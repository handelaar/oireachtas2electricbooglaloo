      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In pages 5, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`woodland' means an area planted, for commercial purposes, since 1922.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> We discussed this matter on Committee Stage and there were extensive arguments for its inclusion in the Bill.  I should like to know whether the Minister is in a position to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a definition amendment.  My recollection of Committee Stage is that there was not a very extensive debate on this issue.  It is, however, an important amendment and I should like the Minister to seriously consider it.  It relates to section 21 of the Bill which, like section 45 of the Principal Act, refers to four categories of trees &mdash; any tree, trees, groups of trees and woodlands.  The problem is that the term &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; is not defined in this Bill or in the Principal Act.  I am advised that, in certain circumstances, a woodland may be confused with a group of trees and that where consent is given to fell trees which are regarded as a woodland, in some circumstances they might be regarded as a group of trees which might leave a local authority open to claims for compensation.  The definition provided for in the amendment would tighten the Bill to limit the possibility of compensation in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment states that &ldquo;woodland&rdquo; means an area planted, for commercial purposes, since 1922.  I hope the Minister, on reflection, will agree that this is just a technical tightening up of the description in the Bill, particularly in view of people's increased awareness of their environment which the Minister shares.  I am sure he would not like a good Bill to be lacking because of a simple technical amendment of this nature and I hope he will be generous in accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1963 Planning Act did not provide for a definition of &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo;, although the term occurs in section 45 of that Act dealing with tree preservation orders.  The absence of an express definition does not appear to have affected the operation of that section.  For this reason, I do not believe that a special definition <Col N="1094" /> of &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; is required in this Bill; I have sought the parliamentary draftsman's advice on this point and he agrees that a definition is unnecessary.  I should also point out that English planning legislation; like ours, uses the term &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; without according it a special definition.</P>
      <P>In any event, I would have to regard the definition proposed in the amendment as too narrow; under it, the sole criterion for regarding an area as woodland would be the commercial purpose of the planter &mdash; and plantation would have to have occurred since 1922.</P>
      <P>In the absence of an explicit definition, the normal rules of legal interpretation would require &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; to be construed according to its ordinary dictionary meaning.  The Oxford Concise Dictionary defines &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; as &ldquo;wooded country&rdquo;, or &ldquo;woods&rdquo;, and the latter is defined as &ldquo;growing trees occupying fairly densely a considerable tract of ground&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore was good enough to write to the Minister in advance about his intention in proposing this amendment. As he has again explained today, this was to give planning authorities greater protection against compensation where they refuse or attach a condition to an application for a felling consent under a tree preservation order.  For reasons which I will now explain, I do not believe that providing an explicit definition of &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; can significantly affect the compensation position.</P>
      <P>Section 45 of the Planning Act, 1963, empowers planning authorities to make tree preservation orders where this is expedient in the interests of amenity.  For this purpose, it distinguishes between &ldquo;woodlands&rdquo; on the one hand, and &ldquo;a tree, trees or group of trees&rdquo; on the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Restrictions imposed under a TPO on &ldquo;a tree, trees or group of trees&rdquo; are non-compensatable where the order declares that the trees are of special amenity value or special interest.  Refusal or attaching conditions to a felling consent for woodlands under a TPO is, in principle, compensatable. The 1963 Act made only one <Col N="1095" /> exception from this general principle, this was where a TPO required replanting of woodlands as an essential condition in the interests of the amenity.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill adds two further substantial non-compensatable circumstances which will apply to trees comprised in woodlands: it allows a TPO to provide, without compensation, that, as an essential condition of the order because of special amenity or special interest, a consent may require that up to 20 per cent of the trees should be preserved, and it allows a TPO, on the same basis, to provide without compensation that the felling or extraction of trees shall be phased over a period of up to 20 years.  These measures strike a balance between reasonable amenity interests, on the one hand, and the requirements of commercial forestry operations on the other.</P>
    <P>This issue arose centrally in the debate on the Local Government (Planning and Development) (Trees and Woodlands) Bill, 1987, sponsored by the Labour Party.  My contribution to that debate in the Official Report of 27 May 1987, columns 3081 &mdash; 3082 advised the House of the view of the Attorney General that legislation which would amend the Planning Acts so as to abolish compensation in the event of a refusal of consent to fell woodland trees would be found unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this Bill goes as far as possible to protect the powers of planning authorities to preserve trees without undue exposure to compensation. I do not believe that an artificially narrow definition of woodlands will resolve the constitutional issue identified by the Attorney General and, accordingly, I do not consider the amendment necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister feels the amendment is too narrowly defined, would he have an objection to putting into this Bill the same definition which is in the 1963 Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Section 25 (8) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, is hereby amended by the deletion of the words `and the matter falls to be determined by arbitration in pursuance of section 68 of the Principal Act, the following provisions shall apply:' and the substitution of`, the claim shall, in default of agreement, be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, in the like manner in all respect as if such claim arose in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land, but subject to the proviso that the arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to make a nil award and to the following provision:',&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a technical amendment designed to protect the existing provision for arbitration in section 25 (8) of the Planning Act, 1976.  Section 25 of the 1976 Act contains a procedure whereby a planning authority may acquire land for open space where a landowner is failing to maintain that open space in accordance with the conditions of the planning permission. Section 25 (8) provided for arbitration on the acquisition price involved in accordance with section 68 of the Planning Act, 1963 and, in turn, section 68 simply provided that compensation claims under the Planning Acts should, in default of an agreement, be dealt with under the arbitration procedures of the <Col N="1097" /> Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
    <P>Section 68, along with the other provisions of Part VI of the 1963 Act, is now being repealed by section 3 of this Bill. This amendment preserves the procedure of arbitration under the 1919 Act for cases under section 25 of the 1976 Act without reference to the repealed section 68.  I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an interwoven technical amendment but can I take it that its intent, where the condition of a planning permission was for a developer to maintain a certain amount of open space in, say, a residential area and he or she has manifestly failed to do so, is that the local authority can serve an acquisition notice under CPO procedure and can acquire the land without paying any compensation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The provisions of this Act shall <Col N="1098" /> apply to a claim for compensation made, or which has arisen, prior to the coming into operation of this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) where no determination has been made, as to the sum, if any, payable in respect of such claim, and/or</P>
    <P>(b) where the claim for compensation was made after October 20th, 1988.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We had a lengthy debate on Committee Stage on a number of amendments tabled by me and Deputy Shatter on the transition period.  At the conclusion of that debate the Minister gave an undertaking to give some consideration before Report Stage to the transition period.  Therefore, I had expected the Minister to put down an amendment on this issue and I am somewhat disappointed that he has not done so.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I sought to include a provision in the Bill so that it would apply to compensation claims which have already been served on local authorities.  I was informed that there would be a constitutional difficulty with that because it would mean applying the Bill retrospectively.  I take that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter in his amendment sought to draw a distinction between the different stages a compensation claim can be at &mdash; the stage when a claim would be made on a local authority; the stage when the court would actually decide that compensation should be paid and the final stage when the amount of the compensation would be determined presumably by arbitration.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is a repeat of Deputy Shatter's original amendment but with the further proposal that it should also take account of claims which were made after 20 October 1988.  I have proposed 20 October 1988 because it is the date on which the Bill was originally published and anybody who made a claim subsequent to that date would have been aware that new legislation was being contemplated and the position in regard to compensation claims would be different.</P>
    <P>My motivation for dealing with this <Col N="1099" /> issue has been strengthened somewhat since Committee Stage.  I am a member of Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and Dublin County Council.  Since Committee Stage, claims totalling £20 million have been served on Dún Laoghaire Corporation, in my view, for the express purpose of the claimants getting in before the new legislation comes into effect.  The first claim is for £2 million in respect of the Ibex site in Dún Laoghaire which had been zoned as industrial and was in use as an industrial site for many years.  A planning application which was made for commercial and other developments on that site was refused by Dún Laoghaire Corporation. There was an appeal to An Bord Pleanála and an oral hearing was held recently.  The outcome of that appeal is not yet known and the developers concerned lodged a claim with Dún Laoghaire Corporation for £2 million. Dún Laoghaire Corporation gave an undertaking to grant a certain type of planning permission for industrial purposes on that site but the claim has not to date been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The second claim which was in two parts related to the St. Helen's lands in Booterstown.  The first claim was for £6 million in respect of a half acre reservation for a travellers' halting stop which was being made on the 71 acres site.  The owners of the site felt that a travellers' halting stop would devalue the property which they intended to develop and sell for £6 million.  The net result of that aspect of the claim is that Dún Laoghaire Corporation have now abandoned their intention to put a halting stop for travellers on the site.  At a meeting of the borough council last Monday evening I was informed that the legal advice available to the borough manager and the advice from valuers was that while the claim was for £6 million the corporation might ultimately have to pay in the region of £500,000 compensation for that site.</P>
    <P>The second part of the same claim was for £12 million in respect of a road reservation which is being made through the grounds.  I have to confess that I have somewhat mixed feelings about this claim <Col N="1100" /> because I opposed the making of the road reservation in the first instance.  Nevertheless this decision was arrived at democratically by the borough council and I do not think the owners of the site should claim in the order of £12 million for it.</P>
    <P>I want to put this total claim of £12 million in context.  St. Helen's lands were sold three years ago by the Christian Brothers for £6 million and resold, I understand, for around £10 million.  Yet a claim for compensation has been made for three times the amount for which the land was sold originally.  I believe those two claims &mdash; I am speaking of those two; I do not know whether there are others which have managed to slip in under the wire since we began debating the provisions of this Bill &mdash; were lodged at this time, one before the decision of An Bord Pleanála is known, the developer having participated in an oral hearing, the other in circumstances in which we are dealing only with outline planning permission.  I believe those claims were lodged to beat the deadline in the Bill.  There is a necessity to build into the Bill a provision to deal with the transition period which will endeavour as far as possible to protect the public purse against claims already in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>I appreciate there are legal difficulties involved, particularly in regard to the application of legislation retrospectively. The amendment originally tabled by Deputy Shatter, having listened to the debate on Committee Stage, perhaps constituted a better approach than my original amendment.  I was seeking to extend that somewhat in the amendment I have tabled on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  Fine Gael, for their part, have not tabled many amendments on Report Stage because, on Committee Stage, a great number of changes were effected to the Bill which we welcomed. The Minister himself had tabled a total of 50 amendments which means the Bill has been radically changed since its publication. Like other Members of this House, we are anxious to get this Bill on <Col N="1101" /> the Statute Book as quickly as possible. It would be our hope that it will be passed today, sent to the Seanad and then signed by the President.</P>
      <P>In agreeing to the Minister's request not to push this amendment on Committee Stage &mdash; he gave us an assurance that he would re-examine the position with regard to claims in the pipeline &mdash; I am very disappointed he has not devised some means of tabling an amendment to meet the very valid points being made, which are the subject of a great deal of worry.  I agree with Deputy Gilmore that we are buying ourselves a load of trouble if we do not amend the Bill in this way. Already in County Dublin there are claims in the region of £18 to £20 million outstanding.  I might remind the Minister that very many of these are at the initial stage &mdash; no arbitration, no talk about money, no assessment; they constitute no more than a letter notifying the local authority that a developer intends lodging a compensation claim.  If the Minister does not heed our warnings what will happen is that local authorities &mdash; if the provisions of the Bill do not cater for very early stage compensation claims &mdash; will be subjected to enormous pressure to give in and allow development in order to avoid massive compensation claims calculated under the terms of the old Bill. The Minister should remember that it will be on his head that all the flak will fall.  It will mean that local authorities will be pressurised into granting permission in order to avoid paying these massive compensation claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have only to remember the row there was about the £2 million claim for the Bovale development between Swords and Malahide when the local authority gave in, resulting in 509 extra houses being built, along with their attendant services, people do not want that in a green belt area.  That will be a common occurrence unless the Minister re-examines this amendment in order to ascertain whether there is a way round the problem. We will not be doing anybody with a valid claim out of compensation if we include them under the provisions of this Bill.  We will not be doing anybody <Col N="1102" /> out of their right to seek valid compensation. Rather we will be ensuring that planning permission will not be given because of threats or guns being put to our heads <i>vis-á-vis</i> compensation.</P>
    <P>We will be pressing this amendment, as I am sure will Deputy Gilmore. However, because of the numbers probably we will lose.  We shall not leave it at that.  The Minister having heard again today of our concerns might perhaps get his officials to re-examine the position ascertaining whether there is any way of inserting a provision in this Bill to ensure that all claims which have not reached assessment and-or compensation stage will be covered by its provisions.  If the Minister can see his way to doing that, he will be doing local authorities, councillors and people generally a good service preventing development where it is not wanted.  If the Minister cannot see his way to re-examining it now, perhaps he would do so in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support both amendments.  We regret the Minister has been unable to come forward with an amendment.  The conventions of this House clearly signal that, in the absence of a ministerial amendment on Report Stage after extensive debate, the prospects of success are not great.  The credibility of this Bill, indeed of this House to legislate for a problem which constitutes a scandal of enormous proportions, will be damaged severely if, two years hence, massive compensation claims are paid even though, since October 1988, the House has attempted to deal with this problem in a relatively radical way subject to the amendments the Minister himself has tabled.  If I cannot appeal to the Minister's good legislative sense, then I might appeal to his political acumen.  I suggest that he will do himself and his party no good if, having legislation for this problem, it continues to surface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are dealing with is nothing short of environmental blackmail.  Effectively the entirety of Dublin city and county is being held up &mdash; in the manner <Col N="1103" /> described by Deputies Owen and Gilmore &mdash; to initial claims where there may not be legitimate grounds for compensation but which nevertheless have the instantaneous effect of sending frightened bureaucrats down their administrative corridors.  The easiest way to avoid the problem is to give in which has been manifested in relation to the halting site at the top of St. Helen's.  It is a pity the Christian Brothers did not make it a condition of their original sale that a halting site be provided.  That is perhaps for another day.</P>
    <P>I concur in Deputy Owen's sentiments. I anticipate the Minister will not be in a position to accept this amendment since he has not brought forward an amendment of his own.  I suspect there is a legal opinion available to him which, despite the judgement of Deputy Shatter who is a lawyer, claims there is retrospection involved here, that a person filing a claim for compensation is entitled to expect that the rules applicable on the day of the first shot was fired will be those which will apply when the final shot is fired.</P>
    <P>That I suspect is a legal opinion.  Nonetheless the Minister has seen fit to ignore legal opinion in the past with a courage for which I must commend him.  I invite him to do the same again allowing the courts decide what should be the ultimate position.  It now amounts to a balancing game between the courts, ourselves and some legal advisers who, since the early seventies in relation to property rights, consistently have given extremely cautious, conservative advice to successive Ministers for the Environment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot accept this amendment this House is obliged to bring it to a vote which we will be supporting. I suspect our respective parties in the Seanad will engage in the same debate. In, say, two years' time when the women and gentlemen of the press berate us legislators for having made a mess of the Bill &mdash; notwithstanding all the debate and the numerous Bills which have been introduced &mdash; it will be clearly seen that some people have been able to make more money in an afternoon than others <Col N="1104" /> can make working all their lives by virtue of having been able to manipulate the law.  That is not our intent.  We are putting the Minister formally on notice in this House, that, if he does not see fit to accept this amendment, that will be the possible outcome.  It constitutes a loophole which as far as we are concerned, should be closed.</P>
    <P>If there is a constitutional matter involved it is one of opinion.  In the final analysis, it will be for the Supreme Court to decide where the fine line is to be drawn between the constitutionality of compensation claims or at what point the sum of money to be determined or the rules applicable thereto should be altered.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a vast improvement on its predecessor in an area in which massive amounts of compensation are likely to fall due in the greater Dublin area.  I say with sadness on the basis of what we have heard already this morning and what is well known in the Department, that this may be a classic historic case of slowly, ponderously closing the stable door long after the horse has bolted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of Deputy Owen and other speakers that there is a need to dispose of this matter as quickly as possible as this would be in the interests of all of us.  I know that we are going to be facilitated in that aim today. In many ways there has been a very mature debate on this matter and the legislation has been vastly improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to look at all aspects of the transitional arrangements involved with a view to making any possible improvements, and I should say to Deputy Quinn that it was looked on in that way.  I do not have the same latitude that members of the Opposition have in this regard, but on occasions I have cast aside what was regarded as good legal advice to do what I felt was right and proper in the circumstances. It was with that attitude that I considered this matter as I said I would on Committee Stage.  I would like to assure Deputies that the question was fully examined in the Department and <Col N="1105" /> also by the parliamentary draftsman who has not found it possible to devise any workable or worthwhile improvement of the arrangements already proposed.</P>
    <P>These arrangements follow the general principle of section 21 of the Interpretation Act, 1937, that the repeal of a previous statute should not affect any right accrued under that statute.  Given that the right to planning compensation arises from an adverse planning decision, the provision of Part VI of the 1963 Planning Act would apply to any claim arising from a planning decision made before the enactment of this Bill.  The new Act will apply to all claims arising from a planning decision made after this.  I should emphasise that a planning decision in this context means the final or definitive planning decision.  If the decision of a planning authority is under appeal to An Bord Pleanála &mdash; and one case in particular was referred to &mdash; it is the decision of the board and the date of this decision which would be relevant for planning compensation purposes.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental difficulty about any attempt to legislate for retrospective application of the new compensation provisions. Any measure of this kind would not have legal force until the commencement of the new Act and pending this, persons would be entitled to submit compensation claims and have them processed under the 1963 Act.  The retrospective provisions would only achieve their objects in so far as, for administrative reasons, claims could not be processed to finality before the enactment of the Bill.  Clearly, this could be individious as between different claimants and would not be an equitable basis for the application or non-application of the new non-compensation provisions.</P>
    <P>The amendments put down by Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Shatter would discriminate between planning compensation claims on the arbitrary basis of whether or not they had been processed to finality.  As I said, this could permit a relatively recent claim to remain subject to the 1963 Act and disallow or compromise a claim of much longer standing merely because it had been affected by <Col N="1106" /> administrative delay.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment would also apply absolutely to any compensation claims made after the original date of publication of the Bill, 20 October 1988.  It would be possible, of course, for a person to have claimed and actually received compensation between that time and the date of this Bill's enactment, and the amendment does not make it clear how this possibility would be dealt with.</P>
    <P>As I said, the problem with applying the new compensation provision retrospectively is that the rights under existing legislation may continue to be exercised and must be respected until this Bill's enactment.  In these circumstances I cannot accept the amendments and ask that they be withdrawn and that people understand that there are good solid reasons why the Minister makes this request at this time.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister has a difficulty with retrospection but our difficulty centres on the use of the word &ldquo;assessed&rdquo; in the Bill which states that this Bill will apply to every case other than a case where any compensation assessed will be payable by a planning authority or any other local authority. This is too loose an interpretation.  My interpretation of the word is that someone has already decided what is going to be paid and means much more than a person has submitted a letter, having failed to obtain planning permission, in which they state they are going to claim compensation.  If the Minister can tighten up the definition he may get around any legal and constitutional problems which <Col N="1107" /> may arise.  He should insert a new subsection in which he defines the meaning of &ldquo;assessed&rdquo;.  Our amendment reads:</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Act shall apply to a claim for compensation made or which has arisen prior to the coming into operation of this Act where no determination has been made as to the sum, if any, payable in respect of such claim.</P>
      <P>That is our interpretation of the meaning of the word &ldquo;assessed&rdquo; and if the Minister can come up with a better definition before this Bill is dealt with in the Seanad he may get around this difficulty.</P>

      <P>It is important that we put what we are seeking to do into context. The Minister may dispute this figure but there are claims for compensation in the order of £70 million outstanding against local authorities.  There is an obligation on the Oireachtas to protect the taxpayer against having to pay out sums of that order.  The general public find it very difficult to understand the rationale behind paying out such compensation claims and are opposed to such payments.</P>
      <P>The difficulty the Minister is describing here is this question of applying the new Bill retrospectively.  There are a couple of points to be borne in mind in that regard.  There seems to be a nervousness about the constitutional position on this and I think that, for a couple of reasons, the Minister is being overly cautious in not taking any steps to deal with the outstanding claims: first, because the constitutional issue is a debateable issue and a number of Supreme Court judges have given their opinion that the existing legislation, the 1963 Act, in so far as it tilts the balance in favour of the rights of property as against the needs of the common good, may itself be unconstitutional. I understand that in amending the legislation in this area there is a degree of sailing close to the wind but I think the Minister is being exceptionally cautious is not taking any steps in this area at all.  There is a degree of latitude that he could have taken to try to protect the public purse aginst outstanding claims.</P>
      <P>I felt that the original amendment I had on Committee Stage sought to make this Bill cover all outstanding claims and I was told that that was too crude, that it was too risky and that it would probably be found to be unconstitutional.  I felt that the Minister was nibbling at the amendment that Deputy Shatter had proposed on that day.  That is why I based my amendment on Report Stage on what Deputy Shatter had to say the last day when he drew the distinction between the different stages at which a claim might be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Minister's point that if we go down that road there are anomalies <Col N="1109" /> that arise between claims that have been processed quickly and those which have not been processed so quickly.  Nevertheless the principal objective of the Oireachtas should be to try to protect the public against having to pay out money and, if money does have to be paid out in claims which are already in the pipeline, to try to limit, as far as possible, the amont of money that has to be paid out. Otherwise we will be in a situation where local authorities can be bullied.  Dún Laoghaire Corporation was bullied, by a <Col N="1110" /> claim of £6 million for the travellers' halting site, into abandoning the site.  That will have a serious knock-on effect for the whole programme of settling travellers not just in Dún Laoghaire but all over the country where the idea is now abroad that if a compensation claim is lodged because a halting site would devalue property and dwellings which have not even been built yet, it is creating a new precedent which is very dangerous.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 4 and 5, to delete &ldquo;a reduction in the value of an interest in land&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the actual loss incurred by the claimant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again, this is an issue which was debated at considerable length on Committee Stage.  It was my understanding that further consideration was to be given before Report Stage to tightening up the way in which compensation is to be calculated. I am somewhat surprised that there is no amendment from the Minister to deal with this matter.  The debate centres on how much compensation should be paid.  There were two points of view. First, in deciding on compensation to be paid, account should be taken of the development potential of the property. The amended version that is included in the Bill, as opposed to the provision in the 1963 Act, would tighen it up somewhat but would still allow for the development potential of the property to be taken into account.  What I am seeking is to ensure that if compensation is to be paid, the only thing that should be compensated for is actual loss.  That is a principle that applies generally right across a whole range of legislation and public policy.  I do not see why the compensation of property interests in this case should be treated more favourably than compensation for criminal injury or injury where actual loss is suffered by an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate there was a great deal of talk about whether the approach I was taking was constitutional and about what would happen where a local authority would down-zone a property from, say, residential to agricultural or amenity, and there would be a loss in respect of the property as a result. Deputy Quinn raised the case of a person who inherits property and who, in order <Col N="1113" /> to be able to pay the inheritance tax involved, needs to develop that property but is refused planning permission and yet must pay the tax.  Quite clearly if someone makes a payment of inheritance tax or of any other charge against a property, that would be taken into account in consideration of actual loss and consequently, in determining compensation.</P>
    <P>There is a reverse side to the argument about down-zoning, that is, that if we were to allow compensation in cases where property is down-zoned, effectively we would be preventing local authorities from down-zoning property at all. I cannot imagine many local authorities running the risk of down-zoning property which might be very much in the public interest, and as a result being hit with a compensation claim.  If we were to leave that provision in the Bill we might well be inviting compensation claims.  Let us say that a local authority decide to zone from residential to amenity a particular plot of ground.  The owner of that plot of ground might never have intended seeking planning permission for it but now finds that, with the decision of the local authority to down-zone, there is a possibility of claiming compensation.  Therefore, by allowing for compensation in cases of down-zoning we might be inviting further compensation claims.</P>
    <P>The down-zoning argument is one that does not hold up when compared with other areas of public policy.  If, for example, a hospital is down-graded, the general public have no right to claim compensation if, as a result of that downgrading, they suffer a loss.  I will use an example from my own constituency.  The maternity unit in Loughlinstown Hospital was closed down some years ago &mdash; that was a public policy decision &mdash; and women from as far south as Gorey are told now that they should go to Holles Street hospital to have their babies.  If, say, somebody suffers injury or loses a baby travelling between Loughlinstown and Holles Street in heavy traffic, that person cannot claim against the public purse for compensation even though the decision which would have given rise to the problem in the first place was a public <Col N="1114" /> policy decision.  Still the argument is made that if beside it a property which is currently zoned residential is zoned amenity, the property owner, as a result of a public policy decision, would have a right to claim compensation.  I do not think there is consistency in that argument.</P>

      <P>There are two other points I would like to raise.  The first has to do with the Constitution which was argued in respect of this particular issue on Committee Stage.  The Constitution is clear in relation to the rights of private property.  Article 43.1.2º states:</P>
      <P>The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath, and inherit property.</P>
      <P>I think that is accepted by everybody in this House.  It does however, make very clear statements in relation to qualifying the rights of private property by the needs of social justice and by the exigencies of the common good.  The common good is decided in the case of planning by the democratic decision of local authorities adopting their development plans.  To impose the restriction we now have on local authorities, that if they down-zone property they leave themselves open to compensation claims, is undermining that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point I should like to make relates to amendment No. 6.  This provision exists in other legislation where the amount of compensation payable is not limitless.  There are many examples of other legislation dealing with matters, other than property, where if compensation is payable there is an upper <Col N="1115" /> limit paced on the amount of compensation which may be paid.  That provision should also apply in the case of planning compensation.  At present there is no limit whatever.  I consider that a limit should be imposed.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I have a question which might facilitate all of us.  Since Committee Stage and the sensitive discussions we had at that time, no doubt some of the Minister's officials have been able to quantify the net difference between actual loss incurred and reduction in value.  That is a semantic point at this stage.  If that information is available to the Minister perhaps he could clarify what is the difference between the two positions as put forward in the amendment.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Shatter, addressed this section in great detail in his Second Stage contribution. I am happy to see that several of the suggestions he put forward have been accepted by the Minister.  Fine Gael believe that this section has been strengthened immeasurably since then. We are satisfied with this section and the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are concerned to make the actual loss suffered by the claimant the key factor in determining the amount of planning compensation. As the Bill stands compensation is to be determined by reference to the reduction in the value of the person's interest in the land.  The First Schedule makes it clear that in general the principle involved is open market value.  I have already argued on Committee Stage that the notion of actual loss to a person is too relative, that it does not have the objective character of open market value and that it is not acknowledged as a principle of land valuation. The amendment, incidentally, offers no definition of the precise meaning intended for actual loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore made clear his view on Committee Stage that compensation <Col N="1116" /> must be closely related to the price which a person actually paid for the land and that if a person inherited or received a gift of the land he should not receive any compensation &mdash; although he has now slightly qualified that view this morning. He conceded in the course of the Committee Stage debate that actual loss could not reasonably be calculated by reference to the historical price paid for land, but he did not indicate how historical price should be updated, by indexation or otherwise.  It seems to me that once Deputy Gilmore has agreed that we cannot entirely rely on historical land values he is accepting in some way or other the need to assess land in terms of its current value.  If this is so, there might be little difference in practice between his concept of actual loss and the principle of open market value.  The Fine Gael members have seen that, and that is their position as stated by Deputy Lowry.</P>
    <P>Compensating a claim for actual loss could be unsatisfactory from another point of view.  Under the Bill as it now stands, the relevant principle of valuation is what the land might have been expected to realise if sold in the open market by a willing seller before and after the planning decision.  If a person, say a speculator, has paid a price in excess of this open market value in anticipation of certain gains, the Bill's rules do not allow compensation to be based on that excessive price.  That is in answer to Deputy Quinn's point.</P>
    <P>Under the amendment a speculator would be able to claim higher compensation on the basis that his actual loss relates to the excessive price he had paid in the first instance for the land.  I do not believe Deputy Gilmore intends this consequence but it follows from the relative and personalised nature of the concept of actual loss.  I am satisfied that the concept is not workable either practically or technically from a valuation point of view.  I suggest that Deputy Gilmore, on consideration, might withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to continue the debate on this amendment.  We had <Col N="1117" /> a long debate on Committee Stage and our respective positions are clear.  We established on Committee Stage that there is a difference between the two concepts.  I hope that the differences are not as great as I fear, but only time will tell.  I am thinking, for example, of the St. Helen's case &mdash; to which I have already referred &mdash; where, as I understand it, under the existing Bill the reduction in value would be calculated between the antecedent and the subsequent value at the time the planning decision was made and that it would be open to the owners of the St. Helen's land to claim that as a result of the local authority or An Bord Pleanála putting a condition into their planning permission that there be a travellers' halting site located on the lands, under the present Bill it would still be open to that developer to claim that that reduced the value of the property.  The distinction is where they would be able to say that at the time the decision was made the antecedent value would be X because that is what we would expect to get from the disposal of the property with planning permission.  The subsequent value, because of the loss in value as a result of the halting site, would be so much less even though in that case the amount being claimed is out of proportion to the amount which was actually paid for the property and to any loss which would be suffered by the property owner in that case.</P>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate because we had a long debate on Committee Stage.  There is a difference of opinion and I hope that the differences we identified do not prove to be as costly as I fear they may be.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 15, to delete lines 12 to 18 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) The owner or occupier of any premises within the district of a sanitary authority shall be entitled to cause his drain to empty into the sewers of that authority subject to the following conditions:</P>
      <P>(i) that he applies to that authority in the prescribed form and receives permission to do so;</P>
      <P>(ii) that he pays the contribution required by that authority for making such a connection; and</P>
      <P>(iii) that he complies with the regulations of that authority in respect of the mode in which the connection between such drains and sewers are to be made and with the directions of any person who may be appointed by the authority for the supervision or inspection of the work.</P>
      <P>(b) A sanitary authority may refuse permission for such a connection if, <i>inter alia,</i> the existing capacity in a sewer has been designated for the drainage of an area zoned for development in the developoment plan made in accordance with Part III of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a brief discussion on this on Committee Stage and it is quite technical.  The amendment tabled in the names of myself and Deputies Quinn and Shatter was originally recommended by the Irish Planning Institute in their submission on <Col N="1121" /> the Bill.  They consider it strange to withdraw a statutory entitlement under the sanitary services legislation without repealing the relevant section of that legislation. They consider their proposal in their report to be superior to the drafting that is in the Minister's amendment and they suggested that the form of words which I have proposed should replace lines 12 to 18.  In relation to structures they raise the question whether the reference in the section to &ldquo;any structure&rdquo; refers to structures which have already been built or to proposed structures. posed structures.</P>
    <P>The Minister said on Committee Stage that there really was nothing between the two forms of wording in practice except in relation to the provision that charges could be made for connecting to a sewer, and he felt that was provided for already under the 1983 Financial Provisions Act and could be dealt with by way of the development levy.  I have put the amendment down again in order to give it another airing, because the discussion on Committee Stage was quite brief.  I would like to hear the Minister's clarification on the couple of questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This area over the years has been fraught with difficulties where local authorities plan their drainage systems with a development in mind that might be phased over five or ten years, and then find they are being forced into allowing connections into such drains just because the drain ran over people's land. The Minister knows this came to a head under the Nora Shortt case where a major pipe was supplied by Dublin County Council to service the Tallaght area and it happened to run over her land.  She applied for planning permission, which was refused.  She put in a claim and on the basis that she could validly show that she could make a connection and there was capacity in this pipe, she was entitled to either permission for development or compensation.  It resulted in the local authority paying a very high sum of money, anything from £50,000 to £100,000 an acre, for land for amenity purposes just because there was a pipe <Col N="1122" /> on it.  There are other instances of pipes going on to people's land.  In my constituency a pipe was extended, in the Kinsealy-Feltrim scheme, on to lands in the neighbouring area.</P>
      <P>The fear always is that once the provision in the 1963 Act is there allowing people the right to connect in, local authorities' development plans might as well be shredded and thrown away because in reality planning was being done by drainage and the pipe network where the development was to go rather than through any other consideration.  Like Deputy Gilmore, I feel what we are doing in our amendment is probably covered in different words under the Minister's own section 25 (5) and under the Third Schedule. Here I feel we must strike home. If a local authority with taxpayers' money provide drainage to take into account the development to be carried out that drainage is sacrosanct until the development is carried out.  If and when at the end of that there is still found to be capacity, it is up to the local council to decide whether they want to zone land to take into account spare capacity.  A local authority must have the right to strike a development plan and decide where they want the development to go. If in the course of deciding that, because they cannot put sewerage pipes through the air, they decide the pipes must go through somebody's land, I am very pleased that in this Bill now there will no longer be the possibility of claiming massive compensation.  That is what has been happening.  It was an intrinsic part of the Bovale £2 million compensation claim.  There is still capacity in the Swords treatment plant for that development, and it was not possible for local authorities to say there was not.  An Bord Pleanála accepted that, and for that reason refused permission without this crucial non-compensatable claim.  I will wait to hear the Minister and if he satisfies me that the Bill already covers everything we have in our amendment, I will act accordingly.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Gilmore has said, this amendment is the product of a <Col N="1123" /> professional input made available to all Members of this House and, I presume, to the Department.  On previous occasions we observed that unless local authorities have the steps explicitly set out for them they seem to lose courage and fall by the wayside.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the amendment in our names seeks to elaborate the section.  Subsection (3) of section 25 states:</P>
      <P>...in whose functional area the premises is situated except with the consent of the sanitary authority, which may be given subject to such conditions as the sanitary authority consider reasonable.</P>
      <P>Getting a sanitary authority to formulate conditions they consider reasonable can in some cases be a very difficult task which, upon completion, may merit a Nobel Prize.  We are suggesting the steps that need to be taken and they are based on the experience of planners.  We are suggesting that those steps should be taken so that a local authority will be able to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to an applicant.  Those steps are clearly set out in our amendment.  We are suggesting that an applicant apply to an authority in the prescribed form and receive permission to do so, that he pays the contribution required by that authority for making such a connection and that he complies with the regulations of that authority in respect of the mode in which the connection between such drains and sewers are to be made.</P>
      <P>Our amendment also states that a sanitary authority may refuse permission for such a connection if, <i>inter alia,</i> the existing capacity in a sewer has been designated for the drainage of an area zoned for development in the development plan made in accordance with Part III of the 1963 Act.  We have set out the conditions for some local authorities who may lose heart after they are threatened by some form of compensation claim.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that this is not a partisan amendment.  It has come from a professional source and I should like to encourage him to take it on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would replace subsection (3) of section 25, dealing with connection to sanitary authority sewers, but would leave the remainder of that section unaltered.  Subsection (3) as it stands already provides that there will not be an entitlement to connect to a sanitary authority's sewer without the authority's consent, and that this consent may be given subject to such conditions as the sanitary authority consider reasonable. Accordingly, I do not believe that paragraphs (a) (i) and (iii) in the Deputy's amendment add to what is already in subsection (3).</P>
      <P>Paragraph (a) (ii) of the amended subsection proposed by the Deputies relates to the making of a contribution to the sanitary authority by the person making the connection.  I have already explained on Committee Stage that I was not concerned in this Bill to effect a fundamental overhaul of public health and sanitary services legislation.  We are principally dealing here with the land use regulation aspect.  In accordance with the Report of the Joint Committee on Building Land, section 25 is designed to prevent developers evading normal planning controls through the use of earlier rights laid down in sanitary services legislation.</P>
      <P>Against this background, I believe that this issue of charging would more appropriately be dealt with under existing powers to require contributions from developers or otherwise, and I do not consider it appropriate to include this kind of provision here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) (b) in the Deputy's amendment appears essentially to repeat what is in subsection (8) of section 25 but does not attempt to clarify the intended linkage with that provision.  Accordingly I could not accept that there is a need for the proposed clause.  All in all, therefore, I cannot see that the Deputy's amendment would improve on the existing subsection (3) and I would ask that it be withdrawn.  I should like to tell Deputy Owen that the concerns she has expressed are covered by section 25 as it stands.  Deputy Quinn asked about setting out the catechism for local authorities and I should like to tell him that I <Col N="1125" /> will cover that in the guidelines that will follow the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 1 to 4.</P>
      <P>We had a long debate on Committee Stage on the First Schedule and, inevitably, in the course of that debate some aspects of the provisions in that Schedule were dealt with in great detail.  I have received professional advice on the amendment to the effect that the subsection should be deleted.  The subsection states:</P>
      <P>(a) it shall be assumed, subject to sub-rule (2), that, after the refusal, permission under Part IV of the Principal Act would not be granted for any development of a kind specified in section 13 (2),</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is felt that the rules as drafted could give rise to a planning application being so constructed as to make it difficult to refuse planning permission on non-compensatable grounds and to use a refusal of permission as the basis for a compensation claim based on a scale of development permission which <Col N="1126" /> could have been refused for non-compensatable reasons.  What is behind that is the Owenabue case in which an application was made for three houses on 30 acres of land and the claim for compensation was based on the development potential of the land at normal density which in that case was ten to the acre. The view is that that rule in the First Schedule could give rise to an application initially being for a low density of housing and if permission is refused for the low density the claim for compensation being based on the maximum potential density for that property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Rule 4 (1) (a) of the First Schedule, which the Deputy's amendment would delete, simply provides that in calculating the value of land after the adverse planning decision, the property arbitrator must assume that planning permission would not be forthcoming for any further gainful development of the land. The logic behind this provision is that if this kind of gainful development was possible or could attract planning permission, then the planning authority would have stated this in the form of a section 13 notice.  Where they have not issued such a notice in response to a compensation claim, or where they have subsequently drawn back from the notice by refusing a planning application brought within its ambit, it will be assumed that no further gainful development of the land is possible.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the valuation rules in the First Schedule will ensure a more realistic and conservative estimate of land value reduction than the 1963 Act. I do not see any basis for the suggestion that Rule 4 (1) (a) could facilitate higher compensation claims than would otherwise be possible, and I am unable to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the local authority simply neglect to serve a section 13 notice, is it open to the developer to claim compensation in the way I described?  In other words, would this rule leave the local authority exposed to compensation if, by mistake, they did not serve a section <Col N="1127" /> 13 notice?  I understand that serving such a notice is the method by which a local authority, when they see a compensation claim looming before them, can head it off.  As I understand what the Minister said, instead of the local authority using their discretion in relation to serving a section 13 notice, a virtual obligation is being put on them to serve these notices to prevent, not the compensation claim which they anticipate, but a potential further compensation claim which might be based on something different from that for which planning permission was sought in the first place.</P>

      <P>The short answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Of course it would be unwise for the locall authority to neglect the option open to them.

      <P>&ldquo;2.  Any development that is in material contravention of the development plan adopted under Part III of the Principal Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a fairly lengthy debate on this issue on Committee Stage and it was agreed then that we would return to it on Report Stage.  The amendment relates to developments which would be in material contravention of the development plan adopted by the local authority.  In this case we are dealing with the Second Schedule which involves developments in respect of which a refusal of permission will not attract compensation.  There is a general view among planners, members of the local authorities and the public, that compensation should not be paid in cases where the refusal of planning permission was because it would be in material contravention of the development plan.  The reason for that is to protect the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin county, where Deputy Owen and I are members of the local authority, there have been over 100 cases since the 1985 local elections where planning permissions were sought and granted in material contravention of the development plan.  This amendment seeks to <Col N="1129" /> ensure that where a local authority refuse planning permission because it is in material contravention of the development plan, it will not attract compensation. That is to protect the integrity and importance of the development plan.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 deals with the section in the Bill which imposes a five year cut-off point within which refusals, because they are in contravention of the development plan, would not apply. Obviously, amendment No. 13 will fall if amendment No. 12 is unsuccessful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The combined effect of these amendments would be to establish the principle that all contraventions of the development plan should absolutely exclude compensation.  This suggestion was considered and effectively rejected on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Third Schedule, as amended on Committee Stage, already provides that compensation is not payable where permission is refused because the development would materially contravene the zoning objectives of the development plan.  It makes only limited exception to this rule &mdash; where land has been &ldquo;down-zoned&rdquo; from development to nondevelopment zoning.</P>
      <P>These provisions give appropriate weight to the zoning objectives of the development plan while providing safeguards for persons who might, bona fide, be adversely affected by down-zoning. Deputy Gilmore's amendments lack this safeguard already agreed by us on Committee Stage and I could not accept them.</P>
      <P>To deal with this matter in more detail, paragraph 11 of the Third Schedule establishes the general rule that refusal of permission for development which would contravene a current zoning objective of the development plan will be non-compensatable. This is a very substantial and comprehensive defence for planning authorities against compensation claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the absolute application of this rule could have created a situation where planning authorities could, in theory at least, arbitrarily change the zoning of land without any regard to the financial implications for landowners who <Col N="1130" /> might have made a recent investment on the basis of a different zoning.  While I did not believe that planning authorities would wish to bring about such unjust results, I felt that the legislation should not leave open the possibility of these consequences.  For this reason, my Committee Stage amendment built in the safeguard that compensation will not be excluded on zoning grounds where the land had a zoning in the previous five years with which the development proposal would have been compatible and where the person claiming compensation acquired his interest in the land before the new restrictive zoning came into operation or was formally notified in draft.</P>
    <P>I believe that the limited safeguard afforded by paragraph 12 is both necessary and reasonable, and that it must be seen in the context of the substantial limitation on compensation which paragraph 11 will bring about.  For this reason, as I have said, I cannot accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment.  I had hoped after the Committee Stage debate, which was exhaustive and on which there was general consensus, that Deputy Gilmore might withdraw his amendment and I hope he will do so now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very exhaustive debate on these two amendments on Committee Stage.  I have a certain sympathy with Deputy Gilmore's amendment in so far as he is trying to get at, if I could be so bold as to suggest it, the abuse of a material contravention, which is where the problem lies, rather than the use of it.  I do not believe the Bill should be so restrictive that it would not allow at times a valid material contravention which very often is the best way to plan a particular development; for example, someone may want to get a package deal on a particular bit of land without necessarily bringing in the acres of lands surrounding it.  I am thinking of a particular case in North County Dublin that we dealt with in the past 24 hours where the Motorola factory are seeking planning permission for a development but there is not an industrial zoned site large enough <Col N="1131" /> to allow for such development.  We are prepared to consider a material contravention which will enable that desirable development to go ahead without making any changes to the surrounding land.  That is a good way of using a material contravention and I would not like any Bill to prevent it.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look again at the main planning Act under which section 4 appeals are dealt.  This issue has been raised time and again in this House. We have to try to stamp out the abuse of section 4 appeals.  When such appeals are tabled a manager has no choice, if it is a material contravention, but to commence the procedures even before councillors are given a chance to decide whether they want it to proceed as a material contravention.  The law says that once a material contravention is tabled the manager has to put an advertisement in the newpapers.  Perhaps the Minister will take on board the proposals in this amendment so that we can get rid of some of the abuses which have given rise to much heated debate both in the media and in council chambers throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Owen that there is a need to deal with the abuse of section 4 appeals and the abuse of material contravention motions. In reply to a Dáil question during the course of the past week the Minister said that this matter is being considered by the committee or committees the Government have established&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to re-examine local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the problem in the context of compensation. Many pressures are put on local authority members when a planning application comes in which is a material contravention of a development plan.  This amendment seeks to at least remove the <Col N="1132" /> possibility that a decision to refuse planning permission which is material contravention of a development plan could subsequently attract compensation.</P>
    <P>As the Minister rightly said, we have been over the argument about down zoning a number of times.  The nub of this amendment is as follows.  The manner in which public and elected representatives can control and influence the way in which their environment and community are planned is through the making of a development plan.  A local authority might want to set many objectives in a development plan, that is the democratically elected representatives of the people deciding &mdash; if we can get back to the constitutional issue which has dominated the whole debate on this Bill so far &mdash; what is in the common good.  If a local authority refuse permission because of a provision in a development plan I do not think that should subsequently attract compensation.  That is really what this amendment is about.  The Minister has made his view on this issue known, we were over it on Committee Stage, and we should dispose of it at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues dealt with in these amendments were discussed on Committee Stage and I gave an undertaking then that the matter would be examined further.  As a result of my examination I am proposing amendment No. 14 which will clarify the position as regards further amendments of a draft development plan or draft variations published in accordance with section 21A as distinct from section 21 of the 1963 Act. The effect of this amendment will be to preclude the payment of compensation also where land is purchased after notice of a material alteration of a draft plan or draft variation indicates the restrictive development objective.  This change will add greater precision to paragraph 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment has a different purpose.  It seeks to go behind the publication of draft development plans or draft variations to the earlier and less formal stage of the evolution of the development objective.  The difficulty with this approach is that, unlike my amendment, it does not relate to the formal mechanism for publishing new development objectives.  In fact, it is likely that at the stage of earlier consideration referred to in Deputy Gilmore's amendment a number of possibilities for new development objectives would be under contemplation by the planning authority.  If a planning authority are particularly concerned to avoid possible advance public disclosure of a new zoning objective it is surely open to them to organise that this is published <Col N="1134" /> formally from the beginning of the review process and that any subsequent changes are handled through the use of section 21A of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 21A of the 1963 Act set out the procedure for communicating draft plans or variations on them to the public.  When a draft development plan or proposed variation has been prepared by the planning authority they must publish notice of that fact.  It is only at this point that a clear picture of the planning authorities purposes is intended to become available and, of necessity, paragraph 13 (b) has to be based on this statutory procedure.  This is why I cannot accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has adequately summarised the difference between our respective positions about which there was some confusion on Committee Stage.  We are dealing with the Third Schedule and the reasons for refusal of permission which exclude compensation. Here we are dealing specifically with that aspect pertaining to the provisions in a development plan.  There is a specific reason we should relate this to the point at which the review of the development plan commences, that is, that the period from the commencement of the review of the development plan to the time, under section 21, when the draft development plan is published and under section 21 (a), when the draft development plan is notified to various authorities which may stretch over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given the impression that within that period &mdash; there is a great deal of uncertainty, it is almost as if it is all up in the air &mdash; there are no proposals or whatever.  The reality is that, from the point at which the review of the development plan commences, it is quite clear what are likely to be its broad parameters. For example, maps are available. If the local authority planning manager has particular proposals in relation to the zoning of an area, those are available on maps.  Members of local authorities can and do communicate with their constituents and others who might <Col N="1135" /> have an interest in the likely zoning of areas.  Within that period, from the commencement of the review of the development plan to the point at which the draft plan is published, there is scope for a great deal of property speculation, some of which may be engaged in anticipation of possible zoning changes and so on.</P>
    <P>It would be a much safer provision if the cut-off point were stipulated to be the point at which the review takes place.  Up to that point everybody knows they are operating under the existing development plan with which they are familiar. Once the review process commences the likely shape of the new plan begins to unfold.  The stage at which the draft plan is published and circulated is a formal one; at that stage 95 per cent of the work on revising the development plan will have been done.</P>
    <P>The point at which the cut-off occurs should be that at which the review actually commences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We endeavoured to tease out this matter on Committee Stage principally because, from experience, we all know that development plans do stretch over a considerable period of time; one does not announce that one is undertaking a development plan and then have it adopted over two or three local authority meetings.  In larger local authorities its adoption can take up to three or four years.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Gilmore if his contention is that because somebody may speculate in property they will be able to lodge a compensation claim later to the effect that they had bought the land which had been zoned for a certain purpose which was subsequently changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ensure that the provisions of this Bill preclude somebody from lodging a compensation claim in respect of land he might have acquired during that long drawn out process.  It may have been land somebody will have bought on the basis of more than a rumour that its zoning <Col N="1136" /> would be changed, say, for industrial purposes. The individual may have purchased that land paying an industrial price, in my view foolishly, thinking that, at the end of the day, it may be rezoned. It will be only at the final adoption of the plan that its zoning will be confirmed.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that somebody who engages in speculation in that long drawn out period cannot make a case &mdash; at the final adoption of the development plan &mdash; that there had been a reasonable expectation that it would be rezoned because the manager had so proposed, contending that he, the speculator, had got himself caught by purchasing that land in that interim period.  That is where my concern lies.</P>
    <P>Already maps will be available, any suggestions for rezoning will already be publicly known before formal press publication that the draft development plan is to be displayed.  I want to be sure that the Minister is clearly telling the House that this type of speculation in which somebody might engage within the two or three years it takes to put a development plan on display will not leave them eligible far compensation; such a speculator might just as easily be caught by buying land in the hope of its being rezoned.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister assure the House that there is a safeguard against somebody lodging a compensation claim, having bought land on the basis that its zoning would be changed which in the end is not changed?  Deputy Gilmore appears to want to ensure that, in this interim period&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Speculation in up-zoning carries no possibility of compensation. The only compensation that will arise under the new Bill will be in respect of down-zoning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not down-zoned the value is reduced.</P>
      <P>This is a clear indication to local authorities that, at a very early date, they should give an indicaton of the review of their plans because once they have done so, nothing can happen, no speculation can subsequently ensue.  It might take a long time to carry out that review as the Deputy says, but that does not matter to them <i>vis-à-vis</i> any subsequent compensation claims.</P>

I would appeal to the Minister to introduce an amendment to cover this issue in the Seanad.

In reviewing the Bill following Committee Stage we felt it appropriate to <Col N="1139" /> put beyond any doubt that a number of further important matters for which planning conditions may provide should be protected from the possibility of compensation.</P>
    <P>I want to add to the list and this may be important.  These further matters are (1) the sequence in which works should be carried out, (2) the period within which works should be completed and (3) restrictions on the occupation of structures until other works are completed, other conditions are complied with or the planning authority otherwise consent to the occupation.

      <P>In summing up I should point out that this is the first time I have been in the House for all stages of a Bill. Never having been a Minister or a Front Bench spokesperson this has been a great experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that this Bill is long overdue and all of us must accept blame for this.  The Minister has acknowledged that when the Bill was first published in October 1988 it was very flawed. Deputy Shatter in his Second Stage contribution indicated that the Bill needed to be radically changed.  Many amendments were tabled, including 50 ministerial amendments on Committee Stage.  This has to be a record.  I have no doubt that this will go into <i>The Guinness Book of Records</i> as the greatest number of amendments made by a Minister to a Bill introduced by him.  However, we must commend him for taking on board all the points made here and because of this we <Col N="1140" /> have a good Bill which will tackle the problems dealing with compensation that have arisen over the years.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to introduce this Bill in the Seanad as quickly as possible. I wish to remind him that we will look to him for a guarantee that outstanding claims, a problem we raised earlier, will not become a big stick to beat us with, and that he will take on board my suggestion that he bring forward an amendment in the Seanad to allow local authorities to keep the powers they have to settle travellers.  In conclusion, I thank the Minister for his co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the way in which he has put this Bill through the House.  However, the problem is much older than this attempt at resolving it.  Members on this side, including myself, are of the view that because of present constraints more than the lack of political will, and I refer specifically to the Interpretation Act of 1937, the problems to which Deputy Gilmore referred in great detail will not go away. It is a sad reflection on this House that a problem first identified in the sixties &mdash; which resulted in the establishment of the Kenny committee by the Minister's much respected colleague, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, as far back as the early seventies and who was barely long enough in office to receive its report &mdash; is only now being resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period since then eight Ministers have attempted to deal with this problem and it is to the credit of this Minister that he has brought those efforts to fruition.  As legislators we should be aware that large sections of suburban Dublin and other parts of the country have been forcibly built, developed and distorted not in accordance with the wishes of the planners and local representatives or with proper or sensitive planning, which has resulted in many people who were not entitled to it, making vast sums of money at the expense of the community.  We are slowly but surely dealing with this problem but in doing so we should recognise that we have responded with too little far too late in <Col N="1141" /> the day, that the problems of compensation and compulsory acquisition in relation to areas not subject to planning permission remain to be dealt with and that in relation to a recent major announcement by the Minister on urban redevelopment and designation, the problem of outrageous property values that bear no relation to real market conditions or existing use value remains with us and will continue to haunt us unless we do something effective about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It has already been indicated that this Bill is long overdue and that the problem of planning compensation has been around for a very long time but it is worth remembering that during the years when many people, including journalists, the general public and members of local authorities, raised the issue of planning compensation in general, two answers were given.  The first was that one could not do anything about planning compensation as it would be unconstitutional.  I recall a number of prominent members of Dublin County Council telling me during a debate on a motion on this issue about four years ago that nothing could be done because it would be unconstitutional and one could not restrict the rights of private property by abolishing or limiting the right to planning compensation.</P>
      <P>We now know that that is not the case. This debate has focused public attention on what is contained in the Constitution rather than on what people think is contained in the Constitution.  It is unfortunate that successive Governments have read the Constitution in such a way that they believed it conferred an unrestricted right and did not see the qualifications in relation to social justice and the needs of the common good contained in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second excuse given by successive Governments for not dealing with this issue is that it is too complex. It is fair to say that it is probably one of the most complex pieces of legislation to have been dealt with here in a long time.  Nevertheless, it has been dealt with although we have, at various stages, had some <Col N="1142" /> difficulty because of its complexities, and it does improve the position with regard to planning compensation.</P>
    <P>Before we lose the run of ourselves, however, we should bear in mind that this Bill will not solve the problem of planning compensation.  It limits but does not abolish compensation for refusal of planning permission or for conditions attaching to planning permission.  It does not deal with the outstanding claims, and there are something like £70 million in claims outstanding against the taxpayer on planning compensation issues.  Like other speakers I had hoped the Minister would address this before Report Stage. I hope he addresses it in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy with the way planning compensation is to be calculated. The Minister has certainly given a number of assurances that his position and mine are not radically different.  I hope he is right.  I am making an act of hope rather than an act of faith in this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will deal with the problem of compensation being awarded and of local authorities literally being blackmailed into granting planning permissions and giving undertakings to grant planning permissions when faced with large compensation claims.  At the back of my mind, however, is a worry that the defects that are still in the Bill will leave local authorities open to substantial claims and that it may still be necessary for a future Minister to deal more effectively with the issue of planning compensation.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words on this legislation before it goes to the Seanad.  I want to thank the Deputies for their co-operation in what was a long debate on the passage of this legislation through the Dáil.  We have had a worthwhile and substantial debate on the many important issues raised.  This has demonstrably contributed to the Bill's improvement as is borne out by the extensive <Col N="1143" /> number of amendments we made to it. I would have thought Deputy Gilmore could be a little bit more generous to the Minister in view of the generous way I responded to so many of the points made both on Second Stage and on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Other points made on Committee Stage were adequately responded to by me and were shown to be flawed.  However, Deputy Gilmore will learn more generosity as life progresses.</P>
      <P>The Bill establishes a stronger community bias within our planning system, as it is intended to do, to enable planning authorities to deal with the vast majority of planning cases free from any threat of compensation and to act more resolutely in the public interest.  At the same time limited and necessary provision for planning compensation is being retained for cases where a property owner is required to accept an exceptional degree of restraint on his development rights in the common interest.  I would have hoped, after the discussion that took place here, that that principle would have been agreed by all, it seems still not to be accepted by Deputy Gilmore.  It was never intended to remove compensation from every case.  That would be unfair, unjust and unconstitutional and Deputy Gilmore should, even at this stage, recognise that.  We had long discussions about the down-zoning and people who have rights in property and that it would not have been appropriate to pursue the matter in the way Deputy Gilmore tried to do.  He has his point of view, however, and in a democracy he is entitled to it.</P>

I think his contribution today was much more conciliatory and understanding than it was <Col N="1144" /> on Committee Stage.  Obviously he has recognised that there is a point to what the Minister is seeking to have incorporated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, his contribution and those of Deputies Quinn, Shatter and Owen were welcome and have added significantly to improving the Bill.  I have recognised that and have adjusted the Bill where I could to accommodate their views.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 11, before &ldquo;a crossbow&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a longbow or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, a similar amendment was defeated by the Government. Since that time a number of months have elapsed and the serious flaw in this legislation by not including the longbow has been brought to light.  The Minister rightly intends outlawing the crossbow but I fail to see how we can allow this legislation to pass leaving a glaring loophole by omitting the longbow.  However, there are two types of longbow, the compound longbow which is a lethal weapon, and the American tracker longbow.  My main fear is that with the outlawing of the crossbow it will be substituted by the longbow.  This fear has been expressed by a number of parties interested in the fight against crime.  It has also been highlighted by people involved in retailing these weapons.  I fail to see how we can allow this legislation through and not include this simple amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> We are encouraging criminals who are using the crossbow to use the longbow and the Minister's intention will have been drawn to an incident involving a member of the Garda Síochána and a crossbow, something that took place between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  Following that incident much publicity was given to the fact that people who formerly used crossbows would look to the longbow.</P>
    <P>My amendment is a simple one.  I fail to see why the Minister did not take the matter on board on Committee Stage. We are giving the criminals and hoodlums in our society an opportunity to turn parts of our streets into Apache territory by allowing the use of this longbow, a Robin Hood-type weapon that can be sold over the counter for £100 or less.  This danger can be obviated by allowing the simple amendment in the names of Deputy O'Keeffe and myself.  Otherwise I ask the Minister when he considers it necessary to allow free access to and the free use of the longbow?  I cannot think of any reason, other than archery competitions, why the longbow can be used.  If it is brought under the legislation, licences in the form of a firearms certificate will issue in the same way as for a crossbow.  We are doing a disservice by allowing the legislation to proceed without including provision for the longbow.  The longbow can be used very quickly.  It is easily primed for action and can be used as proficiently as a crossbow.  It is a highly dangerous implement.  To allow it to be lawfully used on our streets is to foster crime on the streets in many parts of our cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should accept that society has changed very considerably from our own young days when we played cowboys and Indians with bows and arrows and other assorted items.  Unfortunately, the development of society has been such that there is now a far greater use of firearms and offensive weapons in recent years.  At this stage we have to include the longbow in the category of offensive weapons.  As Deputy Flanagan has mentioned we want <Col N="1146" /> to ensure that parts of our country and in particular, parts of our cities cannot be turned into Apache territory.  The problem as I see it is that when the crossbow is outlawed &mdash; as it is very rightly under this Bill &mdash; there may be a temptation for the criminals to turn to an alternative. Are we sending a clear signal to the criminal elements of our society that this is an obvious alternative?</P>
      <P>I can understand there may be technical difficulties of definition.  I believe those technical difficulties could be overcome and in that situation there is a clear duty on us to ensure that the Bill is as watertight as possible.  On that basis I strongly urge the Minister, now that he has had time to reflect on the issue since the Committee Stage, to accept this amendment and to ensure that this loophole in the Bill is closed.</P>

      <P>I am not accepting this amendment.  In compliance with the undertaking I gave on Committee Stage, I have re-examined the question whether the longbow should be subject to all the controls that apply to firearms and will also apply to crossbows when the Bill becomes law.  Having considered the matter very carefully I am satisfied it is not necessary to do this.  As I said when this matter was raised on Committee Stage, from the point of view of public order and safety the longbow does not present the same problem or concerns as crossbows.  What makes the crossbow a potential danger in the wrong hands is that it can be used to devastating effect without the need for a great deal of practice. It can also be carried in a cocked position, ready to fire by the simple squeeze of the trigger, like a gun.  It is smaller and less cumbersome than the longbow and can even be fitted with a type of telescopic sights normally found on rifles.  On the other hand, the longbow requires considerable skill to use.  It is cumbersome and it would be very ineffective for use in committing crime and, unlike the crossbow, I am not aware that it is being used for that purpose.  In the absence of any evidence that the longbow is being misused or is likely to be misused <Col N="1147" /> for criminal purposes, it would be wrong to bring it within the ambit of the firearms and offensive weapons legislation, as the Deputies suggest in their amendment.  I will, of course, keep the situation under review and I can assure the Deputies that if at some time in the future evidence should emerge of criminal misuse of the longbow I will consider what has been suggested in their amendment.</P>

I have considered the matter further and I accepted the Minister's assurance on Committee Stage that the situation would be kept under review.  In the interest of balance I sought not to pursue the matter at this stage and perhaps it may be better if the proposers of the amendment let the matter rest on the basis of what the Minister said on Committee Stage &mdash; that is that the matter would be kept under review and that if a problem should arise we could address the matter again. There is the question of balance and we must recognise that there are substantial differences between the crossbow and the longbow.  We must respect the rights of those who use the longbow legitimately as a sporting weapon and for that reason I do not support the amendment at this stage.</P>

I must ask why we should wait until such time as it becomes a problem.  There are sufficient indications to date that this implement will be used extensively in the future.

      <P>In page 5, line 17, after &ldquo;paragraph (c) or (d)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(or in paragraph (f) or (g) so far as either of those paragraphs relates to the said paragraph (c) or (d))&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a purely technical amendment to correct a point overlooked when the Bill was amended on Committee Stage to deal with defective firearms.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill inserts a new provision in the Firearms Act, 1925, to enable this country to become party to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer and Acquisition of Firearms. That convention does not classify crossbows or stun guns as firearms and for that reason they are specifically excluded from the provisions of the new subsection (3A) which section 5 will insert in the 1925 Act.  This is done in paragraph (c) of the new subsection.</P>
      <P>However, as the Bill now stands, a defective crossbow or defective stun gun could be subject to the provisions of the new subsection (3A) and, of course, this would be illogical, as a fully working crossbow or stun gun would not be so subject.

    <P>We, in Fine Gael would also like to have established as an offence the discharge by a person of a firearm in a reckless fashion without lawful authority after nightfall and before daybreak.  There are a couple of areas that need to be touched on in relation to this amendment.  A problem can arise in our cities and urban areas where a firearm can be discharged after nightfall.  That has a number of consequences, one of which is the inconvenience for those people who might be woken up but it also has the far more serious consequence that somebody might be hit by the bullets discharged from the weapon.  There is a further problem in rural areas where people discharge firearms mainly for the purpose of poaching.</P>

      <P>As I understand that is quite a considerable problem in some parts of the country.  Now that the firearms Bill is before us, we should tighten up that provision by including this amendment.  I recall that on Committee Stage the Minister indicated that there would be a Wildlife Bill and said the matter could be reviewed in the context of another Bill that might come before the House.  We have all been Members here for quite some time and we know the delays associated with bringing Bills before the House.  If a loophole now exists, we should take the opportunity of closing it at this stage rather than waiting <Col N="1150" /> for possibly a number of years for the matter to be considered again.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment, which is directed at preventing poaching, would be to make it an offence for a person to discharge a firearm at night unless he had specific authority to do this.  On Committee Stage I said that I believed this amendment, if it were accepted, would give rise to serious practical difficulties and having re-examined the matter this is still my view.  The example I gave of one of the difficulties that would arise was of a farmer shooting at vermin on his land after nightfall or at a fox worrying poultry or dogs worrying sheep.  We cannot simply put a blanket prohibition on the discharge of a weapon after nightfall &mdash; it is impracticable.</P>
      <P>While I share the Deputies' concern about the need to have effective legislation to deal with poaching, I cannot accept the amendment for the reason I have given.  I might also mention that I do not think this is the type of provision that should be included in a firearms Bill given that there is a separate body of legislation which has been enacted to secure the protection of wildlife, that is the Wildlife Act, 1976.  Accordingly I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

It is recognised at present that the farmer in those circumstances has lawful authority to go <Col N="1151" /> after the fox that is chasing his animals and my proposal would not in any way limit or restrict that farmer's entitlement. The defence offered by the Minister does not stand up in that light.  I am not in any way trying to restrict the right of the farmer in dealing with such matters but there is a problem in relation to the improper discharge of firearms in urban areas after nightfall and I have seen reports of such incidents.  I am also aware that there are problems in relation to poachers.  I understand the Minister's viewpoint that we need a wildlife Bill but when will we see it?  There is a problem both in the urban and rural areas and we now have an opportunity to deal with that problem.  On that basis I am anxious that this amendment be included in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 4 is to broaden the scope of section 9 (1) to make it an offence for a person to carry any knife or similar article in a public place unless with good reason or lawful authority.  Under section 9 (1) as it stands it would be an offence to do so only in the places of public entertainment or resort referred to.</P>
      <P>I propose this amendment after very careful thought.  As I explained in my Second Stage speech, I was anxious to confine the offence to those places where, in the normal course of events, a person would have no legitimate reason to have a knife or similar article.  I was anxious to do this for two reasons.  Firstly, experience would show that it is in such places that the greatest danger of abuse of offensive weapons arises.  Secondly, to make it an offence to carry any knife or bladed or sharply pointed article in a public place unless with good reason or excuse could, in theory, place any responsible citizen who might have reason to carry such an article in the position of having to explain himself.</P>
      <P>However, a number of recent events involving the use of knives has convinced me that the public interest would best be served by broadening the scope of the provision to include all public places. There have been recently a number of very serious stabbing incidents on our streets, one in which a British visitor was fatally injured.  I am satisfied that prevention of such incidents is more important than the avoidance of what is a faint possibility of an incursion on the right of responsible persons to go about their lawful business.  I trust I will have the support of the House in proposing this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the fundamental change which substituting &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in the provision will make, it is necessary in my view to recast its subsidiary elements from what I propose in the amendment, to remove the exception for pocket knives.  This, I know, was already advocated by some Deputies.  I am satisfied that in the context of it being an offence to carry a knife in any public place there is no longer any valid reason to single out <Col N="1153" /> any particular item for exception.  Again, because of the substitution of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in the provision, I feel the use of the term &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; might be pejorative.  I propose its replacement by the term &ldquo;good reason&rdquo;.  It is appropriate that it should be made clear that the provision is not aimed at the legitimate use of a knife or some other tool or article for work or recreational purposes.  This is done in the proposed new subsection (3).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 is merely a consequential amendment.  Section 16 (1) as it stands refers to the places mentioned in subsections (1), (2) or (3) of section 9.  Acceptance of amendment No. 4 will mean that the only place which will be referred to in section 9 will be any &ldquo;public place&rdquo; and the reference in section 16 needs to be altered accordingly.</P>

This amendment was not down on Committee Stage &mdash; possibly it arose from our discussions on Committee Stage &mdash; and therefore we did not have the opportunity previously to tease out the manner in which the amendment is framed.  Any comments I have to make relate to that rather than to the whole principle.  I accept entirely the need to restrict, as far as possible, the carrying of knives and sharply pointed weapons in public places, and from that point of view the Minister has my full support.</P>
      <P>I read an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday which covered the whole question of teenage gangs carrying and using knives.  It pointed out the range of such knives that are available openly for sale.  I was horrified not so much by the range of knives which included tiger knives, butterfly knives and knuckle duster knives but by the cheapness of these items and the fact that they are on open sale for as little as £1.75.  I was absolutely horrified to find that that situation obtains in our cities and I would question those retailers who carry such items and make them available for sale to people who might be tempted to use them for unlawful purposes.</P>

In studying the matter I find it is not so much a question of there not being a number of suitable women available but that when the time comes to make a particular appointment, it is often difficult to find somebody in that particular area or even sector who is appropriate for appointment to the board concerned.  That is not to say that there may not be a considerable pool of women of great ability and talent available in a general way but I find that when one comes to make a particular appointment to a particular board at a particular time there are restrictions and limitations.

      <P>I will be brief.  Is the Taoiseach aware that because of the excellent work done by Eileen Ryan of RTE we now have a very comprehensive directory of women under different headings who are highly professional and highly specialised.  I understand that the <Col N="1156" /> Department of the Taoiseach have now got a copy of the document.  I should like to put it to the Taoiseach, because I know he has a commitment in this area, that if not a quote, a certain affirmative action be, written in, not only with regard to Ministers but to nominating bodies, for example, FÁS where there are very few women in an area of tremendous importance to women?  Could the Government adopt a policy of insisting that every nominating body include women when they are nominating people for membership of State boards?</P>

      <P>All we can do is encourage them but the situation is improving in that regard.  The right of bodies to nominate is a major inhibiting factor.  To that extent we are in the hands of some of these bodies from time to time but we can work in that area, too.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, one of my priority questions was disallowed but I was informed only in this morning's post of that fact which gave me no time to resubmit another question.  This is denying the rights of people who have the right to put down priority questions, if they are informed only on the day of the question and not before the closing date for priority questions.  The question I had put down was about Namibia and was different from the question which was ruled out.  It was specifically asking to extend our bilateral aid to Namibia. The other question which was ruled out had to do with diplomatic relations and project aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 20, 21, 27, 34, 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>I fully share the concerns of Deputies on the issue of Cambodia.  I would refer Deputies to my statement in the Dáil on 14 November 1989 and my answer to Parliamentary Questions on 7 February 1990.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on those occasions, Government policy calls for an immediate end to hostilities and for negotiations leading to a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement based on the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cambodia.  This settlement must provide for the Cambodian people themselves to select their rulers in internationally-supervised, free and fair elections. It must exclude any possibility of a return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge, which has been guilty of outrageous crimes against the people of Cambodia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international discussions on a settlement to the Cambodian tragedy are ongoing and, while difficulties have been experienced in the negotiating process, real progress has also been made in the last few months.  Discussions have been <Col N="1159" /> greatly assisted by the initiative promoted by Australia for a major role for the United Nations, not only in the supervision of elections, but in the interim period preceding such elections.  The Government fully support such an enhanced United Nations role and have decided to contribute the sum of £100,000 to the Trust Fund which has recently been established by the Secretary-General to finance the start-up costs of such a major UN operation, including the cost of planning missions which are already being undertaken by the United Nations Secretariat.</P>
    <P>There is now, I believe, a considerable degree of agreement among the Cambodian parties and within the international community that, in the interim period leading up to elections, Cambodian sovereignty should be vested in some form of Supreme National Council which, in its composition, would be representative of the Cambodian people as a whole.  It is my sincere hope that agreement can be reached in the near future on the establishment of such a body, which could also nominate Cambodia's delegation to the United Nations General Assembly.  Such a delegation would, I am confident, be acceptable to most United Nations member states.  It would certainly have Ireland's support.</P>
    <P>However, if some form of Supreme National Council has not been created by the time the General Assembly meets next September, it will be necessary to address the current unsatisfactory state of affairs whereby the Cambodian seat is held by the so-called National Government of Cambodia, a coalition which includes the Khmer Rouge and which is not representative of the Cambodian people.  I do not believe that this situation should be allowed to continue.  The Irish delegation to the Assembly will, therefore, work closely with likeminded countries with a view to changing the situation, possibly by trying to bring about a situation where the Cambodian seat is left temporarily vacant.  I believe that, in the absence of a delegation truly representative of Cambodia, the option of leaving the <Col N="1160" /> Cambodian seat temporarily vacant deserves support.</P>
    <P>I share the abhorrence of Deputies at the crimes carried out by the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge against their own people. I have great sympathy with the view that those involved should be brought before an appropriate tribunal to answer for these crimes.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide makes the intentional destruction in whole or in part of a national, ethnic, racial or religious group an international crime.  The Convention provides for the trial of persons charged with such offences by a competent tribunal of the State in the territory of which the act was committed &mdash; that is, in this case, by a competent tribunal of Cambodia. However, in the absence of an internationally recognised government in Cambodia, the necessary international co-operation required to bring exiled Khmer Rouge leaders to trial in Cambodia is unlikely to be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>While the Convention also provides the possibility of trial by an international penal tribunal, this is only a theoretical possibility, since there is at present no international penal tribunal with jurisdiction to try persons for genocide. Article IX of the Convention does provide for a role for the International Court of Justice, but only in the case of a dispute between individual States parties to the Convention.  This condition cannot be fulfilled in the absence of a Cambodian Government in a position to be party to such a dispute.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that it is most unlikely that former Khmer Rouge leaders can be brought to trial until such time as there is an internationally recognised Government in power in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>For the long suffering Cambodian people, the urgent necessity is to bring an end to the fighting and to allow them to live their lives in peace.  They should be allowed to determine who their rulers should be, in free and democratic elections, and these rulers should have the <Col N="1161" /> fullest support of the international community in the major task of economic and social development which lies ahead.  I intend to continue to do everything possible during Ireland's Presidency of the European Community to advance the prospects for a just and lasting peace in Cambodia.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply and warmly welcome what he appears to be saying &mdash; that he will work with allied countries to ensure that the Cambodian seat in the United Nations will be left vacant.  My question asked if the Minister would be raising the issue at the Credentials Committee. Has he had advice on how to go about that?  Can he raise the continuing representation on the UN by this so called coalition?  How will he go about doing that?  What are the legal implications for the UN of having a seat vacant, which I understand would be a precedent?  How will he go about fulfilling the thrust of my question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The seating arrangements for Cambodia in past years have not been acceptable to Ireland and when a vote was last taken on this issue in 1982 Ireland abstained on the basis that neither the coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea nor the administration of Phnom Penh had received any endorsement from the people of Cambodia.  Our position continues to be that neither of the contenders for the Cambodian seat has a proper mandate to represent Cambodia since only a government appointed on the basis of free and fair elections could truly claim to have such a mandate. As I have already indicated, I favour the seat being held in the interim by a delegation nominated by some form of Supreme National Council who could be reasonably representative of the Cambodian people.  If this is not possible I believe the option of leaving the seat vacant merits support on the basis that it does not give an unfair advantage to any of the Cambodian parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say to Deputy Owen that I cannot be more definite at present since <Col N="1162" /> I do not know the situation that will obtain in September.  If the credentials presented by the Cambodian delegation are signed by a representative of a Supreme National Council the problem would be resolved since such credentials would be acceptable to most member states of the UN, including Ireland.  If the credentials are signed by the so-called National Government of Cambodia they are likely to be challenged in the Credentials Committee of which Ireland is not a member.  It is also possible that competing credentials might be presented by a delegation representing the Hun Sen Administration and such credentials would also probably be challenged in the Credentials Committee.  It is not possible to say at present what the outcome of any voting in the Credentials Committee might be.  As the Deputy knows, the report of the Credentials Committee goes to the General Assembly where Ireland is represented and the commendation of the committee in relation to the credentials of the Cambodian delegation could be challenged in the General Assembly.  Again, it is impossible to predict the outcome of such a challenge.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, recognising the interest Deputy Owen has in this issue, all I can say at present is that the Irish delegation to the General Assembly will work with like minded countries to bring about a change in the present situation, possibly on the basis of leaving the Cambodian seat vacant.  We cannot be more definite than that now because of the circumstances and how they might change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the information I received today that Prince Sihanouk has announced that he is taking &ldquo;a leave of absence&rdquo;&mdash; I use that term advisedly &mdash; from politics, will the Minister accept now that there is a greater urgency for him to give us an assurance that he will not participate in a vote in the autumn that would give any further accreditation to this coalition who now have not even the respectable face, as it were, of Prince Sihanouk who has gone on leave of <Col N="1163" /> absence, and for how long we have no indication?  In view of that the Minister might consider sending an Irish diplomat to Cambodia.  When diplomats were sent from European countries, those countries got a very clear picture of what was going on.  I do not in any way diminish what the Minister has said, and I take his assurances that he, like us, is totally against the Khmer Rouge, but in view of this new change today he might consider sending somebody to Cambodia to report to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Owen has said confirms the sensible approach I have adopted in reply to the seed question because of the changes in circumstances and developments that are taking place.  I will certainly give every consideration to what Deputy Owen has had to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>In confirming its commitment to political union at its special meeting in Dublin on 28 April, the European Council called for a detailed examination by Foreign Ministers of certain issues.  These were: the need for possible treaty changes with the aim of strengthening the democratic legitimacy of the union, enabling the Community and its institutions to respond efficiently and effectively to the demands of the new situation, and assuring unity and coherence in the Community's international action.</P>
      <P>As well as this examination and analysis, Foreign Ministers are to prepare proposals to be discussed at the next European Council meeting to be held in Dublin in June, with a view to a decision on the holding of a second intergovernmental conference on political union to work in parallel with the conference on economic and monetary union which is to begin in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These conclusions of the European Council set the agenda for the work which <Col N="1165" /> is to be undertaken within the Community on political union in the immediate future.  Procedural arrangements have been worked out to enable the Foreign Ministers to begin this work with a view to the preparation in good time of the report which they are asked to make to the European Council of 25/26 June. Consideration is at present being given to the positions which Ireland should take on the various issues which will arise in discussions on political union and how and when these could best be put forward.</P>
    <P>Our full and active membership of the European Community is a central element in our foreign policy and it has not been in any way in conflict with our policy of military neutrality.  This is the situation so far as the Community Treaties are concerned.  As to the future, we understand that the position of our partners is that they wish to continue their membership of NATO and that they also wish the United States to continue its involvement in European defence through the NATO alliance.  Defence and military matters would therefore continue to be discussed in that forum.</P>
    <P>Ireland will of course participate fully in the preparatory work which is now beginning with a view to a decision on the holding of an intergovernmental conference on political union.  The question of membership by Ireland of the NATO alliance does not however arise.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the Oireachtas will have every opportunity to examine fully the implications for Ireland of political union.  I would mention that last week we had a debate in this House on European developments. This debate covered also the conclusions of the special meeting of the European Council of 28 April, including its conclusions on political union.  There will of course be other opportunities for similar debates as work on this important subject gets underway.  Furthermore, if and when the question of possible treaty changes comes to be considered, then any relevant proposals would be subject to debate in the appropriate instances, with <Col N="1166" /> a view to ratification in accordance with our constitutional procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for a long answer which evaded the kernel of my question.  I should like to put the subject matter of my question to the Minister.  This evening with others I will be attending a conference in Cork on the democratic deficit and my question related to the democratic deficit.  If Ireland is developing a separate position paper on European political union, was the paper developed since last Thursday?  If it was developed before last Thursday, why is it that it was not referred to in the speeches of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  If the Government have decided that they will continue their unique position of not having a foreign affairs committee to discuss matters, will they respond to my suggestion which I believe was generous, that there should be some kind of informal meeting of the spokespersons on Foreign Affairs in relation to political union?  Will the Minister agree that in relation to the Single European Act, the documents prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs were inadequate, too late and largely cosmetic? Is it the Minister's decision that he will only come to the House late in the day when aspects of political union will neither have been discussed by the public nor by the House?  Will he agree that that is scandalous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should at least have regard to the reply given by me.  That reply dealt specifically with the questions that he and other Members asked.  There was no question of evasion in the answers I gave.  In an effort to be as helpful as I can to the Deputy, as I always try to be, I should like to tell him that consideration is at present being given to the positions which Ireland should take on the various issues which will arise in discussions on political union and how and when they should be put forward.</P>

      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's supplementary question, I should like to tell him that I am satisfied that the Oireachtas will have every oppportunity to examine fully the implications for Ireland of political union.  The Deputy will recall that we had a full discussion on the issue last week. There are ways and means of initiating a debate on any issue in the House.  For my part I am more than willing to come to the House to discuss the issues with him and other Members of the Oireachtas if requested to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not elaborated on the 26 lines in his 14 page speech delivered on Thursday which dealt with political union.  There was no inkling in that speech of the basic principles of political union.  Will the Minister explain what the Taoiseach meant when he said in his speech, in the only reference to political union, that there was widespread support for the view that political union must fully respect the principle of subsidiarity?  Will the Minister tell the House what the principle of subsidiarity means to him and how it will be enforced in the discussions on political union?  I should like to ask the Minister to find some other mechanism other than straight statements in the House to enable us to discuss political union.  We need a better opportunity to tease out points rather than making set speeches on the issue.  The Minister should not belittle us by saying that we have had plenty of opportunities to discuss this issue.  We need a proper debate on the issue and I should like to ask the Minister to put his mind to arranging for that to take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to return to a specific point I raised in my question. I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what he proposes to do to initiate a dialogue among the public.  I focused on that in my first supplementary when I referred to the explanatory documentation around the time of the Single European Act which was widely regarded as a cosmetic exercise.  Will such a document be prepared and will there be a public discussion? Does the Minister seriously think that the statement last week &mdash; when it was suggested and believed that there was no separate Irish position on political union and no paper being prepared &mdash; is satisfactory?  Since then there was an announcement in Brussels that there is an Irish paper.  Why can we not discuss that in this House?  Why are we treated so specially that we are to be unique in the Community in not having a foreign affairs committee or debates on these matters in the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants me to answer it I will.  Deputy Owen should be aware that the meeting held in Dublin on 28 April discussed political union which arose from two submissions before us for consideration.  One came from the Belgian Government and the other by way of a joint letter from Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand.  No other member state put forward any suggestions on their views on political union. We have had submissions from three of the Twelve, others are considering the matter and, when they are in a position to do so, the other nine &mdash; including Ireland &mdash; will put forward their suggestions for consideration.</P>

      <P>The issues discussed at the last meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference on 19 April were outlined in the joint statement published after the conference; they included the current political situation, security and legal matters, confidence in the security forces and system of justice in Northern Ireland and cross-Border economic co-operation.</P>
      <P>The question of how political progress can best be achieved is kept under constant and active review by the Irish and British Governments within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference and this will continue to be the case.

      <P>With regard to the second part of Deputy McCartan's question which deals with the Government's commitment to support devolution, we must be very careful in our references to the Agreement.  We must have regard to the text of Articles 4 (a) and (c).  The wording of Article 4 (c) is quite explicit.  It says:</P>
      <P>...devolution can be achieved only with the co-operation of constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both traditions there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister not agree that the question of political progress in Northern Ireland is not unrelated to the question <Col N="1174" /> of extradition?  To that extent I am surprised at his failure to respond to questions on this matter.  Does he not agree that one of those matters which has determined political opinion, particularly on the unionist side in Northern Ireland, is their perception of extradition?  Does he accept that there should be no hiding place anywhere on this island and no loopholes provided in any legislation for any person or persons involved in acts of violence for whatever alleged motive? Does he accept that this question should be looked at at an early stage because it is tied in with the possibility of political progress?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>From the beginning of the Presidency I have been concerned to bring about improvements in the Community's programmes for Third World development.  During the Presidency many of the provisions of the new Lomé Convention, which provide a comprehensive framework for co-operation with 68 African, Caribbean and Pacific group of States over the next ten years, have been brought into effect.  Good progress has been made in the examination by the Council of the measures necessary for ratification of the convention by the Community.  I will shortly by laying this Convention before the House with a view <Col N="1176" /> to its ratification by Ireland.  The convention contains a number of innovations notably in relation to environmental protection and assistance for States undertaking economic reform as well as increased funding.</P>
      <P>Most other developing countries are in Asia and Latin America.  I will shortly be receiving the Commission's reflections on the future approach to co-operation with these countries.  I intend that the Development Council on 29 May will launch a thorough review of the Communty's relations with these countries so as to help determine policy for the nineties. Under our Presidency the Community is also embarking on a major ten year review of its generalised system of preferences.  In relation to Central America, a significant step was taken at the sixth San José Meeting in Dublin on 9-10 April when the financing convention for the regional payments system in Central America was signed.</P>
      <P>The Development Council will also consider new approaches in the areas of environment and development with a view to ensuring that the natural heritage of developing countries is protected in development projects.  Among other matters it is also envisaged that the Council take steps to integrate food aid more fully into the Community's development policy and to enhance the role of women in developing countries.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the details he gave on the Lomé Convention.  I want to ask him a specific question about Third World aid which was the nub of the original question.  The Lomé Convention is not generally regarded as providing Third World aid; it is a co-operation agreement between the Community and the other countries mentioned.  The question asked the Minister the improvements or alterations which have taken place during the Irish Presidency in regard to Third World aid. I want to ask him specifically what measures the Irish Presidency suggested going into the GATT round which would assist, for example, the primary commodities from the producing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> With regard to environmental protection, what measures have the Community or the Irish Presidency suggested to transfer the costs of the environmental burden from the recipient countries to the Community itself or to any of the member countries?  Finally, were the other members of the Community deeply impressed by Ireland's continuing cuts in overseas development aid or were they enlightened enough not to take it as a headline?</P>

      <P>With regard to helping developing countries, I believe there is agreement that the Community will do what it can to promote trade by developing countries and provide appropriate technical and other assistance to them. This important fact was catered for in the Lomé Convention.  That convention provides a significant framework to enable the ACP countries to improve their economies.  So far as the other main group of developing countries is concerned, as I stated in my reply a review of future co-operation with those countries is taking place and the Community's <Col N="1178" /> ten year review of the generalised system of preferences will take the interests of these countries into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see myself making progress on the general matter. Arising from the Minister's reply in relation to one specific area &mdash; in the hope that we might get concrete information even in that one &mdash; when he referred to the sixth San José meeting of 9-10 April, would he not agree that the conditions attaching to the assistance for creating better trading relationships between the countries of the Central American region are not very severe if they are not subject to the contingency that if any one country does not comply then aid does not go to the other compliant countries?  That is posed by way of a small modest question of fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>Can the Minister inform the House whether there has been any discussion among the Ministers responsible for development co-operation about the possible effects of increased EC aid to the Eastern Europe area versus the Third World aid policy now being adopted by the EC?  Can the Minister give the House an assurance that there will be a Lomé VI in ensuing years?  Also in view of his answer to an earlier question about Cambodia, during the Irish Presidency of the EC, can the Minister alter EC policy to allow long-term development aid to be given to Cambodia now that people are seeing that they can deal with the Cambodian position rather than just sending EC aid through the NGOs thereby ensuring that the EC itself could effect a change?  Would the Minister use his very significant power within our period of the Presidency so that, at the end of these six months, he will have one or two of those kinds of successes standing to his name?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be glad to look into the substance of the second part of Deputy Owen's question.  With regard to the first part, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, I can give that assurance, that there will be no decrease whatsoever in moneys specifically put aside for aid in the context of which we are speaking.  There will be no question whatsoever that any moneys designated for aid will be siphoned off for Central or Eastern Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Given what we know about the general state of Africa, declining economies, foodstocks and so on, does the Minister think that EC aid to African countries or to the Third World generally &mdash; as the question asks &mdash; has been satisfactory?  Does the Minister think it is working satisfactorily?  Can he stand up and give us a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or a &ldquo;no&rdquo; reply to that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, I should say it can only be regarded as a help; it is not yielding the end result we would all like to see.  The problems being encountered in many parts of Africa are great.  Aid can do a certain amount only.  There is now a recognition, within the administrations in some of these countries, that they will have to put their houses in order, that they will have to devise economic plans and programmes beneficial to their people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have to devise efficient schemes.  I might mention one example of which I am aware: I visited a certain city in one of the Southern African states recently.  My guide pointed out to me a beautiful site in the city centre where the Government of that poor country planned to build a £65 million headquarters.  As a result of gentle persuasion that £65 million project is not being built and the country can well do without it.  Certainly there is room for improvement in the aid that can be given from Europe to these countries which are <Col N="1180" /> in very serious trouble.  There is also very great need for practically all of those countries to sit down and devise practical policies for the benefit of their peoples.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 18, 25 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has never recognised the incorporation into the Soviet Union of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with our partners in the Twelve, we have been following carefully <Col N="1181" /> developments in the Baltic region.  The member states of the Community have issued a number of statements on the question.  In their most recent, issued on 21 April, they expressed their serious concern at the economic measures introduced by Moscow in relation to Lithuania and their belief that measures of a coercive nature can make no contribution to the search for a solution through dialogue. They underlined the obligation to exercise maximum restraint and to avoid actions that could only lead to a further deterioration of the situation.  The Twelve are firmly of the view that an outcome acceptable to all must be sought and that this is possible only by means of discussion.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Twelve, the Presidency, through our Ambassador in Moscow, made representations to the Soviet authorities setting out our concerns. Our views have also been made known to the Lithuanians.</P>
    <P>As regards the letter sent by President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl to the Lithuanian leaders, the President and Chancellor did not consult with the Presidency prior to taking their initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two supplementary questions for the Minister. First: the Baltic Republics lost their independence as a result of an agreement between two major powers, Russia and Germany.  Would the Minister agree that the reluctance of the American and European powers to defend these Republics &mdash; lest they upset President Gorbachev, a policy with which Ireland complies, &mdash; indicates there is a danger that these Republics will be the victim once again of deals between major powers?  Second: everyone agrees that the problem should be resolved by way of negotiation. However, the Soviet Union has shown no interest in negotiating but instead threatens the Republics both militarily and economically.  How long will our Government tolerate this intimidation before providing diplomatic and economic support?</P>

      <P>It is about the umpteenth time I have noticed this sniggering attitude. Has the Minister, in his capacity as President of the European Council of Foreign Ministers, or as Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs, at any time in recent months, publicly or privately, given support and encouragement to the Lithuanian Government elected by popular vote?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had no meeting with any of the representatives of the Lithuanian Government.  I have had no indirect communication with them.  I might say that, on any occasion that this subject is discussed between the Twelve, with regard to the matter of European political co-operation &mdash; we are fully briefed on the Lithuanian position by Foreign Ministers who live quite close to Lithuania, in particular by the Danish Foreign Minister, Mr. Elleman Jensen.  I might also say to Deputy Deasy that, after our most recent discussion on the question &mdash; when I said that our Ambassador conveyed our message to the Soviets in Moscow &mdash; on that occasion also the Danish Foreign Minister was <Col N="1183" /> asked to convey, on behalf of the Twelve, our views on the issue to the Lithuanians.</P>

      <P>I wanted to take the matter somewhat further and ask the Minister, as the most senior Foreign Minister in the Community at present, whether he would offer himself as an arbitrator to assist in resolving the problem in Lithuania because he has, a number of times today, for example, espoused the democratic will of the Cambodian people.  Therefore the Minister has to cease playing a passive role and perhaps offer himself as someone who can be taken seriously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>We have a deep understanding of and sympathy with the wish of the people of Lithuania to gain independence.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach has given a mandate to Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited (DPOL) to plan and organise an appropriate cultural programme for Dublin in 1991.  I have personally been in contact with the chairman of the board of DPOL to confirm that my Department will assist DPOL in every manner possible in this regard.</P>
      <P>Through the medium of our embassies and consulates abroad, my Department are helping to promote actively in other countries a widespread knowledge of the fact that Dublin is the European City of Culture for 1991.  We are also helping DPOL to establish contacts and links with cultural institutions and groups as well as individual artists and performers overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Through its representation on the <Col N="1186" /> board of DPOL my Department's assistance is actively and continually available to the board and to the chief executive of DPOL in the preparations for this major cultural event.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister inform the House if he or the Taoiseach, who has taken a personal interest in this matter, has made proposals to DPOL concerning some performance events or significant capital expenditure to mark the year Dublin will be European City of Culture?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the total amount of funding which will be available for the Dublin European City of Culture project is still under negotiation.  Funds provided to my Department for cultural relations are intended primarily for the provision of assistance to Irish cultural events abroad.  It would therefore be difficult to allocate these funds towards the overall cost of the project.  As I say, my Department are ready to assist the project in every manner possible and I am satisfied funds will be provided to enable them to get this very worthy project under way as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

Would the Minister not agree, given the great success of the Glasgow venture, the international attention focused on Glasgow and the significance Madrid is attaching to its preparations, that it is absolutely outrageous that at this time of the year we are so unprepared?  Is the Minister willing to contact the Taoiseach, who sometimes is more interested <Col N="1187" /> in patronising the arts, to see if he will do anything?</P>

      <P>The Government have been following developments in central and eastern Europe closely, both on the political level and in the economic arena. We welcome and encourage the progress made by countries in the region towards becoming pluralistic and democratic societies.  Ireland is supporting political developments in the region through our participation in EC support activities and through visits and contacts.</P>
      <P>However our network of resident diplomatic missions is small and must remain so for the foreseeable future, given our limited financial and personnel resources.  We do, of course, keep the possibility of its extension under review in the light of our national and international interests and the resources available.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the significance of recent changes in that part of the world, the Government have decided, with the agreement of the Polish Government, to establish a resident embassy in Warsaw. There are no plans to establish any other residential embassy in that part of Europe in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply in respect of the siting of a full-time embassy in Warsaw.  It is a very positive move.  Surely the Minister should be able to get the Government to agree to a supplementary estimate to provide more residential embassies in these countries, six in all; Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland.  Surely it is of sufficient importance to merit the siting of a number of embassies.  These countries will be very heavily involved in trade with us and I am sure every trading and exporting country in the developed world is moving in there at the moment with residential embassies.  Surely it is not beyond our capabilities to do likewise.  It would be very foolish to say that we do not have the money to do it.  We must get the <Col N="1190" /> money.

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if the General Affairs Council of the EC have examined the impact on (i) EC Budget (ii) EC Regional Policies and (iii) the Common Agricultural Policy of the unification of Germany in the current year and in future years.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The General Affairs Council has been continuously monitoring developments in relation to German unification since the end of last <Col N="1191" /> year.  At each of our monthly meetings the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic has briefed his colleagues on progress in the unification process.  Similar briefings are provided by German Ministers to their colleagues in other Councils including in particular, ECO/FIN and Agriculture.  The Special European Council held on 28 April considered the question of German unification and the informal General Affairs Council held in Dublin on 21 April 1990 to prepare for the special European Council, considered <i>inter alia,</i> a report drawn up by the Commission on the implications for the Community of German unification.</P>
      <P>The Commission states in its report that while the integration of East Germany into the Community does not amount to accession in formal terms, the problems posed are similar to those of recent accessions.  Integration will need to proceed by stages and will require transitional measures to facilitate the gradual application of existing Community legislation. Temporary derogations will be required.  The transitional arrangements will be based on Commission proposals and will be decided by Council following reference to the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>As regards the impact on the Community Budget of the GDR's integration into the Community, the Commission's view is that any figures are bound to be guesswork at this stage.  It is expected that the position will become clearer when the arrangements for inter-German monetary union are finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the revenue side of the Community Budget much will depend, in the Commission's view, on the transitional arrangements and the macroeconomic impact of German unification.  In general terms the Commission expects to see vigorous economic growth in the GDR, generating higher demand throughout the Community and an increase in imports from other member states.  This additional growth, which could add up to one half of one per cent to the Community <Col N="1192" /> GNP, will be reflected in additional revenue to the EC Budget.  On the expenditure side, the cost will largely be determined by the impact of integration on the Common Agricultural Policy and the scale of intervention under the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Commission states that as from unification the territory of the GDR will be entitled to Community aid under the Structural Fund's regulations and assumes that the GDR will be eligible under one or more of the structural policy objectives.  In particular as far as the Social Fund is concerned the Commission expects that particular emphasis will be placed on vocational training and occupational integration.</P>
    <P>The overall volume of Structural Fund assistance to the GDR will depend on the classification of the regions of the GDR with reference to the various objectives of the structural policies.  Chancellor Kohl has stated that German unification will not affect commitments already made to member states regarding the Structural Funds and that these will be fully met.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture the Commission points out that the pattern of agriculture in the GDR differs very considerably from that in the FRG.  Co-operatives and state farms dominate and cover almost 95 per cent of cultivated land.  The average size of farms is very large and family farm ownership almost non existent with the rural population largely employees rather than land-holders. Overall productivity is below West European standards, mainly due to its organisation and excess labour force.  The trend of produce prices in the GDR will depend on how quickly its agricultural economy is phased into a market economy as from the entry into force of German Economic and Monetary Union. Substantial consumer subsidies in the GDR will have to be phased out.  Overall the problems for East Germany, including the question of land ownership, are considerable.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the European Council of 28 April considered the German unification issue.  The conclusions of that <Col N="1193" /> meeting which have been circulated to Deputies, warmly welcomed German unification and expressed confidence that it will be a positive factor in the development of Europe as a whole and of the Community in particular.  The European Council said that the Community will ensure that the integration of the territory of the GDR is accomplished in a smooth and harmonious way.  The Heads of State and Government were satisfied that this integration will contribute to faster economic growth in the Community. They agree that it will take place in conditions of economic balance and monetary stability.  Unification will come about without revision of the Treaties and the European Council saw integration becoming effective as soon as unification is legally established, subject to the necessary transitional arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>After the very lengthy reply which the Minister has just given, surely he does not expect us to believe at this stage that some estimates have not been made as to the costs of unifying Germany and bringing in an additional 16 million people into a unified Germany? What effects will this have on the Structural Funds?  Where will the money for this economy to achieve structural stability and increased infrastructural development come from, if it will not come from the already announced Structural Fund allocations?  I find it difficult to believe that nobody has made any estimates yet of the cost on the rest of Europe of the reunification of Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer Deputy Owen briefly to the fact that the Commission has stated in a document, which it presented to us and which I am taking steps to have laid in the Library &mdash; even though we have not got enough for everybody as of yet &mdash; that any figures at present would be guesswork figures, that is the word that the Commission uses.  As things develop we will have a clearer idea and as I have said in my reply, the position will become clearer when arrangements for the inter-German monetary union are finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> Again, I refer Deputy Owen to the statement made by Chancellor Kohl, which said that German unification will not affect commitments already made to member states regarding Structural Funds and that these will be fully met. Further, in the number of areas I tried to cover in the course of my reply to Deputy Barry's question, I clearly pointed out where there is quite a number of complex situations to contend with but these have been worked on.  As I have already said, the Deputy can have regard to the official views of the Commission which will be laid in the Library in as short a time as I can possibly manage.</P>

    <P>Deputies will have been shocked and saddened to learn last night of the sudden and untimely death of His Eminence, Tomás Cardinal Ó Fiaich while leading a <Col N="1221" /> pilgrimage to Lourdes from his Archdiocese of Armagh.</P>
    <P>Cardinal Ó Fiaich was a great Irishman, a most distinguished churchman and a brilliant scholar.  His contribution throughout his entire lifetime to the religious, cultural and social life of the country was one of dedication, enthusiasm and above all of great humanity.</P>
    <P>As president of Maynooth College and as Primate of All Ireland he displayed unique leadership qualities.  He was held in the highest esteem and with much affection by all those with whom he came in contact in the course of his pastoral and public life.</P>
    <P>He made an immense contribution to the ecclesiastical history of early Christian Ireland, and through lectures, pilgrimages, and through the medium of television, he retraced for a wider public the steps of the saints and scholars from Ireland that brought Christianity and learning to Europe during the dark ages. He seemed to know the location of every manuscript and the details of the journey of every saint.</P>
    <P>He was a man who was most interested in and concerned with people.  He was always available to listen to those who wished to express their views or concerns whether in public or in private.</P>
    <P>He was a man of great humanity, sympathetic and understanding, with a generous warm personality and open manner.  Above all else, he was a man of God and of peace.  He gave leadership by example through his strong personal commitment to ecumenical dialogue and joint civic and religious activities with other Christians.  He spared no effort in his deep wish to see a peaceful solution to the problem of Northern Ireland achieved on a basis acceptable to all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Cardinal Ó Fiaich, who came from Cullyhanna near the Border in Armagh, had a strong sense of identification with his people, and had throughout his life a great love of all things Irish.  He was a spiritual leader of the Nationalist people at a time of great tension and stress, and he had the ability to articulate their feelings and aspirations with great dignity <Col N="1222" /> and moderation.  His contribution will be very greatly missed.</P>
    <P>I, personally, have lost an old friend whom I shall sadly miss.</P>
    <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, in the name of Dáil Éireann, to convey to the Papal Nuncio, His Excellency, the Most Reverend Dr. Emanuele Gerada, to the clergy and the people of the Archdiocese of Armagh and to Cardinal Ó Fiaich's family, an expression of our profound sympathy in their great loss.</P>

B'fhear lách, cineálta, léanta, é, go raibh clú agus cáil air, ní hamháin anseo, agus i dtuaisceart na tíre, ach ar Mór Roinn na hEorpa comh maith.

      <P>It is for his service to the Church he will be chiefly remembered.  This service brought him to the Primatal See of Armagh and to the presidency of the Irish Episcopal Conference.  He served at a difficult time, when the stress and tension and violence of life in the North imposed an additional burden on his office.  The Nationalists in the North not only looked on him as their spiritual leader, but as someone to guide them towards a peaceful and just solution.  I wish to offer the sympathy of my party to the clergy and laity of Armagh, and to Cardinal Ó Fiaich's family, relatives and friends.</P>

      <P>It was with great regret <Col N="1223" /> that the Labour Party learned of the untimely death of Cardinal Ó Fiaich yesterday. His departure has come as a great shock to all the people of this country. From the moment he was appointed Primate of All Ireland, he represented his people with diligence and with great warmth.  He tried at all times to see his role as a pastoral one in which he sought to reach out to everyone who was Irish.</P>
      <P>The times in which he lived ensured that his was often a turbulent and sometimes controversial task which he carried out with great determination.  He succeeded in holding the middle ground in often difficult circumstances and in maintaining contacts at every level throughout both communities in the North of Ireland.  The period in which Cardinal Ó Fiaich served will be remembered as one in which he sought to accommodate change while controlling the pace at which it occurred.</P>
      <P>Personally he will be remembered as a kindly, friendly and jovial man, blessed with the gift of friendship. On a personal note, he had been a friend of my late father and was very close to my family in Newry.  He was always anxious to maintain the Ulster connection.  On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to extend our deepest sympathy to his family and to all his friends throughout Ireland.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy De Rossa is unable to be here today and therefore I speak on behalf of The Workers' Party in expressing our deepest sympathy on the death of Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich.  His unexpected death came when he seemed to be at the height of his power.  He clearly led a very active life until his untimely death.  I met the Cardinal on a number of occasions but I knew him best when he was An tAthair Tomás Ó Fiaich in the late sixties. He had a very warm personality without pretensions or pompous attitudes.  He was most at home with ordinary people and had a taste for the simple pleasures of life.  He was clearly held in great affection by the members of his Church, both <Col N="1224" /> clergy and laity, but also enjoyed the respect of many others as the various tributes paid to him today have shown.</P>
      <P>As the spiritual leader of the largest Church in Ireland, Cardinal Ó Fiaich clearly occupied a position of great power and influence.  My party certainly disagreed with many of the views he expressed on Northern Ireland, social issues and other matters but all these views were genuinely held and were expressed without bitterness or rancour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the other party leaders in this House and with many people throughout the country in paying tribute to the late Cardinal Ó Fiaich and to express my sorrow and regret at his sudden and untimely death. Cardinal Ó Fiaich was a man of many parts.  He was a noted Irish scholar and also a fine historian, building up an enviable reputation in his days as a professor in Maynooth College and subsequently as president there.  He had the difficult task of presiding, as leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, over a decade which has seen immense tragedy, bitterness and division on this island and particularly in places like his own see of Armagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Cardinal was undoubtedly an outspoken Nationalist who always put his case directly, openly and honestly. Everybody knew where he stood but that is not to say that he was not sympathetic to differing views.  He was also very ecumenical in his outlook.  One had only to listen to the very warm tribute by his fellow primate.  Archbishop Eames, on RTE radio this morning to realise the <Col N="1225" /> esteem and affection which other Church leaders had for him.</P>
    <P>Cardinal Ó Fiaich was not a man to shirk stating his point of view clearly and this was sometimes a source of controversy. He was always direct and honest in his view.  One recalls, for instance, his acknowledgment that divorce legislation would have to come in this country although he felt the time would not be opportune until it could be introduced on an all-Ireland basis.  He was strongly criticised then but at all times he displayed a rugged honesty in defending his position.  Moreover, he always had the courage to speak out on issues like that.  He also sought to face up to the complex and difficult question of Nationalists in the North who gave electoral support to Sinn Féin, at all times making clear his outright condemnation of the terrorism campaign of the IRA.</P>
    <P>Cardinal Ó Fiaich will be a sad loss to the hierarchy.  Besides his scholarly and Church work, it was quite plain too that he was a man who quite simply enjoyed life.  Indeed one of the striking things from the pages of pictures of tribute to him in all this morning's papers is how many show him smiling broadly and simply enjoying himself, whether in Croke Park or at many other social functions. On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to express my sincere condolences to his family and to his fellow bishops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I heartily endorse the effort to tighten the law to limit the availability and in particular the use of offensive weapons such as knives.  From that point of view the approach adopted and the thinking behind that approach finds great favour with me.  I have no doubt that the ready availability of knives of all kinds is a cause for great concern.  I am very anxious to limit that availability and in particular to limit the carrying of such offensive weapons in public places.  I indicated in my earlier remarks how appalled I was to read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday the article outlining the ready availability of these knives, the broad range of such weapons and in particular the very cheap cost of such knives, running to as low as a couple of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say directly to the Minister that I am very much with him in his thinking here.  In the proposal as it is drafted at present I want to ensure that the new provision will result in good law and will not leave any openings for lawyers in defending people who carry these awful weapons.  From that point of view I am anxious that the Minister would deal with the following points.  The proposal is that a person who has with him in any public place a knife or any other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed shall be guilty of an offence.  Subsection (2) provides that it shall be a defence if the person so charged shows he has good reason for carrying such a weapon.  I <Col N="1227" /> wonder whether it is necessary to give some outline of what a good reason would be.  There is no such definition in the Bill.  Will it be a matter for the court to adjudicate or will it be left to the Garda Síochána or the DPP to decide what would be a good reason?  Another defence would be lawful authority. Again, there appears to be no definition of &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo; for carrying these knives in a public place and it is important that such a definition be given.</P>
    <P>The next subsection provides that it shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) to prove that he has the article with him for use at work or for a recreational purpose. The question that arises here is whether somebody who might use such a knife in the course of work, such as a fisherman, would be entitled to have the same knife in his possession in a public place, for instance, at a football match on Sunday. There is no definition of what is a recreational purpose.  Is this a loophole?  What has the Minister in mind in including this particular phraseology?  The House would wish to be satisfied about the points I have raised.  I emphasise I am not nit-picking.  I am anxious to ensure that the Minister's thinking, which I heartily endorse, results in good legislation appearing on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of the type of query that can arise.  I carry a penknife. I do not carry it for a work or recreational purpose; I normally use it to pare tobacco for my pipe.  Will I be guilty of an offence for carrying my penknife in my pocket from now on?  If that is the intention of the House, I will find some other way to pack my pipe.  It is important that law abiding people should be aware of the scope of the provision in this Bill as drafted.</P>
    <P>There is one further point on which I would like clarification.  The three new subsections, as far as I can see, will replace the existing subsection (1) because the proposal is to delete lines 31 to 42 on page 6 and also to delete lines 1 to 4 on page 7.  That means that the old subsections (2) and (3) still stand.  Is that <Col N="1228" /> the intention?  The old subsection (2) deals with any flick-knife.  Is it the intention that that provision will stand or is the intention that it would be covered by the new omnibus provision because, of course, any flick-knife would be covered by &ldquo;any knife or any other article which has a blade&rdquo;?  The amendments do not suggest that the existing subsections (2) and (3) be deleted.  Does the Minister intend letting subsections (2) and (3) stand?  If so &mdash; and this is a very minor point &mdash; they would need to be renumbered because we are including new subsections (1), (2) and (3).</P>
    <P>In the light of the fact that this is a new ministerial amendment on Report Stage, I am very much behind his thinking but this would need to be teased out further and explained more fully so that the House can be happy that the end result will be good law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome for the extension of this section.  It is very hard to define the difference between flick-knives and other types of knives. The Minister has acknowledged this by the example he quoted.  Unfortunately, certain people use knives to commit serious crime.  It is unfortunate that law abiding citizens are having their civil liberties curtailed because of these people, and we all regret that.  It would be very difficult to produce a Bill where certain knives are dangerous and others are not. All knives in the wrong hands are dangerous.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the general public the Minister should explain that traditionally certain groups use knives for recreational activities and for show pieces.  I am thinking particularly of the scouts, girl guides, etc.  Are they now to be prevented from carrying knives?  Are knives which are used to whittle away at pieces of wood to start camp fires, etc., to be banned? Another example was given by Deputy O'Keeffe of the fisherman who carries a knife to gut fish, to cut lines or to make adjustments to parts of boats, etc.  Will he be covered by this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one talks about being in possession in a public place, if one has a <Col N="1229" /> knife in a car, is that also regarded as carrying a knife personally?  If a person parks his car in a public place and there is a knife in the car does this section cover that area of activity?  One can throw things into the back of a car and find them months afterwards when looking for them.  Other people who use the car may leave something like a knife in it for whatever reason.  Does this section cover that? Also it would be useful for the general public to know what is meant by another article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed.  This could run into such a long list of articles that it would be difficult to know where it begins and ends. The Minister has a difficult task to cover all these offensive weapons but it would be useful for us all to be clear about where and when one can or cannot carry a knife and what other articles are to be regarded if he includes articles which have blades or are sharply pointed.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us so that we and the general public can be aware if we are committing an offence when we innocently bring one of these articles along with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment the Minister proposes to deal with possession of knives and other weapons of offence and injury.  The Minister and the House will recall that I argued very strongly on Second Stage for a movement in this direction perhaps further than the Minister has suggested, and on Committee Stage I had prepared an amendment to supplant the section in its entirety.  While the Minister has not taken on board everything I proposed at both those Stages, what is here is a vast improvement on what was originally intended in the Bill and for that reason I welcome it fully and support the amendment as it now stands and the section as it will be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated quite correctly that the areas and opportunities for the use of weapons such as knives are not confined to the multifarious areas indicated in the original section 9 &mdash; dance halls, dance marquees, discotheques etc. or other such public places <Col N="1230" />&mdash; and he referred to the tragic, unfortunate incident that occurred on O'Connell Bridge in our city when a young man was here on a visit to celebrate his intended wedding and his best man was brutally attacked and killed.  Therefore the areas of recourse to these weapons are not confined to places of recreation or resort as originally suggested.  It is correct that we try to address that.</P>
    <P>I believe another argument had to be addressed in the drafting of section 9. That was the complexity and virtual unworkability of the section as originally drafted from the point of view of the police officer seeking to enforce the section and the subsequent problems that might arise at a court hearing where the various loopholes could be worked on, exploited and developed in an attempt to evade conviction of any prosecution that would arise from an arrest under the Bill and the section.  The Minister has adopted a general proposition that in any public place the carrying of a knife, blade or other sharply pointed weapon will be an offence, and goes on to offer the two standing defences, one of good reason or lawful authority and the other the carrying of one such implement in the course of a person's useful work or recreational purposes.  The Minister has addressed the issues we have raised out of concern in maintaining the balance.</P>
    <P>I understand, though it is not explicitly made clear, that subsection (2) of the original section will stand in relation to the flick-knife and that it will become subsection (4) of the new section.  I suppose one must accept that the flick-knife is a particularly heinous and vicious implement worthy of its own considerations not only in policing but in prosecution and that there are greater penalties by way of trial on indictment at the election of the DPP relating to that implement should a prosecution occur.  It is difficult to argue with that, given the fact that the overall original approach has now been taken of simplifying in a straightforward proposition that the carrying of all weapons in a public place will be unlawful.</P>
    <P>I have to raise some question about the <Col N="1231" /> issue of &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  I raised this on Committee Stage and wondered why under the Bill the Minister sought to include a specific definition of it.  His amendment proposes to retain the original subsection (6) defining &ldquo;public place&rdquo;. I had suggested that that is a concept well and truly determined and defined under existing legislation by the Judiciary, and I raised by way of query whether there was a concern that by including a further definition of the concept we might be confusing already pretty clear lines of thought and idea on that concept.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to look at that issue in the course of the review for Report Stage?</P>
    <P>While throughout section 9 the Minister refers to offences of a person having with him &mdash; or her for that matter &mdash; a weapon of offence, is he satisfied that is an adequate concept?  Should the section cover &ldquo;possession or control&rdquo;, the wording used usually in dealing with this area? In the area of firearms the Legislature has previously provided for the concept of not only immediate possession but of control.  Take the simplistic idea of the hardened leader of a gang looking to a fall guy or junior member of a mob or gang to carry the weapon.  In the current wording of the section it would not cover a gang leader for whose purposes the weapon is being carried or conveyed to or from the scene of a crime.  The wording here is &ldquo;with him in any public place&rdquo;.  Is that adequate to deal with all the eventualities that could arise?  Perhaps we should use wording as I suggested in the original amendment of a person &ldquo;having in his possession or under his control in any public place a weapon of offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister has done here.  It is a good development and means we will have more effective, much more easily employed legislation once this amendment is put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last point the Deputy made, rather than the wording he suggests we believe the wording that is here &mdash; having the article &ldquo;with <Col N="1232" /> him&rdquo;&mdash; is broader than &ldquo;under his possession and control&rdquo; and will be more effective to achieve what everybody in this House wants to achieve.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their welcome for this amendment.  Obviously, the amendment is not intended to interfere with the pipe-smoking activities of Deputy O'Keeffe or the boy scouts or girl guides or anything of that nature.  That is covered by &ldquo;good reason or lawful authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;for use at work or for a recreational purpose&rdquo;.  Common sense has to prevail in the operation of this and I have no doubt that will be the way the Garda will approach it.</P>
      <P>There is a heavier penalty for having a flick-knife and that is why it is dealt with separately from the others.  In this context, &ldquo;car&rdquo; is regarded as a public place. Regarding why there is not a list of articles, we felt that rather than having a list we would just cover &ldquo;other articles&rdquo; as such.  We want this as broad as possible. There is nothing in Deputy McCartan's point about the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  He seemed to be saying there is a general judgment rule of what &ldquo;public place&rdquo; means in a statute.  He will be aware there is nothing of the kind.  As he said, there is a definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo; in section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 which provides that: &ldquo; `public place' means any street, road or other place to which the public may have access with vehicles, whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge' &rdquo;.  That is not what is wanted in section 9 of the Bill we are discussing here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say to the Deputies that the intention is as outlined in my opening remarks, to come to grips with the problems we have had in our streets and the prevention of the use of knives which has resulted in death and injury, and not just knives but other articles which have been altered in such a way as to have a lethal or very harmful effect.  I believe that as we have drafted it here, it gets to what this House wants to achieve and in its operation, as in the operation of all legislation, common sense will have to prevail.  It is not intended, nor will it ever be, to prevent <Col N="1233" /> decent people going about their work or smoking a pipe.</P>

I take it from the nod from the official that it is not necessary.  Some of the numberings in the subsection will also have to be changed.

      <P>I move amendment No 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 40, after &ldquo;train,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;aircraft,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this amendment in the light of some concerns I have about the definition of &ldquo;public place&rdquo;.  Obviously I want to ensure again that no loopholes will be available for thugs and criminals carryings offensive weapons.  I tabled the amendment on the basis of including aircraft, but let me make a point.  I wonder whether we are wise to provide for a public place in the way the provision is now drafted, whether the approach should be to include any place other than a person's residence or place of work and define the situation the other way round. If, say, a robber has gained access to the house of another person and is in possession of offensive weapons; he has not committed any offence other than gaining access to the House, and some vigilant member of the Garda Síochána <Col N="1234" /> arrests him on the spot it could be said that at that stage he was not in a public place although he may have been in possession of a flick knife or some other offensive weapon.  Are we leaving a loophole in the Bill which will permit such a person to escape?  Will his lawyer be able to argue that he was not in a public place if he was found in a private house?  The provision is drafted on the basis that the offence arises when the offender is in a public place.  I should like to ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the point I have raised is broader than my original amendment in which I sought to ensure that when there was a reference to a train or a vehicle used for the carriage of persons for reward an aircraft should be included. I am concerned about an aircraft because of the danger of a person being found in possession of an offensive weapon during a flight.  Such a person would be a greater danger to the passengers of the aircraft than a person found in possession of a similar weapon on a train.  There is a danger of hijacking an aircraft.  There is a need to cover aircraft and we must ensure that we are not leaving a loophole by leaving the definition as it is in the Bill.  We should ensure that a person who is found in a house with nefarious intent will not be able to plead successfully that he was not in a public place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that the Deputy's concern about aircraft is covered as far as international flights are concerned, but I wonder if domestic flights are covered.  We must bear in mind that a person boarding an aircraft may have a knife in his or her possession, or in their luggage, with the intention of using it on some sporting activities and I wonder if that will be considered an illegal act under the Bill.  It is my understanding that incidents that occur on aircraft are covered by international aviation agreements.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised the point about a thug entering a person's home carrying a knife and asked if he could argue that he was not in a public <Col N="1235" /> place.  I should like to tell him that section 10 covers trespassing with a knife, weapon or other article.  In relation to the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Keeffe, I should like to say that the effect of it would be that the Bill would provide that it would be an offence for a person to have with him on an aircraft any article intended by him unlawfully to cause injury or to incapacitate or intimidate another person.  The amendment is unnecessary given that section 19 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, already makes an offence the conduct at which this amendment is directed.</P>
      <P>That section provides <i>inter alia</i> that it is an offence for a person on an aircraft to be in possession, without lawful authority, of any article which is made or adapted for causing injury to or incapacitating a person, or for damaging or destroying any property, or which is intended by the person on whose possession it is for such purpose.  Even if an amendment of this nature was thought necessary it would be more appropriate to deal with it in terms of the Air Navigation and Transport Act which is a body of legislation specific of the particular problem that arises in relation to aircraft and airport security and not in a general criminal Bill.  The offence referred to by the Deputy is covered in the 1988 Act.  I should like to tell Deputy Kavanagh that commuter and domestic flights are covered.</P>

I am sure that the Air Navigation and Transport Act does not have a definition in the same terms.  However, the definition in that Act, which refers to a person who has possession of an article which may cause damage to a person, may cover my point.

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where a member of the Garda Síochána decides to search a person under this section, he may require the person to accompany him to a Garda station or to a temporary Garda centre or Garda booth for the purpose of being so searched at that station, centre or booth.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> Earlier I expressed my concern about the power of the Garda Síochána to search a person suspected of an offence.  My concern was that the power in the Bill was not sufficiently wide and, in particular, that the Garda did not have the power to bring a suspected person to a Garda station or, in certain circumstances to a temporary Garda centre for the purpose of being searched.  I understood from the Minister that he would consider the points I raised on Committee Stage and I had hoped that he would table an amendment along the lines I had suggested.  This point was brought to my attention by a senior member of the Garda Sióchána who felt that while the power to search was included there was no power to require a suspected person in such circumstances to accompany a garda to a Garda station for the purpose of being searched.  He pointed out that 15,000 to 20,000 people might be present at a rock concert while the Garda deployment for such an event would be relatively small.  He then suggested that circumstances could arise in which there was a suspicion that an offensive weapon had been used to inflict injury or that someone was in possession of an offensive weapon and that it might not be prudent or practical for the Garda to use their power of search at that place. The concern is that if suspicion has fallen on a particular group there might only be a handful of gardaí available in the area to deal with the matter.  In that case it was felt that the wise and prudent course would be for the gardaí to require the suspected person to come to the nearest Garda station or &mdash; if the incident occurred in a remote area where a rock concert was being held &mdash; to the temporary Garda centre which is normally provided in such places.</P>
    <P>To some degree this amendment takes on board the point raised in Deputy McCartan's amendment in which he referred to having regard for the privacy and bodily integrity of the person being searched.  I can understand that in some instances, from every point of view, it might be better that such searches should not take place in front of the general <Col N="1238" /> public.  The senior Garda officer also mentioned that many types of weapons can easily be concealed next to the body which would not be visible from a visual inspection and which might require a more detailed search to detect them. From that point of view, the provision I propose gives extra power to the gardaí which might be necessary in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is a precedent for such power to be given to the Garda in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984.  My amendment is modelled on that precedent where power was given to a member of the Garda Síochána to require a suspected person to accompany him to a Garda station for the purpose of being searched.  It would be a useful addition to the Bill and unless the Minister can advance reasons to the contrary, I strongly urge him to give this additional power to the gardaí.  The member of the Garda to whom I spoke is experienced in these matters and he was concerned that the Garda's hands might be tied in certain circumstances in relation to a search which is provided for in this section.</P>
    <P>Another senior member of the Garda Síochána raised the question of whether the section as drafted at present would cover a suspected person fleeing the scene and being apprehended perhaps a considerable distance from the place where the incident occurred.  He wanted to know if the section empowered the gardaí in that other place to make the search without warrant.  I have checked the section very carefully and it probably does but I should like the Minister's assurances in this regard.  Subsection (1) specifically refers to a breach of the peace occurring, or a member of the Garda Síochána having reasonable grounds for believing that a breach of the peace might occur in that place.  The concern is whether the consequential power of search without warrant applies only in the place where the breach of the peace occurred or where it was reasonably suspected it might occur.  The senior member of the Garda Síochána, to whom I referred, was concerned that the Garda having pursued the suspect a considerable distance, <Col N="1239" /> would be able to search him without warrant in the other place.  I strongly suggest that my proposal in relation to the additional subsection should be included.  As I said, it is included in the Misuse of Drugs Act and there is no reason for the same power not being included in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on amendment No. 8.  The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would look at this matter to see what could be done in relation to a &ldquo;half-way house&rdquo; suggestion.  As the Minister has not tabled an amendment I presume he intends to leave the section as originally drafted.  In the Official Report, column 1790, of 7 March 1990, the Minister said that all that a garda would be required to do would be to frisk the person, which could be done in seconds, since the type of dangerous article which the Garda would be looking for would be easy to detect.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that a skilful and devious person will have no difficulty concealing any weapon which would not be found by mere frisking.  It involves not just concealment on the body or in clothing but in any article that the person might be carrying, such as a bag or brief case or &mdash; in these 007 situations &mdash; the umbrella or the walking stick with a sword or a knife concealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the section as drafted give the Garda enough powers to deal with every eventuality?  I do not think so.  The garda must have, in addition to simple powers of arrest where he or she reasonably suspects an offence has been committed, the power also to detain for a reasonable period of time in such a place as is necesary to fully investigate the matter.  The Minister suggested that there was such a power of arrest without warrant for offences under sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill.  Arrest can only take place where an officer has a reasonable suspicion that an offence has been committed.  Mere suspicion or intuition that a person in a group or someone on his own might be <Col N="1240" /> carrying a weapon is not enough to warrant an arrest.  Indeed, if a weapon was ultimately found the entire prosecution could fall or be frustrated if the officer could not show initial reasonable suspicion for the arrest.  In addition to the power of arrest, a garda should have the right to detain a suspect for the purposes of carrying out a search if he believes he is carrying a weapon against the law.</P>
    <P>There is a need to expand the powers provided in section 16.  I am surprised at how often the needs of the Garda in this regard are overlooked in various amending legislation.  I recall that when the Government were promoting the Bill to give powers to customs and excise officers to carry out searches for drugs an intervention by myself and other Members drew attention to the fact that we were not giving them adequate powers to detain people for the purposes of carrying out a search.  When the legislation to deal with detectors and the invasion of places of archaeological and architectural importance, national monuments, etc., was being discussed we again raised the point that the needs of the Garda were being overlooked.  When we were discussing the legislation dealing with trespassers on railway lines we again referred to the need to give the Garda powers of arrest, a point which was acceded to.  This is another example where the Minister is not looking at the legislation from the point of view of the Garda and the powers they need in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>The second part of my amendment recognises the important point that searches can often be of an intimate nature and may involve very close scrutiny of the clothing and/or the body of the person being detained.  There is a need to ensure that there is no infringement of the general regard a male officer should have for a female member of the public or <i>vice versa</i>.  Regard should be had for the dignity of an individual and there should be no undue infringement of the sexual dignity of the person being searched.  If a female member of the Garda confronts a male member of the <Col N="1241" /> public, or <i>vice versa,</i> it is equally important that he or she should have the power to bring that person to a Garda station or some other location where the search can be carried out by a member of the same sex.  As I have said, such searches can involve close scrutiny of the body and/or the clothing of a person being searched.  Such searches should not be carried out in public, in a hall, a doorway or on a busy street.  In those circumstances a garda should be able to bring the person to a Garda car or Garda station where the search could be carried out.  My amendment takes account of the powers an officer may need in certain circumstances.  The Minister should have had more regard to these issues, as he promised to do between Committee and Report Stages.  The amendment proposed by Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan is equally acceptable if my amendment is not accepted.  However, I should like the Minister to accept my amendment because it deals with the respect, privacy and integrity of a person, which should be provided for.</P>

    <P>I see great merit in these amendments because on rare, and I hope very exceptional, occasions it may be necessary to set up a booth to search, for example, a crowd of hooligans who may visit this country for a football match &mdash; I am not saying our football supporters are very well behaved &mdash; and to detain such people for quite a long period while the search is being carried out.  The proposal in paragraph (4) of amendment No. 8 is somewhat different from the proposal in paragraph (4) of amendment No. 7.  It may take a reasonable time to carry out such a search and, therefore, such a provision should be included in the Bill.  It may not just be a question of frisking someone who has a knife; there may be <Col N="1242" /> a number of people involved and it could take a long time to carry out a search.  If Deputy McCartan's amendment is accepted it will be an addition to the Bill, and would certainly be acceptable to me. I think it is fair to say all of us accept that searches on women should be carried out by women and, where possible, searches on men should be carried out by men. The acceptance of Deputy McCartan's amendment would be an addition to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to say &mdash; and I am not being in any way controversial &mdash; that I regret Deputy McCartan's approach. Just because I have not accepted all the points made on Committee Stage does not mean I have not given deep regard to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Deputy suggested.  I tried to take on board the points made on Committee Stage which I could accept and that is why I introduced the major amendment in relation to public places.  I want to assure the House that I listened very carefully to the Deputies on Committee Stage and I tried as far as I possibly could to take on board the points which will improve the Bill.  I can assure the Deputies that the points I could not accept, including these points, were given very careful consideration.</P>
      <P>I appreciate why the Deputies put down these amendments.  While I am just as concerned as they are that the Garda should have adequate powers to search persons who may be carrying offensive weapons I cannot accept the amendments. There is a number of reasons for this which I want to outline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, I do not believe there is any necessity to provide a garda with powers to take a person to a Garda station or otherwise detain him simply for the purpose of searching him for an offensive weapon. All a garda would need to do in those circumstances would be to &ldquo;frisk&rdquo; a <Col N="1243" /> person.  This can be done in seconds, since the type of dangerous article which a garda would be looking for would, in the normal course, be easy to detect. After all, it would be unlikely that &ldquo;frisking&rdquo; would not reveal a knife or any other type of weapon which could be used against another person.  Furthermore, there is already a power of arrest without warrant for an offence under sections 9, 10 and 11 which could be used in an appropriate case, for example, where a person refused to allow himself to be frisked.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would be opposed to any attempt to make additional provision in legislation for searches of persons which would involve anything more than frisking outside of a regular Garda station. This is because where full searches are carried out it is vital that proper procedures and safeguards be provided in the interests of both persons concerned and the gardaí who may be the subject of complaint about the way in which the search was conducted.  Such procedures and safeguards operate where searches are carried out in Garda stations by virtue of the Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Stations Regulations, 1987.  It would not be practicable to apply those regulations to searches conducted away from Garda stations, whether in temporary Garda booths or otherwise.  For example Deputy McCartan referred to a search being conducted in a Garda car.  I genuinely do not think that would meet with universal approval; it could lead to all sorts of allegations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first part of Deputy McCartan's amendment, the position is that the power to detain a person for a reasonable time in order to conduct a search is inherent in the search power itself.  What would be deemed to be a reasonable time would have to be determined in the context of the type of search provided for in the section, generally a superficial frisking.  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's amendment, I should say the Garda are constantly required to observe the conditions set out <Col N="1244" /> and a further provision in this regard is not necessary.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have given I must oppose the amendments.  A number of other points were made.  With regard to the point made by Deputy O'Keeffe in relation to somebody fleeing from arrest, I should say that, if an individual flees, he can be arrested on suspicion under the provisions of section 14; after arrest he can then be searched in the normal way.</P>
    <P>On the general question of frisking not always being good enough, we must endeavour to keep a sense of proportion here &mdash; the vast bulk of dangerous weapons are bulky although certainly a razor blade strapped to the leg might not be detected.  However, in a crowd people might escape detection in any event.  I want to emphasise that if there is reasonable suspicion that a person has a weapon, he can be arrested and thoroughly searched.  We must be careful that whatever powers we give do not lead to circumstances in which there can be full body searches carried out, other than frisking, which might interfere with the integrity of the person and so on.  Those are not powers to be given lightly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisifed with the Minister's reply.  I must point out that the issue has been raised with me by a superintendent of the Garda Sióchána, somebody who is involved in the front line of the battle against crime.  He feels there is a need for such greater power to be given to the Garda in connection with a search.  I must take note of the views of somebody who has the experience of dealing with these matters on the ground. The Minister indicates that, in most circumstances, what we are talking about is frisking which would take place in a matter of seconds.  This superintendent has pointed out to me that an offensive weapon could be such that it would be easily concealed next to the body, would not be detected either by a visual inspection or frisking procedure.  He makes the point that if such weapons were being concealed a more thorough search would be imperative, that the Garda have not the power to bring such a suspected <Col N="1245" /> person to a Garda station for that purpose. He asked me specifically to ensure that that power be included.</P>
      <P>Quite frankly, the superintendent has an excellent case; he is the type of person who must deal with such circumstances. It was he who raised with me the problem of the temporary Garda booth.  He pointed out that, in certain circumstances, there can be large numbers of people attending functions, such as rock concerts, which can be held in fields or other locations a considerable number of miles from the nearest Garda station. He mentioned that there can be, say, 15,000 to 20,000 people attending such functions.  I cannot speak from personal experience in this regard.  Deputy McCartan may be able to confirm, from his experience, that very large numbers of people attend these rock concerts.  The same superintendent points out the difficulty of traffic congestion on adjacent roads, obviously with such huge numbers of people in the immediate vicinity.  In those circumstances &mdash; even if the Garda had power to bring a suspect to the nearest station &mdash; it might take a very long time.  He mentioned that the normal procedure, in such circumstances, is for a Garda centre to be erected near the function.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the point raised by the Minister, that it might cause a problem for the Garda in having a more thorough search carried on in such a temporary Garda centre or indeed in the nearest Garda station.  I must stress that it is the Garda themselves who have raised this issue with me.</P>

      <P>It would not be fair to mention the name of the superintendent. I accept that it is a superintendent who has written at length on this issue, somebody who has had practical experience of dealing with this type of problem, who is an expert.  We talk about these problems; he must deal with them.</P>
      <P>I come now to the major leg of my argument which is that this power is included in the Misuse of Drugs Act, obviously for a specific purpose or reason.  Presumably it was included because it was felt necessary to give the Garda power under that Act.  With that precedent in existence, with the obvious need to have had it included in that Act, surely if we are serious about tightening up this Bill, giving the full and necessary powers to the Garda to operate its provisions effectively, the same provision should be included in this Bill.  I cannot understand the Minister's attitude on this point.  All Members of the House are of the one mind, that we want a Bill as watertight as possible, without loopholes, one that will give adequate powers to the Garda to operate its provisions effectively. Although there is the precedent to which I referred the Minister refuses, as it were, to translate that precedent into this Bill.</P>
      <P>On that basis I must urge the Minister to come along with me.  If he cannot see his way to so doing, then I want to indicate the strength of my view by insisting on having a vote on the issue.</P>

That is fully evident by the amendments which were made to the Bill, some of which were suggested and some of which were influenced by Deputies from all sides.  We now have a useful and practical Bill which will strengthen the hand of the Garda in dealing with those who carry weapons illegally or for use for criminal purposes. I sincerely hope that the provisions of the Bill will help to curtail crimes of violence and the carrying of knives and other dangerous implements by young persons for reasons of bravado.</P>
      <P>As the Bill was initiated in the Seanad it will be necessary for me to bring it back to that House to deal with the significant and worthwhile amendments which were made in the course of its passage here.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) The Board shall each year present a full set of accounts in respect of ventures established under this section to the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, which shall in turn respect their confidentiality if requested to do so.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment amends the section which deals with the establishment of subsidiaries by Bord na Móna.  In this amendment I am seeking that the subsidiaries they would establish should present a full set of accounts each year, <Col N="1251" /> in respect of these ventures, to the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, which shall in turn respect their confidentiality, if requested to do so.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister gave assurances that he has power to instruct Bord na Móna as to the format of their accounts, but in my view it is of little value that we have the assurance that the Minister has such powers, if he does not exercise them and give the Dáil and the public at large the opportunity to examine the performance of these new ventures which Bord na Móna would enter into.  On Committee Stage I suggested that there should be an open-ended obligation to publish accounts and the Minister pointed out there could be a commercial difficulty in requiring Bord na Móna to publish accounts in respect of their ventures while a commercial competitor would not have such an obligation. As a result, I have modified the proposal so that it would be the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies which would receive the accounts and as in all of the work of that committee they would respect the confidentiality of those accounts, if they were requested to do so.  It is important that the representatives of the public in the Dáil get access to the performance of these companies.</P>
    <P>It seems that I am in complete disagreement with the Minister on this matter.  Throughout the Bill, the Minister has sought to limit the rights of Bord na Móna to do all sorts of things, insisting that they get duplicate sanction from the Minister for Finance and from himself before they do the most trivial things.  At the very same time he is insisting that both he and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, crawl all over the company in their smallest plans but he is insisting on denying the Dáil the right to see how they are performing.  My view is that we should be courageous enough and confident enough in the boards of State companies to say to them they are responsible for running the show but they must be judged on their results.  That means there <Col N="1252" /> is a much greater emphasis on accountability and less emphasis on bureaucratic sanctions which the Minister has enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have moved this amendment in the hope that the Minister will give to the Dáil and the committee the right to examine the accounts of the new ventures that Bord na Móna should enter into.  The existing Companies Act, 1986, would not give the joint committee that access and the Minister's reference to the Companies Act on Committee Stage did not resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies get greater authority to become involved in the scrutiny of companies and their performance than they have had in the past.  It has been a matter of very great concern to me that this Minister and his predecessors have refused to allow the INPC, the company involved in the oil industry, appear before the committee for what I believe were spurious reasons. It is important, therefore, that the committee get certain statutory rights to see the performance of companies and get access to how ventures are going so that members of the committee can execute their duty to the House.  The Minister's own party has been strong in their advocacy of reform of the way the Dáil operates and I hope he will take this proposal in the spirit it is intended, which is seeking to get access to what is their rights for an important committee of the Oireachtas, that is to examine the financial accounts and performance of State companies. That is their mandate and this amendment is only endorsing that existing mandate.</P>

      <P>There was a specific suggestion that my reasons for withholding permission from the INPC to appear before the committee were based on spurious grounds, when I had given the committee full information that they are based on the advice of the Attorney General and I feel duty bound, as a member of the Government, to accept the Attorney General's advice in a matter of this kind.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment that has been proposed, as I have already informed the House there is adequate provision existing which would satisfy the Deputy's concerns in this area.  The statutory framework outlined in section 59 (1) of the 1946 Act enables the Minister to direct Bord na Móna as to the form of their accounts.  Furthermore, under the provisions of section 2 (6) of this Bill the power of the board to establish ventures is subject to the consent of the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance therefore, if it was considered necessary, suitable conditions concerning the accounts of any such venture could be attached to this approval.  On Committee Stage I said that I would be happy to exercise my powers under the 1946 Act to ensure that the accounts, as presented, will show the performance of each division of Bord na Móna and each of their subsidiary companies should any be formed under these new powers, which of course, are, being introduced in this Bill for the purpose of extending the functions and opportunities available to Bord na Móna.  They are certainly not to restrict the operations of Bord na Móna as has been somehow suggested by the Deputy.  In any event, I do not think it would be appropriate that the powers of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies should be limited by the type of provision suggested in the amendment and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>There is no suggestion that the powers of the committee are being in any way limited by this amendment. This amendment provides purely that the committee would be given access <Col N="1255" /> to accounts.  That is written into the committee's standing orders.  The Minister is inaccurate in saying this would in any way infringe on the rights of the committee. The committee have adopted this as a practice.</P>
      <P>I am reassured to hear that the Minister will use his powers to provide that accounts will be published for each of the ventures.  Contrary to what he suggested in his reply a moment ago, he indicated on Committee Stage that he would not use that power because he felt that in some instances the commercial confidentiality of Bord na Móna would be infringed.  It was for that purpose that I sought to have the publication restricted, if necessary, to the Oireachtas committee. I am glad to learn the Minister has gone back on his position on Committee Stage and I look forward to him making such an order.  I hope the Minister will not quietly forget about his undertaking here tonight and that those accounts will be available in the way in which he has said.  The Committee Stage debate suggested that his thinking was otherwise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4. &mdash;(1)  The Board shall transfer to such sub-boards the assets, valued according to their audited worth to the Board, necessary to execute the delegated function, along with such liabilities determined by its auditors to be supportable by that sub-board operating at optimum efficiency.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any surplus of borrowing after the auditors have settled the levels supportable by sub-boards, shall be carried by the Board.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Board shall apply to the service of these borrowings&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  dividends remitted by the sub-boards,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> (b)  the product of a levy as shall be set from time to time by the Board on peat extracted by the sub-boards from the bogs, and</P>
    <P>(c)  an appropriation as shall be set from time to time by the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about the restructuring of Bord na Móna and expanding their capacities to do certain things.  The Bill was introduced in November 1988.  I think Deputies on this side of the House are totally frustrated at the way in which this Bill is proceeding, in a complete vacuum from the reality that is facing Bord na Móna.  Since this Bill was first mooted two reports have been commissioned by the Minister, neither of which has been presented to the Dáil and in the case of both, the Minister has refused to give any information as to what is recommended by those commissions as regards restructuring of the company. This is the enabling legislation which would permit restructuring and yet we are denied any access to the sort of advice the Minister is receiving.</P>
    <P>We have been unable to see the March 1989 accounts of Bord na Móna, which at this stage, are long overdue.  However, we have read very substantive rumours in the newspapers as to the true nature of those accounts, the fact that there was one very bad year and that the company's debts are now higher than the stated value of their assets.  The crucial issue facing Bord na Móna is the restructuring of their capital base in such a way that the companies and the sub-boards about which we are talking can perform effectively. They cannot perform commercially with the debt in which they now find themselves.  I find it totally frustrating to be debating a Bill that is supposed to be about restructuring Bord na Móna and about finding new opportunities and new ventures for the board while at the same time we are denied any inkling as to what the Minister intends in this regard.</P>
    <P>What I have proposed in this amendment is essentially similar to the format <Col N="1257" /> devised for NET when they found themselves in difficulties, with borrowings outrunning the value of their assets, that is to provide for a holding company to which the portion of the debt that could not be borne by the various divisions of the operation would go.  The operating divisions or sub-boards would only have such debt as is deemed supportable by them when operating at optimum efficiency.  That was the procedure not only adopted in the case of NET but also advocated in 1984 by the National Planning Board in their report which dealt with State companies.  They recognised that some of these companies would not be able to recover or grow of their own accord because of the overhang of debt.  I have made an attempt here to provide a statutory vehicle which would permit this recommended type of dealing with a company that got into difficulty and this was the format recommended by that board.  I have not seen any other analysis comparable to that done by the board of the problems of State companies, and I think this is one very worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said the Government have sufficient legislation at their disposal to deal with the difficulties of Bord na Móna and that he did not think new legislation was necessary. However, I would draw his attention to the remarks of his party colleague, Deputy Pat O'Malley, on Second Stage in November 1988 in which he was at pains to point out that this legislation was a totally inadequate vehicle for the task that confronted Bord na Móna.  He believed there was a need for a completely new framework within which the company could compete and grow.  He advocated that such a legal framework be adopted and was bitterly opposed to the Bill as presented.  Now his colleague has an opportunity to provide the statutory framework asked for by his party and is falling back on Fianna Fáil's inadequate Bill as underlined by his colleague at the time.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to gel all these positions that are being taken.  On this side of the House we are genuinely trying <Col N="1258" /> to grapple with problems in Bord na Móna, problems which are very deep and very real and must be confronted.  The company have performed remarkably well in the last two or three years.  They have done wonders with their operations and are now trading profitably again. Their workers have made sacrifices in restructuring their operations that are hardly equalled in any other State body. Yet, as the elected representatives debating the affairs of Bord na Móna, we are left in the dark and are putting through legislation without knowing what is going on.  I hope the Minister will take this format which has a very respectable pedigree as one that would deal with the problems of Bord na Móna.  It provides for a holding company to which the surplus debt could be removed from the operating divisions and it would give the horticultural peat division, the milled peat division and so on, a chance to perform commercially and trade successfully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the situation in Bord na Móna presents a difficult problem for the Government, a problem which I have inherited.  I agree with the Deputy's remarks in regard to the efforts that have been made by the management and board of Bord na Móna and also the workforce to come to terms with the financial difficulties the company have been confronted with for some time past.  This whole matter is at present being comprehensively reviewed and I am not yet in a position to make a statement about the financial position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No decisions have yet been made by Government as to how the matter will be dealt with.  I commented on this issue on Committee Stage and earlier and assured the House that the future of Bord na Móna is a matter of very grave concern to me.  I am satisfied that the proposals contained in this legislation will be of great assistance to the board to help them to develop along strong commercial lines in the future in the division into three separate divisions and also in the additional powers that are being given to the <Col N="1259" /> company to extend their operations at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the future financing of the board and what decisions the Government have to make will occupy some further time before final decisions can be made.  I am not in a position to say any more about that at present.</P>
    <P>I do not envisage that this amendment would make any great contribution in trying to find a solution to the difficulties with which we are confronted.  The provision for the setting up of sub-boards within Bord na Móna is designed to give the board maximum flexibility in carrying out their functions.  The purpose of these sub-boards may be to operate the separate divisions, to which I have referred, or to examine specific proposals on behalf of the main board.  In the event that any division of the board was to be established as a separate subsidiary company &mdash; which seems to be what Deputy Bruton has in mind &mdash; then they would require to provide separate accounts.</P>
    <P>The intention of the Bill is to open up commercial opportunities for Bord na Móna and the amendment would have the opposite effect by imposing rigid statutory restrictions on these sub-boards. The division and transfer of the assets is not the intention.  The board shall, by their legal instrument, delegate functions so that the sub-board may act as if it were the board, to the limit of that delegated authority.  It is not the intention to break up or apportion the assets.  That would have far-reaching legal and accounting consequences.</P>
    <P>The effect of subsection (2) of the amendment would, in practice, delegate to the auditors of Bord na Móna capital decisions in relation to the apportionment of the board's resources.  This is a function of the board and the involvement of the auditors as proposed in the amendment is unacceptable.  The amendment introduces unnecessary statutory restrictions on the board, severely constraints their flexibility and is contrary to the very intention of the Bill.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on some of the points raised by the Minister.  I contest the view that a system whereby the various divisions of Bord na Móna were relieved of debts beyond their capacity would not help their success. The only hope for the divisions of Bord na Móna is if they have a capital base from which they can profitably grow and trade.  A provision such as a holding company that would take away the excess debt will become inevitable in some shape or form.  The Minister is being somewhat disingenuous to suggest that my amendment would restrict or impinge on the freedom of the board.  Essentially what is involved is allowing the companies to have only that portion of the debt that they can support when operating at optimum efficiency imposed upon them and that they would not carry a debt that would drag them down despite their very successful trading.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that the amendment was giving to the auditors powers that should be rightly executed by the board.  However, I do not agree that that is the case because the amendment provides that the board shall transfer the assets valued according to their audited worth.  I do not know what other system can be adopted for apportioning assets other than getting their audited worth.  It does not in any way restrict the board in their duties.  All this legislation is asking is that the board apportion assets among the different divisions.</P>
      <P>The role of the auditors is simply to provide the information on which the board would make their decisions.  If the Minister was seriously concerned about the phraseology, I am sure he could amend it to meet his requirements to ensure that it was the board that were making the decisions and the auditors were providing them with the information necessary to make those decisions in a fair and objective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this legislation, if it is to mean anything, is that Bord na Móna will, in future, have a number of different subsidiary companies.  That is what is stated in the Bill.  If they form a number <Col N="1261" /> of different subsidiary companies, including some of their existing divisions, of necessity those companies will need to have some assets apportioned to them.  I would have thought that, as night follows day, that is what would happen.  This amendment is not breaking new ground in talking about apportioning assets as the Minister seems to suggest; it is just putting forward one approach to do this.</P>
    <P>I do not want to force to a vote an amendment of this kind in a way that would be divisive because obviously the Minister is studying the difficulties faced by Bord na Móna.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously a format of this nature as one which would deal successfully with the board's difficulties. Unless a formula for some new capital restructuring is found by the Minister, Bord na Móna, despite their successful current trading in a very difficult market for an energy producing company with low fuel prices, will be in serious difficulties in the coming years.  I will not press this amendment because I believe the Minister is acting in good faith and is comprehensively reviewing the position. I hope he will understand the frustration on this side of the House that after two commissioned reports by the Minister, 14 months after the crux year for Bord na Móna, we are no closer to having solid proposals from the Government to deal with the problems.  That is very unsatisfactory for Bord na Móna.</P>

In view of that I will give the Minister a period to come up with a response and I hope he will consider favourably a vehicle such as the one I am suggesting.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 6, to delete &ldquo;the Minister for Finance&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;where the value of the capital funds committed, or the value of any long-term contracts entered into by the Board exceed £10 million, shall be subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Essentially the purpose of this amendment is to do what I think the Minister is keen to do, that is, to give Bord na Móna greater flexibility.  If we want companies behaving commercially we must be willing to give them a commercial mandate and judge them by the results.  I am trying to provide that the requirement for sanction from both the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance should be diluted in this Bill.  The duplicate sanction by the Minister for Finance as well as the Minister for Energy should be removed except where the value of expenditure undertaken by the board exceeds £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a board were raising new borrowings the Minister would like to be consulted if he were offering guarantees on those borrowings, but I understand the Minister for Finance has powers already, where new borrowings are being entered into by the company, to withhold his consent if he wishes, but where the board are using their own retained earnings or raising their own borrowings without a ministerial guarantee I do not see that the Minister for Finance should be brought into this as well as the Minister here today.  I am not requiring the dropping of ministerial sanction, but I am asking that it be just the Minister for Energy, who is examining the affairs of the company on a day-to-day basis, to be consulted about sanction.  In my view for the Department of Finance to have a role in respect of small sums of money would not be helpful.  The Department have <Col N="1263" /> already offered to all companies and all public bodies guidelines as to how projects should be assessed and they provide a headline for companies like Bord na Móna as to how they assess investments. The Minister for Finance should not be crawling all over a company in their intentions.</P>
    <P>In section 8 the Minister has provided for extraordinarily detailed consent procedures on very minor elements of the board's business.  On Committee Stage the Minister took a few rather trivial elements of the dual sanction procedure away in respect of overseas operations of the company, but still any decisions by Bord na Móna within the State regarding non-peat research have to get consent from both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Energy, regardless of how small the expenditure.  The purchase of any business, even a small stretch of bog, as I understand from reading this Bill, would require consent from both this Minister and the Minister for Finance. Any decision to develop a cutaway bog for a new commercial purpose, even if it complied with the Minister's directives with regard to policy, would still require his personal consent and the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Any joint venture again would require that dual consent.  Outside the State even more operations are brought into the requirement of all these consent procedures. We are ending up in a position where very trivial decisons &mdash; not trivial from the point of view of Bord na Móna but trivial from the point of view of the Minister for Finance and all his huge Department &mdash; are going to be kicked back to his Department where they can be potentially sat upon for weeks, months and years before a final sanction goes through.  The Minister here should have a little more confidence in his own board whom he appoints to run Bord na Móna and in his own ability to assess what they are doing, and cut out the Minister for Finance's role in some shape or form from the present proposal.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I have suggested that the figure of £10 million be used as <Col N="1264" /> a cut-off point.  The Minister may come forward with some better way of avoiding excessive bureaucratic control over Bord na Móna, and if he can suggest some way in which that be done I will be very happy to see it done, but the Bill as now framed is far too bureaucratic, and the Bill that ostensibly tried to give a company rights to establish new businesses and become more commercial is ending up having civil servants from both the Departments of Finance and Energy involved in the most minor of commercial decisions by the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the amendment is seeking to restrict the Minister's powers as regards the board?  Is it not true also that the history of Bord na Móna is that the existing powers that are being sought now exist with the old Bord na Móna, and that Bord na Móna are heavily in debt arising from the Minister allowing substantial borrowings beyond the capacity of Bord na Móna to repay? Is that not the crux of the problem of Bord na Móna?  The amendment as stated seeks to give more freedom to the board.  I am not sure that is desirable in this instance, but I say it is desirable that the Minister should have a better housekeeping attitude to Bord na Móna, so that the type of borrowing that previously occurred and landed them in the trouble they are now in &mdash; I do not blame the present Minister for that &mdash; would be restricted, and borrowing would be on a commercial basis for use on commercial enterprise that could show a return whereby the borrowing could be repaid. That is not the present position and I am not at all sure or satisfied that the amendment as proposed would have that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is exactly the same amendment as we had from Deputy Bruton on Committee Stage and on that occasion I stated clearly the reasons I could not accept it.  If one leaves aside the necessity for controls by the Minister and the Minister for Finance and looks at the arbitrary figure of £10 million as in the amendment, one can see that this limit can easily be circumvented.  By a <Col N="1265" /> multiplicity of proposals and a multiplicity of £10 million sums, very quickly one could reach a situation where the board could borrow vast amounts of money without the Minister who is guaranteeing these borrowings having any say in the affair.  It seems a highly irresponsible way for the State to carry out its business.  So long as the State owns companies of this kind it has a duty to the taxpayers and to this House to exercise due controls.  It should be very obvious regarding the person, the Department or the Minister who is guaranteeing these loans &mdash; capital borrowings are all guaranteed by the Department of Finance &mdash; that it is very necessary that legislation should contain a provision whereby his consent would have to be obtained initially before these borrowings could be undertaken.  I understand the provisions in this Bill are similar to the provisions contained in other Bills under which other semi-State bodies are established.  In these circumstances I can see a necessity to retain this level of control, and for the same reasons I gave on Committee Stage, again I indicate to Deputy Bruton that nothing he has said or that has happened in the meantime could lead me to change my mind on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is reciting that all other State bodies are under similar restrictions to get consent from both the sponsoring Minister and the Minister for Finance for research, purchase of assets, development of cutaway bogs and minor elements like that. If that is the case it explains to a large extent why our State companies have had enormous difficulty in executing a commercial mandate.  For instance take the development of a cutaway bog or the purchasing of a new piece of bog: if they have to go back not only to the Minister for Energy but also to the Minister for Finance to make that sort of decision, the company are hidebound and restricted in their ability to operate commercially.  I do not think the Minister for Finance would have greater competence in deciding on whether those were wise things to <Col N="1266" /> do than the board the Minister put there to execute the function.  I do not know how this can have evolved as a set piece for running State bodies.</P>
      <P>It seems to be a rather sad way to conduct our business.  The Minister should have availed of the opportunity when presenting the Bill to do what his party spokesman suggested on Second Stage, to provide a new mandate which would be genuinely commercial and free the company from bureaucratic controls. The Minister should allow the company to be judged on their performance and results.  The company have proved themselves very capable in the last two years.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Section 18 of the Principal Act is hereby further amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (3):</P>
      <P>`(4)  In any event, when the Minister lays a report of the Board before each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with subsection (3), he shall do so not later than six months after the end of the financial year of the Board to which the report relates.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed an amendment along similar lines on Committee Stage and I was not satisfied that the Minister had advanced reasons why a board like Bord na Móna should not present their accounts within a reasonable period of the end of the financial year.  The Minister, when pressed, said that Government policy required the accounts to be presented within six months but he was not willing to say why we should deviate from that practice and why there should not be a statutory provision to produce the accounts within six months.  If a company had a bad year, or decided to revise the valuation of their assets in accordance with standard accounting procedures, <Col N="1268" /> that should not necessitate the postponement of the presentation of their financial returns.  As I understand it, companies in the private sector are under an obligation to file returns to the Companies' Office within a specified period and if they do not do so they can be struck off.  I do not think it is unreasonable to be seeking for the presentation of accounts within a six month period of the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are serious problems to be confronted in many companies from time to time, but I do not see why that would necessitate keeping the House in the dark as to the true financial state of a company.  I was not satisfied with the explanation advanced on Committee Stage and I retabled my amendment in the hope that the Minister would explain why he felt that a statutory provision as I have suggested should not be included.  I appreciate that there is not such a statutory provision in respect of many State companies but we are dealing with a State company who have breached Government guidelines.  The Minister must have alerted to that fact once they had breached that six month rule which, as he said, is the convention.  However, accounts were not produced and they have not been produced to date.  There seems to be a weakness in regard to presenting returns and I suggest that a statutory requirement along the lines I have put forward would not be unduly burdensome on a company.  The company should be capable of presenting a true account of their financial position each year as a normal part of their operations. That should be enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>State companies are in a unique position in that in most cases their borrowings are guaranteed by the State. That puts a greater onus upon them to make statutory returns.  For that reason the requirement for returns should be statutory.  We are all involved in making guarantees for their operations and we are entitled to see the returns published on time.</P>

      <P>This amendment, which is similar to the amendment tabled on <Col N="1269" /> Committee Stage, has been brought forward by Deputy Bruton because of the exceptional circumstances that obtain in regard to last year's accounts of Bord na Móna which have been delayed longer than is normal.  There are very special circumstances involved and they were explained to the House before.  It is my hope that those circumstances, once they have been dealt with, will not arise again for some time.  I beg the indulgence of the House because of the delay but I am aware that all Members are concerned, like the Government parties, to ensure that the right decisions are made to guarantee the future commercial success of Bord na Móna.  We have had this inordinate delay due to exceptional circumstances but that does not justify placing a clause in the Bill which would make it a statutory requirement that the company produce accounts within six months one way or the other.  Flexibility should be allowed in the present arrangements to take account of exceptional circumstances and that is understandable.  I ask the House to agree to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a Government requirement of all semi-State bodies that they must produce their reports within six months of the end of the financial year.  The Government are anxious to ensure that that is complied with at all times but where exceptional circumstances occur, as is freely admitted occurred in the case of Bord na Móna this year, we should permit a delay in publishing the accounts.  Major decisions are being faced up to by the company.  Some matters were let slide in the past and they could easily have been let slide in another year but, because the problems were faced up to this year, there will be a delay in publishing the accounts.  I do not think it would be wise to insert a statutory requirement as suggested by the Deputy.  The chief executives, chairmen and board members of those semi-State bodies are aware of the Government's requirement in regard to publishing their accounts and, as far as I know, they seek to comply with that requirement.  I accept that that has not been achieved in regard to Bord na Móna this year and I hope it will not happen in <Col N="1270" /> the future.  It would not be appropriate to include a clause as suggested in the amendment.  As I explained on Committee Stage, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

We are at a very considerable disadvantage in assessing the direction of the company and it would be courteous of the Minister to provide Members of the Oireachtas with accounts which have been duly presented to him so that we can examine and assess Bord na Móna's future in the same way that he does.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to debate and decide the best way to approach the problems of the company but we do not have the access to the information which the Minister has.  It is damaging the ability of this House to contribute to the debate on the future of the company.  I will not press the amendment but I hope the Minister will make available to Members of the House the information on which we can assess &mdash; as well as the Minister and his Department &mdash; how the difficulties of this company can be resolved.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 33, after &ldquo;Minister.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Such directives shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and shall come into force within 21 sitting days unless a motion is passed in either House to the contrary.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> This amendment is concerned with the proposed policy directives which the Minister intends to introduce in relation to the future use of cutaway bog.  As the House knows, the Minister has established a committee which will examine the different options for the use of cutaway. On foot of those recommendations the Minister proposes that he will produce general policy directives as to how cutaway bogs should be used.  The different possibilities for the use of those bogs will be considered, some perhaps will be allowed to revert to wetlands, some will be used for forestry and others will be used for agricultural land or whatever.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's approach in establishing such a committee and having a detailed study of the best options because very large acreages of land are involved.  Other Deputies remarked that the acreages are as big as County Louth so they are very substantial amounts of land and their future use is of very considerable importance to the House.  My amendment involves a standard procedure where the House can look at proposed decisions which the Minister intends to implement in a Bill.  This would apply in cases where the House would have an interest in seeing the contents of such proposed decisions and rescinding or altering them if it felt it was appropriate.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage The Workers' Party sponsored an amendment which was similar in nature but required the more onerous system of positive approval by the House of those policy provisions. From my very brief period on the other side of the House I realise that having to get positive approval from the House can be very difficult because of the lengthy queueing time involved on the Government side in getting motions before the two Houses of the Oireachtas. This provision of only requiring them to be laid before the House and going ahead unless they are rescinded by the House is fairer to the Minister and gives him greater flexibility in making speedy decisions.  However, the House has a <Col N="1272" /> legitimate interest in seeing the policy directives which the Minister intends to take on foot of the recommendations of this committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House whether there is a possibility that the report by the consultants to discuss the future of Bord na Móna will be made available to Members of the House?  The report was made available to the then Minister, Deputy Smith, before the new Government took office.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (1) (j) states that the board may develop commercially or otherwise any bog vested in the board which is, has become or becomes incapable of commercial exploitation for the production of turf or turf products.  The whole area of cutaway bog and its future use will determine the mid to long-term viability of Bord na Móna when their main job of commercial exploitation of turf has been completed.  Perhaps the Minister will let us know whether public representatives in the area, who have a very important point of view to put, will see consultants' reports, the terms of reference of which did not include the social implications of changes which would be brought about in relation to the use of cutaway bogs or the future of Bord na Móna.  The terms of reference were strictly economic and it is strange that there is such a lack of information available to public representatives in the area. The economy of these areas depends on their continued viability and prosperity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy Cowen referring to the committee which were set up to take submissions on the future suggested use of the cutaway bogs and to make recommendations to me?  That is a committee of experts rather than consultants.</P>

      <P>It is not proposed to publish the Deloitte-Haskins report because it contains vital commercial information in relation to the operations of Bord na <Col N="1273" /> Móna and it would not be in the best interests of the company or their employees to publish it.  I will consider publishing the report of the Committee in relation to cutaway bogs.</P>
      <P>The amendment suggests that any directives made in relation to the future use of cutaway bogs should be the subject of a motion.  Deputy Bruton gave a good reason for not following that route, because of the need to avoid seeking to clog Dáil business and debates with a series of motions.  I know the amendment is worded in such a way that it would only come into force within 21 sitting days unless there was a motion to the contrary. However, I do not see the necessity for a motion of that kind to be placed before the House.  This is a policy decision which the Minister will be obliged to make in the same way that he is required to make various decisions in the ordinary day to day running of his Department in relation to a variety of matters.  It would be an impossible situation if everything had to be the subject of such a directive.  I do not think the principle enshrined in the amendment should be applied in a Bill of this kind which deals with the possible future use of cutaway bog, which could result in a variety of uses being made of it.  In addition, it would mean the Minister of the day would have to continually review the policy he would apply in relation to the disposal of cutaway bog.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased at the response to the public invitation to make oral submissions to the committee of experts.  It is very satisfying to see the wide spectrum of society represented in the submissions which have been made and which I hope will help to ensure that the recommendations ultimately will be of a very comprehensive and valuable nature.  I will consider the submissions very carefully before making any final decisions in this area.  I will be pleased to keep the House informed about decisions which will be made in the future about these matters.  The House will have the opportunity, if it considers the issue warrants it, to raise the matter in the House by way of private notice question, parliamentary question or special motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> I find it difficult to agree to the amendment. A similar suggestion was made before and I do not think it would be really appropriate to specify in this legislation that any directions the Minister might issue should require a further resolution of the House before coming into effect.  One could extend the principle to a whole range of areas and make the Minister's work very difficult and slow down the decision-making process.  It would certainly delay the coming into effect of any decision the Minister may make.  I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to differ with the Minister.  The Minister has taken on a new power by restricting the rights of Bord na Móna to use their cutaway bogs as they see fit and to pursue their normal commercial mandate.  There is a respectable legal precedent in this House for requiring the Minister, when he is making special orders as to how a business should be carried on, to execute the general wish of the Dáil.  It is quite usual for such orders and directions to be laid before the House and to have this provision for delay before they come into force.  This means the House is given a chance to consider these new directions before they are put in place and commercial and irrevocable decisions taken on the basis of them.  If the Minister is going to the trouble of setting up a committee who will produce recommendations, which he will act upon as he sees fit by rejecting some of them and accepting others, I do not think it is unreasonable for the House to request a delay of 21 sitting days from the date on which he makes his decisions before they come into force.  This is a reasonable balance and would give the Minister discretion, as is his right, to make decisions in this area.  It will ensure that the House will get an opportunity before final decisions are made by Bord na Móna on cutaway bog to consider what is intended and the policy framework within which they will operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's attitude to this amendment is a bit narrow.  We are not seeking <Col N="1275" /> to make his life impossible but he is proposing to lay down policy directions as to how cutaway bog will be used.  Within the large volume of cutaway bog which will be available for use it is likely that these directions will prevail for a long time to come and dictate how these lands will be used.  I believe the House is entitled to have such directions laid before it within 21 sitting days so that it can consider the implications for the many regions which will be affected.  I do not think this is an unreasonable request and I hope the Minister will reconsider the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving the adjournment of this debate last evening I was dealing with the very important matter of the discretion of a trial judge, in all cases, to exercise due consideration on the basis of the evidence before him and the decision returned to him by the jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> It has been said, but bears some repetition, that each case has its distinguishing features and characteristics, that in essence no two cases are exactly similar.  Be that as it may, many hundreds of cases are dealt with in our courts on a weekly basis that bear remarkable similarity in aim, content and evidence.  It is very important to bear that fact in mind in discussing the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that a trial judge be afforded every opportunity of considering the various mitigating factors that may be put to him from time to time, such as the age of the offender, the history of the offender, in many cases the character of the offender, the circumstances in which the incident took place, the question of previous convictions, the question of evidence in the form that may be given by a probation officer, the evidence of a counsellor, the professional evidence of a psychiatrist, the evidence of a medical consultant and so on.  It is very important that we allow such people give their evidence freely, that they be made available to a court at all times so that the judge be given an opportunity of teasing out all aspects of each case.</P>
    <P>Our system of criminal law provides for maximum sentences and, in some cases, for sentences of minimum duration; that is as it should be.  Nonetheless, I contend that the minimum sentence requirements, as far as possible, should be kept at a minimum.  There have been calls recently for the imposition of mandatory sentences.  I have in mind some of the Garda groups who have expressed alarm recently at the disparity of sentences as far as attacks on their members are concerned.  They express the belief that, until such time as a system of mandatory sentences is implemented, its absence will give rise to an undermining of public confidence in the Garda Síochána.  They advocate that consideration be given to a mandatory sentence for an attack on a member of the force.  I do not believe the time is right for us to consider such a provision.  Nonetheless it is a pointer in the direction of a certain fear among members of the <Col N="1277" /> Garda Síochána, one that has spilled over to members of the public, which can manifest itself in the form of disquiet at the inconsistency of the sentencing policy of our courts.</P>
    <P>Again fundamental to criminal law, there is the avenue of appeal available to a convicted party which may be exercised in most cases following a conviction.  For example, the entire conviction can be appealed or an appeal entered on the severity of sentence.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill allow the Director of Public Prosecutions a similar right.  I do not believe it is asking too much that society allow the law officer, in the form of the Director of Public Prosecutions, such a mechanism.  We must remember that, in the lawful exercise of his functions, the Director of Public Prosecutions represents the State and the public at large.  At all times he acts in the public interest.  If he forms the opinion that a sentence, for some reason or other, is too lenient, then he should have a mechanism available to him to allow that trial be rerun on the basis of the leniency or otherwise of the sentence.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed on the far side of the House last evening at the fact that such a proposal would undermine the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We heard comments to the effect that there would be continuous representations to the Minister for Justice to put pressure on the Director of Public Prosecutions, that the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions might be in some way compromised by allowing him that right of appeal.  I reject these criticisms as being unfair and unfounded. There is no provision in this Bill, nothing envisaged which would allow anybody make representations to the Minister for Justice &mdash; through a local politician, county councillor, party member or whoever &mdash; that might influence the role and/or functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions will not be in any way compromised or tarnished by allowing him this vehicle of appeal.  It is beyond belief to suggest that there can be any correlation between allowing the <Col N="1278" /> Director of Public Prosecutions this mechanism and allowing people make direct representations to the Minister of the day.  I want to nail that myth.</P>
    <P>The purpose behind the introduction of this Bill is the disparity in sentences which is causing such concern.  Granted, as the Minister said, it does not happen on a daily basis but it has happened all too frequently in recent years.  When one looks to the Department of Justice, to the courts for evidence of consistency of sentencing, such evidence simply is not available.  To the best of my knowledge it has not been compiled.  There is no source of reference available to this House, to any interested party or to any law officer to undertake a study of the level of consistency or lack thereof as far as sentencing is concerned.  This is something we should examine.  It is important that we examine cases that have gone through our courts over, say, a five year period to ascertain the level of disparity and/or inconsistency obtaining. It is my belief that we would be surprised by the level of inconsistency revealed.</P>
    <P>On the question of inconsistency in sentencing, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the Supreme Court judgment in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> Tiernan delivered on 13 May 1988 by Chief Justice Finlay.  The defendant had been convicted and sentenced to 21 years penal servitude.  The appeal to the Supreme Court was brought pursuant to a certificate issued by the Attorney General, pursuant to section 29 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, on 9 March 1987.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General certified the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on the grounds that it involved a point of law of exceptional public importance, that it was desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken to the Supreme Court and that it involved the guidelines which the court should apply in relation to sentences for the crime &mdash; in this case &mdash; of rape.</P>
    <P>In the course of his judgment, Chief Justice Finlay had this to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> Both the Criminal Divison of the Court of Appeal in London, in the case of R. <i>v.</i> Ballam, and the Court of Appeal in New Zealand, in the case of R. <i>v.</i> Puru, were dealing with cases where a number of different decisions were brought before them for review or consideration, and where evidence was submitted of overall patterns or tendencies in the imposition of sentences within their jurisdiction for rape.  The specific purpose of this form of multiple appeal in the case of R. <i>v.</i> Ballam was to seek from the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal a broad statement on policy, almost amounting to a range or tariff of appropriate sentences for rape of different kinds.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the absence of any statistics or information before this Court in this appeal, concerning any general pattern of sentences imposed for the crime of rape within this jurisdiction, general observations on such patterns would not be appropriate. Furthermore, having regard to the fundamental necessity for judges in sentencing in any form of criminal case to impose a sentence which in their discretion appropriately meets all the particular circumstances of the case (and very few criminal cases are particularly similar) and the particular circumstances of the accused, I would doubt that it is appropriate for an appellate court to appear to be laying down any standardisation or tariff of penalty for cases.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have the view of a member of the Judiciary on standardisation and inconsistency.  In the same case Mr. Justice McCarthy had this to say on the question of consistency and standardisation:</P>
    <P>I recognise the need to give guidance to trial judges as to the matters to be taken into account when assessing the penalty appropriate in any given case. I do not subscribe to what is apparently the view in England and New Zealand that there should be any particular <Col N="1280" /> minimum standard; there is a maximum &mdash; penal servitude for life. The trial judge, subject to due consideration of the matters specified by the Chief Justice, and taking into account what further matter may properly appear to be relevant in the particular case, should have a true judicial discretion as to the sentence appropriate in any case.</P>
    <P>In this instance we have the Attorney General seeking guidelines with the Supreme Court indicating that it is not appropriate, given the lack of information, for such guidelines to be laid down and arguing for the <i>status quo</i> to be maintained.  Last night the Minister had very little to say but that we should await the report of the Law Reform Commission who were requested in 1987 to consider this and other related matters. The one positive thing the Minister had to say was that he was going to ask the Attorney General to request the Law Reform Commission to accord priority to this matter, but I wonder how long we will have to wait for this report given that the Minister in the course of his address stated that in his opinion the Law Reform Commission are grossly overworked at present.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of this Bill I do not think this House considered the question of sentencing or the right to appeal, but we can get an indication of the way the House feels from the fourth report of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  On the question of sentencing the committee had this to say:</P>
    <P>The Committee are convinced that in the interests of having a consistent level of sentencing by all judges, a set of guidelines for sentencing should be laid down for sexual offences and for all other serious crime.  Such action would not only allay the fears of the general public, it would also help to maintain a high level of respect for the law.</P>
    <P>Arising from two important points Fine Gael drafted the Private Members' Bill <Col N="1281" /> before us.  Having indicated that inconsistency in sentencing has given rise to public concern, I do not wish to give the House any examples as plenty abound, some of which were referred to last night.</P>
    <P>A number of vehicles are available to an offender some of which give rise to concern.  First, in cases involving a very serious criminal charge at the Circuit Criminal Court applications are often made to have the case tranferred to Dublin, the idea being the offender would avoid local odium if the case was transferred to Dublin or some other area. There are also glaring differences in the sentences handed down by judges.  What would warrant a suspended sentence in one area would warrant a sentence of two years in another.  Then there is the question of adjournments when people have to wait for a particular judge to hear a case.  This is not unusual but it is a practice which should be stamped out. Attacks on members of the Garda Síochána have also given rise to concern, as I stated earlier.  In the past people convicted of assaults on members of the Garda Síochána have been subjected to the Probation Act, given suspended sentences or hefty prison sentences, which do little to allay public concern.</P>
    <P>The role of the media was referred to last night by Government speakers who indicated their intention to oppose the Bill and by the spokesperson for the Labour Party, but what we have to bear in mind is that it would be very difficult for the media to influence a decision to be handed down in a case taken under this Bill given the fact the jury would already have convicted the person concerned. Are we saying that public comment influences a learned judge of the Appeal Court or an experienced judge of the Supreme Court as these are the only people who could be influenced by the media in the circumstances?  I do not believe that a senior judge of the Appeal Court would be influenced by the tabloids peddling alarmist trash of the lowest common denominator.  The judges of the <Col N="1282" /> Appeal Court are experienced people who will not take into account any comment by the media, alarmist or otherwise, in arriving at their decision.</P>
    <P>A majority of the House appear to have indicated that they will not allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage. Notwithstanding that, I believe there are other avenues available that could be explored with or without this Bill.  It is very important that retraining and refresher courses be made available to the members of the Judiciary from time to time.  The Minister himself stated that judges are human.  I agree.  Sometimes it is very difficult for them to reach a decison, but they should have available to them all the necessary techniques.  There are situations where a judge might be appointed from Chancery to a criminal court.  If we are to avoid public outcry, statements from politicians and a sensationalist press, we must put these mechanisms in place.  The President of the High Court and the President of the Circuit Court should meet with their colleagues on a regular basis and if they will not do that there should be a statutory provision, as there is in the District Court.  Until such time as they meet on guidelines we will be faced with the type of criticism that gave rise to this Bill.  We need concerted action on the question of sentencing and this Bill is a start.</P>
    <P>Prison sentences and prisons have given rise to much debate in recent weeks.  One point that is staggering is that in 1989 1,000 people served terms of imprisonment for however short a time because of the non-payment of fines.  The cost of our prison service is £70 million, a staggering amount.  We must look to alternatives and there are a number of alternatives which have been working quite well.  There are others, such as community service orders, the payment of fines by instalments and the payment of fines that reflect the circumstances of individuals rather than a blanket fine which we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> House arrest could well be an alternative to prison; somebody would be confined to their house after work or school and fitted with something like an electronic tag that would set off an alarm in the Garda station if they moved outside the confines of their house.  This is something we believe we will see in the future and that we should be considering. Another possibility is weekends in prison rather than hefty prison sentences for people who have been convicted of not very serious charges.  They could perhaps serve a weekend in prison for a period of maybe, 25 weeks.  Such a sentence would cause considerable hardship without the person having to be removed from society and away from their family and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The question of compensation for victims is another day's debate but it should be considered along with the question of confiscation of property.  We must have a debate on our entire system of criminal justice.  This Bill is a start, although I do not suggest it is a panacea.</P>
    <P>Some concerns were expressed about the time limit within which the appeal papers could be lodged and about the manner in which the appeal could be tendered.  These are not very serious and could well be thrashed out on Committee Stage if the Bill were allowed to get through Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister was so negative in what he said last night on a matter of such importance.  It was a feeble attempt to smooth over many of the serious problems we have in our criminal law system.  I welcome what he said about the Law Reform Commission report but if we are to wait a number of years for this we are not tackling the problem as we should.  Our criminal law code must be modernised and simplified so that the needs of society will at all times have priority and be met.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the House, I would like to share some of my time with my party colleague, Deputy Flood.  I will be very interested to hear what Deputy McCartan has to say in relation to this Bill.  I listened with great interest to what Deputy Kavanagh had to say last night and I thought he made some very pertinent points in relation to it.</P>
      <P>I do not accept Deputy Flanagan's comments about the Minister's contribution. The Minister said bluntly that he was opposed to the Bill but he did accept that like most Members in the House he would have some disquiet at sentences that have been handed down from time to time by our courts.  Most people in the country would.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the Minister did point out in a very frank way a number of areas where he felt there were problems with the Bill as drafted and obviously he had the weight of his Department behind him.  While he did accept that bona fides of Deputy O'Keeffe he quite validly pointed out a number of the problems that arise from this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally have some difficulty with the whole idea of allowing the State to appeal against severity of sentence.  It goes to the root of our Constitution which guarantees the independence of our Judiciary in Article 35.  I would think this Bill would be open to constitutional challenge if it was passed.  Some people say <Col N="1285" /> there is an Act of similar proportions in England but England does not have a written constitution and our Constitution was very specific on this.  That is one of the main reasons I feel that allowing the State to appeal what some people would regard as lenient sentences is fraught with constitutional difficulties.  We should tread very warily in that regard.  I entirely agree with what the Minister has said in relation to the Law Reform Commission. I would agree with some Members that unfortunately the Law Reform Commission have delayed in bringing forward a report but hopefully as a result of the impetus this debate and the request from the Minister have given the Law Reform Commission will come forward as quickly as possible with their recommendations in this regard.  This whole area needs much better debate not only here but also outside among the Judiciary, among the legal profession and also among victim support groups etc.</P>
    <P>Another area touched on last night was the area of conferences of judges.  I have had a lot of contact particularly with Circuit Court judges and I do not see any constraint on them to have conferences. I know that they meet from time to time. There is a statutory basis, as Deputy Flanagan pointed out, in the District Court, and I believe this should be extended to the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court.  I know that the judges meet on a voluntary basis. It is slightly spurious of Deputy O'Keeffe to say that they will not go to these conferences because they are not getting travelling expenses.  That is very unfair. Irrespective of whether they get travelling expenses they have met with one another to endeavour to have some consistency of sentencing, and that is to be encouraged.  I noted with some interest the observations made by the Director of Public Prosecutions at the Incorporated Law Society's annual function in Killarney when he called for a complete reform of criminal law.  I agree entirely with him.  The whole area of criminal <Col N="1286" /> law should be looked at.  Tinkering with the code of criminal law with small Bills here and there &mdash; I criticise the State for doing this as well &mdash; is not the right way to go about it.  We should have an overall look at the criminal law area because there is no doubt that most people outside of this House are very worried about the level of crime and the State's response to it, whether by the law enforcement agencies, such as the Garda Síochána or the Army or through the Judiciary.  There are some very valid criticisms levelled against our courts because of decisions that have been handed down. However, personally I think the vast majority of the decisions have been good and could stand up to the test of time. Obviously mistakes will be made from time to time and to a certain extent this Bill is a reaction to some of the recent mistakes that have been well publicised over the past number of months.</P>
    <P>While it is not an area for this Bill, I exhort the Minister to investigate much more thoroughly the alternatives to custody. I am a very strong supporter of community service.  I have seen it in action in my own area and I think it should be encouraged.  It would be one way of ensuring that our prisons are not full and as a consequence we would not have as many problems, as we are having, in our prisons.  It was very interesting recently to hear Justice Delap in a television interview say that out of approximately 49 cases where community service orders were made, the vast majority, approximately 46 of those concerned ended up doing their community service and only three went astray.  That is an indication that not only the Judiciary and the people dealing with offenders in court welcome community service orders but, obviously, the victims also would rather do community service &mdash; this is recognised by most people &mdash; that serve a period in custody.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made last night that the Director of Public Prosecutions could be exposed to lobbying is valid.  It is a bit naive to say that he would not.  At present <Col N="1287" /> he quite rightly refuses to make public comment on cases that come before him from time to time.  Given the level of hype that could be engendered by some recent decisions I have no doubt that if there was an avenue whereby the State was entitled to appeal, Deputies would be standing up in this Chamber wanting to know why the Director of Public Prosecutions was not appealing a particular case under the legislation.  I have no doubt that the newpapers and the media in general would be calling for the Director of Public Prosecutions to act in cases where he might not want to do so.</P>
    <P>If this type of provision were enshrined in legislation, whether in this Bill or in a Bill brought forward by the Department of Justice, it would lead to something that I am not in favour of, plea bargaining, which is in vogue in a very big way in America.  It would do a great disservice to our judicial system in the area of criminal law if there was an element of plea bargaining creeping in as a result of the possibility of the State putting in an appeal.  For Deputy O'Keeffe to say that it would apply in only very few cases is something I would not agree with.  Once the State was dissatisfied with any decision it would immediately put in an appeal in the hope that it would be allowed to bring the matter to the Appeal Court and at that stage perhaps an element of plea bargaining would creep in.  I envisage that is a very great possibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh put his finger on what is wrong with sentencing and that is the inconsistency rather than the leniency in sentencing.  We should really be looking at this, and a better way to deal with it is to have conferences on a statutory basis which would examine things in a much more detailed way.  If the judges feel &mdash; I do not agree with this suggestion &mdash; they cannot do this because of the lack of travelling expenses, then pay them the travelling expenses.  I do not honestly <Col N="1288" /> believe that is a valid reason and that suggestion is a disservice to judges.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, referred to double jeopardy and the Minister referred to double punishment. There is a grave possibility that we would infringe the rule of double jeopardy by allowing a convicted criminal to go through the hoop twice.  This would be most unfair and would not be in keeping with the concept of our judicial system which we hold in very high esteem.  We often criticise other jurisdictions and judicial systems.  In order to maintain our judicial system, we should look very carefully at any proposed reforms. However, as I said earlier, we should codify the judicial system in some way.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Burke, referred to the media commentary during an appeal.  That is a very great fear and we should look at this area very carefully. Perhaps it is something that the Law Reform Commission should examine in great detail.  Another point, and this may have been mentioned before, is the time limit for appeal.  There is no reference to this in the Bill but perhaps it would be taken care of under the rules of the court. However, there is always a possibility that a court, if it was put to them would allow the State to lodge a late appeal. Again, this would be grossly unfair to someone who had been convicted already who was probably languishing in jail for a period and might then find he had to do an extra stint in jail.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, mistakes are made, but in the vast majority of cases the decisions are good.  I wonder why Deputy O'Keeffe has chosen to limit the provisions of the Bill to the higher courts and not to encompass the District Court. Many decisions that the media comment on are District Court decisions and not decisions of the higher courts.  Perhaps someone on the far side will respond to that point later.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Minister, I do not think it is a good idea that the State could appeal against lenient sentences.  There are <Col N="1289" /> other areas of criminal law that we can reform, for example, the right to silence or practices relating to custody of suspects. We should be looking at the beefing up of the Garda Síochána because there is no doubt that there is grave disquiet among people about what is happening in our towns and villages around the country.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I do not think tinkering with the criminal law in this fashion is recommended.  I ask the Minister to request the Law Reform Commission to have a much more detailed look at the whole area of criminal law so that we can put it on a better footing in the long-term.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate. Every so often arising out of a court decision a public debate takes place on the issue of Deputy O'Keeffe's proposed legislation.  During the course of such debates views have been expressed from a variety of quarters but unfortunately the end result is that no specific action has been taken down through the years to put in place a mechanism that allows the State to carry out a review of lenient sentences.  Very frequently, the ordinary citizen is baffled by the fact that an offender can appeal his sentence, while the State, generally speaking does not find itself in the same situation.  That is one of the reasons people believe there is a need for a change when sentences are too lenient.  It is why, as has been already stated by the Minister and other speakers, the whole question has been referred to the Law Reform Commission.  As other speakers have also said, it is a pity that report has not yet been presented by the Law Reform Commission but I understand the reason for that.  If one studies their most recent report on another issue one will see that they have been extremely active over the years in presenting various reports, discussion papers and so on.  I have found the reports which I have had an opportunity to read and study very helpful in my job as a <Col N="1290" /> legislator.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, is probably right in saying that this legislation is very complex.  We require the best possible advice and assistance in drawing up legislation which will provide for the implementation of a mechanism to review lenient sentences. It is important that legislation in this regard is not flawed or rushed but is based on sound information and facts and, above all on sound judgment.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission are probably the best people to assist in this regard.  The Minister has indicated that he will be taking into account the report the commission will bring forward.  In his contribution he expressed his anxiety that that report would be made available as quickly as possible.  He has sought the assistance of the Attorney General in an effort to have the matter dealt with as speedily as possible.  Arising out of this debate and out of the imposition of lenient sentences in certain cases, we are all agreed that there is a necessity to put appropriate legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Justice complimented Deputy O'Keeffe, rightly so, on the work which had undoubtedly been put into the preparation of the Bill. The Minister accepted that the Bill in question is motivated by a concern to improve the administration of justice in our courts.  He also went into detail on the specific reasons he is opposing the Bill at this stage.  As has already been said in this debate, on occasion there is very grave public disquiet concerning the sentencing policy of our courts.  There are specific cases where, on the surface, the sentence does not appear to fit the crime in question.  As I have said, citizens look to us as legislators to update legislation to provide that the State can take action where a sentence may appear to be too lenient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are often informed through the media of various court cases, the sentences handed down in these cases and we then make a rash judgment on the <Col N="1291" /> correctness of the sentence imposed but we should not rush into judgment from the outside unless we have all the information and facts relevant to a particular case, as have those who participate in and are present at the case in the court room.  The publicity about specific cases, some of which have been referred to in this debate, has been wide off the mark and is not helpful to a debate of this kind.  In fairness to defendants, the media do not always report the main thrust of the case put forward for the defence.  Those of us on the outside then come to a particular conclusion about the sentence handed down, based on the one-sided information available through the media, conclusion is very often incorrect.</P>
    <P>At present an offender can appeal against a conviction and also against a penalty imposed if he or she considers it is too harsh.  As I have said earlier, it is surprising that the State on the other hand simply cannot appeal against a sentence which the public may consider to be too lenient.  A debate of this kind could lead to the assumption that a harsh sentence which benefits a particular crime can help the victim of the crime in question but I do not believe that is always the case.  Certainly victims to whom I have spoken do not always insist on a severe sentence.</P>
    <P>This is quite a complex matter and there is need for proper and adequate victim support.  We should ensure not only that the victim is satisfied but also that the sentence handed down by the court is sufficient to meet the severity of the crime.  Support for the victims of crime is a fundamentally important matter and the State must become more involved in this area.  The Victim Support Organisation are expanding and becoming increasingly busier in helping the victims of crime as each year goes by.  These crimes do not have to be serious crimes; various petty crimes frequently leave in the minds of those who have been injured <Col N="1292" /> a legacy of fear and intimidation and this is something the victim support groups are beginning to tackle.  The State has a role to play here and we should become more conscious of our responsibilities as legislators in this regard.</P>

      <P>I do not deny that that is important.  The victim support groups do a tremendous job and need all the help they can get.  This Government or any other Government would be well advised to support such organisations, particularly financially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill includes no safeguards for the offender, in particular with regard to a time element.  Some of my more learned colleagues in the legal profession who have contributed to this debate have spelled out very clearly the reasons there should be some time limit with regard to the State making an appeal in relation to a sentence it considers to be too lenient.  Reference has been made to the comparable legislation of 1988 in the United Kingdom which imposed a time limit of 28 days for the making of such an appeal.  An offender should be entitled to some time limit &mdash; I am not saying 28 days is the ideal time limit because there may be constraints with regard to the case in question or there may be some other issue of a legal nature but a time limit ought to be imposed and that is something I cannot discern in the legislation.  Under this Bill it falls to the Director of Public Prosecutions to initiate the procedure for reviewing a particular sentence.  In general terms where a member of the public felt that a particular sentence was too lenient, under this legislation there could be a public campaign to try to compel the Director of Public Prosecutions to take a particular decision.  Because no time limit is imposed that campaign could roll on and on.  That would not be helpful either to the convicted persons or to the Office <Col N="1293" /> of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am not sure how we could get over that difficulty.  The last thing I would like to see would be the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions subjected every other month to a concerted campaign on a specific sentence which might be considered by some to be too lenient. That is something we must take account of in any legislation we bring forward to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill appears to resemble the English Criminal Justice Bill, 1988. While that Bill may be suited in general terms to legislation for this jurisdiction, I do not think &mdash; and the Minister pointed this out last night &mdash; it necessarily follows that it would be good legislation for Ireland or that it would suit this country. As I have pointed out, there is the finer point regarding the time limit but there are other aspects about which I would not be happy.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to deal with the review of over-lenient sentences which is an important issue and one which we should come to grips with.  We all recognise there is a difficulty and that the public need to be convinced that they can have confidence in our judicial system.  Any legislation which does not unnecessarily infringe on the rights of the individual but which encourages public confidence in our judicial system would have a great deal of merit.  The debate on this issue in the past, sometimes based on media hype, has not been well informed and has not been always in full command of the facts from the prosecution and defence sides.  For that reason it is better to wait for the Law Reform Commission report to give us the benefit of their examination and consideration.  I am sure the Law Reform Commission can take submissions from experts and other interested individuals and organisations. They would then produce a report that would be of assistance to any Minister for Justice trying to implement a mechanism that could lead to a review of lenient sentences.  I do not for one moment say <Col N="1294" /> that the legislation is not required; I believe it is.  To be of benefit to the State, and to be fair to both sides, the legislation must be based on sound principles which can be arrived at only through debates of the kind we have had on this Bill, and also through a report from the Law Reform Commission, or indeed any other organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that wish to put forward their point of view.  I take the point that the issue raised by Deputy McGahon is a concern of the Minister for Justice. He has indicated in this House that he is asking that the report be given the priority it now deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first things that emerged from the debate so far is that there is all-party agreement in the House on the general principle that there should be in place a mechanism where the prosecution are worried about the inappropriateness of the sentence passed &mdash; and, in particular, the leniency of it &mdash; so that the prosecuting authorities would have the right to pursue the matter in a higher court.  Every party spokesman supports that general principle.  Equally, The Workers' Party support that principle and will be supporting the Bill which is a fair and reasoned measure to address the issue and to bring forward a legislative formula to bring the matter into law. They have to be commended for responding so quickly to the issue and the debate which recently arose out of a number of notable, if not notorious, instances of inappropriate sentences being passed by our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has emerged from the debate so far is an incredible array of spurious and other reasons the Bill may not be supported by the Government.  I understand why the Labour Party would be anxious for the Law Reform Commission to report.  It was on their initiative, when in Government with the Fine Gael Party, <Col N="1295" /> that the matter was referred to the then Attorney General, John Rogers, who requested the Law Reform Commission to take up this issue along with a long list of other matters.</P>
    <P>For the Minister for Justice to suggest that it is incumbent on us to wait for the Law Reform Commission to report on the matter and to use that as the main plank for opposing what was on the face of it a very worthwhile and fair attempt to address this issue, is somewhat disingenous.  I say this because when we dealt with the Larceny Bill, which is being danced around in the Seanad at the moment &mdash; we addressed the issue of handlers and the disposal of stolen property and we had at that time a very detailed and worthwhile Law Reform Commission report which was dumped in the wastepaper basket by the Government and ignored.</P>
    <P>The Minister had passed in this House a Bill which his party had devised when in opposition, which they had tuned with the aid of the Office of the Attorney General and his officials in the Department, and presented it here on the basis that it was a preferable and better option.  All those resources are available to the Minister for Justice to deal with the issue of whether the prosecution should have the right to appeal lenient or inappropriate sentences.  The Minister has the Office of the Attorney General and all the expertise in the Department of Justice to help him address this issue which is presented in the guise of the Bill from the Fine Gael Party.  To criticise this Bill as a genuine effort simply because the Law Reform Commission have been asked to give priority to this consideration is having it both ways.  I cannot understand how the Government on one occasion in an important area of legislative reform can ignore the work of the Law Reform Commission who had produced the report and on the other hand say we must wait until the Law Reform Commission report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> If the Government are anxious to deal with the report of the Law Reform Commission, I would remind them of the remarks the chairman of the commission made not so long ago.  He said there are in excess of 30 substantial reports recommending reform of the law be it criminal, civil or otherwise, sitting on the shelves in the Library here or in the Minister's Office and elsewhere, requiring to be addressed.  That again throws into relief the seriousness of the Minister's reserve in this regard.  If you are going to look to the Law Reform Commission every time the Opposition present reforming legislation in the area here and say that we must get the report of the Law Reform Commission first &mdash; I anticipate that device will be used more and more &mdash; then it is also incumbent on Government to give proper and fair resources to that organisation, increase their staff, give them the opportunities to do their work and avoid what has happened here, the fact that an important and urgent issue has been sitting with them for four years simply because they have not the resources to address the huge area of work we expect them to deal with.</P>
    <P>This is a succinct and precise issue, and when the formula devised by the Fine Gael Party in the Bill as circulated is ultimately addressed by the Law Reform Commission &mdash; I do not wish to usurp their wisdom or intentions &mdash; they will not come with anything better or greater in divergence from what is being proposed here.  The issues are simple and straightforward and have to be addressed within the overall framework of the criminal justice system as administered at the moment.  For that reason the Bill should be supported.</P>
    <P>There are obviously many issues to be debated and discussed, and the Minister touched on many of them.  I would like to look at some of them, but that is the whole essence and purpose of debate, to come in and discuss and see if we can improve upon or amend the legislation before us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> The Minister's first concern was to see that there would be uniformity in overall sentencing policy, although it was not spelt out in the address he made to the House last evening.  That is not really a matter for which one can legislate.  If you wish to develop uniformity of sentencing among the Judiciary, the best way to ensure that is to have proper educational facilities available, on-going review of social and legal matters, seminars, directives and advice coming from the Department or from some other authority to the Judiciary as a whole.  I believe they lack serious information.  They lack serious direction on what is happening, for example, whether our prisons can accommodate more prisoners, whether the policy of locking up any class or type of prisoner is having an impact on the incidence of that crime or whether there is a need to rely on non-custodial sentences or the like.  None of this is being addressed in an informed way.</P>
    <P>No research is being done on society to be made available to the Judiciary upon which to arrive at their decisions. Anyone who works in the courts and looks at the way decisions are arrived at from day-to-day often comes to the conclusion that it depends on which side of the bed a judge might have risen from in the morning, how he or she might have read the headlines in the newspapers or what he or she last watched on TV to come to a conclusion that this is the issue to run with, this is the way to deal with a particular offence at the time.  The way to arrive at uniformity is through education and on-going direction from the Department as to what is socially required.  Our courts and judges are far too remote from the day-to-day needs of society.</P>
    <P>The next issue the Minister raises is a red herring in this area, that is the problem of double jeopardy.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Strictly speaking the concept of double jeopardy relates to the question of acquittal&rdquo;.  Of course it does.  There is no question of putting a person in jeopardy a second time by having an inappropriate sentence reviewed.  I am <Col N="1298" /> surprised that the Minister raised it.  He says it should be debated.  He makes the observation, and in all of these debates makes no attempt to come down one way or another or indicate his view on a point. He goes on then to deal with the question of fairness and talks about it in a way which again makes it difficult for me to understand why this is being presented as an issue.  He asks the question: if a person who has been on bail or in custody awaiting trial is then convicted or dealt with and sentenced, would it be fair to have the sword of Damocles hanging over the head of that person after the trial?  It is interesting that, coming up to trial when on remand or on bail, the accused is an innocent person but has to suffer all the discommodity of the trial and the disruption that that imposes on his or her life.  After trial and sentence that is dramatically changed.  The person is now a convicted person.  To suggest that the convicted person at that stage would have to await a review of an inappropriate sentence is introducing an element of unfairness, a spurious issue, and simply not facing up to the provisions in the Bill.  If the issue of fairness is to arise in this debate it is the unfairness to the victims in cases in which inappropriate, lenient sentences are imposed.  There is no getting away from it, the suspended sentence of imprisonment imposed on a soldier in the face of a heinous and vicious crime of rape was utterly inappropriate, completely out of order.  To suggest that the prosecuting authorities would have no basis to pursue that matter by way of a review is unfair, and it is only right for that reason if for no other that we address this issue of whether a right of appeal in certain instances should be available to the prosecution.</P>
    <P>The issue of independence of the Judiciary is introduced by the Minister. There is no question in this Bill of interfering with that independence.  In fact, the moving authority is the prosecutor in bringing the prosecution and then bringing the matter back to the Judiciary if the <Col N="1299" /> prosecuting authority is unhappy with the sentence.  It is the Judiciary who decide the matter entirely.</P>
    <P>The issue of <i>sub judice</i> and public comment arises.  It is quite clear that once a conviction is recorded the matter remains <i>sub judice</i> until the time allowed to lodge the application for the review expires; the media would not be in a position to make comment until then.  That is clear. There is a clear, easy answer to it.  If the Minister had been prepared to allow the discussion to develop on this Bill in the ordinary way debate takes place here on legislation, he could have been assured on this and on many of the other matters. No, these are all issues thrown into the pot in the hope of building up a case that the Bill should not be debated, looked at or given a Second Reading because the Minister simply does not want to listen to the issues or ideas of reform coming from the opposite side.</P>
    <P>The question of the Director of Public Prosecutions being the moving authority is a further point raised.  Should it be the Attorney General or whoever?  I have no problem about this.  There are arguments on both sides, and there is no problem if at the end of the day the collective view of this House is that the Director of Public Prosecutions is not the appropriate person, that it should be the Attorney General as in the British formula.  If, having rejected the idea that we could borrow from the British experience earlier, the Minister then comes back to say that in Britain they have the Attorney General and we should have him here, I have no difficulty.  All that is required is a two-word amendment to the Bill to delete &ldquo;Director of Public Prosecutions&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;Attorney General&rdquo; and the job is done.  What is the need for kicking this back, as Deputy McGahon suggested, for a further four years?  I am saddened by the Minister's approach to this suggestion.  He uses the comfortable device of asking the Law Reform Commission to take up something they clearly <Col N="1300" /> had not intended in the schedule of their work with the resources available to them at this time.  I regret the delay this will cause.</P>
    <P>The issue of legal aid arises.  The Minister is concerned as to how the unfortunate person would manage if he or she had legal aid because, although the current law allows for it, the regulations do not.  It would take no more than half an hour to draft an extrta form and an additional section in the regulations to deal with that matter.  Nothing more or less is required.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that we should defer this matter further.  I accept that we would all be better armed when dealing with matters like this if we had the report of the Law Reform Commission but, because it is expected that it will take a long time for that to emerge and because the Minister did not have any difficulty in the past in dealing with important legislation to the complete disregard of the Law Reform Commission, I do not go along with the call that we should defer this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I should like to address a number of points raised in it.  I query whether we should be confining the Bill in the way Fine Gael are suggesting. One of the most important issues raised in it is the manner in which drunk driving offences are prosecuted before our courts.  Invariably they are dealt with in the District Court.  Inappropriate sentences are passed almost on a daily basis in our district courts in rape cases, indecent assault cases and, in particular, drunk driving cases involving serious injury or death to innocent victims.</P>
    <P>The Mothers Against Drunk Drivers have issued a manifesto in an attempt to address that problem.  At its launch on 1 September last the Minister said his heart went out to the calls being made by that organisation.  They are concerned about the inappropriate sentences being passed by our courts.  A very good friend of mine was killed in the city of Dublin recently, mowed down by a reckless <Col N="1301" /> driver of a motor car.  This issue concerns me greatly.  I cannot say any more about the case because, having been dealt with in the District Court, it is under appeal.  If there is a review of sentencing policy I will press for the introduction of a system to enable the prosecution to come out of the District Court in such cases and have the matter addressed by another court.  I am not saying that that should be by way of a simple appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court but the High Court should be asked by way of case stated to review a sentence imposed in the District Court.</P>
    <P>The Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are more concerned about the nature of the charges being preferred, the preponderance of simple dangerous driving charges being laid as opposed to charges of dangerous driving causing death or, indeed, manslaughter.  However, that is a separate issue from the one we are dealing with tonight but in regard to sentences there is a clear case for those convicted of drunk driving, particularly those who cause death or inflict serious injury, to be given a fair measure of the punitive system available to us.  We must find a device to allow a higher court review the level of sentences imposed by the District Court.</P>
    <P>In mentioning the case of the soldier charged with rape I should like to state that I was heartened to see the formation of the Outrage Group which consists of housewives and other concerned people. Many of them come from my constituency and they got together in response and put forward a number of demands.  One of them was that where sentences imposed are inappropriate there should be a right of review by way of appeal to a higher court.  In this instance we are talking about a review, about redressing the wrongs visited on the families or victims by inappropriate sentences imposed by our courts.  We are not talking about every case.  We are attempting to lay down guidelines, to lay down a pattern that will give direction to <Col N="1302" /> those concerned as to what is an appropriate sentence.  We have to address that issue because there does not appear to be a willingness on the part of the Department, or the Minister, to take a leading role on this.  Equally, there does not appear to be a commitment or a disposition among the Judiciary to get together to discuss this matter and work to develop a sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>The Bill is good in that it provides the vehicle and the impetus for the Judiciary to address the question of sentencing. The Minister threw into the pot of issues to be looked at the question of whether it was appropriate for courts to deliberate on sentences or, more particularly, for the prosecutor to address the court on what is an appropriate sentence.  That is what takes place at present.  Prosecutors are constantly invited to give their comments and do so.  The Minister has thrown that issue into the pot suggesting that there is more to this than meets the eye. An oversight in the Bill is the failure to provide time limits.  There must be a strict time limit of 14 days maximum on the prosecutor to indicate his intention to seek an application to review a sentence. Those issues should be addressed and that could have been done had the Government agreed to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>The Bill clearly involves sentence review upwards.  There is no doubt that a person who receives a heavy sentence and is dissatisfied with it will appeal on his own and argue that the sentence should be reduced.  In the Bill we are talking about increasing sentences in unusual cases.  That raises the whole question of whether our prisons can tolerate more people being sentenced.  It begs the whole question of whether we should have sentencing guidelines or a policy for the Judiciary.  It is my view that we should have such guidelines. Our courts, while independent in their functions, have a service to deliver to the community.  They must help us <Col N="1303" /> combat and deal with crime.  The problem is that all too often they do not appear to be tuned into what we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>This issue was drawn to my attention recently in a most horrendous way.  I should like to relate to the House details of a case that sums up the way our courts have gone completely off the rails with regard to sentencing.  The case involved a 20-year-old from Finglas West in the city of Dublin.  He was unemployed, did not have previous convictions and was never in trouble with the law before. When travelling home on a bus he paid a fare which he believed to be the correct one.  An inspector demanded that he should pay an extra 35p to bring the fare to what the inspector believed to be the correct fare.  The youth indicated that he did not have that amount of money and he was prepared to get off the bus.  The inspector refused to let him off the bus and he called the police.  The youth was brought before the Children's Metropolitan District Court and prosecuted for the outrageous offence of not having an extra 35p.  He was remanded twice on bail by the court and when he appeared on 27 April he had been assigned a solicitor under the criminal legal aid scheme.  The district justice decided that he wanted the inspector in court to tell him more about this horrendous offence and he remanded the youth in custody to St. Patrick's Institution for one week. That young man was prepared to get off the bus and walk home but for 35p District Justice Paul McDonnell believed that the place for him was St. Patrick's Institution for one week.  When the case came before the court again the district justice, having heard what the inspector and the probation officer had to say about the incident, gave the youth the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act and dismissed the charge.</P>
    <P>That illustrated more than anything how the courts are completely out of touch with what we are attempting to <Col N="1304" /> do in trying to combat crime or reserve places in prison for particular offenders. There is no clear sentencing policy.  That young person should not have been sent to St. Patrick's Institution for one week under those circumstances.  Indeed, it could be argued that the young man should not have been charged in the first place.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Minister for Justice, in getting off his chest as much as he did in this House yesterday at Question Time in regard to events at Mountjoy Prison, maintained in answer to questions by myself and others that the alternatives to imprisonment were being fully looked into.  He went on to say that 3,000 persons were committed to alternative schemes to imprisonment and that there were 2,000 in custody.  I do not accept that argument and it is quite clear that the Whitaker Report of 1985, which the Minister says he has adhered to since he came to office ten months ago, is being ignored in this important area of sentencing and in attempting to invoke alternatives to imprisonment.</P>
    <P>At page 44 of the Whitaker Report, under the heading &ldquo;Extension and Strengthening of Non-Custodial Penalties&rdquo; four or five specific areas are dealt with which the committee felt should be looked at by the Government.  I do not have time now to go into them in detail but none of these areas has been developed.  To give one example, the committee considered that in principle &mdash; and as far as possible in practice &mdash; fines and custodial penalties should be kept separate.  However, we still put between 200 and 250 people into prison every year because they cannot pay fines.</P>
    <P>Last week a married separated mother with three young children came to my clinic pleading with me to intercede with the Minister in regard to a term of imprisonment for one month for non-payment of her TV licence which she felt should not be imposed because of her inability to pay.  Two men &mdash; one from my constituency &mdash; were committed to prison for <Col N="1305" /> non-payment of ground rent.  Who can argue that we are reserving prison to combat serious crime when we are using valuable places for so many people who should never have been imprisoned in the first place?</P>
    <P>The report talks about non-custodial orders being made and people with habitual problems in regard to drink and drugs being obliged to comply with those orders as opposed to simply locking them up in prison.  Any attempt to increase or to overload the already overcrowded prison system must also incorporate a commitment to seriously reduce and review the type of prisoner we are committing to jail and what we do with them when they are locked up.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have had the opportunity to address the Bill and I commend the Fine Gael Party for bringing it forward. I had hoped that the Minister would have taken the opportunity of realising that it was a concrete proposal addressing a particular problem.  Instead of drumming up a list of spurious and unimaginative reasons for not supporting the Bill he should have allowed it to progress to Committee Stage.  In the event of defeat I urge the Minister to bring forward his alternative proposals in this House so that this important issue can be addressed and our law improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to improve the administration of justice in our courts by seeking to introduce a system of appeal which will be available to the State prosecutor &mdash; the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; against what are perceived to be over-lenient sentences along the lines laid out in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed that the introduction of this procedure into our system of justice will help to defuse public controversy which erupts from time to time because of decisions by the courts which are deemed to be too lenient in relation to convicted criminals.  It is contended by the movers of the Bill that the evidence of this public controversy arises where <Col N="1306" /> non-custodial sentences are imposed for serious crimes such as murder, manslaughter or rape.</P>
    <P>While the independence of the Judiciary is accepted, it is felt by the movers of the Bill that the relative severity of sentences handed down may from time to time &mdash; albeit in rare circumstances &mdash; require the exercise of this new right of appeal by the State to review the sentence imposed.  This right of appeal is envisaged only in the case of the Central Criminal Court, the Special Criminal Court and the Circuit Criminal Court.  There will be a review of the severity of sentence only to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The <i>raison d'etre</i> of the Bill is that the punishment must be seen to fit the crime.  It is stated that the background to the proposal is that there is a need for broad consistency in sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>The point was also made, in support of the Bill, that the knowledge of such a power being vested in the Director of Public Prosecutions would give some comfort to the victims of crime while the case was being proceeded with.  The Minister's speech, while acknowledging the bona fides of the Deputy moving the Bill, pointed out that we are talking about a very small percentage of cases which might reasonably be expected to be appealed by the State if this power was given to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In requesting priority to be given to the whole question of sentencing policy by the Law Reform Commission, it is envisaged that they will be dealing with not just the aspect of the right to appeal by the State but also the whole question of trying to bring about more uniformity in sentencing.</P>
    <P>In this respect we must, as Deputy Flanagan pointed out, ensure that we retain a system whereby each case is judged on the evidence and circumstances pertaining to its own set of facts and that there would not be a slot machine system of justice whereby mandatory sentences are handed down <Col N="1307" /> without taking into account legitimate mitigating circumstances which do not excuse the crime but which, nevertheless, should have a bearing on the sentence to be imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister then outlined reservations about the provisions of the Bill which, it was contended by Deputy Flanagan, were rather minor difficulties which could be thrashed out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On reflection, I should like to have the considered opinion of the Law Reform Commission which, in turn, will be getting the views of experts in this field and other interested parties on the question, for example, of the right of appeal by the State where a suspended sentence is imposed.  In such an example the implications for the individual concerned would be fairly drastic and we had precisely such an incidence in a most tragic and unfortunate case which was decided this week.</P>
    <P>The time limit which should be imposed within which the prosecution could lodge an appeal is another question which must be answered.  What are the implications for the independence of the Judiciary who have at present total discretion under the Constitution in sentencing policy?  Would public comment be permitted where the sentence is appealed by the State?  It is envisaged in the provisions of this Bill that the Director of Public Prosecutions shall have power to take the appeal.  The involvement of the Director of Public Prosecutions is a question which requires a thorough examination and the promoters of the Bill are seeking to provide a procedure when, in appropriate cases, a review takes place to ensure that the public see that justice is done.  In such controversial cases the spotlight will be on the Director of Public Prosecutions to see if an appeal on the grounds of leniency of sentence will be lodged.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, in the exercise of his statutory <Col N="1308" /> function under section 2 (5) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, requires that the exercise of his function be independent and he may decide, contrary to the perceived public opinion, not to proceed with an appeal on the grounds envisaged in this Bill.  On the basis that this extra power being given to him is not being exercised in that particular case his independent decision may in fact heighten public controversy rather than lessen it.</P>
    <P>In the independent performance of his duties cases will arise whereby this power, if granted now, will not be used when the publicity attaching to the cases which generated public disquiet in the first place raised the expectation that the power of appeal would be exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The publicity which such cases attract would have the effect of anticipating a certain course of action by the Director of Public Prosecutions which may not, on the facts of the case, be warranted in his opinion. It would have the unintended effect of undermining public confidence in the courts in those circumstances.  It should also be pointed out that the Director of Public Prosecutions does not give reasons for the decisions he takes.  The rule about not giving reasons for decisions &mdash; for example, a decision not to prosecute &mdash; has existed since the foundation of the State and has been followed by successive Attorneys General and by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not seen fit to remain in the Chamber to listen to the points I want to make in regard to Cork Regional Hospital.  I am very pleased to have been given the opportunity to highlight the very serious problems which confront the Southern Health Board in the provision of an effective medical service at the Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>It must be said that it is only because of the persistent failure of the Minister to listen to the problems which have been related to him on numerous occasions by the Southern Health Board and by the staff of the hospital by way of an emergency press conference which was held on Thursday, 22 February, that I feel obliged to remind him once again of the very serious problems in that hospital.</P>
      <P>In a nutshell, the Southern Health Board need money for equipment and consultant staff and teams in the Cork Regional Hospital.  The Fox Report will not relieve the Minister of his obligation to deal with what is now nothing short of an emergency in the Cork Regional Hospital.  Indeed, such is the crisis in the hospital that in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> today it was reported that conditions in the hospital have deterioriated to such an extent that the health of the staff is being affected resulting in increased sick leave while morale is at an all time low.</P>
      <P>The Cork Regional Hospital should be the flagship of medical care in the south. It can offer not only regional but many national medical specialities to the public.  However, because of under-funding by the Department of Health over the past three years, the ability of the hospital to carry out these duties has been eroded and the public are suffering as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the kernel of the problem is under-funding.  In their letter of <Col N="1311" /> allocation to the Southern Health Board the Department of Health requested the board to maintain the service at the Cork Regional Hospital at 1989 levels. However, the Southern Health Board have been under-funded by £3 million which meant that the allocation to the Cork Regional Hospital has been reduced by £1.166 million.</P>
    <P>Public representatives from all parties, medical opinion both on and outside the board, management from CEO level down, and the suffering public, know only too well that the level of services in the Cork Regional Hospital cannot be maintained at 1989 levels given the level of funding which the Southern Health Board have received.  The Minister has met the chairman and chief executive officer of the board who have put their case to him on more than one occasion but he failed to respond to them.  I can only hope that the Department of Health have not closed their minds to these matters and that a favourable decision will be forthcoming immediately.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive response is needed to restore the Cork Regional Hospital to its former position.  Over 50 beds have been closed in the hospital and there is a two year waiting list for some orthopaedic operations.  The hospital has not received a specific capital allocation for equipment replacement since 1983. Because of the Minister's failure to provide a capital allocation, the board now propose to divert scarce resouces from their revenue account to purchase new equipment.  If equipment is not operable, the closure of further beds will be inevitable. No sanction was given by the Department for the purchase of equipment in 1990.  The following are essential to the continued operation of the hospital &mdash; telementry, which will cost £120,000; anaesthetic equipment, £120,000; a Gamma camera, £180,000; laboratory equipment, £110,000 and an electrical stand-by system, £80,000, giving a total of £610,000.  This money is urgently <Col N="1312" /> required by the Cork Regional Hospital. In addition, the x-ray equipment is near the end of its normal working life and a capital allocation of £400,000 is needed to replace it.  Staff and patients are frustrated at equipment breaking down and if this life saving equipment is not replaced, it will lead to unnecessary suffering and even death.</P>
    <P>Key staff shortages are also a major problem.  In October 1989 the board submitted a number of priority developments for 1990 to the Minister.  This included six consultant posts &mdash; a cardio-thoracic surgeon, a cardiologist, an anaesthetist, an orthopaedic surgeon, an urologist and a consultant in accident and emergency.  The filling of these posts would open up 35 additional beds and would reduce many of the long and unacceptable waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Mr. Fox will not find fault with Cork Regional Hospital or its management team.  If anything, they have been penalised to date for their efficiency and ingenuity by an annual reduction in their allocation.  I appeal to the Minister to lift the siege at the Cork Regional Hospital, to fill the key consultant posts and to give them a capital allocation for equipment.</P>
    <P>I have spent some time contemplating the Minister's reply.  I expect that he will refer to the Fox report, which I believe is a smokescreen the Minister can hide behind for not giving a reasonable allocation for the replacement of equipment and the filling of consultant posts at Cork Regional Hospital.  I also expect the Minister to tell me that there has been an 8 per cent gross increase in the allocation to the Cork Regional Hospital.  In effect, there will be only a 1 per cent net increase available to the board, unless the Minister has it in mind that we should renege on our responsibilities to pay and not to take account of the annual rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>The number of in-patients in the hospital in 1989 increased by 10 per cent <Col N="1313" /> while the accident and emergency numbers increased by 48 per cent.  I have figures which suggest that in comparison to hospitals of a similar size Cork Regional Hospital is not getting its fair share from the Department of Health. Three hospitals in the Dublin area, the same size as Cork General Hospital and offering similar services, received gross increases in their 1990 allocations from 16 to 19 per cent.  In his letter of allocation to the Southern Health Board for 1990 the Minister requested them to maintain services at the Cork Regional Hospital at their 1989 level.  To public representatives, medical opinion, the management of the Southern Health Board, their chief executive officer to the programme manager for the general hospitals section, to every member of the general public in the Southern Health Board area who has dealings with Cork Regional Hospital it is obvious that it is not possible &mdash; given the current level of allocation &mdash; to maintain that level of services.  It is likely that the level of activity in the Cork Regional Hospital will be significantly reduced because of the Minister's failure to sanction a number of consultancy posts, for which application has been with the Minister's Department a considerable time or to sanction the capital allocation necessary for replacement of essential medical equipment at Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>There is also a necessity for a capital allocation for the replacement of equipment at Mallow General Hospital.  In the interests of the health and welfare of the public who have dealings with Cork Regional Hospital I appeal to the Minister to respond favourably to this appeal, to effect an urgent capital allocation to the Southern Health Board in order to alleviate the position obtaining there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to highlight two issues in relation to the present finances of the Southern Health Board.  According to reports issued as recently as Monday last the revenue position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the level of service being provided is inadequate but would about break even if the Minister would make available the £340,000 approximately which he promised the board in respect of the influenza epidemic which occurred earlier in the year.  It is unfair of the Minister not to make that finance available immediately to the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to raise is that there has been no agreement reached with the banks with regard to the colossal interest paid to them, which is on the revenue side.  On the capital side, as was pointed out by the previous speaker, there is need for a further investment in order to maintain an efficient level of service.  It must be remembered that the hospital will only be as good as the staff running it and as good as the equipment with which they are provided to treat their patients.  That service cannot be maintained if such equipment is outdated and in need of replacement.  In such circumstances the Minister is obliged to make the necessary capital funding available. That capital funding is not being made available.  We are told that it is being allocated to the larger hospitals such as those in Cavan and Waterford, and in all the major hospitals that have been built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress the absolute urgency of providing equipment in Mallow General Hospital, requests for which have been with the Department since 1980, the main one being the provision of a generator and screening unit for barium meal x-rays for elderly people who have not been provided with this service because that <Col N="1315" /> unit has been out of commission since December last.  Those people will not go to Cork city and are, therefore, being denied that service.  I appeal to the Minister to give the House an assurance that that service will be provided.  There are also two posts remaining to be filled at Mallow General Hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say we are aware of the difficulties facing the Southern Health Board charged with primary responsibility for services at Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>Current personnel policy in the health services is that health agencies have autonomy to make necessary appointments within approved employment ceilings and financial allocations and, in the case of consultant posts, following approval by Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
      <P>The organisation and provision of services in a large flagship hospital is not an easy task.  As Deputies will know, however, it is a matter for the Southern Health Board, in the first instance, to determine the level of funds made available to the Cork Regional Hospital from within their allocation.  The allocation notified to the Southern Health Board for 1990 is £143 million, a very substantial sum.  Having received their allocation it is then a matter for the Southern Health Board to distribute resources in accordance with the board's priority.  The budget allocated to Cork Regional Hospital by the Southern Health Board for 1990 is at present £31.608 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the autonomy in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is autonomy to the Southern Health Board to decide their priority.  I should say I did not interrupt Deputy Creed.  I reiterate that that is autonomy devolved to the Southern Health Board to distribute the funds according to their priorities within their <Col N="1316" /> area of jurisdiction.  I might add that is the third highest allocation to any hospital in the country, that an extra £130 million was allocated to the health services in 1990 and that the Southern Health Board got their rightful, equitable and fair share of that huge increase.  In the past the impression has been given that Cork Regional Hospital received little or no capital funds from my Department in recent years.  I should like to outline briefly the extent of the capital funds which have been made available to the Southern Health Board for requirements at that hospital within the past two years, more particularly since the appointment of Dr. O'Hanlon as Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>There was a new regional ophthalmic unit opened at the Cork Regional Hospital late in 1988.  The unit building costs alone amounted to £1 million with an additional £250,000 being provided for equipment.  I stress, a total of £1.25 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of that was provided by way of voluntary subscription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is additionality.  I am talking about Exchequer investment. A total of £800,000 was provided for a new C.T. Scanner and ultrasound equipment. Also a capital grant of £200,000 was made available for neurosurgical equipment.  The purchase of other items of equipment at a cost of £144,500 was also approved.  In addition, in the last few weeks the Minister sanctioned capital funds of almost £185,000 for the purchase of a Gamma camera.  All of that amounts to over £2.5 million.  Therefore, the House will agree that that constitutes a significant investment by the Department of Health in the Cork Regional Hospital, that in very difficult financial circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we acknowledge there are still some equipment requirements at Cork Regional Hospital.  I might point out that the Government are preparing a five-year capital programme, the main <Col N="1317" /> objectives of which will be to ensure that the physical infrastructure is in place to meet the service goals we have set ourselves while ensuring that the fabric of existing services is maintained.  The position with regard to Cork Regional Hospital will be considered in that context, within the totality of similar demands from other hospitals and health care institutions throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputy and the House that neither the Minister nor myself or indeed the Department will hide behind any smoke screen, will not produce any manipulative statistics to sustain the standard facts that are there &mdash; showing that we have made a large investment in our health services and demonstrating that the Southern Health Board, and the Cork Regional Hospital, in particular, has got its fair share.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Sherlock I should say that we are aware of the position obtaining in Mallow General Hospital.  We appreciate the positive attitude adopted by the staff, consultants, medical and paramedical staff of the hospital and of the local people of Mallow. We are examining that position and will ascertain what we can do about it.</P>
    <P>I might add that this year this Government will invest £1.4 billion, or 21 per cent of our Exchequer budget, in the health services.  That is positive proof of our commitment to ensuring that we will have a constant, modern health care service for all our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for having given me the opportunity to raise this important issue.</P>
      <P>The recent decision in the Dunne <i>versus</i> National Maternity Hospital case &mdash; Dunne, infant, suing through his mother, the National Maternity Hospital and Dr. Reginald Jackson, the consultant &mdash; raises a number of fundamental questions of such public interest that only a full inquiry by the Minister for Health can allay public disquiet.</P>
      <P>The bizzare progress of the case raises profound issues of credibility about the administration of our National Maternity Hospital.  The public are unaware that, since 1982, the parents of William Dunne, who have endured so much, had been seeking information, first, from the hospital and, second, from successive Ministers for Health.  Both Deputy Woods and the former Deputy Barry Desmond communicated, through local Deputy Liam Kavanagh, that the report from the hospital confirmed that no fault lay with Holles Street.  Dr. O'Donnell, the chief medical adviser, confirmed there was no negligence on the part of the hospital.  The evidence which emerged later showed that the hospital report was seriously, apparently deliberately, deficient in a number of important respects.  For example, the evidence showed that meconium at grade I was observed at noon and at grade II at 4.20 p.m..  At a minimum, to any medical practitioner this was a recognised alarm bell that all might not be well.  This evidence was omitted from the hospital report.</P>

    <P>Other crucial evidence was concealed from the two Ministers and chief medical officer, all of whom acted on good faith. This raises a number of important questions, the most important being if there were to be a repeat of this tragedy next <Col N="1319" /> week could the public rely on the answer of the Minister for Health and could we have confidence in our National Maternity Hospital to tell the truth?</P>
    <P>Eminent witnesses were brought forward by the hospital to testify that it was hospital policy to monitor only one foetal heartbeat in the case of expected twins. The Dunne case was &ldquo;not a mistake&rdquo;, the hospital testified, merely the implementation of normal hospital policy.  The hospital persisted with this submission until ten women who had been delivered of twins at Holles Street before and since Kay Dunne testified for the plaintiffs that in all ten cases both foetal hearts were monitored.  Can the public trust the administration of our National Maternity Hospital?  For example, why did the hospital deny the existence of nurse Carmel Tierney, who was present at the birth, and the existence of her nursing notes taken at the time of the birth?  If they did so unwittingly, why, during the first trial, when nurse Tierney presented in court some two days after the denial, did the Holles Street council not take the opportunity to correct their evidence?</P>
    <P>If nurse Tierney's notebook, the existence of which was denied, had not accidentally fallen into the possession of lawyers for the plaintiffs would Holles Street still be claiming that nurse Tierney did not exist?  Who was the barrister who had a consultation with nurse Tierney when she presented at the first trial and, having gone through her notes, suggested that they were of little interest and that she should go home?  If, as the court accepted, he was not a member of the defendant's legal team, who was he and what was his role?  Did he similarly obstruct other material evidence and did he turn away other witnesses whose evidence might have been conclusive?</P>
    <P>The anguish endured by the Dunne family was prolonged by the decision of the Supreme Court to send the case back for retrial on the basis that the judge had misdirected the jury as to whether there <Col N="1320" /> was a general and approved policy of monitoring both foetal hearts.  In the light of subsequent evidence this was an irony but a painful irony for the Dunne family resulting in a further month's wait and a reduction in the award for young William's future of £600,000.  Suffice it to say if the Supreme Court were seized of the case next week there would be no question of a retrial.</P>
    <P>Qualities of courage, tenacity and sheer heroism on the part of the Dunne family determined the outcome of this case rather than reliance on hospital ethics or normal jurisprudence.  I am prepared to accept that the Minister for Health, like his predecessors, is acting in good faith.  However, I am satisfied that the public will share my disbelief at the reply he gave to my parliamentary question of 1 May seeking a full inquiry.  How can the Minister say as he did on 1 May that &ldquo;It is a matter for the board of management to regulate the affairs of the hospital and if, arising out of this case, any review of policies or procedures is to be carried out it would be the responsibility of the board to do so in the first instance&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>The difference between the present Minister and his predecessors, Deputy Woods and the former Deputy Barry Desmond, is that the present Minister knows what transpired in both the High Court and Supreme Court.  How can he wash his hands of a proper inquiry and say it is a matter for the very same people who were so economical with the truth in both the High Court and the Supreme Court?  Tens of thousands of Irish women are seeking satisfactory answers as to why such a bizarre profile of our National Maternity Hospital was presented in court.  I hope the Minister for Health accepts that the responsibility is his to reassure the public on such an important issue and to now agree to initiate the inquiry I have sought as a first step in this direction.</P>
    <P>This is a sad and sorry story of unacceptable standards in high places.  It is <Col N="1321" /> also a story of wheels within wheels, not all of which we yet know.  Later this week, I think on Friday, a book by Gene Kerrigan entitled <i>Nothing but the Truth</i> will be published by Tomar Publications and if the diligence of this journalist on this issue is anything to go by we can expect other issues of profound public importance to be raised by that book.</P>
    <P>Is this the kind of conduct one should expect from our National Maternity Hospital, a hospital which has deservedly such a high reputation, and is this the kind of conduct one should expect from those charged with the responsibility of running that hospital?  Why was it necessary to inflict additional pain on the longsuffering parents of the child, who had sacrificed everything, by the manner in which the hospital authorities decided to prosecute this case?  What, for example, would have happened if the ten women had not come forward to testify that eminent witnesses were lying?  If those ten women had not come forward, and it was their evidence which led to the collapse of the case, what would the outcome have been?  If the nursing notes of nurse Carmel Tierney taken at the time of the birth had not accidentally fallen into the possession of the lawyers for the plaintiffs, would the authorities in Holles Street still be denying not only the existence of the notebook but also of nurse Carmel Tierney herself?</P>
    <P>What is the Minister for Health's opinion of the Bar Council?  Is it not extraordinary that this <i>deus ex machina</i> figure of a barrister, who the court accepted was not acting for the defendants, was able to take aside this material witness and lead her to believe that her notes were of no interest and tell her to go home, and that we do not know the identity of the barrister?  Is it proper for a professional body, with the status of and with the role in society which the Bar Council have, not to conduct an inquiry into this extraordinary happening?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the most profound issues of public importance have been <Col N="1322" /> raised by this question and I sincerely hope the Minister will accept that it is his responsibility to reassure the public on these issues.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern in raising this very tragic case on the Adjournment this evening.  I am glad to have this opportunity to clarify my position in relation to the events referred to by the Deputy.  The first point that should be made is that the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, is a voluntary hospital and the Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for the board of management of the hospital to regulate their own affairs.  He will also appreciate that the staff are employed by the board of management of the National Maternity Hospital and not by the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, it is the responsibility of the board of management in the first instance to carry out any review of policies or procedures which they consider necessary arising from this case.  I am sure the board of the hospital will take note of the points made by the Deputy in the course of his remarks this evening.  I should add that if the circumstances of this or any other case should point to a need for a review of policies or procedures in a particular service, these matters would have to be dealt with as part of an overall review of the service concerned.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's concern regarding requests for information to the hospital in this case, I have been informed that these were dealt with by the hospital in the same way as other requests of this type where there is a possibility that legal proceedings might be instituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> The Deputy asked me in his parliamentary question of 1 May to consider the establishment of a statutory patients council.  The position is, as the House will recall, that I announced a detailed action plan for the health services on 6 February 1990.  That plan includes a significant initiative on the quality of patient care. In conjunction with this initiative I have invited the chief executive officers of the health boards and the secretary-managers of the voluntary hospitals to submit proposals to me as soon as possible for the introduction of appropriate feedback or complaints mechanisms in order to deal with complaints and improve the level of communication between hospital staff and patients.  These proposals will <Col N="1324" /> then be examined in the Department for the purpose of establishing suitable mechanisms of this type in all hospitals.</P>
    <P>With regard to the National Maternity Hospital generally, I am satisfied that a very high standard of service is provided by the hospital and I would be saddened if this very distressing case gave the impression that there was any diminution in the general level of care provided by the staff.</P>
    <P>I should say once more that I fully understand the Deputy's interest and concern in this very sad and tragic case. I am grateful to have this opportunity to reiterate my own position on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 May 1990.</P>

      <P>No.  The meeting on 2 April in Luxembourg between the European Community Troika and the Arab League Committee on the Intifada was devoted to the issue of Jewish settlements in the Occupied Territories.  I participated as President of the Foreign Ministers meeting in European Political Cooperation, along with my Troika colleagues, the Foreign Ministers of France and Italy and the Commissioner with responsibility for relations with the Mediterranean region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply of arms and explosives to Ireland by any member of the Arab League would be a bilaterial issue <Col N="1197" /> between Ireland and the country in question. The Dáil is aware that this question has arisen in relation to Libya and that it has been pursued bilaterally with Libya. As Libya was not represented at the meeting on 2 April, there was obviously no opportunity for me to pursue the matter further on that occasion.</P>
    <P>In a speech on 2 April in Baghdad, President Saddam Hussein revealed that Iraq possesses binary chemical weapons and threatened to use them against Israel if Israel attacked Iraq.  At the time of the Luxembourg meeting, the statement had not been seen or considered by the Twelve.  Thus, the Troika was not mandated to bring the matter up at the meeting.</P>
    <P>As Presidency, Ireland subsequently initiated consultations on the subject, which culminated in the issue on 20 April of a statement by the Twelve on the threatened use of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, a copy of which I have placed in the Dáil Library.</P>

US statistics for the year ending 30 September 1989 show that 10,185 US immigrant visas were issued to Irish citizens in the period. This latter figure does not include those Irish who may have emigrated illegally to the US last year and are therefore not featured in official US data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have attached a very high priority to efforts to improve the <Col N="1202" /> situation of our emigrants in the US.  To help alleviate the welfare problems encountered by some of those emigrants, we established the immigration working committees.</P>

      <P>The activities of nuclear submarines at sea are governed by international law.  Submarines have the right of innocent passage without notification through territorial waters provided they travel on the surface and fly their flags. They may pass freely through international waters, whether on the surface or submerged.</P>
      <P>While this is the position under international law, we believe that the matter cannot be left at that.  We are very seriously concerned about the dangers that submarines pose to shipping and about the nuclear hazard in the event of an accident involving nuclear powered or armed submarines.  We avail of every opportunity in international fora, such as the United Nations and the International Maritime Organisation, to focus attention on the general problem.  In addition, we have raised specific incidents with the authorities of the countries concerned and will continue to do so as the need arises.</P>

      <P>As has been pointed out a number of times in recent years by a number of my predecessors as Minister for Justice, in response to parliamentary questions on this matter, the introduction of any system of registration of security firms raises issues of considerable difficulty.  A registration system which attempted to <Col N="1211" /> provide for minimum standards of commercial practice by those engaged in the business would give rise to serious questions as to the criteria to be applied in the determination of those standards and raise also serious issues in relation to individual rights.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that an answer to any problems which may arise from the increasing number of security firms is to be found in statutory controls.  The position will, however, continue to be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Guidelines for the installation of control devices at pedestrian crossings are contained in document RT.206 published by An Foras Forbartha in January 1981.  The guidelines set out the different criteria under which the installation of a particular control device is justified in a given situation e.g. traffic conflict, variations in volumes of pedestrian and vehicle movements and accidents.  The criteria provide for a variety of combinations of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and cover both major urban and provincial town situations.  My Department is not aware of the alternative system referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that there is any crisis in post-graduate specialist training in medicine.</P>
      <P>Irish doctors have always had a tradition of going abroad in pursuit of further training and experience in order to further their careers.  The majority of doctors who go abroad return to take up senior medical posts bringing with them the benefit of training and experience obtained abroad.  Similarly this country has traditionally provided post-graduate training and experience for doctors from under developed countries.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that in recent times the proportion of doctors going abroad at an earlier stage in their careers has increased which in turn has increased our reliance on non-national doctors to fill non-consultant hospital doctor posts, particularly in the smaller hospitals.</P>
      <P>However as the Deputy may be aware all doctors employed in the public health service whether national or non-national doctors must be registered in the register of general practitioners maintained by the Medical Council.  This ensures that all medical personnel have an appropriate standard of training and clinical experience for the practice of medicine in this country.</P>

      <P>Connaught Airport is licensed for public use under the Air Navigation (Aerodromes and Visual Ground Aids) Order, 1970 (S.I. No. 291 of 1970).  Under the Order, applicants for aerodrome licences are required to provide operational information on the aerodrome facilities including landing and take-off distances.  While specifying and approving operating regulations, I do not regulate by means of the aerodrome licence the type of aircraft which may land or take-off at the aerodrome or the load which an aircraft may carry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Permissible take-off and landing weights vary with temperature, wind conditions, and the landing, take-off and emergency distances available.  It is the responsibility of the aircraft operator to establish maximum allowable operating weights in accordance with the limitations in the approved flight manual and <Col N="1218" /> in compliance with the operating regulations. I have no reason to doubt that operations are being conducted at Connaught Airport in accordance with the approved operating regulations.</P>
