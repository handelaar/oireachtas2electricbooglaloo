      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Taoiseach, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A representation of the Derrynaflan Chalice was reproduced on the dinner menu cover on the occasion of the last European Council, 28 April 1990.  The Heads of State or Government present <Col N="1880" /> at that Council expressed keen interest in the chalice and its historical context. It was decided to give them an opportunity to see the chalice on their return to Dublin for the June Summit.  As there would not be sufficient time for the Heads of State or Government to visit the National Museum, the Derrynaflan Chalice will be on display at Malahide Castle on Monday evening, 25 June 1990, when the Heads of State or Government will attend a function there.</P>
    <P>The chalice will be shown in a sealed, climate controlled exhibition case specially provided by the National Museum. The highest standards of packing, transport and security, under the supervision of the competent professional staff of the National Museum, will be observed.</P>
    <P>The chalice is currently on display in the National Museum together with other masterpieces of Celtic metalwork from the period 6th to 9th century in an exhibition entitled &ldquo;The Work of Angels&rdquo;.  It should be a matter of pride for us that the Heads of State or Government expressed such interest in the chalice.  Their interest should stimulate interest generally in viewing the chalice and the other masterpieces which accompany it in the exhibition at the museum.  I may add that the Heads of State or Government will view the chalice after the exhibition has closed for the day and it will be returned before the exhibition opens the next day.</P>
    <P>I decry, and am bitterly disappointed at, the attempts made to suggest that this viewing of the chalice by the leaders of Europe is anything other than a proper and courteous response to an interest expressed by them in one of our national treasures.  I would also emphasise that the chalice, as it deserves, will be displayed in a dignified and respectful manner under conditions prescribed by the professional staff of the museum.</P>
    <P>I would further emphasise my own deep personal interest in the Derrynaflan Hoard.  I visited the museum the day it arrived there with the clay of centuries still clinging to it and I have fully supported the museum staff in all their work associated with the hoard at every stage. I yield to no Deputy in this House in <Col N="1881" /> my reverence for and attachment to the Derrynaflan Chalice and Hoard.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out that I approved the making of a grant of £150,000 to enable the Derrynaflan Hoard and other museum treasures to be included in the &ldquo;Work of Angels&rdquo; Exhibition being organised in London and Edinburgh in conjunction with the British Museum and the National Museum of Scotland so as to give the people of Britain and Scotland the opportunity to see these treasures.  The chalice was also put on display in Cork and Cahir when Deputy Nealon was the Minister responsible for it and he, in fact, opened those exhibitions.  I commend him for that action, which is in keeping with the policy many Deputies have been advocating of displaying artefacts from our National Museum at centres around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to cite one precedent for this extraordinary decision to display a piece of national treasure at a dinner for Heads of Government.  Will the Minister indicate any other occasion when in any other jurisdiction a national treasure of any member state was displayed on the dining table of the guest nation?  Will the Minister agree that it is particularly regretful, that when the excellent exhibition, &ldquo;The Work of Angels&rdquo;, is taking place at the National Museum, it is not there that the Heads of State are being brought to see the Derrynaflan Hoard and our other fine treasures?  Will the Minister agree that the whole saga and decision has set off a regrettable set of requests, best illustrated by that to exhibit the Derrynaflan Chalice at the Nenagh's EC hooley with the Minister for Agriculture and Food looking for it for his constituency?  Will there be any end to this abuse of our national treasures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's suggestion that this is not a proper occasion for the display of one of our national treasures.  As Minister for Education, I advocated bringing the Ardagh Chalice, the Tara Brooch and the Book of Kells to New York, Boston and San Francisco.  That was quite a hazardous and worrying journey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>They were brought back in perfect condition and their delightful artistry was made available to thousands of people in the United States.  That happened also in Europe.  When we have something which is really worth while, which can stand up artistically internationally, then it is to the benefit of the country and to the morale of the country to put it on display whenever possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given as his reason the great interest expressed by the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, and others in seeing the Derrynaflan Chalice.  Does the Minister believe that if the Taoiseach professed an interest in the Crown Jewels they would be displayed on a banquet table in London for him?</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment the Deputy for having himself shown the Derrynaflan Chalice in Cahir and Cork when he was responsible for it. All I can do is repeat that the product of the skilled hands that produced the Derrynaflan Chalice should be shown to as many people as possible.  It is the product of the hands of Irish craftsmen.  I hope that when Jack Charlton comes back, the product of the skilled feet of Irishmen will also be on display.</P>

      <P>Ag tagairt don cheist, tá sé ráite ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil an t-eolas foilsithe. Níl sé, mar shampla, ar cheist 3.  Chuir mé an cheist, cén áit a bhfoilsítear na hirisí agus na nuachtáin éagsúla.  Níl an t-eolas sin sa tábla a luaigh sé, agus chomh maith leis sin, níl an t-eolas faoin díolaíocht atá ar gach ceann acu sa tábla ach an oiread.

Ach an cheist dheireanach a ba mhaith liom a chur air ná, nach gcuireann sé imní air féin agus ar Aire na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil irisí curtha i gcló agus ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht, agus an bhfuair sé aon iarratas ó aon dream atá lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht maidir le hiris nó nuachtán a chur ar fáil.</P>

      <P>Agus mé ag seoladh an fhoilseacháin sin go hoifigiúil, dúirt mé gur obair chruthaitheach a bhí ann cé go bhfuil fírinní searbha, b'fhéidir, curtha faoinár mbráid ag an údar.  Aithnítear go coitianta nach bhfuil labhairt na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra chomh folláin nó chomh forleathan agus ba mhaith linn í a bheith sa Ghaeltacht ina hiomláine, agus tagann na conclúidí san fhoilseachán leis an méid sin.  Mar sin féin, caithfear a rá go bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo bríomhar mar theanga pobail in a lán ceantair Ghaeltachta agus níor chóir bheith éadóchasach faoina todhchaí.  Ní fhágtar gan dóchas muid tar éis an foilseachán seo a léamh.</P>
      <P>Cé go mbíonn athbhreithniú leanúnach á dhéanamh ar scéimeanna mo Roinnse, níl leasuithe sonracha beartaithe de thoradh an fhoilseacháin seo ach scrúdófar na moltaí ann maidir le sonraí breise a sholáthar i ndáil le feidhmiú scéim labhairt na Gaeilge.  Tá clár ríomhaireachta á réiteach ag mo Roinnse faoi láthair chun freastal ar an scéim áirithe seo.</P>

    <P>Leanfar leis na scéimeanna atá á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse agus ag Údarás na Gaeltachta ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú mar ghnáth-theanga an phobail sna ceantair ina bhfuil sí fós amhlaidh. Leanfar fosta leis na hiarrachtaí chun an <Col N="1887" /> Ghaeilge a láidriú sna ceantair a bhfuil sí níos laige iontu.  Tá léirithe ag údar an fhoilseacháin seo gur fearr a sheas an teanga an fód in áit a raibh fostaíocht ar fáil, agus molann sé tuilleadh staidéir a dhéanamh ar an tionchar atá ag deiseanna fostaíochta agus deiseanna oideachais ar chaomhnú na teanga.</P>

Tá go leor scéimeanna ann agus dúirt mé leis an Teachta, agus mé ag freagairt ceiste anseo, go bhfuil mé réidh le héisteacht le moltaí ar bith ó dhuine ar bith, agus go hárithe, ó Chomhaltaí an Tí seo.

I leith teangeolaíochta tá sé ráite i dtuarascáil Udarás na Gaeltachta agus tá sé ráite sa tuarascáil seo, nach bhfuil a ndóthain airgid acu, go speisialta chun an teanga a chur ar fáil; agus, chomh maith leis sin, cáineann an tuarascáil chéanna an chaoi a bhfuil difríocht idir polasaí an <Col N="1888" /> Roinn Oideachais, Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta.

An aontódh an tAire gurb é an fáth go bhfuil sé ag cothú trioblóide ná, nuair a leagadh síos an scéim na blianta ó shin gurbh é an coinníoll a bhí ann, gurb í an Ghaeilge teanga theaghlaidh an dalta. Bhí sé sin ceart go leor nuair a bhí muintir na Gaeltachta agus gan acu ach Gaeilge, ach tá rudaí ag athrú agus tá an Ghaeltacht dátheangach anois.  Nach n-aontódh an tAire go bhfuil athrú á dhéanamh ar an scéim sin agus béim á cur ar theanga labhartha an dalta in ionad teanga theaghlaigh.  Tá a fhios againn go léir go bhfuil daltaí ann a bhfuil ardchumas Gaeilge acu.  B'fhéidir nach í an Ghaeilge teanga labhartha an teaghlaigh, ach nuair a bhíonn ardchumas Gaeilge ag an pháiste nárbh fhiú athmhachnamh a dhéanamh ar an scéim?

Glacaim leis an phointe atá á dhéanamh ag an Teachta McGinley, agus, mar a dúirt mé leis an Teachta Michael D. Higgins, bím breá sásta i gcónaí scrúdú a dhéanamh ar mholtaí, agus geallaim don Teach go ndéanfar é sin agus más féidir é a dhéanamh níos fearr chun seans a thabhairt don <Col N="1889" /> aos óg Gaeilge a labhairt, tá mé sásta é a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Pointe amháin a ba mhaith liom a dhéanamh: mar a dúradh san fhoilseachán, tá an fhostaíocht iontach tábhachtach. Tá an-bhéim curtha againn sa Roinn agus san Údarás ar fhostaíocht agus ar fhorbairt ár n-acmhainní nádúrtha. Déanfar machnamh ar na pointí a thóg an Teachta McGinley agus an Teachta Higgins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 10, 35, 41 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I reject any suggestions that there has been a delay on the Government's part in relation to this matter.  The Government and I are committed to upgrading this line provided, of course, EC funding can be made available in such a way as not to render urgently needed domestic projects impossible.  The Dublin-Belfast rail project has for some time now been one of the transport proposals under discussion with the EC Commission.  The board of CIE advised me that they had decided that the upgrading of the line is desirable and that they would support the necessary investment provided that an adequate level of grant aid would be available.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of the Dublin-Belfast project in our operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructure must depend on the level of EC grant assistance which can be secured under that programme and the competing claims of other public transport projects on the available resources, particularly the proposed rail link from Clondalkin to the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community initiatives programme, supplementing the Structural Funds, is a further possible source, however, of EC grant assistance for the Dublin-Belfast project.  Moreover, as recently as 5 June, I again raised with the EC Transport Commissioner the possibility of assistance for the Dublin-Belfast project from the proposed special EC <Col N="1891" /> transport infrastructre fund, the establishment of which may be agreed by the Council of Ministers shortly.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that I will continue to explore all options for EC assistance for this project, subject to the constraints of competing priority projects in the public transport field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that he has been prevaricating on this issue for over 12 months?  The Community of European Railways have recognised the importance of this line and that it is part of a major European rail and sea route linking Belfast, Dublin and Cork with Brussels, Amsterdam, Paris and Basle. The importance of this line has also been recognised by the Northern Ireland Railways who have made submissions to Europe to upgrade it.  Therefore, will the Minister agree that the only thing holding up the upgrading of the line is his prevarication? Will he also agree that, if he does not support Northern Ireland Railways in the upgrading of the line, it is destined for ultimate closure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy is aware we are dealing with questions nominated for priority to which only 15 minutes apply.  If I am to dispose of the five questions involved brevity is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  Is the Minister conscious of the fact that the railway will ultimately be closed if it is not upgraded and that all that is required by way of capital funds from the State is a miserable £15 million in investment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must keep this matter in perspective.  Of course Northern Ireland Railways are keen to go ahead with upgrading the line; so are CIE.  However, the difference is that the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment are prepared to make a substantial investment in the line.  I have to see whether I can match that.  I want to <Col N="1892" /> clearly state that the Government and I are committed to an upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast line.  At present the journey takes about one hour and 55 minutes and the expenditure of £60 million would cut 20 minutes off the journey.  If I go ahead with this I would probably have to abandon one or two domestic projects and find £20 million of taxpayers' money to cut 20 minutes off the journey.  I totally reject any question of a closure of the line and as soon as I can encourage the European Communtiy to allocate funds to this project I will certainly go ahead with its upgrading.</P>

      <P>A brief and final question from Deputy Byrne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Northern Ireland Railways have decided to downgrade to a single line the section between Portadown and the Border unless he is forthcoming with funds? Hundreds of millions of pounds have been made available for building roads &mdash; a sum of £212 million has been allotted under the National Development Plan &mdash; and a miserable £36 million have been provided for public transport.  Does the Minister expect the public to believe that he cannot get sufficient funds through the European Community to upgrade the railway?  We are only talking about between £10 million and £15 million and when that is balanced against the road building programme it is a disgrace&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entering the realm of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that there is no question of the line being closed or no threat from the Northern Ireland authorities to do so.  I will give the Deputy the figures.  I have £95 million available to me for public transport under Structural Funds; of that £15 million has been agreed with Brussels for bus and rail transportation which I will have to match with another £15 million to £20 million of Government moneys.  The Deputy can see that projects which are urgently needed, like Clondalkin and Tallaght, <Col N="1893" /> could not go ahead if I spent the money upgrading the other line.  It is my job, therefore, to prioritise these matters and I am of the view that I should go ahead with the Clondalkin and Tallaght projects &mdash; or other urgent projects &mdash; while remaining committed to the Belfast line, and I shall try to get other funding for it. Last week I had discussions with the EC Commissioner, in which I formally asked him to assist the Dublin-Belfast project by upgrading the line under a new fund which may be established, the transport infrastructure fund.  I am committed to this line but I must get my priorities in order.</P>

      <P>The accounts of each of the State companies under the aegis of my Department are audited by firms of auditors, appointed by the boards of the companies subject to my consent.  In the case of the air companies the relevant Acts provide for consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The State companies are required to submit audited reports and accounts annually to me, which are, in turn, laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The accounts are submitted in a standard format agreed between my Department, the Department of Finance and the state companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accounting policy and procedures and the internal audit function are matters for the boards.  However, at the behest of my Department, audit committees are in operation in the four commercial State <Col N="1894" /> companies under the aegis of my Department. In addition, my Department receive interim unaudited accounts on a regular basis for the purposes of monitoring performance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <P>I can tell the Deputy that all audited accounts are submitted to my Department on a monthly basis by CIE and B &amp; I and on a quarterly basis by Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  Of course, such accounts are screened initially by the boards of the relevant companies and then by the audit committees. My Department keep in very close touch and carefully examine these monthly and quarterly accounts submitted to them.  Indeed, on an almost week-in-week-out basis they maintain contact with the companies in regard to their financial and operational activities.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of accountants, I am quite satisfied that the expertise available to my Department is sufficient.  In this area we do engage consultant accountants from time to time to examine particular companies or projects. I will maintain a close eye on that aspect.</P>

      <P>Now that we have established that there are no accountants in his Department &mdash; indeed I might add that his Department did not do very well in discovering what had happened in the case of Aer Lingus &mdash; can the Minister assure the House there is no further difficulty being encountered within the Aer Lingus group of companies, that no other section of Aer Lingus has been up to the same sort of activity as Aer Lingus Holidays?  Can he give the House an assurance that that is the case?  Has he caused inquiries to be made into their other subsidiaries?  Furthermore, would he agree with the recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts that the Comptroller and Auditor General should play a role in inspection of and reporting on State-sponsored bodies when issues of this type are involved?</P>

      <P>I should tell the Deputy that the Chairman of Aer Lingus has informed me that a comprehensive action programme &mdash; part of which has already been implemented &mdash; is under way to substantially strengthen financial controls within the Aer Lingus group. The Assistant Chief Executive, Finance, who was recruited from outside the group last September, is now in the process of filling seven new senior finance appointments as part of a reorganisation of the group.  In addition, steps are now being taken to strengthen substantially the group's corporate legal function and specific recommendations are being developed in that regard.  The chairman has also assured me that all appropriate steps are being taken to prevent a recurrence of irregularities anywhere within <Col N="1896" /> the Aer Lingus group such as occurred in the case of the holiday company.  He has also informed me that &mdash; as I requested &mdash; arrangements are being made for a phased, orderly withdrawal by Aer Lingus Holidays from the tour operating business at the end of the current season. The chairman has also advised me that, arising from the Craig Gardner report, the board of Aer Lingus have decided that certain legal action should be initiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 17 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided in 1987 that no further consideration should be given to extending the DART system, because of the high costs of such development and the scarcity of financial resources. Following this decision CIE submitted transport investment plans for the greater <Col N="1897" /> Dublin area involving bus-based options and diesel services on existing rail lines.</P>
    <P>Most of the bus proposals in the plans have already been implemented.  The plans also proposed the construction of four new stations on the railway line from Maynooth to the city centre.  I am pleased to say that these new stations will be open in July.  The proposal for a new commuter rail service between Clondalkin and the city centre &mdash; with eight new stations and feeder bus services to Tallaght &mdash; has been submitted for EC Structural Fund assistance.  Further developments in relation to the Clondalkin project must await the outcome of the request for EC aid.  This application and other options are being pursued urgently by my Department with Brussels.</P>
    <P>I have received a number of outline proposals in recent months, including the one referred to by Deputy Byrne, for the provision of a light rail system in the Dublin area.  These proposals involve, <i>inter alia,</i> utilisation of the old Harcourt Street railway line and provide for a linkup with Tallaght.</P>
    <P>An inter-departmental working group, chaired by a senior officer of my Department, and comprising representatives of the Departments of the Environment and Finance, Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, the Dublin Transportation Task Force, Iarnród Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath, has been established to assess and report as soon as possible on the feasibility of rail and busway options for public passenger transport in relation to the former Harcourt Street railway line and the Tallaght area, having regard to: engineering and operational considerations; traffic management implications; capital and operational costs; the scope for private sector participation in the provision and operation of services; and environmental impact, having regard also to the extent to which EC funding may be available.</P>
    <P>The working group, which has met on three occasions to date, is proceeding with their work as a matter of urgency <Col N="1898" /> and I expect to receive their report shortly.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would again emphasise that the Government &mdash; who are at present providing over £110 million annually for essential public transport services &mdash; are committed to the development of an efficient and cost-effective system of public transport for Dublin and for the rest of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a role for Aer Rianta in developing a DART system to the airport in conjunction either with DART, Iarnród Éireann, or some other part of the CIE group, since that company has successfully developed into other ancillary services, since servicing the airport would be in their interest as much as in the commuters' interest and since they would appear to have the necessary resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see a real link developed to the airport.  Without raising any expectations &mdash; because I cannot do so &mdash; I should say I am probing that issue to ascertain whether there is any possibility of so doing.  To an extent I have put that back on the agenda, but I stress only as something I would want to examine.  I am not sure that Aer Rianta should be involved in running land-based public transport systems; it is not really their business.  Nonetheless, I will bear the Deputy's comments in mind when investigating that overall position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, whatever about the need for motorways around the city and county of Dublin, there is no need for them through the city centre?  If he agrees with me in that respect, would he make this view known to the relevant local authorities &mdash; that there is no need for such motorways but rather that the long-term interests of the city would best be served by some type of rapid transport system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general point, I have no difficulty in agreeing with the Deputy that rail-based and bus-based <Col N="1899" /> options &mdash; light rail, heavy rail and bus-based &mdash; in the development of a public transport system in a capital city obviously are a better option.  That would be my private view on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>A joint plan by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and Bord Fáilte &mdash;<i>Promoting Irish Tourism 1991-1993</i>&mdash; was formally presented to me on 24 May last.  The plan is currently being examined in my Department, and the question of the level of Exchequer funding for tourism in the light of this plan will be considered by Government in the context of the Estimates for 1991, the projected first year of the plan's operation.</P>
      <P>As far as the potential of Irish tourism in terms of expansion and jobs is concerned, the Government have set out their targets for the sector in the Operational Programme for Tourism for the period 1989-1993, namely, to increase overseas visitor numbers by 90 per cent, overseas tourism revenue by £500 million and, in the process, create 25,000 new jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now into the second year of this programme.  On the basis of the 1989 results, when overseas visitor numbers <Col N="1900" /> and revenue increased by 16 per cent, creating an estimated 5,000 new jobs, and having regard to the trend in the first four months of this year, I am confident that the targets will be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is concern in some sectors of the tourist industry that in the absence of a substantial increased expenditure on aid, the anticipated growth in jobs in the tourism industry will not be achieved in the short term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, Deputy, I am satisfied we are more than meeting our targets at present and we are well ahead of targets in terms of tourist numbers.  While I accept that tourist numbers bear a strong relationship to marketing, they also have a lot to do with other things such as access transport costs, airline charges, access ferry charges and how we handle our environment. I have the report from Bord Fáilte and the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, but I remain to be convinced that spending additional moneys necessarily brings in a <i>pro rata</i> increase in business.</P>
      <P>I want to make sure that Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry have the right amount of money and not necessarily more money.  I know the Deputy will appreciate from his previous work in this area that the industry are now beginning to do well as a result of the pick up in business and more and more they will have to help to fund the costs of promoting the industry.  I am anxious that the tourist industry themselves will use their own money to back Government money in the promotion of tourism.  The Government will not be found wanting in this area but the industry must contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise three points in response to the Minister's reply. First, the details from the CSO of numbers coming in and out of this country &mdash; I know the Minister accepts this to a point &mdash; cannot be absolutely accurately related to tourism because of our abnormally high levels of emigration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Second, the overwhelming majority in Irish tourism do not have the resources to engage in substantial marketing and promotion and that is the reason the State should intervene. Finally, would the Minister accept that State expenditure on tourism is totally insignificant when compared with expenditure in other sectors such as agriculture or industry when account is taken of the value of the Irish tourist industry to the national economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the numbers who visit the country are not the only measure and that is why I have laid fresh emphasis on the earnings from those who come and the jobs created as a result.  Quite frankly, I am much more interested in the jobs and the cash we can get as a result of visitors than in the numbers coming through.</P>

      <P>I am advised by Aer Lingus that procedures are currently in train to sell the Aer Lingus Holidays business as a going concern.  This is the preferred option for withdrawal from the business, and would provide the best prospect for continued employment for staff members.</P>
      <P>I have asked Aer Lingus to deal with this problem as effectively and sensitively as possible.  I have expressed the view that, as suitable new opportunities arise in Aer Lingus, preference should be given as far as possible to the staff of Aer Lingus Holidays.  In this context, it should be noted that Aer Lingus recruited over 1,000 new employees over the past two years.</P>

      <P>Proposals for fiscal harmonisation, including the possible imposition of a positive rate of VAT on passenger transport and the possible abolition of duty free sales within the Community, are being examined by the EC Council of Finance Ministers.</P>
      <P>Under the Commission proposals; as now modified by the Council of Ministers, two rates of VAT are envisaged &mdash; a standard rate in the range of 14 per cent to 20 per cent for general application to goods and services and a reduced rate in the range of 4 per cent to 9 per cent for a limited number of items.  At present, international sea and air passenger transport within the Community is zero rated for VAT purposes.  Under the Commission proposals, the reduced rate of VAT of 4 per cent to 9 per cent would apply to such transport.</P>
      <P>While agreement has been reached by the Council of Finance Ministers in relation to the broad outline VAT structure to apply post-1992, negotiations on the individual elements which would form part of the total package are still at a very preliminary stage.  It is apparent, however, that the abolition of duty free sales within the Community is unlikely to occur in the near future, given its relatively low priority in terms of the main issues involved in fiscal harmonisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, very much aware of the concerns of the tourism and transport sectors about these issues.  I share these <Col N="1907" /> concerns and my Department have written to the EC Commission outlining the serious implications for our tourist industry of any changes in relation to VAT and duty free sales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement.  Would he confirm whether he is supporting the retention of the duty free facilities at our sea and air ports? Does he agree that there is a potential increase in air fares of between 20 and 37 per cent and sea ferries would suffer even more dramatically, with not only a loss of income from the duty free facilities but also a loss of passengers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it quite clear to the EC Commission that I am totally opposed to the suggested changes in duty free sales.  I have sought to retain the present position.  I should mention to the Deputy that these changes would apply only to duty free sales within the Community; transatlantic traffic, which makes up a significant part of our business, would not be affected.  I have made my views known equally strongly in regard to the suggested changes in VAT as they would affect the tourist industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of judgment in many cases.  Depending on the airline used and the conditions on the Dublin-London route, the economy fare ranges from £120 to £216; and the Cork-London route from £154 to £250.  There is a difference here because of the distance. On the Belfast-London route the fares range from as low as £58 to £164.  To answer if the charges are comparable would depend on the figures one uses &mdash; whether it is mile by mile or the figures overall.  If one looks at the figures overall, there is a difference brought about by different policies of different companies. <Col N="1917" /> That is why I am trying to encourage more competition in the airways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister said the fares on the Dublin-London route were reasonable.  Surely the kernel of the answer was that the fares on the Cork-London route are unreasonable. When you look at the comparison the Minister has given us for the Belfast-London and Cork-London routes it is dreadfully unreasonable.  Could he please endeavour to see that the people of Cork and Munster generally get a fair crack of the whip where air fares are concerned?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I was not clear.  I said the Dublin-London routes are reasonably comparable with those on the London-Cork and London-Belfast routes if one takes those factors into account.  If one takes the actual fare only into account, then one could conclude that they do not compare reasonably.  Air fares are critical to the economy.  I keep them down by competition and I have to approve price increases, which I am very slow to do.</P>

I should like to make it clear that I would be willing to talk to any airline that wants to fly these routes. The more airlines and the more competition we have on these routes the better I like it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a vast difference between the fares charged on the Belfast-London route compared with the other two routes, thereby disadvantaging the people who travel Dublin-London?  Can he confirm that those fares charged on the Dublin-London route and on the Cork-London route comply with EC regulations? Can he further confirm that in 1992 and thereafter if changes take place he will make representations to the airlines concerned to bring the air fares into line with those on the Belfast-London route?</P>

      <P>Next week in Luxembourg the EC member states will return to the question of opening up the airways in Europe.  We are endeavouring to have passed at European level the second air liberalisation programme, which, in effect, allows more airlines to fly to more places, with fewer regulations. The airline industry is one of the most regulated industries there is throughout Europe.  On assuming this brief, I was amazed by the extent of the regulation.  The same is true here, although to a lesser extent.  We are doing everything possible, at EC level, to open up the skies as by doing this there will be more competition, which, in turn, will lead to more sensible prices.  With regard to the Belfast-London route, I indicated that the prices range from £58 to £164 while, on the Dublin-London route, prices run from £120 to £216.  Therefore, the bottom range of one is close to the top range of the other.  It all depends on the level of luxury one wishes to have when flying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated earlier that there are two means open to him to keep down airfares, the first is competition and the other is to delay or refuse price increases.  With regard to the Cork-London route, would the Minister not agree that one of the problems is that there is not enough competition as very <Col N="1919" /> few airlines fly the route and, as a consequence, prices per mile are much higher than they are on the Dublin-London route or the Belfast-London route? Second, would the Minister encourage more airlines to fly the Cork-London route as the traffic is there and encourage the airport to stay open longer as this would in turn encourage more airlines to fly the route?  The more competition there is on the route the greater the possibility of fares coming down to a level comparable with the prices charged on the Dublin-London route.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus have sufficient aircraft <Col N="1920" /> maintenance staff to maintain their own fleet.  The company put together an imaginative proposal, with IDA support and with the approval of the Government, to create major expansion of employment in aircraft maintenance in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Through the development of a £35 million aircraft overhaul facility at Dublin Airport, the Aer Lingus strategy entails securing major contracts from foreign airlines for aircraft maintenance.  When the new hangar complex, currently being built, is operating to capacity, external work will account for about 75 per cent of the total business.  For this reason and to provide a totally customer oriented business focus on this important new enterprise, Aer Lingus see it as necessary to reorganise the maintenance activity into a separate business.  They do not consider it possible to create such expansion within the present structure of aircraft maintenance as a department of the airline.  Aer Lingus have, therefore, established a new company TEAM Aer Lingus &mdash; the experts in aircraft maintenance &mdash; to undertake all maintenance and engineering activities, including the operation of the new hangar facility.</P>
    <P>A previous example of the need for a change in structure was the setting up of Airmotive Ireland.  When this engine overhaul activity was carried out at Dublin Airport, 150 people were employed on that work.  With the independent focus Airmotive Ireland was able to bring to this competitive international business, the employment figure has now risen to 650.  Airmotive has also entered a joint venture with the major US engine manufacturers, Pratt &amp; Whitney, to create an additional 300 plus jobs. Aer Lingus would expect the new company TEAM Aer Lingus to achieve the same level of success.</P>
    <P>I am aware that an imbalance has arisen between the amount of aircraft maintenance work required and the capacity of Aer Lingus to do all the work involved.  Aer Lingus have informed me that they want to correct this imbalance <Col N="1921" /> through recruitment and training of additional staff.  Unfortunately, this recruitment has run into difficulties in the context of the dispute over the formation of the new company, TEAM Aer Lingus. A direct result of this dispute has been that work has had to be subcontracted abroad.  To date, over 100,000 man hours of work have had to be subcontracted.</P>
    <P>As soon as the dispute is resolved, Aer Lingus intend to commence recruitment as fast as the staff can be trained and absorbed.  It is expected that the new company will recruit over 300 staff within the next 12 months.  The parties involved in trying to resolve the dispute are aware of the gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>The dispute is being dealt with by the Labour Court at the request of Aer Lingus, ICTU and the trade unions involved.  I hope that the dispute can be resolved quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too hope, that with the involvement of the Labour Court that this dispute will be resolved quickly. Given the current shortage of skilled staff in Aer Lingus, the abundance of contract work and the decision of the company, referred to by the Minister, to subcontract maintenance work, would the Minister request the company to continue to employ the 64 skilled hostesses who are under threat of dismissal, as this single act alone would lead to a drastic improvement in the industrial relations climate in Aer Lingus?  I ask the Minister to take note of this suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's comments but having regard to the fact that the dispute is currently being dealt with by the Labour Court at the request of Aer Lingus, the ICTU and the trade unions involved, it would be best if I did not elaborate on this matter too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these two questions together.</P>
      <P>The position is that an advance copy of the court judgment was received in Dublin this morning.  The formal judgment has not yet been received.</P>
      <P>In its judgment the court has found that, through the operation of the 48-hour rule without a specific derogation from Community law, Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are naturally disappointed at this ruling.  In the submissions made to the court, the Government had made a forceful case about the scale of abuse of the travellers' <Col N="1923" /> allowances and the major distortion of trade that had been occurring prior to the operation of the 48-hour rule.  The scale of the problem had been recognised by the Advocate General in his opinion of 21 March, which was discussed in an Adjournment Debate in this House the following day.</P>
    <P>While the Government accept the court judgment, I have made clear that the present 48-hour restrictions are to remain in operation pending a detailed consideration of the judgment and its full implications, as well as the outcome of current consultations at Community level.</P>
    <P>The aim of the dicussions already in train with the EC Commission and other member states is to obtain a mutual agreement for modified arrangements to enable Ireland to prevent the abuses and distortions of trade to which I have referred.  It is hoped to reach an understanding with the EC as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that it is the Government's objective in the discussions that the new arrangements should safeguard the important financial and economic interests of Irish businesses and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The ultimate solution lies, of course, in the approximation of indirect tax rates in the Community.  Progress in this area has been slow because of the important interests at stake for all the member states.  The Irish Government have made clear, in the VAT and excise reductions which I introduced in the 1990 Budget, that Ireland is anxious to make progress in the approximation of EC indirect taxes.  However, until the necessary degree of approximation has been achieved, the Irish authorities must continue to be concerned about the trade distortions that have arisen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand him correctly, the Minister is telling the House, notwithstanding the finding of the European Court against Ireland, that he intends to continue enforcing what has been found to be an illegal and unauthorised ruling by the European Court.  If <Col N="1924" /> so, would he explain to the House why, having been found guilty, he intends to continue the offence?  Secondly, would the Minister outline what further proposals or discussions he has had with the European Commission with a view to achieving some compromise on this matter, and indicate whether he is having discussions on the basis of some different allowance period, other than 48 hours &mdash; perhaps something less &mdash; and what stage those discussions have reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>At the meeting of ECOFIN yesterday, in Luxembourg under Item 6 of the agenda, fiscal harmonisation, there was a discussion on travellers' allowances.  I would like the Deputy and the House to be aware that Denmark has a 48-hour rule, albeit in a more restricted fashion than we would be looking for, and has a derogation from it.</P>
      <P>During that discussion Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on behalf of Ireland, tabled her suggestions about how the situation might be met.  The Dutch delegation and the Dutch Minister tabled a Dutch compromise taking into account the Danish situation and said in their deliberations they would be in favour of taking the Irish case on board as well. Therefore, in the context of it arising yesterday, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, tabled proposals that could be considered in the light of the ongoing discussions that will take place with the Commission and with the member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the first part of the question, yes, technically the court have found, but the Deputy being a lawyer will appreciate we need reasonable time to consider the implications of the court judgment itself, in view of the fact that the Advocate General when giving his opinion stated clearly that there is a very serious problem in relation to the distortion of trade in Ireland &mdash; it is on record &mdash; and while distortions of trade have occurred in this instance, it is also technically in breach of Community law <Col N="1925" /> in that under sections 85 and 86 of the Treaty free and equal competition is supposed to apply.  Two wrongs do not make a right.  It is a complicated area and reasonable time would be expected to be allowed in any such circumstances where the issues are complex, as they are in this case.</P>

Having regard to the minimal measures taken in the Finance Bill recently enacted concerning tax harmonisation progress, when do the Government expect to be in a position to make a more comprehensive statement in this regard?  Finally, does the Minister acknowledge the irony of the situation where the Government who campaigned in favour of the removal of all tariff barriers and of the SEA have devoted most of their energies since to working out what derogations we might get and that the better deal expected by consumers, whether in respect of motor cars&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me set the background against which the 48-hour rule was introduced in the first place so that there is full appreciation of what is involved.  In 1986 alone about 3.6 million trips were made for the purpose of making purchases in Northern Ireland, with serious consequences for the Irish economy.  Some IR£300 million was spent on those purchases, which represents 1.9 per cent of GNP, 2.8 per cent of total personal expenditure on goods and services, 12.9 per cent of imports of consumption goods ready for use, and 91.2 per cent of the deficit on current account of the balance of international payments.  The revenue lost to the Exchequer in 1986 is estimated at £40 million.  Are the Deputies seriously suggesting that that could be allowed to continue, that there is not a <i>prima facie</i> case straight of a clear distortion of trade?</P>
      <P>We have approached this in the most pragmatic way possible.  Once this court case started the Commission found itself unable to have discussions or negotiations with us but after this morning's adjudication by the court it is now in a position to start negotiations.  In that context this whole issue was discussed yesterday and will continue to be discussed and it is the way to resolve the matter finally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this year's budget, I tell Deputy Rabbitte and others, reducing VAT from <Col N="1927" /> 25 per cent to 23 per cent and other areas of Customs and Excise was a recognition and a clear statement of principle by the Government of our acceptance of a move towards tax harmonisation to be achieved as circumstances permit.  Furthermore, it is possible to negotiate with the EC a derogation that can carry us on to the end of 1991, the date on which the Finance Ministers Council fixed last November for final resolution of the VAT situation. Derogations are allowed and are legal under sections 108 and 109 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken into account the fact that all court orders and judgments come into operation from the time they are pronounced and not after allowing any period of time for any party thereto to consider them?  Has the Minister taken into account in view of the European judgment that now a person, if stopped, may well have a claim against the Minister and the State for damages and he may run himself and the State into substantial legal costs if he adopts that attitude for any length of time?  Will he comment?</P>

We have accepted the court judgment and we will within a reasonable time consider its total implications.  In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with the Commission and member states.</P>

      <P>In the second last reply the Minister gave to Deputy Taylor was he indicating that we regard it as acceptable under EC laws that if a decision is made against a member state on some future occasion that is detrimental to the interests of this State, that other state should be given some considerable time to consider whether to comply with the European Court judgment?  It is a very dangerous precedent if that is what the Minister is suggesting.</P>

      <P>The matter in question is a matter of public importance as provided for under Standing Order 30, that is, the recommital of the Broadcasting Bill, 1990, for Second Stage debate in this House.  Last Thursday the Minister took advantage of the lapse by Deputy Michael D. Higgins, a mean, cowardly and a shabby use of the lapse, in order to collapse a debate on that Bill.  Discussion is not terminated.  We know there is dissension within the Government and within the Fianna Fáil Party on the issue. We all heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy say at the weekend that he does not agree with the provisions of the Bill.  We have not yet seen the proposed amendments.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Over several weeks on the Order of Business, I have raised the issue of the appropriateness of there being an Irish position paper prepared in advance of the Summit that will take place on 26 June.  The related matter was a request for a debate.  I accept now that there has been a decision not to have an Irish paper, something I deeply deplore but, nevertheless, the Taoiseach indicated to the House on two occasions that there would be a full debate rather than statements in the House.  It now appears that the Government Chief Whip has suggested there should be statements and not the debate indicated by the Taoiseach. I put it to the Chair that that was a disgraceful misleading of the House. Further issues arise.  For example, if there will be statements, who will make them? Will a Government statement be circulated in advance?  My principal reason for rising is to say that an undertaking given to the House more than once on the Order of Business for a full debate has been broken by the proposals intended for next week.  I should like to ask the Tánaiste if it is his intention, speaking on behalf of the Government, to stick to the original undertaking of the Taoiseach or whether it is his intention to make some other proposal to the House.</P>

      <P>I will complete my point without using personal aspersions. If that be the Tánaiste's inclination, it is not mine.  The Tánaiste has repeated that there will be a debate in the House and the Taoiseach repeated that there will be a debate but what has been prepared by the Government Chief Whip is an arrangement for the making of statements.

      <P>I beg your indulgence for a moment or two to bring a matter to the attention of the Chair and the House because the Chair frequently says &mdash; sometimes quite rightly &mdash; that Deputies should raise questions about some of the issues brought up here.  I should like to relate a little experience to you, Sir, if I may and I will be very orderly about it.  I put down a question to the Taoiseach asking whether the acquisition of an executive jet and the purchase of a search and rescue helicopter were seen as competing options.  On 7 June I was informed that the question had been transferred by the Taoiseach to the Minister for Defence.  On 11 June I was informed that the same question had been transferred by the Minister for Defence to the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  It is a much travelled question, it gets around a lot in the executive jet and helicopter.  To clarify the situation I put down a question to the Taoiseach, to ask him &mdash; for the period since 24 October last &mdash; the number of questions submitted for answer by him, the number of such questions ruled out of order, the number of such questions transferred to other Ministers and the reasons because we would like elucidation on this side of the House about what we may question and how we go about it.  You can imagine my astonishment to find in my post this morning a letter from the Ceann Comhairle <Col N="2015" /> ruling my question out of order on the grounds that the Taoiseach has not official responsibility to the Dáil in relation to these matters.  That brings me back to an argument I had some time ago with the Ceann Comhairle.  I find in the Official Report of 8 May 1990, at column 838 &mdash; in relation to the transfer of questions &mdash; the following statement by the Ceann Comhairle:</P>
      <P>The Chair has no function in the matter appertaining to the transfer of questions.  That has been, and always has been, a matter for the Taoiseach and his Cabinet of the day. </P>
      <P>What I am saying to you, Sir, is that whether the Chair realises it or not, whether the Chair understands its importance or not, the Taoiseach's Government are transferring questions to other Ministers, seeking to avoid answering questions on the spurious grounds that they have no responsibility therefor.  I am relying on you, Sir, to be a faithful messenger for me to the Ceann Comhairle; to tell the Ceann Comhairle that that kind of conduct on the part of the Government should not be tolerated by this House, by its officers or Chairman.</P>

We spoke about this at greater length on Second Stage.  Nonetheless it is a precise statement that takes us that little bit closer to acknowledging those principles of international law in the treatment of offenders we have sought to emulate for so long.

      <P>I should like to make a brief statement on this section because I was not present on Second Stage, that is, that the abolition of the death penalty has been long overdue.  Its survival has not simply been an anachronism because many people throughout the country support the death penalty, particularly in regard to murder of a member of the Garda Síochána or a prison officer in the course of their duties.  Even taking that into consideration I am quite happy with this section.</P>

      <P>In response to the points made on this section I am indeed pleased and honoured to be the Minister to have brought forward this reforming Bill to finally remove the death penalty from our Statute Book. Substantially it was removed in 1964 by the legislation passed then so that, while it has remained on the Statute Book, it has not been operated since the mid fifties.</P>
      <P>As Deputy McCartan said, this section constitutes the substantive provision of the Bill and abolishes the death penalty for those offences in respect of which it was retained under the Criminal Justice Act, 1964.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Where a person (other than a child or young person) is convicted of treason or of a murder or attempt to commit a murder to which section 3 applies, the court&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) in the case of treason or murder, shall in passing sentence specify as the minimum period of imprisonment to be served by that person a period of not less than forty years,</P>
      <P>(b) in the case of an attempt to commit murder, shall pass a sentence of imprisonment of not less than twenty years and specify a period of not less than twenty years as the minimum period of imprisonment to be served by that person.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is purely a drafting amendment and is to make clear what is intended in relation to the sentence to be passed on a person convicted of an attempt to commit a murder to which section 3 applies.</P>
      <P>The court will be required to pass a sentence of imprisonment which may be anything up to life but will have to be at least 20 years.  The court will also be required to specify a period of not less than 20 years as the minimum period of imprisonment to be served by the person concerned.  Under the section in its present form, it may not be entirely clear that the court must pass a sentence of at least 20 years as well as specifying a minimum period, again of at least 20 years, to be served.  The matter does not arise in the case of conviction for treason or actual murder, because in those cases section 2 provides that the offender shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Deputy McCartan's proposed <Col N="2022" /> amendments to the new section and section 5 of the Bill, I consider the changes he seeks to make unacceptable and, therefore, I oppose his amendments.  The effect of the amendments, if accepted, would be to provide that what are now termed capital murders and which are referred to in the Bill as &ldquo;murders to which section 3 applies&rdquo; would be treated as to penalty and administration of sentence in the same way as &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; murder.  In the case of attempt, the effect would be to provide for a mandatory life sentence.  This would mean that a person convicted of murdering a Garda or prison officer would have a sentence of life imprisonment imposed on him without any reference to a minimum term and the sentence could be remitted, or early release could be granted in the ordinary way.  I cannot accept this for the following reasons.</P>
    <P>As I explained in my Second Stage speech, there are very good reasons why the offences which are set out in section 3 of the Bill should be treated differently from ordinary murder or attempt.  Those offences relate not only to murderous attack on an individual, terrible as that is, but also represent an attack on the institutions of the State.  A garda, for example, will not be shot by a subversive or a criminal because of who he is but rather for what he is and what he represents. The garda will be at risk of his life not because a criminal has some personal animosity towards him but because he represents the forces of law and order which we, as a society, have established to prevent crime and apprehend criminals. The murder or attempted murder of a garda and the other murders referred to in section 3 are, therefore, to my mind different from &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; murder and need to be marked by a special and heavy penalty.</P>
    <P>This I think is basic.  I accept that there can be argument about what &ldquo;special&rdquo; penalty should be provided for such offences and I know that there may not be unanimous agreement about the one proposed in the Bill.  However, I doubt very much that there is any significant support for the proposal inherent in the <Col N="2023" /> Deputy's amendments that the murder of a garda, prison officer etc., should be treated no differently from other murders. I certainly would not accept that proposition.</P>
    <P>In deciding what penalty to propose in the Bill to replace the death penalty I was guided by a number of concerns.  One, by the fact that the offences in question represent, as I said, an attack on the institutions of the State.  Two, that we have a largely unarmed Garda Force whose only protection from those with murderous intent is the statutory protection we can afford them by way of a penalty with deterrent effect.  Three, the security situation which exists in this country where there are armed subversive groups operating which represent a particular threat to our democratic institutions.  Four, very heavy maximum penalties are already prescribed for the types of crimes which might give rise to the circumstances where a garda's life is put in danger.  For example, the maximum penalty for armed robbery is life imprisonment.  An ordinary sentence of life imprisonment for the murder of a garda is very unlikely, therefore, to have any deterrent effect on an armed robber who is trying to evade capture.  Five, what has for many years past been effectively the penalty for capital offences, namely, 40 years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Having weighed up these factors I concluded, and the Government agreed, that the proper course at this time simply would be to formally remove the death penalty from the Statute Book &mdash; which is something the vast majority want to see done &mdash; but otherwise to make no radical change.  All of the concerns which I have enumerated above which led various Governments over the past 20 years to recommend to the President that he should commute a death sentence to one of 40 years' imprisonment remain.  This being so, a move to reduce the penalty at this stage could be misinterpreted as a weakening of our resolve to protect the Garda and prison officers.  It could have a serious effect on morale in both services, and could lead to a demand for more extensive carrying of arms and, of most <Col N="2024" /> concern, it could imperil lives if criminals were to get the idea, as I have said, that we were going &ldquo;soft&rdquo; on those who murder Garda or prison officers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second of the Deputy's proposed amendments, it is my belief that once we have determined to prescribe a heavy mandatory penalty as a deterent to the murder of Garda and prison officers, we must, if it is to have the desired deterrent effect, make it abundantly clear that it will not be watered down.  This is why the Bill provides for the exclusion of the powers of remission and early release normally exercisable by the Government or by the Minister.  Of course, it will still be possible for the President to exercise his constitutional power to remit or commute a sentence on the advice of the Government.  It could be in a very rare and exceptional case that this avenue could be followed.</P>
    <P>I accept, as I said on Second Stage, that a 40 year prison sentence is a very harsh penalty.  I would prefer if I could recommend something less, but I am satisfied for the reasons I have given that it would be wrong for me to do so.  I appreciate that from the point of view of rehabilitation of a prisoner a long immutable sentence is far from ideal.  My primary concern, however, must be to deter murderous attacks on Garda, prison officers etc., and it is for this reason the sentence proposed must be as it is.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words from and including &ldquo;the court&mdash;&rdquo; in the third line down to the end of the amendment and substitute &ldquo;the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment for life.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment to delete the requirement to impose the maximum penalties or minimum periods of time a person must spend in prison for the commission of treason or murder.  In the case of treason or murder a person must serve a period of not less than 40 years and in the case of an attempt to commit a murder a person must be imprisoned for a period of not less than 20 years where the victim is a member of the Garda Síochána or a prison officer or otherwise as defined under section 3.</P>
      <P>The amendment in my name on behalf of The Workers' Party group is to delete all the words from and including &ldquo;the court&rdquo;&mdash; down to the end of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment in my name deals with section 5 which relates to sentencing. It proposes to delete section 5 (1) which provides that the power of commutation or remission of punishment under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, should not apply until those minimum terms of imprisonment have been served by the offender.  As I said on Second Stage, I consider that the range of sentences mandatorily being imposed by this <Col N="2026" /> statute to be almost, if not equally, as savage as the death sentence.  I do not accept the need for the scale of sentence included in the Bill and I hope, in the few moments available, to explain the reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the crime of capital murder or murder in the circumstances provided for under sections 3 and 4 of the Bill is particular and not ordinary because it represents an attack on the State or on an institution of the State and for that reason, requires a heavy and special penalty.  I fully agree with that proposition in general terms.  I recognise that the Garda Síochána and the prison officers have a sensitive and important duty to carry out and that they are often in the front line of defence of the institutions of the State, and indeed of the community, in the carrying out of their duties.  I equally acknowledge that many have given their lives in the pursuit of those duties in the past.</P>
    <P>I accept the need for severe penalty for those who would be convicted properly before a court for such an offence but my question relates to the approach of the Minister.  The imposition of a minimum period &mdash; for practical purposes, 40 years will often mean the life of the offender &mdash; denies the whole purpose of penal administration.  The Minister said there was a need for a heavy penalty in the case of an attack on an institution of the State. He then listed a number of guidelines, including the fact that the crime represented an attack on the State, that it might lead to the more regular use of arms by the Garda Síochána, that the severe penalty &mdash; in the past, it was the death penalty &mdash; would be the only defence available to the Garda Síochána because of the security system that exists in the State, that heavy maximum penalties, such as life imprisonment, already exist for armed robbery and that 40 years is the commuted sentence of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>The one matter to which the Minister did not refer &mdash; which I feel is a major fault &mdash; is the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System, otherwise known as the Whitaker report.  This is a <Col N="2027" /> report that is often, and must often be referred to in a debate of this sort, when trying to establish some form of penal policy.  The report is probably the only statement ever commissioned by Government on principles of penal policy that would be available to a Minister for Justice.  The Minister has indicated that he has particular regard for this report. He went to great lengths here at Question Time in the last few weeks to indicate the areas in which he has sought to borrow from that report.  I suggest that in the introduction in this legislation of an unprecedented scale of penalty, the Minister is abandoning and totally departing from some of the basic principles that have been laid down in that report.</P>
    <P>The report lays down very clearly the need to be able to review long terms of imprisonment.  Indeed, the Minister acknowledges the force of argument that long-term prisoners should have the facility of having their sentences reviewed from time to time and he has adopted this provision by establishing the sentence review committee.  Why has he introduced an exception for these offences when Whitaker makes no such case?  The report states in page 12, paragraph 2.15:</P>
    <P>The Committee is in favour of custodial sentences being reserved for the most serious offences (with the corollary that very short prison sentences should be virtually eliminated) but is opposed to any general lengthening of sentences or to haphazard, as distinct from well-judged, early releases.  The Committee prefers a system in which sentences imposed would in fact be served subject to a higher standard remission (? as against the present ¼) for good conduct, to a system of regular judicial review of all sentences of 5 years or more, and to provision for supervised release at any stage if recommended by review committees representative of all the services operating in a prison. </P>
    <P>At the time Whitaker reported the practice had already been introduced of commuting capital punishment to terms of 30 <Col N="2028" /> and 40 years imprisonment.  The phenomenon that is now sought to be introduced by way of legislation was known to the committee but they did not make any case such as is laid down here, that long-term sentences should be judicially reviewed at least at the expiration of five years and regularly thereafter.  As a general principle, that should be applicable to all sentences.</P>
    <P>On page 15, paragraph 2.25, under the heading Review of long and indeterminate sentences, the report states:</P>
    <P>It is important that a regular and formal procedure exist for review of long or indeterminate sentences.  A first judicial review should take place after a prisoner has completed five years of sentence, further judicial reviews to follow at intervals to be determined by the review body. </P>
    <P>At paragraph 6.9 under the heading Long-sentence reviews, the report states:</P>
    <P>Courts frequently suspend the operation of custodial sentences on conditions. The extension of court practice in this area would go some way to meet the Committee's desire to see greater flexibility in sentence disposals and the greater use of alternatives to custody. As indicated in Chapter 7 the Committee considers that there is good reason to justify a review of a long sentence after, say, five years have been served.  This could be achieved by establishing a Sentence Review Committee presided over by a Judge of the High Court with power to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice. </P>
    <P>I acknowledge the Minister has taken that recommendation on board.</P>
    <P>The Committee could include one or two assessors and act on reports, co-ordinated by the Probation and Welfare Service from a variety of sources, as required e.g. prison administrators and representatives from other prison services (medical, psychiatric, psychological, teaching, etc). </P>
    <P>I am sorry to quote at length from the <Col N="2029" /> report but it is important to point out that a committee, established by Government, who worked at great length reviewing the whole matter and laid down what I believe to be the only statement of principles ever to emerge in the area of penal practice in this country, have recommended, for very good reasons set out in the report, the need to review long-term sentences.  They did so at a time when, as I have said, the practice was already established of commuting capital murder to life imprisonment, with minimum periods indicated.</P>
    <P>The problem I have with the Minister's proposal is that it is not reflecting what Whitaker argued for.  We should depart from Whitaker for extraordinary reasons if at all.  The argument put forward by the Minister needs to be looked at.  The crime in question represents an attack on the State and for that reason the Minister makes the point that there should be a special and heavy penalty.  I have already indicated I agree with that. The way to achieve that special penalty is by providing a sentence of life imprisonment <i>simpliciter</i> and for the Minister of the day to decide just how severe that term of imprisonment should be.  I have full confidence in the method that currently exists for the determination of the length of life imprisonment, that of review by the Minister of the day in consultation with all the agencies available to him or her in the prison service dealing with the particular offender in question and also in consultation with the Garda Síochána and the judge of trial &mdash; as is the practice &mdash; and any other person the Minister considers should be consulted before a decision is taken to release any prisoner from the life imprisonment condition of incarceration of custody.</P>
    <P>The special complexion of life imprisonment will be reflected in that way by the term the prisoner will spend there. To deny that process and to insist on the scale of imprisonment required here of 40 years denies the possibility of rehabilitation, it denies the possibility of events that might occur down the line that could <Col N="2030" /> have a profound impact on the conditions, the circumstances and the reasons that might influence a Minister to consider a power under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, for early release or otherwise.  I could give innumerable considerations of the change of attitude, of the declaration that is relied upon by the Department and the Minister currently in dealing with people incarcerated at Portlaoise prison, of allowing for remarkable changes in attitude of the person incarcerated who at one time might be motivated by all the most heinous ridiculous warped conditions and factors and who after a time in prison, would begin to realise that what had gone before was completely wrong, that might allow for the facts surrounding the unfortunate loss of life in the particular offence that led to the conviction and the sentence being imposed.  I appreciate it is a thorny issue to grasp.  The Minister is facing a strong lobby and argument from the Garda Síochána at this stage.  It might well be argued &mdash; although I have not heard the argument &mdash; that perhaps we should level matters as they are in the Bill and leave this kind of debate for future amending legislation in the light of experience or in the light of particular developments from the point of view of the Garda Síochána.  Will they, for example, have to rely on the use of arms more often, as the Minister contends?  I do not accept that argument because the reality in this country has been that since 1954 &mdash; even though we passed the amending legislation in 1964 &mdash; there has not been, <i>de facto</i>, capital punishment for any offence, including the death of a prison officer or a member of the Garda Síochána acting in the course of their duty in the State.  We have not been pushed or forced towards a greater use of firearms in the duties of the gardaí or, more particularly, of prison officers.</P>
    <P>The point is that good and sound research and principles are laid down in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System.  The arguments that counter prevail, that are advanced by the Minister, simply do not convince me that we should depart from those <Col N="2031" /> principles.  My argument is that you impose life imprisonment and the Minister of the day decides how long that term should be, given all the variable factors that can exist and accepting that because of the particular victim &mdash; a member of the Garda Síochána, a prison officer or any other person contemplated under sections 3 and 4 &mdash; a very strong argument will be needed to prevail on the Minister of the day to release the person from incarceration.  Nonetheless, that is a far better model and formula than that proposed by the blunt instrument of saying to a person, &ldquo;because you have committed the heinous crime of murder in these circumstances, you will be locked up for 40 years with remission and with no other consideration, hope or eventuality being allowed for.  That is too blunt, too severe and is unnecessary in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I accept that the other issues advanced by the Minister help make the case in some respect but they are not sufficiently weighty to take away from the basic propositions as outlined.</P>
    <P>Another point that must be made is that a person sentenced to life imprisonment, whether a minimum term is attached, is never free of the supervision of the Minister or of the court.  A person once released from incarceration is on licence for the rest of their days.  That licence allows the Minister to revoke the freedom of the individual given certain considerations and factors.  That is the practice which takes place on a regular basis in the Department.  I instance one particular case where the offender is brought back in, for particularly good reasons, because of the tragic circumstances of the offender.  That power exists.  It is suggested that at present life imprisonment in this State for ordinary crimes &mdash; if I could borrow the Minister's words &mdash; represents eight to ten years, although there is a computation of seven to nine years; some people say the sentence is now creeping up to 11 years on average.  That is not the end of the matter.  The person once released is then <Col N="2032" /> under continuous supervision of the probation and welfare services, under scrutiny from the Garda Síochána and under the ongoing possibility that the Department following a review and, in full consultation, can revoke the term of release and have the person recommitted to prison to serve whatever period is desirable. That is a further factor that must never be lost sight of in this debate. Whenever an offender in the circumstances of this Bill is released he or she is open to being recommitted should they show any unsatisfactory tendency again.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6.5 headed &ldquo;Penalty Imbalances&rdquo; of the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System, under the chairmanship of Dr. Whitaker, attempts to lay down some basic principles which we should seek to apply in all instances.  The paragraph reads as follows:</P>
    <P>While a number of serious crimes such as treason, genocide, murder and rape will always, by reason of their innate seriousness, either by statutory mandate or by the due exercise of judicial discretion, require the imposition of the penalty of imprisonment, the aim of the courts in dealing with other offences should be to impose a penalty other than imprisonment when such a penalty is appropriate to the circumstances of the case. </P>
    <P>The most relevant passage as far as we are concerned reads:</P>
    <P>Where Parliament thinks fit to prescribe maximum and minimum terms of imprisonment for an offence, the range should be sufficiently wide to enable a judge to impose a term of imprisonment which will fit the particular circumstances of the case. </P>
    <P>The point I want to make, in laying down a further principle of penological practice, is that the report recognises that statute can and should on occasion lay down maximum and minimum limits and also the need to allow a judge and, by implication, the Minister, discretion.  The fact is the Minister's proposals do not <Col N="2033" /> allow for this one jot.  The Minister, in laying down a term of imprisonment of 40 years &mdash; even worked back to 30 years with full remission, which is rare in itself &mdash; is not allowing for discretion.  Indeed, under section 5 he is removing the possibility of remission even in extraordinary circumstances.  That is a bad principle to work from.</P>
    <P>The question of remission and the concept of a review of sentence are also examined in the Whitaker report.  I understand provision is made for remission once the minimum term of imprisonment of 40 years has been served.  This can be worked back to 30 years but in effect this gives us little or no hope that the notion that there should be remission for prisoners will be considered. The report at paragraph 7.36, page 72, has this to say on that matter under the heading &ldquo;Pre-Release Programmes&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>On the basis of its general approach to imprisonment the committee takes the view that there should be a liberal approach to conditional releases before the normal release date allowing for maximum remission.  The possibility of conditional release is a powerful incentive to prisoners to do well in prison. </P>
    <P>We should not lock people up simply to punish or brutalise them further but rather in the hope that they will do well and reflect on the wrongs they have committed, the heinous nature of their acts and the fact that we expect something better or more of them once released. We invest vast sums of money on behalf of the taxpayer in trying to achieve that end.  In practice, the imposition of this term of imprisonment, which is very severe, will shut out all hope for the offender committed, with the result that there will be no possibility of getting co-operation or a life after prison and little will be achieved other than the taking out of circulation, at huge cost to the community, of the offender once sentenced.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I urge the Minister <Col N="2034" /> to look again at the amendment I am proposing or in the debate on the Bill in the Seanad or in the light of the workings of the legislation in the coming years to indicate that the door is not as closed as it appears now.  I make no apology for seeking to address the issue on the basis of the principles laid down in the one comprehensive document we have on prisons and the use of incarceration as a penalty, the Whitaker report, and as I said before, we should be very slow to depart, if at all, from the good reasoned arguments and principles laid down in that report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the abolition of the death penalty but would argue the case in a different way.  On very rare occasions very serious crimes are committed by citizens and there is an obligation on the State to its citizens to remove the persons concerned from society, even for the rest of their lives if necessary.  If a young person, who has been sentenced in the normal way to life imprisonment for the shooting dead of a bank official during a bank robbery, commits a similar offence on release seven years later but on this occasion shoots a member of the Garda Síochána, is a judge in sentencing that young person entitled to impose a longer sentence than 40 years and specify the number of years to be served?</P>
      <P>There is another category of person, to whom I referred during my Second Stage contribution, who should be dealt with very severely by the State and that is the members of illegal organisations who sit in judgment on fellow citizens, pass death sentences on them and has them carried out.  What sentence should they be given under the law?  The court should be given authority to send, if necessary, a person to prison for the rest of their natural life or until they reach old age when they will no longer be a danger to society.  I note that this is a system used, albeit very rarely, in Britain.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy McCartan's amendment.  However, my <Col N="2035" /> support for his amendment should not be taken to imply any lack of support for the Garda Síochána who are the protectors of society.  As long as a person poses a real danger to life or limb, it is sometimes necessary to incarcerate this person for the rest of their natural life.  Like Deputy McCartan, what I object to is inflexibility. We should not differentiate between this crime and the crime of murder or attempted murder, as this gets away from the possibility of rehabilitation or remorse.  It should be borne in mind that even those who murder or attempt to murder a prison officer or a garda are not damned for all eternity; there is still the possibility that they will repent or express remorse.  Having regard to the fact that the death penalty has not been invoked for a long time and no prison officer or garda has been murdered for many years, I do not think it is necessary to lay down such very long terms of imprisonment.  Accordingly, I support Deputy McCartan's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Minister's amendment which merely clarifies section 4 of the original Bill.  It is very important that we be realistic this afternoon.  In agreeing to section 1 we assented in effect to the abolition of the death penalty.  On Second Stage there was agreement on all sides of the House on this matter.  In abolishing the death penalty for humanitarian reasons we should be prepared to provide society with a replacement which fits the ghastly crime of capital murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy McCartan quoting at length from the Whitaker report, but at no stage did he make any reference in any of his quotations to the fact that the Whitaker report was commenting specifically on capital murder.  In fact, I venture to say that it was not at any stage written down in the context of the most serious crime a person can commit.  It is important when dealing with the remedies society imposes for these crimes to look at section 3 and at the crimes we are talking about.  We must understand and not for one moment deviate from the fact that <Col N="2036" /> we are living in a very violent society with a very high crime rate and an active terrorist organisation in our midst.</P>
    <P>Looking at section 3 (1) (a), (b), (c), and (d) we remember incidents in the past ten or 15 years.  We have had the murder of members of the Garda Síochána, attempted murder of prison officers in the course of their duty, violent crimes contrary to sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Offences Against the State Act, and not 20 years ago we had a violent murder of a diplomat from a neighbouring state.  Foreign heads of state fear to enter our land, and we are talking about having sentences that can be reviewed or less severe than the harshest possible and lengthiest sentences available to our courts.  Having considered that, I believe the Minister has opted for the correct course by introducing a mandatory minimum sentence.</P>
    <P>It has been argued with great effect that mandatory sentences make bad law. In general I agree with that sentiment, but people acting in the name of the Irish people are prepared to commit violent crimes against other people and it is very important to have a deterrent, such as a lengthy sentence of 40 years, with a valve. The valve is extremely important.  It is absolutely essential that a prisoner who is imprisoned for whatever reason be not deprived of hope.  Deputy McCartan spoke at length on instances of rehabilitation and the fact that for some reason or other a prisoner may have a change of heart.  The Minister may not have allowed for that valve in this Bill, and I commend to the House the Fine Gael amendment to section 5 which could be the valve that would not deprive a prisoner of hope.  I think prisoners are more likely to conform and to become rehabilitated if they have an element of hope, if they have something to work towards.  If we deprive a prisoner of hope we do little to encourage any element of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>An argument against Deputy McCartan's amendment must surely be that its import is to whittle away the distinction between capital murder as we now know it and ordinary murder.  Since we have an <Col N="2037" /> unarmed police force in this State, one of the few West European countries that still have an unarmed police force and long may that remain the case, it is important that we provide for the distinct offence to act as a deterrent to protect the people employed to protect society. By adopting the watered down amendment proposed by Deputy McCartan, we are ignoring threat to society by organised criminal gangs who are stalking the countryside daily, and we are ignoring the threat to society from terrorists.</P>
    <P>The distinct offence as envisaged in this legislation is blunt and severe, as Deputy McCartan stated, but it is necessary because if we are to stand up to the terrorist threat we must be blunt and severe.  The Whitaker review group have no power to review or investigate sentences for capital murder.  That said, it is important that we have some valve in the event of a change of heart or that a review is necessary for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>This Bill in no way effects or detracts from the power of the President to commute or review sentences should he feel that to be necessary.  That is important and should not go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>The question of remission is important. A prison sentence, be it 20 or 40 years, following conviction under this legislation still allows for an element of remission.  I would like to elicit the Minister's views on changes that may occur from time to time in the remission procedure.  At present under statutory regulation remission amounts to a quarter of the sentence.  That can change and has done so in the past and is likely to change in the future.  An offence under this legislation could attract a sentence of no more than 20 years.  The Minister might like to comment on whether at any future date if the rules on procedure governing remission were changed, that would have an effect on the terms and provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>On balance between the Minister's amendment and Deputy McCartan's amendment the Minister's is of far greater service to society, subject to the <Col N="2038" /> qualification of the Fine Gael amendment to section 5.  We will support the Minister's amendment in the hope, and with the qualification, that serious consideration will be given by him to our amendment to section 5 as a necessary valve available to the convicted party who may have a change of heart, who may become rehabilitated, so as not to deprive that prisoner of hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have a distinction in regard to penalty between ordinary murder and the murder of gardaí and prison officers.  On that basis, I cannot agree with The Workers' Party amendment which would remove that distinction, at least in statutory terms. Deputy McCartan argues that cases could be treated differently by the Minister for Justice of the day.  That is not a sufficient distinction; there should be a distinction in statutory terms.  If pressed to a vote, Fine Gael will vote against The Workers' Party amendment.</P>
      <P>If we accept that there should be a distinction between ordinary murder and the murder of prison officers and gardaí, we must ask what the penalty should be. There is general agreement that the death penalty should be taken off the Statute Book.  It is provided in section 1 that no person shall suffer death for any offence. I accept fully that proposal.  I believe in the commandment &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill&rdquo;. The death penalty was not a deterrent and should be removed from the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>If we accept that there is a distinction between what is termed ordinary murder and the murder of a prison officer or garda, then we must define the appropriate penalty.  The Minister had a number of options.  He could have fixed a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment subject to a minimum term of 40 years; alternatively, he could have selected a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment subject to a term ranging over a number of years, leaving it to the trial judge to decide on the actual term to apply within that range.  There was the further possibility of permitting remission for good behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> There are pros and cons in these options.  At the moment, an ordinary term of life imprisonment for ordinary murder would usually be about nine or ten years in the case of good behaviour. That would not apply in the case of a particularly vicious offence or in cases involving subversive activity leading to murder.  It is very clear that a number of years would have to be mentioned in the statutes that would be substantially in excess of what is effectively being served by those convicted of ordinary murder at the moment.</P>
    <P>The basic approach of the Fine Gael Party is that we would be failing to provide adequate deterrents against the murder of gardaí and prison officers if there were not a distinction.  We accept that there are pros and cons in the two options I have mentioned.  In terms of the standard of sentence in other European countries, 40 years is quite high, but the Minister has included provision for remission for good conduct.  We should consider the possible disruptive effect on prison administration of long-term detention of prisoners who have no incentive to comply with prison rules.  I will come back to that point, which is the basis of the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    <P>Within the second option, we could fix a range of years within which the trial judge could decide a sentence.  Because the Minister has opted for a minimum sentence without any discretion to the trial judge, there cannot be a distinction or differentiation between offences according to the degree of culpability attaching to them.  A person could shoot an unarmed Garda officer at point blank range in a premeditated act.  Another example could involve a person driving a getaway car.  One of those in the car could become involved in an exchange of shots during which a Garda officer is killed. The driver of the getaway car would be guilty of an offence under section 4 because of the doctrine of common design where it could be proved that the common intention of those committing the original offence extended to those helping to carry it out.  Under the Minister's proposal, the trial judge does not <Col N="2040" /> have the possibility of differentiating between the gross case of the point blank shooting of an unarmed garda and the case of a person who was not as directly involved but yet would be guilty of the offence and would suffer the same penalty.</P>
    <P>The choice open to the Minister was quite difficult.  He has opted for the fixed minimum penalty of 40 years in the case of murder and 20 years in the case of attempted murder and he has allowed for remission for good conduct.  My view is that there is probably a case for a range of years within which the sentence could be decided.  This would allow for differentiation depending on the gravity of the offence and the culpability of those convicted.  However, I will not quibble with the Minister's decision to opt for the minimum.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided for a restriction on the power of the Minister to commute or remit the punishment or to grant a temporary release.  We must look at that power in the context of the problems it might create in disrupting the prison administration.  There is still the power of the President, on the advice of the Government, to commute sentences under Article 13.6 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned at the point raised by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors which, to a degree, relates to the earlier point I made in regard to the possible disruption of the prison administration by a long-term prisoner who may think he has no hope whatsoever. On 3 May 1990 the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors issued a circular to all Deputies and Senators &mdash; to be fair to the association, this circular was circulated in the context of their being opposed to this legislation in which they said and I quote:</P>
    <P>The suggestion that a 40 year mandatory sentence replace the death penalty is not acceptable because a criminal serving the mandatory sentence is beyond further substantial punishment. In an escape attempt such a person can &ldquo;afford&rdquo; to be absolutely ruthless with the lives of prison officers, <Col N="2041" /> gardaí or the general public because society cannot impose any further penalty. </P>
    <P>We have to take note of the point raised by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  They are concerned that somebody who has had a very long sentence imposed on him could be quite ruthless in his dealings with prison officers, gardaí or the general public and society could not impose any further penalty on him.  They are afraid that such a person would be absolutely free of the possibility of any further penalty being imposed on him and if there was a shootout or escape attempt there would be absolutely no deterrent whatsoever on him to be restrained by the norms of society or the fear of punishment.  To a large degree this is why I put down amendment No. 3a to section 5.  Because we are taking these amendments together I want to briefly comment on my amendment to section 5.</P>
    <P>We should not close the door on this debate; we should be prepared to commit ourselves to looking at the effects of these changes, monitor them and review them, in particular, from the point of view of the fears and concerns expressed by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, which is a very reliable organisation. I fully understand their point and this is why I believe the amendment put down by Fine Gael could and should be taken on board by this House and the Minister.</P>
    <P>Essentially what we are proposing is that the Minister should be obligated, under section 5, to make a report to Dáil Éireann on the effects of the restrictions on his powers imposed by section 5.  This would provide the vehicle for a debate on the issue and if it was decided further legislation was necessary at that stage it would stimulate the introduction of such legislation.  It would also give us an opportunity to put to rest the fears expressed by organisations such as the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  They would be able to proceed in the sure knowledge that the <Col N="2042" /> matter would be looked at again and if the concerns they had expressed came to reality the Dáil would have the opportunity of considering them.</P>
    <P>I have proposed in this amendment that the Minister for Justice should report to Dáil Éireann not later than four years but if the principle of my amendment is accepted I would be open to accepting a period of five or eight years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy McCartan's amendment is not acceptable to us and I urge the Minister and the other parties in the House to accept the Fine Gael amendment.</P>

      <P>The great dilemma in this debate, which has been dealt with at some length, is the proposal to remove the death penalty as a deterrent to crime and replace it with a minimum sentence of 40 years.  When Mr. Paddy O'Brien, the President of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors spoke recently in Killarney he said they sought only to retain the final penalty as a deterrent to be used only in the most extreme circumstances but, nevertheless, to remain as a protection for unarmed gardaí and prison officers.  I disagree with that view and I think many speakers in this House, including the Minister, disagree with it also.  When Deputy Brian O'Shea spoke in this debate on behalf of the Labour Party he said: &ldquo;If I thought the death penalty would protect the life of a single garda or prison officer or would inhibit dangerous criminals from carrying guns I would have a totally different view of this legislation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party agree with that view but we do not believe the death penalty <Col N="2043" /> has acted as a deterrent &mdash; 11 gardaí have died since 1970.  Because, <i>de facto</i>, no death penalty has been imposed during that period the argument put forward by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors does not hold water in that respect.  However, Irish society owes a considerable debt to the men and women who place their lives at risk on a daily basis both on the streets and in our prisons and if they believe there is an element of a deterrent in the death penalty then we in this House, who do not have to deal on a daily basis with criminals, have to make it our business to see that the sentence we put in its place is very severe. This is why I support the Minister's amendment and oppose The Workers' Party amendment in the name of Deputy Pat McCartan.</P>
    <P>Criminals should know well in advance that they will have to face a very long time in prison if they shoot or kill a garda or prison officer.  This is one of the weaknesses in Deputy McCartan's argument. I took down one of the Deputy's sentences &mdash; I do not know if it was from the Whitaker report or his own remark. If I understood the Deputy correctly, he suggested that a murderer of a garda or prison officer should be recommitted after a certain length of time if he demonstrated any unsavoury or unsatisfactory tendency.  Does this mean that if such a person shoots another garda he will have demonstrated an unsatisfactory or unsavoury tendency?  That is the point I am worried about.  I do not think it is right to let somebody back into society after ten or 12 years if there is a possibility he will commit the same crime.  As we know, some people were let out of prison who had not changed.  The alternative is to keep these people in prison which will mean a very expensive bill for the taxpayers. The Labour Party have campaigned for many years for the abolition of the death penalty.  We have to bear the expense of keeping these murderers in prison for a very long time if they are a threat to gardaí and prison officers whose job it is to look after our society and who spend every day in a certain <Col N="2044" /> amount of danger.  There are occasions when their occupation is not very dangerous but there is always the possibility of danger when people set out to rob banks or do some other nefarious deed.</P>
    <P>We should ensure that gardaí and prison officers do not consider that we are taking away what was a deterrent without putting something in its place and ensure that criminals know they will face very stiff sentences if they contemplate murder in the future.  The minimum sentences that are being introduced here are very severe and if, as Fine Gael suggest, a review of this legislation should take place, at least the people concerned will still be alive to have their sentences reviewed.  The removal of the death penalty means that the State will not have killed the murderer so that his sentence can be reviewed in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be given the backing for what he is doing in his amendment. Deputy McCartan's amendment would result in a murderer not feeling the same level of deterrent as he would if he knew he would have to face a heavy sentence should he commit that crime.  There is the dilemma of whether people think about these things when they commit murder. We, however, should err on the right side of our gardaí and prison officers by demonstrating to them that a very heavy sentence will be meted out to anybody who commits this crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an interesting debate on this set of amendments for well over an hour.  This has been very worthwhile.  It has been quite a while since I made my opening remarks but I will just repeat a few of them to again indicate to the House my thinking in deciding on what penalty to propose in the Bill to replace the death penalty.  I was guided by a number of concerns which I will reiterate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is that the offence in question represents an attack on the institutions of the State; there is a major difference between an ordinary and a capital offence.  The second is that we have a largely unarmed Garda force whose only protection from those with murderous <Col N="2045" /> intent is the statutory protection we can afford them by way of a penalty with deterrent effect.  The third is the security situation that exists here where there are armed subversive groups operating and who represent a particular threat to our democratic institutions.  The fourth is that very heavy maximum penalties are already prescribed for the type of offence which might give rise to circumstances where a garda's life is put in danger. For example, the maximum penalty for armed robbery is life imprisonment.  An ordinary sentence of life imprisonment for the murder of a garda is very unlikely, therefore, to have any deterrent effect on an armed robber who is trying to evade capture.</P>
    <P>What has for many years been effectively the penalty for capital offences, namely, 40 years imprisonment, was the sentence I came down in favour of after consideration.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that there is a strongly held point of view that a 40 year sentence is a very harsh penalty.  I would prefer if I could recommend something less but I am satisfied, for the reasons I have given, that it would be wrong for me to do so. I appreciate the points made by a number of Deputies that from the point of view of rehabilitation of a prisoner a long immutable sentence is far from ideal but my primary concern as Minister must be to deter murderous attacks on gardaí and prison officers.  It is for this reason that the sentence proposed must stay as it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the Sentence Review Group and to the Whitaker report.  The Whitaker commission looked at just one aspect of prisons.  My responsibility, as Minister for Justice, goes much further than just sentencing. It goes to the heart of the concern for the gardaí and the prison officers who serve this country loyally.  As far as remission is concerned, in this Bill there is provision for a 25 per cent remission for good behaviour.  That is something that was not there before in relation to capital offences and sentences commuted by the President were for 40 years.  Now it will be 40 years with remission for good <Col N="2046" /> behaviour and that was put in response to discussions I had with the Prison Officers' Association who were concerned, as were a number of Deputies here, about the question of having an incentive for prisoners to obey prison rules.  That is very important and it is for that reason and in response to the points made by the prison officers that that incentive is there.</P>
    <P>In regard to the right to grant further remissions and the temporary release mechanism which is used on the advice of the Sentence Review Group, I decided to remove that power in relation to capital murders, again to give clear signals to people who would murder or attempt to murder a garda or prison officer that the full rigour of the law would be used to punish them.  However, the President has the right to pardon, on the advice of the Government, should there be an extraordinary change of heart, as was mentioned by Deputy McCartan, and it is obvious that there has been a dramatic change.  In such circumstances it is the right of the Government to advise the President to pardon such a prisoner, and that right is still there.  It is an important right and should not be disregarded.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a liberal release policy.  I have tried, so far as I possibly could since becoming Minister for Justice, by setting up the Whitaker Committee and releasing long-term prisoners over the Christmas break and continuing that policy even since the Christmas break, to be as liberal as possible. At the same time I must always be guided by the principle of protecting the institutions of the State and in particular those who protect the institutions of the State, the Garda and the prison officers.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Joe Doyle's expression of support for the Bill.  Deputy Garland, supporting Deputy McCartan, emphasised that there must be no lack of support for the Garda.  I accept the Deputy's sincerity when he said that he was not suggesting any lack of support for the Garda but the difficulty involved in this is that we must try to balance things up.  If we are to remove the death penalty we must decide on how to protect <Col N="2047" /> the Garda and prison officers and, at the same time, act in a humane manner.  I vehemently disagree with his point that there was no need to differentiate between ordinary and capital murders.  I answered that point earlier.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan raised the point about remission for prisoners and I should like to draw his attention to my earlier reply to that point.  He suggested that foreign Heads of State might be fearful of entering this country but there is no proof of that.  On the contrary, during our Presidency in the past six months many Heads of State have visited this country.  I should like to tell Deputy O'Keeffe that the <i>mens rea</i> in regard to capital murder is very precise.  It is essential to prove the thought process of the person at the time of the killing.  It is very unlikely, but possible, that a person in the circumstances he outlined would be charged with capital murder.  It would be difficult to prove them guilty of capital murder.</P>
    <P>I consider Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment unnecessary in principle.  The terms in which it is drafted would be of little value.  As to the principle of a review, I should like to assure the House that I regard it as one of the responsibilities of my office to keep criminal law under constant review.  This is particularly so in relation to new legislation.  I do not consider there is a need for a provision of the nature proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan suggested that there should be a review, and a report to the Dáil on the operation of the restrictions imposed in section 5 on remission for early release within four years.  That is pointless.  Even if there were to be no restrictions it is inconceivable that the question of a remission or early release would arise in the case of a person sentenced for a murder under section 3 within the first four years of that person's imprisonment.  I accept, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, that it could be seven or eight years but I do not think the point arises.  Experience of the effects of the restriction provided for in section 5 will be something that will only be <Col N="2048" /> gained in a much longer time span than four years.  It is not clear how the review suggested by the Deputies will operate.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that my successors in this position will keep the provisions of the Bill under review.  Even if the Minister of the day does not do so, I have no doubt that organisations concerned such as the AGSI, GRA and the POA will ensure that the Minister keeps the legislation under careful review.  Deputy Flanagan raised the question of remission and I should like to tell him the 25 per cent remission that exists at present could be changed at any time.  I have no doubt that in years to come it will be changed.  I should like to tell the Deputy that remission in Northern Ireland is 50 per cent.  I cannot accept the amendments put forward and I strongly commend my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a point of view on the record because I have strong reservations about one section.  I am not expressing my reservations on a party political basis.  An amendment along the lines suggested by Deputies O'Keeffe and McCartan should be included in the Bill to safeguard against what I consider to be a more draconian and less humane punishment than hanging. I am opposed to hanging but, in certain circumstances, it would be better to hang a person than to put that person in prison for 40 years without the Government, or the Minister for Justice, having the right to review that sentence at some time in the future.  I do not think the Minister should divest himself of his power under this heading.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about capital murder but we must bear in mind that we are also dealing with treason, however that can be defined in this day and age.  A person can be sentenced to prison for 40 years if found guilty of treason. That person will be confined to an 8 ft by 6 ft cell for 40 years and that term can only be reduced to 30 years.  The Minister does not have the power in any special circumstances to order the release of the prisoner or reduce the sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little point in abolishing the <Col N="2049" /> death penalty for capital murder or treason and replacing it with a minimum mandatory sentence of 40 years.  At present the President may, on the recommendation of the Government, commute the sentence of hanging to one of 40 years.  Nobody is aware if that is constitutional or not but at least the Minister has a right to review a sentence on humanitarian grounds.  It is wrong of the House to pass legislation requiring the courts to send a person to prison for a minimum of 40 years without the Minister for Justice having a right to review it at some stage.  I commend the Minister for bringing forward the Bill to abolish the death penalty for capital murder or treason but I presume it has been said that that move makes gardaí and prison officers more vulnerable.  Sentencing a person to 40 years in prison may have the effect of endangering the lives of prison officers because the prisoner will have lost all hope for the future.  We should make no apology for leaving the power with the Minister for Justice to review sentences in such cases.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot accept an amendment along those lines on Committee Stage he should bring forward his own amendment on Report Stage.  It is the will of the House that he should retain this power or have a power along the lines suggested by Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan.  It will be too difficult to review any sentence after a capital murder takes place.  The Minister should remove the section or amend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that a prison term of 40 years is a harsh sentence but I was guided in this as the Minister responsible for the Garda and prison officers.  I would prefer if I was able to recommend a shorter sentence but, for the reasons I have given, it would be wrong of me to do so.  I should like to emphasise that the power of pardon in very special circumstances, mentioned by Deputy McCartan, lies with the President acting on the recommendation of the Government. This time I have put in a clause concerning the normal remission of 25 <Col N="2050" /> per cent in regard to those whose sentences were commuted from death to 40 years.  It is now written into the Bill.  I fully understand the concern of the Deputies in relation to taking this power but I have to weigh against the decision &mdash; finally and thankfully &mdash; to remove the death penalty from the Statute Book and not to send the wrong signals to subversives and others who would attack gardaí and prison officers and indeed who have been known to murder them.  I must protect the lives of gardaí and prison officers.</P>

However, in all circumstances, when it has gone from the jurisdiction of the courts and back into the realm of administration the Minister should retain that power because, otherwise, the legislation is draconian.  The safety valve should be there and the Minister should retain the power in some shape or form. He should review the matter along the lines of Deputy O'Keeffe's recommendations. I strongly support the objective of handing out tough sentences but I should like the Minister to reserve the right to review them.  That is the feeling of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to some of the points made to the amendments in my name on behalf of The <Col N="2051" /> Workers' Party because some Deputies may have misunderstood what we are seeking to achieve.  I am totally in agreement with what Deputy Mitchell said to the House a few moments ago.  He has made my case in advance of the amendments. Deputy Doyle said that there should be a provision for locking up a person for life.  That provision exists at present and that is what life imprisonment by definition and by term means. The court has the power to put a person into prison for his or her natural life, from the moment of sentence to whenever life expires.  However, when the sentence has been imposed factors affecting the demeanour of the offender, the society from which he has been taken, the view of the Minister of the day and people who have responsibility for the person locked up, all come into play.  When the person has been imprisoned, better informed opinion in the light of developments comes into play &mdash; and the prison administration let offenders out at various times.  Some people who have been sentenced to life imprisonment have been let out within two years of the sentence being imposed but others will never get out.  A third category may get out for a short period on different occasions but will probably never be out on a full term basis.  It is conceivable that many people serving life imprisonment today will be there for the rest of their natural lives.  I am simply arguing that that panoply of eventualities is adequate to deal with a person who commits murder as provided for under sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I equally support the proposition that, for the purposes of sending out signals, a Minister can make a statement that, because of the nature of the offence, the sentence will be for an exceptionally long period.  I do not think any Members have a doubt in this regard.  The view is shared by all that someone who commits an offence as grievous as those contemplated under sections 3 and 4 should be incarcerated for an exceptionally long period because of the reasons advanced by the Minister, the threat of terrorism, the attack it represents on an institution of the State, etc.  It is being argued here <Col N="2052" /> that we should also allow for other factors.  I appreciate that the Minister is resolute in believing that he has a balance in the Bill and I acknowledge that his job is somewhat more difficult than mine.</P>
    <P>However, if we allow the minimum period of 40 and 20 years respectively, why is there a need to introduce subsection (1) of section 5?  This concerns the absolute prohibition of powers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, being exercised by a Minister dealing with such a person until or after the term of imprisonment has been served.  Why not allow that power, provided for under section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, to stand and let it also be understood that the clear message from this House is that it would take an extraordinary set of circumstances for a Minister to release a person or to commute a sentence under that section where the offence was one with which we are dealing here?  Is that a possible balance we could seek to achieve in this debate?  If so, it would meet my worries and considerations because it would meet the point in the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Keeffe and Deputy Flanagan.  If this compromise is possible the clear message would go out under section 4 that the term would be a minimum of 40 years for the offence and a term of 20 years for an attempt but that degree of culpability is not something to be walked away from by suggesting that it is not likely that someone would be charged.  Even where the firm charge should be laid there are degrees of culpability; there are degrees of participation, the principle of the law says that an accessory may be charged as principal, in the first degree, and be convicted and dealt with on that basis.  There are also factors that can follow thereafter.  I do not think we should under-play that issue in terms of clear signalling.  We should be clear in signalling that there is no tolerance of terrorism in this country.</P>
    <P>There is also another area in respect of which clear signals can be sent out, that is, trying to bring some pressure to bear on the minds of terrorists that their campaign is futile, that there are <i>quid pro quo</i> if they end their campaign of violence.  In <Col N="2053" /> that context the powers available to a Minister under section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, would be all important. That has been recognised in part by the Minister in allowing prisoners home from Portlaoise Prison over the Christmas period and in getting the review committee to undertake their task as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained his reason for reintroducing the remission provision, having consulted and listened to arguments advanced by persons involved in prison administration and the important role that plays.  The Minister has not explained at any stage why the provisions of section 5 (1) are so important other than making the point that the clear signal must be there &mdash; absolutely rigid &mdash; 40 years with good behaviour and absolutely nothing else.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate somewhat on the &ldquo;grave reasons of a humanitarian nature&rdquo; referred to in section 5 (3).  Perhaps he could say what circumstances are envisaged in that context.  That is an important explanation which should be available to help us understand the full import of this Bill.  I wonder whether that would constitute a compromise that might commend itself to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell the House the definition of &ldquo;treason&rdquo; in relation to this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is defined in the Treason Act, 1939.  We have not got a copy handy but will endeavour to get it for the Deputy.  I am told it is also contained in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>With regard to the &ldquo;grave reasons of a humanitarian nature&rdquo; to which Deputy McCartan referred, the circumstances envisaged would be, say, the death of a wife or a serious illness which would be treated in hospital.  Mainly it would be on the death of a close relative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question, once we have determined to prescribe a heavy mandatory penalty as a deterrent to the murder of a garda, prison officer and so on &mdash; if it is to have the desired deterrent effect <Col N="2054" />&mdash; we must make it abundantly clear that it will not be watered down.  That is why the Bill provides for the exclusion of the powers of remission and early release normally exerciseable by the Minister or the Government.  Of course, it will still be possible for the President to exercise his constitutional power to remit or commute a sentence on the advice of the Government.  That could be exercised in a very rare, exceptional case, which was the point Deputy McCartan was making. He was not making the point on a general review of these types of capital offences. If I understand him correctly he was saying that, in the rare, exceptional case, we should have power to commute, but only in such cases.</P>
    <P>That power is already available to the Government in advising the President in the case of a capital offence rather than the normal day-to-day powers exercised by a Minister in relation to remissions and changes in sentencing, in particular in relation to long-term sentencing, on the advice of the review group &mdash; it being a capital offence no Minister should exercise that power alone.  If there were rare, exceptional circumstances involved he should go to Government who would then, collectively advise the President.  I believe that to be the appropriate way to proceed in this respect.</P>
    <P>If I may quote Article 39 of the Constitution it says:</P>
    <P>Treason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by this Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt. </P>

      <P>In the Minister's closing comments in relation to the role of the President in the case of remissions or commutations it would appear that he is making a little more play out of this <Col N="2055" /> provision than had been the case heretofore. For example, does he envisage a broadened role for the President in this respect in view of the Minister not being afforded the powers of commutation that obtain at present, that he is now passing on this power to the President?  Could the Minister inform the House whether there is any precedent in this regard.  I understand that in the forties a petition was opened that attracted almost 20,000 signatures but did not have the desired effect, it did not deliver the goods.  Is the Minister now saying that the only safety valve available will be the role of the President and that he now envisages that to be a broadened role?  If that is not the case, would he reconsider his opposition to the Fine Gael amendment which will be the only real safety valve then available?</P>

    <P>This is purely a drafting amendment.  Section 5 of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, provides that, in certain circumstances, a person who commits any of certain terrorist acts anywhere in the world shall be guilty of an offence against the law of the State as if he had done that act in the State.  Section 6 (4) of that Act ensures that, in the case of an act that would have amounted to capital murder if committed in the State, the effect of section 5 of the 1987 Act should be that the offender be sentenced to imprisonment for life instead of death.  Section 6 (4) of the 1987 Act will become redundant as a result of the Bill and the amendment proposes to repeal it.</P>

We are making history this afternoon by proceeding to join the many civilised states throughout the world which have removed the penalty of lawful killing from the Statute Book.  Killing in any form cannot be justified and capital punishment as a form of retribution or deterrent is unworthy of a democratic and Christian society.

In the publication of Amnesty International, <i>When the State Kills</i>, which I quoted in opening my contribution, they note that today:</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I do not intend to oppose this Bill or delay its passage through the House but I want to put down a marker on section 3 on the question of the carriage of goods by road.  This section sets down certain penalties for failure to comply with the provisions of the Bill. I regret that the Bill concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods, which will give rise to accession to what is known as the ADR Agreement is not being brought before the House at the same time as this Bill.  Not only is there no legislation to deal with the modern safe carriage of toxic waste by rail, but there is no legislation to deal with the modern safe carriage of toxic waste or related dangerous substances by road. The ADR Bill is long overdue and should be before the House in tandem with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an indication of inertia within <Col N="2061" /> the Department of Tourism and Transport and this is further witnessed by the fact that we are the last European State to sign the ADR Agreement and to introduce the appropriate legislation.  I make this point on section 3 because I believe that the Bill is overdue and we will be in very difficult circumstances if there is a major toxic problem on road or rail.  I will draw the Minister's attention to what is called the &ldquo;Asahi Express&rdquo; which travels on a line where we have had a derailment and almost a second derailment caused by cattle crossing.  These incidents could have occurred while the &ldquo;Asahi Express&rdquo;, which carries highly toxic substances from Dublin to Mayo was on the line.  I think we should be taking the ADR legislation in conjunction with this Bill so that we can come to terms with the question of a safe carriage of toxic goods by either road or rail.  This needs to be attended to.  However, having said that I do not want to delay the passage of this Bill.  It is purely technical legislation which has the support of the haulage industry and also has European-wide support. I am sorry we are the last country to deal with this matter and that this inertia exists.  We should be taking the ADR Bill in tandem with this one and deal with the whole question of the transport of toxic waste by road and rail and also the transport of other dangerous goods.</P>

      <P>I confirm that Ireland has not acceded to the ADR &mdash; we are the only member state of the European Community in that position &mdash; because it has not the required legislation or administrative or technical arrangements in place.  The Deputy is right in that a Bill would be needed to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and arrangements put in place for the testing and certification of equipment and packaging and driver competence.

      <P>Given the experience of recent times, can the Minister assure the House that any expenses incurred in the administration of this Bill will be properly monitored by his Department? For instance, I am concerned that there is not even one accountant in the Department of Tourism and Transport, and I use this occasion to highlight that matter. It is totally unacceptable that, in a Department of its size, with so many State and semi-State bodies under its aegis, there is no fully fledged accountant capable of monitoring these expenses and advising the Minister and Minister of State on matters of a broader nature in relation to this industry and also in relation to semi-State bodies in general. As we are allowing the Minister to incur expenses in the administration of the Bill, I use this occasion to make that comment.</P>

Recently I had experience of a case where a person imported the ashes of a loved one from the UK.  What would happen in that case if the ashes went astray?

I want to make some comments at this stage, and particularly to highlight the fact that it has been alleged that members of the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and the Progressive Democrats were not present during the debate last Friday.  I was attending another function in Trinity College relating to transport which was of equal importance &mdash; some would argue it was of more importance.

      <P>The Workers' Party do not oppose the Bill.  It is a relatively straight-forward and non-controversial measure, aimed at enabling this country to ratify the Convention on the contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road.  As a Deputy representing Dublin city, the Minister will be very conscious that the amount of goods conveyed through our congested and built-up city streets is the cause of major problems.  Although this is a technical Bill, it indicates that more companies than ever will be conveying goods cross-Channel and into Dublin. The Minister might consider other methods of transporting these massive container trucks which cause so much damage to inner city roads.  He might look at a system in operation in Europe where the containers are driven straight on to trains that take them to locations outside the city boundary.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann has no confidence in the Minister for Justice and Communications. </P>
      <P>The speech made by the Minister for Justice and Communications in the debate which he so cleverly succeeded in truncating last week had a number of interesting features.  One of the most interesting was that the Broadcasting Bill, 1990, was boiled down to its bare essentials in the course of this speech. The Bill had started life as a panic measure aimed at saving Century Radio from the consequences of its own mismanagement. It had attempted to secure support for this crude and corrupt approach by offering largesse, in smaller amounts, to every commercial station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have seen these tactics backfired. What had started life as a brazen attempt by the Minister to save political friends and supporters of his party from losing their investment quickly turned into a fiasco for the whole Government. In short order, we discovered that the Cabinet had not been consulted about a number of the items in the Bill, and that <Col N="2067" /> the doctrine of collective Cabinet responsibility had been thrown out the window.  As events unfolded, we learned that the leader of the Opposition had been more thoroughly consulted than some key members of the Government.</P>
    <P>So, several meetings and helicopter rides later, a compromise was apparently agreed between the two party Leaders in the Coalition. That compromise led, among other things, to a speech at the weekend by the Chairman of the Progressive Democrats, who obviously feels that since he is not even a member of this Dáil, the issue of collective responsibility need not worry him unduly.</P>
    <P>Speaking for the Progressive Democrats, their chairman is not only willing to defend the legislation as it stands, but is insisting on claiming all the credit for it. I can only conclude that the Progressive Democrats political judgment has grown in direct proportion to their number of seats, and that they have decided that now they are in bed with the very people whose integrity they lambasted on issues like these a couple of years ago, they had better make the most of a bad job.  Either that, or the Progressive Democrats are willing to join the political conspiracy that this Bill represents.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence that that in fact is the position.  I would welcome a categoric assurance from the Leader of the Progressive Democrats in this House that he did not agree to suspend his reservations about the sale of Cablelink shares as part of the &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; he worked out with the Taoiseach.  In the absence of such an assurance, I believe that there is more than coincidence in the timing of the announcement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the matter, and I intend to say more about that shortly.</P>
    <P>I referred a moment ago to a conspiracy, and to the fact that the Broadcasting Bill has now been pared down to its essentials.  I believe that most Members of this House, on all sides, know in their hearts that this Bill represents nothing other than an attempt by Fianna Fáil to destroy our national <Col N="2068" /> broadcasting company, and to pave the way for commercial television by destroying the ability of RTE to compete effectively.</P>
    <P>In the Bill that he is now proposing to this House, this Minister for Justice and Communications is abrogating to himself the power to ordain whether RTE lives or dies.  Not only is he placing a limit on the revenue that RTE can earn through advertising, but he is fixing that limit by reference to RTE's licence income.  He is taking £6 million from RTE's income this year, and up to £20 million next year. Thereafter, he can play around with RTE's ability to plan and develop as he likes, whenever he likes and by whatever decision he might make about the licence fee.</P>
    <P>If at some stage in the future he decided that it was politically popular to knock, say, a sum of £10 from the licence fee &mdash; and there is no doubt that that would be popular in the short term &mdash; the effect of that would be to take about £10 million from RTE's revenue.  But, as a result of the capping mechanism he is now proposing &mdash; and which the Progressive Democrats are claiming credit for &mdash; such a move would also take a further £10 million from RTE's advertising revenue.  In this way, the Minister, if he succeeds in having this legislation as outlined last week passed, can play God with RTE's future.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate we will be hearing a great deal about the job losses that will flow from this legislation.  Job losses will occur in RTE itself, and they will occur among the many independent film-makers who provide a range of valuable programmes to RTE.  There will be job losses, too, in the advertising industry. My colleague Deputy Higgins will be spelling out some of the impacts that this legislation will have on jobs.</P>
    <P>But perhaps in the long term the even more serious repercussion of this Bill will be on the confidence of one of our most valuable creative assets in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Without television, people power would never have taken off in the Philippines. It was television that made the breakthrough that led to the Camp David <Col N="2069" /> accords between Egypt and Israel.  It was television that led the way to a deepening conviction on both sides of the Irish Sea about the innocence of the Birmingham Six.  It was television that moved millions throughout the world last November when the Berlin Wall began to crack and fall.  No one who saw it, thanks to television, will ever forget the sight of Nelson Mandela walking out of captivity, and into a possible new dawn of democracy in South Africa.  Against this background, no one can dispute the power of television for good.</P>
    <P>Nobody would stand here in front of this House and say that RTE has never made a mistake, or has always been fair, or that we agree with every decision that RTE has ever made.  I would not stand here and say that I have always found television friendly.  However, I would argue that RTE have served the national interest well and that they have at all times upheld and protected high standards of public service broadcasting. More than that, RTE news and current affairs have played a major role in ensuring that the people of Ireland have always been able to play a significant part in our democratic process.  It is poor reward that, in return for that contribution, RTE are now going to be destroyed as a viable institution at the whim of the Fianna Fáil Party, and at the hands of a Minister with a very poor record.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I believe the main purpose of this infamous Broadcasting Bill is the destruction of RTE as a viable entity and to pave the way for the introduction of commercial television.  The irony is that the Bill will not work. Commercial television will not work in Ireland unless it attracts an adequate audience. I know that the Minister's purpose, in seeking to divert revenue from RTE and to force RTE to provide nationwide transmission facilities for their competition, is to make as much room for the entrepreneurs as possible, but that competition can only succeed if it stands on its own feet and produces quality programming. Surely, if no other lesson can <Col N="2070" /> be learned from the Century misadventure, that much must be learned.</P>
    <P>Speaking in the curtailed debate on the Minister's Broadcasting Bill last week, I detailed some of the history of that misadventure.  I tried to demonstrate to the House, by reference to the Minister's own speeches, that in 1987, the Minister believed in a non-interventionist approach where commercial radio was concerned, at least on the surface.  The reason, I said, was simple.  The Minister's friends and supporters were at that time advising him that all he had to do was to give the green light for commercial radio, create the right sort of commercial climate in the community at large, and it would become a licence to print money with, no doubt, great spin-off benefits for everyone involved.</P>
    <P>As we all know now, of course, the reality was that the Minister's friends turned out to be much better at advising him about politics than they were at running a radio station.  Century Radio was started with highly professional and committed staff who were prepared to work long hours to make a success of their venture.  The news service provided by Century in particular quickly gathered a reputation as being highly professional.  I know, for example, that their main news bulletin in the middle of the day is listened to avidly by the RTE Newsroom. It probably is not possible to pay a higher compliment to the professionalism of Century's staff than that, but unfortunately from the very beginning, the station was under-capitalised and badly marketed by its proprietors.  The station got off to a bad start as a result of the row involving its transmission facilities, and the management appeared to be unable to determine what audience they should be aiming for.  It was a station without any particular role or niche in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, the Minister's friends had to go back to him to tell him that they were unable to make a go of the station. He was probably very surprised &mdash; after all, he had already intervened with RTE to force RTE to charge a lower than economic fee for transmission facilities, <Col N="2071" /> and had generally kept the RTE Authority very busy responding to his instructions and demands.  For example, he had refused to allow RTE Local Radio in Cork to broadcast around the clock, as they had requested, and insisted that the station sell a substantial proportion of its shares in Cablelink, thereby affecting RTE's cash flow and potential surplus for years into the future.  I will return to some of these issues later on.</P>
    <P>Whatever else may be said about the Minister, it has to be said that he is loyal to his friends and political supporters. He, therefore, set about putting together the package which he unveiled in this House two weeks ago.  It did not appear to matter to him or to the Taoiseach that that package flew in the face of both logic and fairness.  The bottom line for the Minister and the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Government is that their friends must be looked after.</P>
    <P>Among the friends and supporters of these two parties, of course, are those commercial interests that are fascinated by the prospects of privatisation.  The attack on RTE conducted by the Minister has an underlying current which is intimately bound up with the privatisation argument, an argument spelled out in all its nakedness last week by the present chairman of Bord Telecom soon, I imagine, to be reappointed.</P>
    <P>Bord Telecom have bought most of Cablelink from RTE and a minority partner. That sale was ordered by the Minister &mdash;it would not have happened otherwise. I have no objection in principle to this transfer of ownership between two State companies, but I strongly object to the motivation behind it.  The purpose of this transfer, I believe, was twofold.</P>
    <P>First, it was part of the continuing process of weakening RTE.  RTE were forced by the Minister to sell their shares for far less than their commercial value. The immediate effect will be a further loss of £2 million to £3 million in revenue for RTE, coupled with the loss of very considerable potential earnings in the future.  To compound the situation, the Minister for Communications has already determined that any capital windfall <Col N="2072" /> accruing to RTE from the sale of these shares will be taken back by the Exchequer, thereby ensuring that RTE get no benefit down the road.</P>
    <P>But just as significant is the fact that this sale will make Telecom Éireann an even more attractive proposition for private speculators.  I have no doubt whatever that the &ldquo;privatisers&rdquo; in the Cabinet, led by Deputy O'Malley, are already preparing for the sell-off of the State's telecommunications company.  Equally I have no doubt that there are many wealthy speculators, with close links to Fianna Fáil, who are now preparing their bids.  It would not surprise me in the least to discover that the financial problems of the two Government parties, caused by the fall off in membership and in collections, will be more than eased by the political outfall of this decision.</P>
    <P>The political ramifications of the announcement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, last Friday should not be ignored.  It seems obvious that he was given concessions on the Broadcasting Bill &mdash; concessions that can clearly be seen to be spurious &mdash; in return for getting out of the way of the sale of Cablelink shares. He has thus clearly decided to align himself totally with Fianna Fáil in their attack on RTE, and will no doubt be willing to come to the defence of the Minister now under attack.  I look forward with interest to his contribution to the debate, and I trust that when he speaks he will outline for us all the Cabinet procedures that were followed in the course of the Minister's adventuring.</P>
    <P>To sum up this aspect of the matter: the Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, has, I believe, forfeited the confidence of this House because of an unprecedented attack on a major State company for naked political reasons.  He has sought to divert public money for the benefit of private speculators, and has sought to do so despite the damage that will cause for jobs and development in our national broadcasting service.  In his attempts to do so, he has employed sharp practice in the Dáil, but much more important than that, he has endeavoured to pervert the <Col N="2073" /> principle of collective responsibility by ignoring tried and trusted Cabinet procedures.</P>
    <P>These are not the only aspects of this matter to which I wish to refer.  I do not believe that the actions of the Minister for Justice and Communications would have been possible were it not for the full-blooded support of the Taoiseach. Indeed, in the debate on the Broadcasting Bill last week, I made the point that the Minister was only carrying out the Taoiseach's bidding.  As long as he does so, and is seen to deliver, it appears that his career will prosper.  He may not always have been on the same side as the Taoiseach in some of the internal Fianna Fáil battles that have gone on in the past, but he has nevertheless always managed to hold down senior positions of trust. When things go badly wrong, as they clearly have on this occasion, the Taoiseach lets him be hung out to dry in this House.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Justice and Communications has been to some extent a puppet in this affair, what can we say of the puppet-master?  It is quite clear that the Taoiseach has long harboured a deep antipathy to RTE.  It is well known that he holds RTE responsible for having the audacity to report on the deep and widespread anger in the community over health cuts in the course of the last election campaign.  In a classic piece of political self-delusion, he appears to believe that it was the reporting rather than the anger that cost him an overall majority in the general election.  He has as much interest in securing advantage for political friends as the Minister Deputy Burke has, if not indeed more.  For that reason, it ought to be very clear that this motion is every bit as much a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach as it is in the Minister.</P>
    <P>I stood in this House for many weeks in 1983, as we debated the Local Government Bill of that year.  The purpose of that Bill, for which I was responsible, was to reconstitute An Bord Pleanála in order to remove from it the political taint with which it was by then indelibly associated. <Col N="2074" /> I can still remember the venomous way in which Fianna Fáil responded to that measure and the determination with which they sought to cling to the power to treat the physical planning process as the gift of politicians.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Justice and Communications was at the centre of that debate.  It was in the main his responsibility that An Bord Pleanála had among their members some persons whose only qualification for the job was their political allegiance to the Fianna Fáil Party, and particularly to him.  Indeed, his own constituency adviser was one of the people that he appointed to An Bord Pleanála in the last few days of his tenure as Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The same Minister has more recently appointed an Independent Radio and Television Commission, independent only in name, with the vast majority of their members appointed as a result of their Fianna Fáil affiliations.  His recent appointment of an RTE Authority contained a clear majority of Fianna Fáil names, too, seasoned of course on this occasion by a couple of members of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious questions that must be asked, both about this administration and the last one, is this: &ldquo;Why has Deputy Ray Burke been given such a stranglehold on the Communications portfolio?  Why has the Leader of both of those administrations, the Taoiseach, seen fit to exercise his prerogative to ensure that we have had a Minister for Energy and Communications, followed by a Minister for Industry and Commerce and Communications, followed by a Minister for Justice and Communications?</P>
    <P>After the last election, in particular, there was some speculation by political commentators that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and Communications could be one of those who would suffer in any necessary reshuffle of the Cabinet.  He was, it is generally felt, among those who, had given very bad advice to the Taoiseach in urging him to dissolve the Dáil after being beaten on a Labour Party motion on haemophilia, and he had failed to hold two seats in <Col N="2075" /> his Dublin North constituency.  For these reasons and others it was generally felt at that time that his political star was on the wane.</P>
    <P>However, when the new Government were announced, Deputy Burke's critics were yet again confounded.  Not only had he not lost his place around the Cabinet table, he had been given one of the most sensitive portfolios imaginable, a position of enormous trust, with access to a great deal of sensitive information, and responsibility for supervising important investigative work by the Garda Síochána.  As time went by, it became clear that this Minister was trusted a great deal by his Taoiseach &mdash; for example, he began to play a key role in Anglo-Irish affairs, often being sent to the Anglo-Irish Conference when much bluster and tough talk was required.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House, I believe, knows &mdash; or should know &mdash; the sensitivity of the Justice portfolio &mdash; it was, after all, one of Deputy Burke's recent predecessors who managed to bring his entire party into disrepute through his abuse of the job.  The effective management of the Garda Síochána, the prison service, the parole service, the courts, the Land Registry, the civil legal aid service, the huge workload in law reform, difficulties associated with extradition, and other matters &mdash; all of these are tasks enough for any member of a Government to carry alone.  When they are added to the ultra-sensitive management of intelligence, membership of the Security Committee of the Cabinet, and involvement in the Anglo-Irish process, and when, added to all that, is the personal strain associated with physical security in the job, there is little wonder that it has long been the case that the Justice portfolio is seen as one of the most difficult and burdensome jobs in Irish politics.  For many years now, it has been inconceivable that any one person could be expected to carry this portfolio as well as another portfolio.  It was, therefore, no surprise that the appointment of Deputy Burke to both jobs was greeted with some astonishment and not a little comment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2076" /> This comment was occasioned not only by the huge workload involved, but also by the fact that in the past, it had been easy to see that Deputy Burke had signally failed to carry both of them effectively. He had been a part-time Minister for Energy, at a time when the country was demanding &mdash; and he was promising &mdash; legal action against the British in respect of Sellafield.  Hardly a week went by during his tenure of that portfolio without threats of legal action, but in the end, unfortunately, nothing happened.</P>
    <P>When he was part-time Minister for Industry and Commerce he presided over that Department while a great deal of funny business went on in the area of export credit insurance.  I understand that Deputy O'Malley still spends sleepless nights as he worries about cleaning up the mess.</P>
    <P>It would be putting it at its kindest to say that Deputy Burke has been a part-time Minister for Justice.  He has presided over the virtual collapse of the free legal aid system, making promises to this House in the matter that were never kept. He is sitting on a potentially explosive situation in our prisons, arising from his own failure to address issues of overcrowding and health care.  He is in overall charge of the Fraud Squad which, for reasons of lack of resources and necessary skills, have been unable to conduct a proper investigation of fraud for years, despite ample evidence that there is a great deal of business fraud to be uncovered.</P>
    <P>In the recent past, for example, the State entered a defence in a claim for damages by a major beef processing company. The essence of the State's defence was that the original claim was fraudulent. Notwithstanding that defence, the claim was settled out of court, with the State agreeing to pay over more than a million pounds in settlement.  Where was the Minister for Justice while this was going on?  Why was he not ensuring that the State's claim of fraudulent activity was investigated by the Garda?  Are we to assume that that sort of thing simply never happens with a Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> Within the last couple of weeks, Deputy Burke's colleague, the Minister for the Environment, did not demur when Deputy Ruairí Quinn stated in this House that Fianna Fáil councillors in Dublin had been corruptly interfered with.  Deputy Burke has overall responsibility for the Garda investigation into those allegations.  Are we to assume that he sees it as his task to ensure that that investigation never sees the light of day, as the results would undoubtedly be damaging to his party?</P>
    <P>Why has there been no properly resourced investigation into the allegations surrounding the collapse of the Gallagher banking empire?  We have all read recently that because the Fraud Squad have been unable to conduct a proper investigation into these matters, it is now extremely likely that no prosecution will ever take place, and this is despite the admission by the Minister for Finance in this House recently, under questioning by Deputy Mervyn Taylor, that the collapse of that Bank involved extensive wrong-doing.  We all know that the principal involved in that bank has been prosecuted, and convicted, in the North of Ireland, for activities that all stemmed from Dublin, yet our Minister for Justice will be unable to come in here and tell us that a properly-completed file has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions to enable a prosecution to commence in this jurisdiction.  In the meantime, this great friend to the Fianna Fáil Party has already paid a half-million pounds in fines in the North, without any apparent difficulty, and is busy transacting business in London as we debate this issue here in the Dáil, and all the while the Taoiseach steadfastly refuses to initiate a debate in the House on all of the issues involved in that scandal.  The only conclusion possible is that such a debate would be extremely embarrassing for Fianna Fáil and their friends and supporters.</P>
    <P>These are some of the areas in which this Minister for Justice has been responsible for what can only be described as extraordinarily poor management of his <Col N="2078" /> portfolio.  I believe that it is necessary to go further than that.  I believe that this Deputy has been placed in these two sensitive and delicate jobs in order to ensure that Fianna Fáil's interests are protected where it counts.  As they see it, their interests lie in ensuring that political friends and supporters are looked after when it comes to commerce, and protected when it comes to justice.</P>
    <P>In putting those interests first, the Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, has ignored the national interest.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal in particular with the aspects of education for which the Minister has responsibility. Let me begin with the use of two words, not mine.  The words I refer to are &ldquo;cutting corners&rdquo;.  They were the words used on television by the Minister's colleague in Cabinet, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, who in answer to a question said, &ldquo;On this Bill I suppose corners were cut.&rdquo;  Last week we had more corners cut in relation to Parliament.  I believe that in moving this motion we are reflecting the right of the House to be the ultimate place where there is responsibility for policy, practice and procedures within ministerial portfolios. What we have just listened to, what the world knows, is that there was a scandalous short-circuiting of normal Cabinet procedures being reported in the public Press and that the Bill itself which was introduced last week was not presented to Cabinet in a manner in which it could be discussed.  Perhaps people who deny this will say others are running away from the Bill.  &ldquo;Cutting corners&rdquo; is Deputy O'Malley's phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell on the parliamentary procedures that were followed, but I will say communications policy is important for this country and an end must be put to what is taking place now.  If the Minister insists on coming into this House with a Bill which he has been told by his Cabinet colleagues, consulted or unconsulted, is flawed, if he will insist on that Bill being on the Floor of the House, if he will refuse to stand up on Second Stage and reply to the suggestion <Col N="2079" /> that interests are being benefited by this flawed Bill, if he will say to this House, &ldquo;It requires no more than two minutes&rdquo;, then it is time for the Minister to go.</P>
    <P>In relation to what is happening and the interests involved I have not very much time this evening but I will spend a great deal of time going in some detail into this area on Committee Stage of the Broadcasting Bill.  The Minister was preceded by certain decisions in his portfolio. It has often been said that Deputy O'Sullivan, I and others have an ideological position in relation to broadcasting. That is true, but what we object to is the sell-off of a public asset to people who are unaccountable.  An example of that took place when the World Administrative Radio Conference allocated Ireland its orbital position at 31º W.  On that occasion a Minister decided to award a DBS concession to a private consortium, Atlantic Satellites.  Very shortly afterwards it transpired they were just an Irish front for the US Hughes Communications.</P>
    <P>What is the relevance of this?  When Deputies in this House say there are interests that are standing behind the changes in communications policy there is only one place to give the names or the denial of those interests and that is in this House.  The debacle that took place last week began with a concern for Century but it quickly turned into, under influence of the Progressive Democrats we are told, a concern for the future of TV3.</P>
    <P>Is it not appropriate in this House to hear what plans are involved for TV3? Perhaps people feel it is not of relevance politically who will own communications. It is interesting that in the negotiations regarding innovations through the use of satellites, the Irish Government's applications for frequencies specified bands in the part of the spectrum reserved for telecommunications rather than conventional television programmes.  In other words they were setting up the whole run of this policy which was never stated in this House.  TV3 is being set up in an atmosphere where it will fit neatly with the privatised Bord Telecom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> There is a reference in the Bill to dignity. A broadcaster is not supposed to reflect on the dignity and reputation of people being interviewed.  How was this House treated with dignity when the Minister said he would not reply to suggestions made about interests involved in broadcasting?  He says he need not do that and will just go on, after cutting corners in Cabinet, by cutting a few more corners in the Dáil as well.  Of course, he has not done so.  He has drawn this debate on him and a Committee Stage where people will be able to go into every matter in detail which concerns broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion which has not received a reply relates to the peculiar vindictiveness directed against the State broadcasting service.  There are people in this House who sometimes speak about a consensus in favour of neo-liberal economics. What was proposed was not neo-liberal economics.  It was based on the belief that one must mutilate one person in the competitive arena to give a prospective person in the arena an automatic advantage.  This means that if TV3 gets up and running, the people who have turned losses into profits will be mutilated, in case it is needed for the sake of TV3.  That is the kind of anti-national thrust that was behind the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister began by suggesting something which was perhaps illegal or unconstitutional, telling people who pay a licence fee, which is a tax, that they will now be paying it not for public service broadcasting but to generate a little fund for the people who are coming home to Mammy when it becomes tough in the commercial sector.  In addition there was a suggestion that advertising would be capped, reaching into the commercial practices of a company.  Then there was the outrageous suggestion of telling one aspect of broadcasting that it could not continue with its content.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, who might or might not have read the Bill and later spoke about it, suggested that they had got him off the licence fee, as if that is some great parliamentary game.  The second version of what the Minister was at was very interesting.  The man who <Col N="2081" /> controls the licence fee now wants to control the ceiling on advertising in the State broadcasting company.  One man could refuse an increase in the licence fee or could reduce it and thereby stifle the capacity of that body to compete in the market place.  What an unusual power to seek.  In addition he included for good measure advertisements for their own programmes broadcast by RTE.  The National Symphony Orchestra has recently been restored to full strength but if RTE announce that they are to give a concert in the National Concert Hall, that will be part of their advertising allocation. Advertisements for any programmes will form part of their advertising allocation. This is from the free market Minister.  It is not as if his embryonic TV3 would ever provide videos on health or education, orchestras or even a trio at any stage of their existence.</P>
    <P>He then dealt with the question of the licence fee.  It will be the ceiling.  For whose benefit will it be the ceiling?  Is he not under an obligation to say in this House for whose benefit it will be?  Then there is the question of this Minister's legacy.  He will acknowledge that I am one of the few Deputies who have sat through every one of his speeches on broadcasting since 1982.  I heard him talk about MMDS.  He was to be in charge of the revolutionary technology of MMDS, but it went wrong for the commercial interests in TV3.  What does one do then? The people who have got the contract for TV3 are told that they need no longer be confined to MMDS and that they will use a transmission system which is beyond that.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister wanted to interfere in Cablelink.  His absence of policy was reflected in the inability to publish a policy in relation to communications or any aspect of it.  He said that TV3 could use a UHF process but it did not occur to him that one of the principal transmitters is a VHF one.  That would not bother the Minister who says, &ldquo;I make it up as I go along and maybe I might tell the Cabinet.  Sure, who would want to tell them anyhow?  We will have a chat <Col N="2082" /> about it afterwards.&rdquo;  He sat there day after day after the principal puppet master was swanning around the Gaeltacht saying that Teilefís Ghaeltachta would be on offer.  Whatever happened to that?  The Minister would not tell this House that the transmission capacity that would have enabled Teilefís Ghaeltachta to go on air was being given to TV3.  If the MMDS system was unsuitable for TV3, would it not be unsuitable for Teilefís Ghaeltachta?  The old bankrupt republicans ditched the Irish language a long time ago when they appointed an absentee landlord Minister for the Gaeltacht who will not even speak a word of Irish in this House.</P>
    <P>One reason why he should go from office is the destruction of between 300 and 500 jobs in RTE.  It will be the end of the documentary and the end of the independently commissioned film.  About 90 independent film makers each hiring between six and ten people provide films on contract to RTE.  It will be the end of educational programmes.  Those who are the most disgracefully treated, the artists, the people who are in Equity, the people whom the emperor of all the Europeans likes to patronise rather than make provision for, will lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the length of the advertisement will affect jobs in advertising. What will happen to all these jobs? The advertising which would sustain jobs in RTE has to be knocked off in case the friends need it, but in the meantime the jobs will go to UTV and Channel Four. In addition the people who prepare the advertisements will get jobs, the creative people.  It is a recipe for destroying jobs in one of the most creative and sensitive areas.  Until very recently a great number of the television commercials shown here were made abroad.  That position has been reversed.  At present most of them are made here.  The Minister is now reversing the trend and sending that activity and those jobs abroad.</P>
    <P>We come to the nub of the matter. Does this House have responsibility for a communications policy and is there a policy in the thing of bits and pieces that the Minister has presided over?  Does this <Col N="2083" /> House stand for accountability in relation to interests who will benefit commercially, who will make money but who might know nothing about broadcasting in the aural or visual media?  This is the place to debate these issues but the Minister has defied all those criteria &mdash; he will not announce a communications policy and he will not come into the House to reply to questions as to who stands behind the proposals.  His activities in the Department of Communications have been anti-national and anti-worker and above all yesterday they smacked of William Martin Murphy &mdash; the idea of going out to people and asking why they were not at their desk?  Why was the Minister and his officials not at their desks preparing a communications policy?  It is much easier to sit at the desk and wait for your friends to come in and ask for bits and pieces, saying, &ldquo;there might be money in radio but I am sorry it did not work out and we must make sure the same does not happen to TV3&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is this Minister who is creating the situation where not alone will we not own our own communications system but our general telecommunications system, on which taxpayers have spent £1.6 billion, will be robbed from the public and handed over to the private sector.  That is what the sale to Telecom and its fattening is about.  I want to ask the Progressive Democrats why, in their helicopter flight, did they not ask for the Bill to be withdrawn.  Why did many of the Minister's party who disagree with this legislation not ask for it to be with-drawn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not heard anything to equal it in this House for some time.  If the Deputy wants to achieve some distinction in that direction he is welcome to it but this motion is being taken seriously by those of us on this side of the House; indeed the Leader of the Deputy's party, Deputy Spring, who spoke before him did nothing to add to the seriousness of the motion.  His speech was a classical smear speech, coloured by assertions such as &ldquo;everybody knows&rdquo; and other defamatory allegations and assertions.  Who is &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; in that context?  His speech was a classical smear tactic.  Both Deputy Higgins and Deputy Spring have done nothing to add to the stature of this House.

      <P>This motion of no confidence is rejected absolutely by the Government.  We share the view held by many people, outside the people of <Col N="2086" /> peculiar vindictiveness, that Deputy Burke, in managing the affairs of the Department of Justice and the Department of Communications is reflecting the outstanding approach of this Government in getting things done.</P>
      <P>When we came into Government we inherited a situation where nothing had been done in regard to broadcasting by the most dilatory administration in this country's history.  From 1983 to 1987, along with neglecting a long range of legitimate Government activities there was non-participation, counter-participation &mdash; we saw this adumbrated in great length in a book published recently by a former Minister of that Government &mdash; and a long period of indecision by that administration, and in no area was that indecision more apparent than in the area of broadcasting.  Rampaging pirates were broadcasting all sorts of unregulated matters on the airwaves to the disgrace and detriment of the administration of broadcasting and, in particular, of RTE.  If that situation had been allowed to continue unrestricted, as it was let go unrestricted by the Government who were in office from 1983-87, RTE would have been driven into bankruptcy. We decided collectively as a Government that this disgraceful record in public broadcasting and allowing pirate buccaneer broadcasting to prosper &mdash; the conservatives and the socialists favoured the buccaneers who were running pirate broadcasting and allowed them to broadcast on the airwaves unhindered and unrestricted &mdash; had to be stopped and some order and regulation, administered by legislation of this House and Government through Government bodies, should be initiated to ensure that a properly licensed, regulated and controlled system of broadcasting would be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the Minister for Communications, Deputy Ray Burke, who took a very historic jump in that respect, with the full support of the Government, and said that the nonsense of the previous four years had to stop.  He brought in what I would regard as the historic broadcasting Bill which set up the broadcasting <Col N="2087" /> commission and enabled private and co-operative broadcasting to be properly regulated on a local and national basis throughout the country.  That proceeded very successfully under the excellent chairmanship of Mr. Justice Henchy, who had retired from the Irish Supreme Court.</P>

These are facts. In parliamentary terms confidence means confidence in the achievement or non-achievement of the Government, not smear campaigns, personalities or alleged political friends.

      <P>We rescued RTE from bankruptcy, set in train a series of radio stations throughout the country and eliminated the pirate stations.  That is now on the record.  Having achieved a mix of public broadcasting through RTE and private broadcasting through independent radio stations, the Government's next duty was to ensure that equity prevailed in a free and fair market within which the stations operate so that RTE and the private independent operators that had been established could flourish.  That was the motivation behind the introduction of the Broadcasting Bill before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the pursuance of that, various options had to be examined.  Points of view were expressed by people who are genuinely interested in broadcasting and suggestions made as to how this could be achieved.  We have now come to the conclusion that the best way to achieve <Col N="2089" /> this is to have a balance of advertising within that pool as between RTE and the private independent broadcasting operators. How this can be done is a matter of pragmatism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>If the principle of equality between the operators of RTE and those of the independent radio operators is accepted, this can be achieved.  There is room for differences of opinion in how that can be achieved.  We considered that the way to ensure equality between RTE and the independent broadcasting firms was to put a ceiling on advertising by RTE equal to the extent of revenue from their dues.  We considered that this would also mean fair play for people involved in advertising in the print media who should also be considered for equality of treatment.  RTE had two sources of revenue, their dues and advertising revenue and we are limiting the advertising revenue to the level of the dues.  That ensures a fairer playing field for the print media, the newspapers both national and provincial, and for the various private and co-operative firms engaged in radio broadcasting at the moment and who will be engaged in television broadcasting in the future.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a constructive effort to create as equitable an environment as possible, doing as little damage and as much good as possible to the constituent operators in this area.  That is what the Government are trying to do.  Let us have a debate on whether this is the best way to go about it, but let us not reduce a discussion on this highly important matter to the level of smear politics.</P>

We stand by the Minister in pursuing that philosophy of the 1987 Government now carried on by the present Government backing that Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go on at considerable length about other areas in regard to the positive aspects of what Minister Burke has contributed to the advancement of this and the previous Government.  I could mention the progress that has been made by Telecom Éireann which, under his direction, has become one of the big progressive bodies.  When Telecom Éireann was established some six years ago it was on very weak ground having inherited telecommunications services and equipment which has been totally dismantled largely by the Minister who has pursued a policy of liberalising terminal equipment which will be completed this year.  He has <Col N="2091" /> announced a decision to open competition in the area of value-added services and that will open up a whole new range of services for Irish businesses and consumers based on a national telecommunications network.</P>
    <P>In parallel with this liberalisation, Telecom Éireann have gone from strength to strength.  Part of the success story of the Government, and their predecessor, is that the most recent accounts show that the company achieved profits after tax of £75 million under Deputy Burke's aegis in the year to March 1990. They have wiped out their accumulated losses and will pay a dividend of £30 million to the Exchequer in the coming year.  Do we have confidence in a Minister responsible for such an organisation? We have total confidence in him and that should be the attitude of the House.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann is the type of company that Cablelink should be associated with.  There is nothing wrong with that. A company of that magnitude, making such improvements in their services and engaging in progressive capitalisation, making a profit of £75 million and a contribution of £30 million to the Exchequer is the type of company that should be absorbing Cablelink for the greater communications good of the country.  That is good business, good administration and good government.  We are proud of Deputy Burke as our agent in the pursuance of that objective.</P>

      <P>Deputies Spring and Higgins have grossly debased the standard of Dáil Éireann by the type of speeches they have made.  We should be dealing with the many Bills that are on the Order Paper.  It is no harm to remind the House that the Order Paper is largely dominated by the Minister referred to in the Labour Party's motion.  Very important criminal law and criminal justice measures are being debated in both Houses and the Minister is also involved in the Broadcasting Bill under the Communications heading.</P>
      <P>The Government, and the Minister, are responsible for progressive legislation in the area of criminal justice, criminal law reform and broadcasting.  That is what we should be attuning ourselves to. I accept that there may be legitimate differences on how to approach the various reforms initiated by the Minister but we should do so in the proper spirit and not be referring to allegedly nefarious political undercurrents that do not exist, except in the peculiar imaginations of the Opposition Members, particularly in the minds of some members of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I feel a particular duty to oppose the motion before us and to pay a tribute, a justified tribute, to the achievements and personal commitment of the Minister for Communications and Justice, Deputy Burke.  I rise to speak tonight out of a sense of appreciation and respect for a person who never spares himself with the zeal and effort he puts into the job at hand.  I appreciate and respect a colleague who has committed himself to the service of the Government in two areas of critical importance and great sensitivity for the country, and I appreciate and respect the Government who have <Col N="2093" /> fearlessly confronted the challenges and met the demands in every area of our national policy making.</P>
      <P>I should like to begin by saying a few words about the procedure that has been adopted tonight.  To put down a motion of no confidence in a Minister in relation to matters contained in a Bill that is before the House for discussion is to my mind a misuse of parliamentary procedure. The different Stages of a Bill provide ample scope for every possible point to be made, and if Deputies missed the bus last Thursday they can board it further down the line.  If the indignation and concern were as genuine as is made out, it is curious that there were no Opposition Deputies in the House to listen to or carry on the Second Stage debate.  The reason for the motion is surely that the Opposition feel a little foolish, that after all their bluster the Second Stage debate finished prematurely because they could not keep one Deputy in the House.</P>

      <P>A motion of no confidence in individuals in the House is, I believe, an unpleasant procedure which should be used as sparingly as possible.  The different sides of the House disagree on issues and that is normal in a democracy. However, we do not need to personalise our disagreements.  I am saddened to hear the smear and vilification in the contributions by Deputies Spring and Higgins. This is the second motion of no confidence in a Minister in six months, both tabled by the Labour Party.  It is a procedure that was used only once by Fianna Fáil in more than four years of <Col N="2094" /> Opposition and, to the best of my recollection, when the &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; in the balance of payments was suddenly revealed.</P>
      <P>I recall on a number of occasions when the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Spring, stressed that his party preferred to debate issues and not personalities.  I wonder, looking back over the record, whether that is the case.  There seems to be a good deal of personal abuse and venom directed against members of the Government, with constant attribution of unworthy motives or worse.  Most impartial observers would consider that the Ministers of the Government, and their Fianna Fáil predecessors since 1987, have performed extremely creditably and would contrast their performance favourably with that of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government prior to 1987.</P>
      <P>There is one other preliminary remark I should like to make.  I would have thought that the Labour Party would have felt a certain sense of shame bringing forward a motion of no confidence in relation to this subject, given their record when they were in Government.  For more than four years they blocked the sensible development of a commercial independent broadcasting sector and, in the process, made a shambles of the Government because of their attachment to the dogma of a State broadcasting monopoly and because of their deep ideological aversion to private commercial profit-making activity.</P>

      <P>In the process, they allowed the black economy in the shape of private radio stations to flourish.  The people of Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Clare and any other areas that now enjoy legal local radio stations did not want or need the State, and still less RTE, to have a controlling interest in their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not my purpose to go into the <Col N="2095" /> details of broadcasting policy while addressing this motion because that is not what the motion is about.  Rather, the motion seeks to suggest that Deputy Burke should no longer hold the offices of Minister for Communications and Justice. The Tánaiste has given reasons why such a move is unjustified bearing in mind Deputy Burke's obligation as far as the Department of Communications is concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Deputy Burke's period as Minister for Justice.  As a former Minister for Justice who served in that difficult office for many years, I have a particular understanding of the problems confronting Deputy Burke.  I must also say that I have a certain affection and concern for that office.  Deputy Burke's zeal and common sense, as well as his genuine concern for people, are ideally suited to that most difficult of Cabinet responsibilities.  I do, of course, continue to work closely with Deputy Burke in the Anglo-Irish Conference.  In that area, the Minister for Justice carries a very heavy burden in respect of cross-Border security co-operation and the implementation of security aspects of Anglo-Irish policy.  In facing the threat from those who would seek to subvert the institutions of the State and kill and maim our fellow Irishmen and women, Deputy Burke has shown himself to be a man of extreme courage.</P>
    <P>In the last nine months the Minister, Deputy Burke, has contributed much to our work and deliberations in the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and his measured &mdash; but direct &mdash; approach to the most serious issue of policing, to the effective operation of security policy and to public confidence in the security forces is valued on all sides in moments of crisis.  At a time of opportunity and hope for political progress, as is the case at present, the Minister has been a source of strength and wise counsel.  It is not a contribution for which he has sought public recognition but we all gladly recognise it.  It has been suggested that the <Col N="2096" /> portfolio of Communications should not be combined with any other position in Government and that the Minister does not work full-time in that portfolio. However, the last time we had a full-time Minister for Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; not combined with another portfolio &mdash; was in the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition of 1973-77, when Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien was Minister.  There are still people in the House who remember that his only aim at that time was to ensure that Network 2 would merely rebroadcast BBC 1.</P>

      <P>I again remind the House that the Minister has given unstintingly of himself in the service of the nation.  If he has a fault it is one of over-generosity with his time and effort.  Of that he may stand guilty but on all other grounds he certainly does not.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Communications made a hames of broadcasting policy since the very start.  In 1987 he presented a Bill in this House in which he proposed that he would decide who the new broadcasters would be and that he would operate public control over them.  There would not be an independent radio commission, of which the Tánaiste spoke so glowingly, under the <Col N="2097" /> Minister's proposals.  This crude attempt was successfully blocked by the Opposition because the Government were in a minority.  However, it is now clear that the Minister has not changed his spots, he is still determined to bring broadcasting under his control and it is only now, with the help of the hapless Progressive Democrats Party, that he is in a position to do what he sought to do in the past.</P>
      <P>Confidence in the Minister has seriously crumbled, not only in his handling of Communications policy, but in the whole cohesion of Government which has resulted from this move.  The idea of collective responsibility has collapsed, with the Progressive Democrats saying that their colleagues had cut corners and that they had taken their eye off the ball. So much for collective responsibility for decision-making.  In respect of this House, backbenchers were removed so that the Minister could cause the debate to collapse and very shortly afterwards they bobbed up in the media to express their concerns and unease about the proposals. So much for political debate and democracy in regard to the Minister's plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new controls which the Minister is introducing on RTE are far worse than those which preceded them.  They mean that RTE will not be able to get one ounce of benefit from their success in winning an audience.  If they succeed in getting 100 per cent audience they will not get one penny more into their budget. So much for fair competition.  The restrictions on the budget which they will receive will mean that they will be in a worse position than any civil servant.  Not only will they have to go to the Minister for an extra penny to spend on broadcasting and programmes but they will also be locked into an earmarked tax, a user charge not based on ability to pay.  How many of us believe that our public services would develop in education and social welfare if they were confined to presenting a user charge each year?  We <Col N="2098" /> all know that they would not survive for one day if that was the case.  The new formula is a recipe for the slow strangulation of RTE.  They will be locked into a budget which will be cut by £20 million next year and frozen thereafter.  The Minister was very quick to say that there would not be an increase in the licence fee, he was merely pandering to political popularity, but the fruit of that move is that quality broadcasting, as we have come to know it, will die.  RTE's revenue is being assaulted by the Minister.  He was charged in this House with bringing in a new broadcasting policy which would meet public demand, be independent, have quality and be diverse.  What has he produced?  Regardless of public demand, he seeks to destroy 2FM; as far as independence is concerned, he seeks to bring RTE firmly under his own political control in regard to every penny they will spend; in regard to quality, he seeks to destroy the revenue base of RTE from which they have made programmes of which we can be proud.  As for diversity he has reneged on his promise to develop community local broadcasting in tandem with commercial ratio.  That was one of his great cries in the House but it has disappeared.</P>
    <P>What about his move in regard to Cablelink?  How can we have confidence in a Minister who has no idea of the proper framework for public policy in deciding to sell off Cablelink?  He allowed RTE to hold a competition but when the results were out and they selected someone who they considered would be successful the Minister decided to change the ground rules.  He used crude political intervention to block RTE's decision and insisted that it would go to his selected candidate.  This arbitrary intervention undermines confidence in the operation of a communications policy, and that has been the hallmark of this Minister since the very beginning.</P>
    <P>We will see very practical consequences from the Minister's move against RTE.  As other speakers said, <Col N="2099" /> advertisements will go overseas and they will not benefit the print media, although they seem to think they will.  People do not advertise to the same extent in print media as they do in television.  The consequences for RTE will be that 300 or 500 jobs will be scrapped and, far worse, the private production sector, which the Minister said on numerous occasions he sought to develop, will be the first to feel the pinch.  RTE have already said that the independent production capacity will be cut back first.  It means that the 900 people now involved in independent production of film material will find that their base has collapsed.  The only gains will be for overseas firms and there will be a decline in the broadcasting network of which we have been proud for many years.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not deserve the confidence of this House.  In the past he made solemn declarations that he had no intention of diverting revenue from RTE but those declarations crumbled and the Minister brought in a Bill which would take 25 per cent of the fee from RTE.  So much for the Minister's solemn declaration. We will have the worst of all worlds in relation to broadcasting policy. The commercial station went in with their eyes open, they got a franchise which the Minister rightly said was a scarce natural resource and now he seeks to change the ground rules.  Many stations which successfully operated under this scheme will now face changed rules and, as the Minister admitted, the inefficient will be supported and the efficient will have to survive on their own resources.</P>
    <P>We can no longer have confidence in a Minister who left us with a broadcasting sector which will hobble along and gradually deteriorate over the coming years. Broadcasting of the kind that comes through on satellite channels will become more and more commonplace.  Along with the other parties in this House I believe confidence in the Minister has disappeared.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose first to deal with the announcement by the Minister for Communications two weeks ago that he was killing off 2FM radio.  I will deal with this first because, of all the outrageous decisions taken by the Minister since he began playing what I might describe as Ray's Roulette with RTE, this was the most outrageous.  The Minister did not come to the House and say: I am closing down 2FM.  Nor did he say: I am instructing my new, tame RTE Authority to pull the plug, which would have been a relatively decent thing to do, when 2FM might have continued to become a sort of martyr of the airwaves.  Instead the Minister decided he would undertake the task by way of slow strangulation.  He assumed to himself the roles of Programme Controller, and Editor-in-Chief, totally flouting the letter and spirit of all broadcasting Acts and practices.  He then outlined his proposed autumn schedule for the new station.  Apparently the Minister's 2FM would be heavy on public service broadcasting which would feature educational programmes, continental languages, the Irish language, programmes on farming affairs, business and trade union matters and music, provided it was of a specialist nature.</P>
      <P>These were not casual pronouncements by the Minister off the top of his head.  The Minister told us that these were Government decisions, that the Government had decided to ask the new RTE Authority, as a matter of priority, to develop plans for alternative use of the 2FM network more in keeping with the public service mandate of RTE. Then he informed us of his schedule. What he omitted to tell us was that the kind of RTE Authority &mdash; of which we had no knowledge at that point &mdash; he was about to appoint would not need to be asked twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite frankly, on the evidence available to us I do not think the Minister gives a damn about the mission of 2FM in promoting the Irish language, continental languages and the other elements <Col N="2101" /> of his public service schedule.  Otherwise he would never have produced them as part of his plot for the planned strangulation of 2FM.  Anyone with the slightest regard for the Irish language, farming or any of the other features would be revolted by their use in a cynical exercise of deliberately driving listeners away from the station.</P>
    <P>The killing off of 2FM was only the Minister's first spin against RTE.  On the same day there was the announcement of his assault on the licence fee revenue at a rate of £6 million a year; advertising would be capped but not yet.  Two days later &mdash; when the actual Bill arrived &mdash; the licence fee bleed-off had risen to £12 million.  Another seven days passed and the playing pitch, goalposts and all had changed again.  Gone was the licence fee rake-off; in its place at least a £12 million diversion of RTE advertising revenue which would be effected immediately.</P>
    <P>What confidence can this House or anyone have in a Minister who makes such bewildering gyrations on issues of such fundamental importance to the whole future of broadcasting in this country, public and independent?  Having changed fundamental issues three times within the space of a fortnight we were told the Government were operating a set of clear-cut, coherent objectives and policies.  Sadly, the only clear-cut objective I can recognise in all of this is the desire of the Minister and the Government to &ldquo;sock it&rdquo; to RTE.  The simplest and clearest way I can describe it is to use the words of a prominent Minister to a prominent RTE person on the night of the last general election count: we will get you for this.</P>
    <P>Assuming the Minister has dropped his crazy plans for 2FM &mdash; and we have no guarantee that it will not be attempted again &mdash; the decision with which we are confronted is the Minister's proposal to divert at least £12 million from RTE advertising, and other measures, equally objectionable, to stifle their enterprise. <Col N="2102" /> The purpose of all of this would appear to be to facilitate the arrival and survival of TV3, the Minister's personal creation.</P>
    <P>In passing, I might say that I regret the Minister seems to have abandoned Century Radio.  I would go along with a once-off Fóir Teoranta-type package to assist the station as part of the alternative broadcasting for which it would appear there is a general desire.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves certain questions about the Minister's proposed TV3 channel and the way he is going about its establishment.  We must ask ourselves: is there a place for it?  Has this country the resources to finance three television channels?  The Minister says it has but all of the evidence &mdash; some outlined by myself and my colleagues, including representatives of the Labour Party &mdash; would suggest that we cannot trust the Minister's judgment.  We must remember that, on average, television production costs approximately £11,000 an hour.  An hour of good drama costs approximately £100,000.  Whether there are 1,000, a million or 50 million viewers, the production costs are the same.  Assuming the new TV3 station received all of the revenue being diverted from RTE advertising that would pay for approximately three hours television a day.</P>
    <P>We are a sovereign nation and need a strong broadcasting service.  We need a strong voice in news and current affairs coverage of international events.  The days are long gone when we could rely on agency material.  If the place to be is on the Berlin Wall, then our services must be there too.  Before the proposed diversion of advertising revenue, RTE had approximately £5 million for news services.  Sky Television, a direct competitor only commencing but making great inroads, have a budget of £45 million annually for news alone.  The BBC have £120 million annually for news and current affairs services, more than the entire budget of RTE for news, current affairs, radio, television, the lot.  They are our direct competitors and unless we <Col N="2103" /> can compete with them the zappers will be at work and we will lose our viewers and listeners.  With regard to service, what we receive boils down very much to a question of cash.  All of the stations have the necessary talent to make and produce programmes.  Under the Minister's proposals we may end up with two helpings of mediocrity with a consequent loss of viewers and listeners to other stations. Competition in itself &mdash; which the Minister contended &mdash; does not automatically improve standards; anybody can look to the British tabloids for proof of that.</P>
    <P>I know that Private Members' time is not a very suitable slot for a motion of no confidence in the Minister or to discuss the fundamental issues of broadcasting here.  Nonetheless it underlines the need for an independent review body, such as that suggested by my colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, rather than be left to the whim of a Minister who changes the pitch from day to day.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House deals specifically with the Minister for Communications which I regret to a certain extent because what has happened over the past fortnight &mdash; leading to the tabling of this motion &mdash; involved the whole of the Government, including the Progressive Democrats.  Not only were Progressive Democrats Ministers at the Cabinet table when the decisions were sanctioned, we were told they were enthusiastic supporters of them.  Since then, predictably, they have reverted to their now familiar role of political zappers. Once they discovered that the programme they were backing was not proving popular the Progressive Democrats Ministers handed over to their remote control boys.  We were told that corners were cut but we know that when those decisions were being taken around the Cabinet table they were there cornering with the best of them.</P>
    <P>Thus, over the past fortnight, the Minister for Communications has presided <Col N="2104" /> over what I described earlier as a bewildering array of fast-changing, wildly contradictory plans for RTE and broadcasting generally in this country, public and private.  I know he disputes it but all the evidence available to me would suggest that he misled the House with regard to his intentions.  He has been guilty of gross interference in his attempted running of 2FM by way of ministerial diktat.  His new RTE Authority have been described as a Montrose Fianna Fáil Cumann.  The Minister's proposals could irreparably damage RTE's ability to compete with increasing competition and will result in the loss of approximately 300 jobs.  There will also be immediate victims in the private sector, the private independent production sector, which the Minister rightly encouraged in the past and who should be encouraged by us all.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims that he has taken decisive action.  The same could be said of Steve McMahon in Cagliari last evening when he kicked the ball in the wrong direction.  I regret very much that we can have no confidence that the Minister will not do the same thing.  We are dealing with a matter of fundamental importance for the future of broadcasting, and the decisions we make during the current period will dictate what stations people will be watching in future years when competitive stations from all over will be available.  It is my belief that if the Minister drains RTE of their money and enterprise &mdash; as he now proposes to do &mdash; people will be zapping to the foreign stations.</P>

      <P>Normally, I do not believe in raising personal issues of this kind by way of general debate, because, if at all possible, matters of individual or personal interest should be avoided or, at best, be raised by way of parliamentary question, preferably by written question. I raise this matter in the House this evening to express the frustration to which I have been driven by the tremendous wall of bureaucracy, departmental stonewalling and intransigence that I have come up against and because I genuinely believe that a rank injustice is being perpetrated against an unemployment assistance applicant in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>As a result of what is, in my opinion a blatantly wrong decision, a family is left literally penniless this very night.  I am not given to hyperbole or exaggeration but I know the family in question and I can categorically state that that is in fact the situation.  The family in question comprise a husband, wife and four dependent children.  The husband worked until a number of years ago when he was made redundant.  He is genuinely unemployed and is available for and is seeking work. They have absolutely no means whatever. They live in a very small dwelling provided by Mayo County Council, for which they pay rent, on a very small farm, with the applicant's mother who receives a non-contributory old age pension.  He derives nothing whatever from the farm; indeed the farm is so small that it simply would not keep a family.  His mother has been means tested in respect of her pension entitlement and she now virtually gets the full pension, which speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the investigation of his social welfare entitlement, in view of the fact that he has been getting more than £100 over the past four years, he brought to the attention of the social welfare officer that he recently purchased a car. He lives in a very isolated rural area, <Col N="2106" /> which is far away from any communication. It will be readily acknowledged that one cannot buy a more modest brand of car than the Lada.  He was asked to produce evidence as to where he got the money to purchase the car and he produced evidence to show that he was paying it off in small monthly instalments on a loan from the Bow-maker company.  I think the amount in question is so negligible that it is well within the capacity of somebody getting unemployment assistance to meet such repayments over a four year period. After providing the documentation, the applicant was notified that he had failed to produce evidence that his income was not over the statutory limit of £7,020 and therefore his dole was withdrawn.  It would have been a very bleak Christmas for that family had the Western Health Board not come to their rescue.  We know that health boards do not come to the rescue of people by way of supplementary welfare unless and until they are absolutely satisfied there is no visible means and that there is a reasonable chance the claimant will be successful on appeal and get his or her unemployment assistance back and the amount in question will be recouped by the health board.  On 29 May 1990 I asked the Minister for Social Welfare a question, Parliamentary Question No. 106 and I quote:</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Higgins asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give a breakdown of a figure of more than £7,020 means which was arrived at in respect of an application for unemployment assistance. </P>
    <P>The challenge thrown down to the applicant was to prove that he did not have such means.  The Minister by way of written reply said and I quote:</P>
    <P>Following investigation, the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that he failed to show that his yearly means did not exceed the <Col N="2107" /> statutory limit for receipt of a qualification certificate from 6 December 1989.  The limit is £7,020 in the circumstances of his case.</P>
    <P>He appealed against this decision and following an oral hearing of his case on 4 April 1990, an appeals officer also disallowed his claim on the same grounds.</P>
    <P>If he is now willing to disclose all the sources of his means he should contact his local office and request a further interview with the social welfare officer. </P>
    <P>He did, and had a further interview.  He tried to prove at length that he does not have any other means, that he does not have the mythical millions.  He does not have a bank account or a post office account.  He tried to prove he is genuinely available for work and has no means either visible or invisible, yet the Department have turned down his appeal.  It is putting an impossible burden on somebody. Through you, a Cheann Comhairle, I put it to the Minister that it is like saying to a person that you have an income of £7,020, which is out there somewhere and you have to prove that you have not got it.  I respectfully submit to the Minister that if I said to him that he has an income of £100,000, unless he could prove that he had not got it, I would be placing an impossible onus on him.  The Minister could come along and show his ministerial cheque, and then show his cheque for being a Deputy, but there would be a grey area of £30,000 or £40,000 in between the upper threshold and the £100,000 challenge which had been thrown down to him.  Poor people on unemployment assistance are expected to prove this.  It is an impossible task for them and they simply cannot meet it.</P>
    <P>I know these people.  I know they are genuine, decent, honest and honourable people and they simply have no means whatever.  They live on a small family farm but they derive no benefit from it.  I <Col N="2108" /> understand that the social welfare officer does not say this.  This is not an isolated case.  I could quote, and I hope the Minister's officials will take note, chapter and verse of numerous cases.  In fact, I could bring to the Minister's attention case No. CC3988-89 where somebody came to me in November 1989, a man who had a wife and six children, who had been in receipt of £64 per week unemployment assistance and who on the run up to Christmas was totally cut off on the basis of an inadequate investigation.  They had the most miserable Christmas of their existence but as a result of the appeals process not alone did they get their £64 assistance returned but were awarded £72 per week three weeks ago.</P>

      <P>In common with other cases, if a wrong decision is made, the Department should acknowledge it.  The social welfare officer who is responsible <Col N="2109" /> for carrying out an incorrect or inaccurate assessment should be brought before some senior officer and asked how he or she arrived at the figure.  In some cases I can guarantee that some social welfare officers do no justice to the officials in his Department, and in some cases this seems to indicate a lack of diligence in carrying out the correct procedures for investigating such cases.  In some cases the decisions would appear to be based on personal prejudice rather than the guidelines set down by the Minister.  I can assure the Minister in this particular case, irrespective of what he will say tonight &mdash; I am anticipating his reply &mdash; because the decision is based on a so-called report by a social welfare officer in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, that it is factually incorrect.</P>

      <P>The Deputy pointed out that he understood the monthly repayments were small and of a negligible amount. That is the one thing on which the Deputy did not seem to have the facts, and that is very relevant to this case.</P>
      <P>Means for unemployment assistance purposes are determined in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Social Welfare Acts and regulations.  Applicants are required to show to the satisfaction of deciding and appeals officers, as appropriate, that their means calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions are less than the statutory limits for the receipt of a qualification certificate which is a formal statement of their means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deciding officers and appeals officers are statutorily appointed officers who are obliged to act independently, including independently of the Minister, when giving decisions on entitlements under the Social Welfare Acts.  I am aware that they make every reasonable effort to be fair in giving their decisions.  Claimants are given every opportunity to state or to present their case and all evidence in <Col N="2110" /> support of a claim is taken into account in arriving at a decision.  While I never had any doubt about the integrity of deciding officers and appeals officers in discharging their statutory functions, I am conscious of the fact that although it is most important that justice be done, and that this has always been the case in relation to the decision system operating in my Department, it is also important that justice be seen to be done.  In this way public confidence in a decision system is maintained and strengthened. It was for this reason that I established a totally separate appeals office.  This initiative was welcomed by the many interests concerned with welfare because it enhanced and made more apparent the independent character of the appeals system.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline the background to this particular case.  The person concerned is a married man in his mid-thirties with four children.  He first claimed unemployment assistance in September 1972.  Following a review of his means in August 1989, his claim was disallowed from 6 December 1989 on the grounds that he had failed to show that his yearly means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of a qualification certificate. The statutory limit in his case is £7,020 a year.  He appealed against the disallowance and was afforded the opportunity to present his case in person at an oral hearing which was held by an independent officer on 4 April 1990.  The appeals officer did not find his story credible and disallowed his appeal.  That is the system we operate under our legislation.</P>
    <P>Both the deciding officer and the appeals officer considered that he had alternative sources of income which he had failed to disclose.  They came to this conclusion having regard to his financial commitments and the fact that he had recently bought a new car for £10,000. He told the investigating officer that the repayments on the loan he obtained to purchase the car amounted to £258 per month; this is in addition to his other <Col N="2111" /> outgoings such as repayments on his house loan &mdash; the Deputy mentioned rent &mdash; and domestic living expenses.  In view of this it is not difficult to see how an appeals officer would conclude that he must have other undisclosed sources of income.  The Deputy mentioned a car which he assumed would not be very expensive &mdash; the Lada.  The car in question is a new Fiat Uno 60 Diesel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>But the loan is £10,000. The appeals officer and the deciding officer asked where this money came from and how it was being paid for.  They cannot see how it can be paid without some additional source of income.  Perhaps somebody else is making the repayments or is paying half the loan, but under the legislation you are obliged to disclose your full means.</P>
      <P>The claimant lives beside his mother who has a farm which, it is understood, he will in due course inherit.  He claims that he derives no benefit from his mother's farm and I have been informed that no benefit from this source has, in fact, been assessed against him.  If the person concerned is now willing to disclose all sources of his means or has new evidence, he should contact his local office and a further interview with a social welfare officer will be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that in this case, as in all others, I am in the hands of the deciding officer and the appeals officer who make their decision under statute.  We may send questions to them, present new evidence or suggest that full information has not been given, but we must support their decisions.  I have not had an oral hearing of the case, nor has the Deputy.  He does not have all the information that an appeals officer would have in his or her possession, and it is extraordinary to be rerunning such a case here with less than the full information and without the person here to talk about <Col N="2112" /> the matter.  I put the Deputy's question to the appeals officer and the matter was reconsidered, but it basically boils down to the fact that neither the deciding officer, who was carrying out his statutory function, nor the appeals officer was prepared to believe the story.  As I have said, if there is other evidence or if somebody else is paying towards some of the loan, that information should be disclosed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment, I have been trying to do so for the last week.  This is a matter of great importance.  It is amazing that in the last election, health was the major issue focused on.  Apparently, the Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, was annoyed with RTE for constantly raising that issue during the election campaign.  I would disagree and say the major issue in the last election, certainly in my constituency, was education; it still is the major issue and is one that packs halls regularly.</P>
      <P>Many aspects of education are being very slowly dealt with by the Minister &mdash; the pupil-teacher ratio, remedial teaching and disadvantaged areas &mdash; but one major issue that has not been highlighted or dealt with is the effect on schools of the lack of caretakers and secretaries. This problem has existed since the embargo came into effect in 1983 and the position has become worse since 1985 when the Government decided to use the SES as an alternative to caretakers.  It was never intended that that scheme would be used to provide full-time permanent jobs. It was not fulfilling the duties of caretakers because the work was being carried out on a part-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the lack of caretakers, schools have become run-down and deteriorated and vandalism is increasing at great cost to the State.  I will quote from two recent articles which show these <Col N="2113" /> problems, arise in both primary and post-primary schools but I am dealing mainly with primary schools.  The <i>Evening Herald</i> of 24 May stated:</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Association of Management of Catholic Secondary Schools, Bro. M.A. McGrath, said the exterior and interior fabric of many schools was deteriorating at an alarming rate. </P>
    <P>This is due to the fact that they cannot afford to carry out the necessary repairs and maintenance to many of the older schools.  This results from the lack of caretakers.  <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 3 June, 1990, in an article entitled &ldquo;Vandal crisis hits unguarded schools&rdquo; by Peter Tesch reported that:</P>
    <P>The condition of many schools in urban areas is deteriorating since there is no caretaker or only a part-time one employed through the Social Employment Scheme, to maintain the school. As a result school Boards of Management are faced with rising insurance bills which have to be paid from already restricted budgets.  It is not uncommon, says John White, </P>
    <P>&mdash;President of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation&mdash;</P>
    <P>to see a principal unblocking the toilets, boarding up vandalised windows or paying out of their own pockets for paint to do the school. </P>
    <P>I could also quote from letters from school managers &mdash; the Minister will be aware of these because they have been sent to her as well &mdash; where they outline appalling conditions in schools.  Many of these schools are in my constituency. There are schools in Dublin south-west, and I am sure in many other urban areas around the country, where the children when they come to school in the mornings find used condoms and excrement all over the school yard.  One of the principals pointed out that children, particularly those in junior classes, to the horror of <Col N="2114" /> teachers, have unwittingly handled used condoms.  One can understand at present because of the risk of AIDS etc. the enormous dangers to children and the danger to health that exists as a result of lack of cleaning in school yards.</P>
    <P>The job of the principal is to look after the educational aspects of the school, to put his educational stamp on that school and to give pupils a sense of dignity, self-esteem and pride in themselves.  Instead of that, he has to go around cleaning school yards, boarding up windows, sweeping up glass after windows have been smashed as a result of vandalism, he has to do plumbing repairs, clean blocked drains and toilets, lock doors and gates, cut grass, repair forced doors, replace bulbs and light fuses.  That is a sample taken from a survey in the Clondalkin area and I am sure that is the case in many schools throughout the country. This is the type of job that either the chairman, the manager or the principal of the school must attend to.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the Minister's speech in the Seanad on Wednesday, 6 June regarding free education where she said:</P>
    <P>The State undertakes to provide for free primary education, A local contribution towards school running-costs, equivalent to at least 25 per cent of the capitation grant, must be lodged annually to each school's bank account. </P>
    <P>That means the State provides free primary education.  In fact, the Constitution states the State must provide free primary education but the Minister says that 25 per cent must be paid by the local management of schools.  That is not free primary education.  The Minister in one of her replies to the teachers suggested that the school management should be able to provide the money for a school caretaker. It is absolutely impossible for parents in these areas to provide sufficient money for that.</P>
    <P>To summarise, I am saying that school <Col N="2115" /> buildings are inadequately maintained and that they are going into a state of disrepair.  Principals are spending an inordinate amount of time on maintenance and secretarial duties.  Teaching principals &mdash; there are some principals who have teaching duties as well &mdash; have to bear the additional responsibility of full-time teaching and are unable to do that because of the attention required for emergency plumbing or caretaking.  Inadequate maintenance of school buildings is not cost effective.  Incidents of vandalism would be mitigated by the presence of school caretakers on the school premises. Well-maintained buildings and prompt attention to repairs give a pride in the school and in the local environment.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most important things in the school area at present which is being neglected.  We are thinking all the time of insufficient remedial teachers but without the caretakers and the secretaries &mdash; I am talking particularly about caretakers &mdash; the whole environment of the school is run down and is damaging the educational prospects of the children in these schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to reply to this debate on behalf of the Minister for Education who, regretfully, due to prior commitments cannot be here.  A scheme of grants for the employment of caretakers in our national schools was introduced on 1 June 1979.  The objective of the scheme was to make better provision for the administration and servicing of national schools and also to create additional employment opportunities. The scheme was introduced as part of the job creation programme of the then Government.  Three hundred and forty caretakers were employed at the scheme's peak in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incremental scales of pay replaced the original flat rates of grants, which contributed to an escalation in the cost of the scheme.  What was originally conceived <Col N="2116" /> as both a modest contribution to job creation and the improvement and maintenance of facilities in the educational sector soon became a sizeable area of State expenditure.  This was in addition to the capitation grants provided by the Department of Education, which assist boards of management with the management and maintenance of schools.  It was in this context that a decision was taken by the Government of the day in 1982 to phase out the scheme and this decision was conveyed to the boards of management of national schools throughout the country in April 1983.</P>
    <P>As caretakers resign or retire they are not being replaced as the filling of non-teaching posts in schools continues to be subject to the overall policy obtaining in regard to staffing in the public service. Nonetheless, the rate of loss of posts has been rather slow and some 290 national schools still enjoy the services of a caretaker.</P>
    <P>Under the original scheme any school having a staff of 16 or more teachers was eligible to participate and obtain a grant for the employment of a school caretaker. Where two or more smaller schools shared the same campus and they had a combined staff of at least 20 teachers they were also eligible to participate. The caretakers are employed by the boards of management of the schools and a subvention towards the cost of employment of the caretaker is paid by the Department of Education.  In schools where the enrolments are in decline a caretaker post is not lost, even if the numbers fall below the original requirement. A significant number of schools have retained their caretakers in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the incremental caretaker scheme for 1990 is £2.3 million. The cost of the employment of the caretakers employed under the social employment scheme of the Department of Labour is not included in this figure.  In conjunction with the introduction of the social employment schemes in schools in <Col N="2117" /> 1985 the then Government decided, as an exceptional measure, to reinstate all 29 caretaker posts which had fallen vacant up to April of that year.  Because of the continuing serious budgetary situation, the phasing out policy has been maintained since that time.</P>
    <P>I have listened with interest to what Deputy Mac Giolla has said.  I would like to point out to him that the cost to the Exchequer and the commitment by the Government to education is obvious in the vast amount of money we have allocated in the Book of Estimates which was prepared in the autumn of last year and in the budget which this House passed this year.  There are many people in the community with many skills who are ideally suited to caretaking duties, maintenance, remedial and other works.  I say to Deputy Mac Giolla that all children are entitled to the same facilities and opportunities within the educational sector.  The State in itself cannot have all the resources so the private sector &mdash; that is, the parents and the community &mdash; are given an opportunity on a partnership basis to make a small contribution to the maintenance of schools.  This is very important and I think this is what parents and management of schools prefer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> Many smaller national schools have been able to avail of assistance under the social employment schemes and many of these posts have involved the provision of caretaking services.  A difficulty has arisen in recent months whereby the trade unions concerned have decided to veto further social employment scheme appointments in schools, because of the prohibition on employment of full-time caretakers and clerk typists under the Department of Education Scheme.  The Minister for Education and the Minister for Labour are, however, having discussions on this complex matter with a view to resolving this problem as speedily as possible.  I am confident that my Government colleagues the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern and the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, will be able to find an amicable solution to this matter, <i>quam celerrime.</i></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 38 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann operates a route network of 2,000 kilometres of railway which can be apportioned on the basis of 700 kilometres of primary trunk routes, largely double track, and 1,300 kilometres of secondary or lightly used lines, exclusively single track.</P>
      <P>To date the company's resignalling programme has concentrated on the primary trunk routes, of which some 500 route kilometres are already controlled by modern signalling equipment.  A further 200 kilometres of primary track is scheduled for completion on this basis as soon as possible under Iarnód Éireann's programme for mainline resignalling.  I have been advised by the board that the amount invested in the upgrading and replacement of signalling in the ten years up to the end of 1989 was £49.9 million. This investment has been funded by the board through a combination of own resources and commercial borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> The board have also advised me that they plan to spend up to £25 million on further replacement and upgrading of railway signalling over the next ten years. This includes the resignalling of the loop line under the Phoenix Park at an estimated £7.8 million.  EC Structural Funds aid has been sought for this latter work.</P>
    <P>Apart from any aid which may be available from the EC, the cost of the board's resignalling programme over the next ten years, as approved by the Minister from time to time, will continue to be funded by the board from own resources and borrowings.  Close monitoring of any EC funding opportunities will, of course, be an important ingredient during this period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>I have received interim reports from the chairman of Aer Lingus on the action taken to implement the instructions I issued to the board of Aer Lingus on 15 May 1990, following receipt by me from Craig Gardner of the report of their accounting investigation into the affairs of Aer Lingus Holidays Limited.</P>
      <P>The chairman has informed me that a comprehensive action programme, part of which has aready been implemented, is under way to strengthen financial controls within the Aer Lingus group.  The Assistant Chief Executive &mdash; Finance, who was recruited from outside the group last September, is in the process of filling seven new senior finance appointments as part of a reorganisation and enhancement of the group finance function.  In parallel, steps are being taken to strengthen substantially the group's corporate legal function and specific recommendations are being developed in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman has assured me that all appropriate steps are being taken to prevent a recurrence of irregularities anywhere in the Aer Lingus group such as <Col N="1934" /> occurred in Aer Lingus Holidays.  He has also informed me that arrangements are being made, as I requested, for a phased and orderly withdrawal by Aer Lingus Holidays Limited from the tour operating business at the end of the current season.</P>
    <P>The chairman has advised me that, arising from the Craig Gardner report, the board of Aer Lingus have decided that certain legal action should be initiated.  I regret that I am unable to make any further comment on this point or on the question of discipinary action taken by the board since such comment could prejudice any proposed legal action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>A survey is carried out annually by CIE of the modes of transport being used by commuters entering the city centre in the morning peak.  This survey shows that on the DART corridor, which is served by both bus and rail modes, 54 per cent of journeys in the morning are made by public transport and 37 per cent by car. Outside of this corridor, where the sole form of public transport is bus, only 25 per cent of journeys are made by public transport, while 58 per cent are made by car.  It is also estimated by CIE that 6,000 to 8,000 cars are being left at home each day by DART users who could otherwise have travelled by car, adding further to peak hour traffic congestion.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to be definitive about the relative merits of public transport <i>versus</i> private transport in the environmental context.  However, research in this area would suggest that public transport, especially rail, is cleaner and kinder to the environment and enjoys significant advantages over private transport in terms of land utilisation, safety, reduced noise levels and more efficient energy usage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fiscal and taxation treatment of private forms of transport do not fall within my direct area of responsibility. Nevertheless, as far as public transport is concerned, some points are worth bearing in mind.  For example, CIE enjoy favourable tax treatment in relation to excise duty on fuel.  Furthermore, when comparisons are being made about the levels of financial support for public transport and private transport, account must be taken of the substantial levels of financial assistance which are made available annually by the Exchequer to <Col N="1937" /> CIE in respect of the provision of essential public transport services.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte's target for 1990, in line with the five year growth targets set out in the operational programme for tourism, is to increase overseas visitor numbers to some 3.2 million in 1990, an increase of over 14 per cent on last year.</P>

      <P>I see no compelling reason at this time to consider re-establishing the Dublin Transport Authority, which was dissolved at the end of 1987 as part of the Government's overall strategy to reduce public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, the co-ordination of efforts to combat traffic congestion and to promote and facilitate the use of public transport in the city has been a matter for the Dublin transportation task force, which was reconstituted by the Government specifically for that purpose.  The task force is pursuing this aim by co-ordinating on a non-statutory basis the work of the various official bodies involved in traffic management and the provision of public transport services in Dublin and by devising and funding new traffic management and bus priority measures, where appropriate. In the latter area, for which a 1990 Exchequer allocation of £180,000 has been provided, the task force is, for example, continuing to invest in the expansion and enhancement of the city's closed circuit television (CCTV) traffic monitoring system, the computerised urban traffic control (UTC) system and in bus lane and other bus priority schemes. This work is supplemented by an action programme embracing such concerns as controls on road openings and the deposit <Col N="1945" /> of builders' skips, and parking arrangements for buses and coaches in the city centre.  Indeed, the issue of parking generally, including the question of adequate arrangements for the enforcement of the relevant regulations, continues to receive particular attention.  In addition, the task force has instituted arrangements to ensure that transportation considerations are fully taken into account by the Dublin planning authorities and by An Bord Pleanála, both as regards general policy and its application in specific instances.</P>
    <P>In general, I am satisfied that the arrangements currently in place are producing substantial benefits without incurring the administrative and other costs necessarily associated with a statutory authority, but the position can be kept under review.</P>

      <P>My Department, which has recently received the report of the US President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism, has regular contacts with US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) security personnel to discuss aviation security matters.  At the two most recent meetings, in April and May of this year, the FAA representatives expressed themselves as generally satisfied with the security arrangements at Dublin and Shannon airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in reply to previous parliamentary questions in February and April, 1989, my predecessor, following the Lockerbie disaster, asked for a speedy review of civil aviation security at Irish airports by the National Civil Aviation Security Committee.  As a result of that review steps were taken to <Col N="1946" /> increase the level of security at Irish airports. As the Deputy will readily appreciate, policy has always been not to give details of specific security measures taken.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we can have confidence in our aviation security arrangements. I am not complacent, however, and you can take it that we lose no opportunity to learn from the experience of other countries in the field of aviation security.  A meeting of the National Civil Aviation Security Committee is being held shortly and will have on its agenda for consideration the report of the US President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism.</P>

      <P>The Government's view remains that the most effective way at present for them to work for a satisfactory conclusion of the Birmingham Six case is to pursue the matter directly with the British Government. In this regard, the Government have repeatedly and forcefully conveyed their views and their deep concern about the case to the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, as one of the 35 member states of the CSCE, is of course represented at the conference currently under way in Copenhagen.  As I stated in reply to a <Col N="1952" /> question on 7 February last, it is not the Government's intention to raise the Birmingham Six case at the conference. However, the Government have, as appropriate, raised the case internationally, including at the Foreign Affairs Council in December last, following the transmission to the Council of a resolution on the case from the European Parliament.  As stated previously, the Government are also always prepared to avail of other appropriate occasions, including during the present six month period, to raise the case bilaterally and otherwise.</P>

For details of the latter, I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 6 February.  The Chinese authorities can, therefore, be in no doubt as to the seriousness with which Ireland and its partners in the Twelve view the grave violations of human rights in that country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 76 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>Recent instances of racism, including anti-Semitism, in different parts of Europe are deeply regrettable.  These outbreaks are all the more regrettable in that they come at a time of marked improvements in the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms enjoyed by the people in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, is a basic concept of the CSCE and is set out in Principle VII of the Helsinki Final Act together with the commitment to respect the right of persons belonging to national minorities to equality before the law and to protect their legitimate interests in this sphere.</P>
      <P>Specific measures which participating States have committed themselves to take in order to ensure the enjoyment of these rights and freedoms in actual practice are elaborated in further CSCE documents.  The record of implementation by States of these commitments has shown a marked improvement in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, further improvement is <Col N="1957" /> required in some cases.  The European Community and its member states will continue to press for these improvements, especially at the current Copenhagen Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE.  A number of proposals dealing specifically with the issue of racism and the treatment of minorities have been tabled by member states of the Community at Copenhagen. These issues will receive special attention there, and at the CSCE Summit Meeting which is expected to take place later this year.</P>
    <P>The Twelve believe that there now exists a willingness in all participating states to carry out their commitments and to enact the necessary legislative reform. Very considerable concrete progress has been made already and more is in prospect. A co-operative approach among the participating states is being pursued. Accordingly, economic sanctions are not under consideration by the European Community.  Nevertheless, Community assistance towards Central and Eastern Europe is contingent upon continuing progress in political and economic reform and is thus firmly linked to the implementation of the commitments undertaken in the human dimension.</P>
    <P>Last week I attended the opening of the CSCE Conference on the Human Dimension in Copenhagen.  In my speech on behalf of the Twelve I spoke about the very welcome improvements in the degree to which the human dimension commitments of the CSCE documents were being implemented; but I also said that the protection and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms depend on continued vigilance, even in countries where there is a long tradition of democracy and pluralism.</P>
    <P>I called for full respect for human rights and better protection of minorities.  I believe that these questions will continue to be central to the further development of security and co-operation in Europe. On the same occasion, I also said that ensuring the conditions in which the rights of the individual are respected in practice is one of the prime duties of all <Col N="1958" /> citizens and that this entails free elections and the rule of law.  I called upon the conference to adopt detailed provisions which will give explicit expression to all these commitments.</P>
    <P>In the Vienna Concluding Document of the CSCE, all the participating states explicitly agreed to take effective measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination against individuals or communities on the grounds of religion or belief and to foster a climate of mutual tolerance and respect between believers of different communities.  We have on many occasions, both at CSCE meetings and in numerous bilateral contacts, made clear our views on these matters.</P>

      <P>It is much too early to say when an interconnector is likely to be commissioned. The report of the working group on interconnection in 1988 concluded that an electricity link with the UK appeared to be economically viable and merited consideration of proceeding with pre-contract phase discussions and studies.</P>
      <P>The situation in the UK has changed considerably, however, due to the privatisation of its electricity industry.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always keen to promote good management and conservation of our energy resources both indigenous and imported.</P>
      <P>Our current conservation programme which is carried out by Eolas on behalf of my Department contains a number of elements which are relevant to the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>In the domestic sector, there has been a free telephone advisory service in operation since the early 1980's and this service was expanded last year to include information about energy and the environment. This service provides advice to householders on such topic as the choice and cost of fuels for heating, the choice of efficient appliances, methods of insulation and the safe installation of heating appliances.</P>
      <P>In the industrial sector, four regional energy officers based in Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Sligo promote energy efficiency by giving on the spot advice during company visits and by organising workshops and lectures on relevant topics.  The energy audit programme for industrial sectors is currently concentrating on the food and drink industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1968" /> The emphasis of this programme is on maximising the level of implementation of energy saving measures through follow-up visits to each company involved in the programme.</P>
    <P>In addition, detailed studies are currently being undertaken to establish the potential for energy savings in hotels, public buildings and hospitals.  The objectives of these studies is to carry out detailed energy audits of a sample number of organisations in a particular sector and then to promote the replication of the results and findings throughout that sector by various publicity measures including trade articles, workshops and conferences.  A recent conference held by Eolas and the Confederation of Irish Industry explored two topics in detail, namely, the energy/environment issue and combined heat and power.  Regarding the latter topic, my Department supports the use of combined heat and power units wherever they are shown to be viable.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides grants of up to 33? per cent to manufacturing industries, hotels and third level institutions towards the cost of engaging consultants to carry out fuel efficiency surveys.  Grants are also available for feasibility surveys for switching from oil and for combined heat and power projects.</P>
    <P>While from an energy conservation point of view I would like to see a shift from private to public transport, policy in this area is a matter for other Government Departments, notably the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Ideally, electricity producing power plants should be located as close to the user as possible in order to minimise transmission losses.  However, there are a number of reasons why this does not always occur in practice including the need to maintain continuity and security of supply, overall greater efficiencies through economies of scale and the availability of suitable deep water ports for importing fuel.  The location of some power plants, for example, hydro stations, is decided by topographical and <Col N="1969" /> other technical considerations rather than proximity to users.</P>

      <P>While unsorted domestic and industrial refuse is a potential source of energy, any proposal to harness energy from this source would require the most careful consideration on both environmental and commercial grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The burning of unsorted refuse can contribute to environmental problems due to smoke emissions and, possibly, the emission of toxins.  The latter can result from the burning of such items as plastic and metals.  The installation of fuel <Col N="1970" /> gas cleaning equipment can reduce these emissions but the costs of such equipment could render such a project uneconomic.</P>
    <P>There are other considerations that pose problems for such a development. Unsorted waste has a low heat value and it can be difficult to extract this heat due to the mixture of materials involved e.g. vegetable matter, wet materials, etc.  On the demand side, there could be difficulty in using the heat on a continuous basis given that heat demand is generally seasonal in nature whereas refuse is produced continually throughout the year.</P>

      <Quest>the action he has taken to alleviate the fears of the people of County Meath due to the 29 per cent increase in the crime rate in the county over the last 12 months; the number of extra gardaí he has requested the Garda Commissioner to appoint; and if he has made arrangements with the Garda Commissioner to have the extra patrol cars required by the force in the county made available.</Quest>

      <P>The increase in crime in County Meath in 1989 to which the Deputy refers followed a significant decrease in the level of reported crime in 1988 over 1987.  A comparison of the crime figures for Meath between 1987 and 1989 shows that the increase over the period is 8.7 per cent. The Garda authorities inform me that special measures are in place to deal with the situation.  These include increased Garda patrolling and the operation of mobile checkpoints.  The various policing measures being taken in Meath are being kept under ongoing review to assess their effectiveness in tackling the crime situation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities consider that the current Garda strength assigned to stations in County Meath is adequate to meet local policing needs, having regard to overall resources and the many other demands on Garda services that must be <Col N="1977" /> met.  There are no proposals to assign additional manpower to stations in the county at present, but the position will continue to be kept under review.</P>
    <P>I understand that the question of allocating a patrol car to Dunshaughlin is being considered.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposal from the Midland Health Board to provide a training centre for people with a mental handicap which formed part of the capital development programme adopted by the board on 16 December 1982.</P>
      <P>In 1986 the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, High Street, Tullamore made accommodation available as an interim arrangement pending the provision of a purpose built facility.  My Department provided a capital grant of £25,000 towards the cost of converting the premises. The unit is operated on a joint basis between the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary and the Midland Health Board. The provision of a purpose built unit will be considered in the light of capital funds available and the competing priorities to be met.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to estimate the number of young people living rough, i.e. on the streets, but in a recent joint Eastern Health Board/Focus Point report, 88 young persons out-of-home were in contact over a period of eight weeks.  Eleven of these had made just a brief phone contact with Focus Point, and of the remaining 77 who were researched in detail, 29 &mdash; 16 boys and 13 girls &mdash; were under the age of 16 years.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Eastern Health Board that accommodation is obtained for the majority of homeless young people who come to notice; however, there can, from time to time, be a small number who are difficult to place, very often due to their unwillingness to accept the accommodation offered by the board, and some of these end up sleeping rough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a share of the special fund for disadvantaged youth from the national lottery funds being made available for young homeless, I have been able to ensure that facilities have been improved and will continue to be improved.  These improvements are as follows: the assignment of a special team of social workers to deal specifically with homeless children and young people.  They are based in areas of greatest need, i.e. Tallaght, Ballyfermot, Ballymun, north inner city and south inner city.  They are backed up by a centralised crisis accommodation service at the homeless unit, Charles Street, where a social worker is available for the purpose of providing a counselling advisory and referral service; a community residential project for boys in the Tallaght area.  The project will provide residential care for six boys aged between 12 and 16 years; a residential project for girls located in the Ballymun area, <Col N="1987" /> expected to be in operation from September next; a long term residential unit for boys, opened in the Clontarf area, which will accommodate up to ten boys in the age group 11-14 years; and the setting up of a new project called &ldquo;Carers for Young People&rdquo; the aim of which is to cater for difficult adolescents who have previously been placed without success in a variety of other settings.</P>
    <P>In addition to services under the direct control of the Eastern Health Board, special financial allocations have been made to voluntary organisations working with the young homeless such as Focus Point.</P>
