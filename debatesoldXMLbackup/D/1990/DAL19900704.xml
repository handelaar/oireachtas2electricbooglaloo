    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 16.  Statements on the European Council in Dublin on 25 and 26 June shall be made at 3.45 p.m.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 28.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been reported in the newspapers during the past fortnight that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the co-Chairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference, is to make a statement in the House of Commons tomorrow and that this statement has in effect been agreed with the Irish Government through constant contact with the co-Chairman. In effect it is a joint statement. The Taoiseach will agree that it would be desirable that this House should have an <Col N="2" /> opportunity of debating the present state of play in Northern Ireland, since it is to be debated in the House of Commons tomorrow.  I would ask the Taoiseach to consider allowing such a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the House should be in the picture in some way.  I am not quite sure yet.  Things are still evolving.  I will see what I can do.</P>

      <P>I refer to the Insurance Bill, the Second Stage of which is to be debated today.  The time allowed for Committee Stage should be reconsidered since it is totally inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Taoiseach to item No. 6 on today's Order Paper, the Clinical Trials Bill.  On over a dozen occasions in this session the Taoiseach has promised that this Bill will be taken. I understand that the Government Chief Whip yesterday indicated to my Party's Whip that this Bill will not now be taken in this session.  In view of the commitments given by the Minister for Health and also of the fact that all Stages of the Bill could be taken in a few hours, will the Taoiseach consider making time available before the session ends to take this important legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disgrace.  The Taoiseach should act immediately.  It is absolutely outrageous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise on the Adjournment the compensation due to Swords Community Council in respect of expenditure on the VEC school in <Col N="4" /> Swords, given ultimately that the payment of such by the VEC has to be sanctioned by the Minister and her Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the statements on the EC Summit will conclude at 7 p.m., thus conforming to the position on the Order Paper last Friday?  This will effectively exclude me or any other Independent Deputy from speaking on this matter.  I regard this as a conspiracy between all the parties in the House to silence the Independents.  I intend to speak on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must assure the Deputy there is no conspiracy.  It is well known, established practice that on these occasions we only have party leaders.  I would be very happy to receive the Deputy in my office and go through with him the details of the wonderful, magnificent declaration on the environment.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 258 of 27 June and the reply by the Minister which shows the reluctance on the part of the Department <Col N="5" /> of Education to allow repeat examinations for students who are hospitalised and who were too ill to take the leaving certificate paper on a particular day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food when protests he has made to the French authorities about yesterday's blockade which prevented the importation of Irish lamb into France and if he would ask the French authorities to direct their attention to New Zealand imports rather than Irish imports?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek your guidance on the subject matter of my Priority Question which was ruled out of order.  Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle would clarify the procedures available to me.  Is it possible <Col N="6" /> to re-introduce the Priority Question today?  I have been in touch with the Department of Social Welfare and they seem reluctant to answer this question. I presume &mdash; and I expect the Ceann Comhairle's office are also expected to presume &mdash; that they will give the same answer as they gave to a previous question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter which is more appropriately dealt with by my office, but I am aware of the Deputy's complaint.  I disallowed the Deputy's question because it was clearly a repeat and as it was a Priority Question he could have submitted a substitute Priority Question in accordance with Standing Order 37 (4), which enables Members to table substitute Priority Questions for questions disallowed.  Perhaps the Deputy was not aware of that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only notified by your office this morning and this allowed me no time to substitute another question. This question was not a repeat, but the answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not argue about the matter now.  It was clearly a repeat and I have said so.  There is little I can do about the matter now.  I would advise Deputy Ferris when he is submitting Priority Questions in future that he put down more questions, lest any of them be disallowed.  This is the normal practice so that his number of Priority Questions will be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, may I presume that the answer to my Priority Question would have been a repeat, even though the question was not a repeat?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    <Title>Insurance Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is somewhat unusual for a Minister for Finance to introduce an Insurance Bill.  However, as the Bill is connected with the restructuring of Irish Life Assurance plc, it is appropriate that I should do so instead of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has the more general responsibility for insurance matters and the supervision of insurance companies. Nonetheless, an important part of the restructuring will come within the purview of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his capacity as insurance supervisor.  I will return to this point in a moment.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with all aspects of the restructuring of the company.  It is not necessary that it should do so.  The primary function of this legislation is to enable the restructuring to take place and to allow the Minister to fulfil his part in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new corporate structure will be put in place in order to implement the proposed restructuring of Irish Life.  This involves the setting up of a holding company for Irish Life, referred to as Holdco, and the creation of a sister company to which the business of Irish Life will be transferred.  Irish Life will eventually be wound up.  The Minister and the other shareholders in Irish Life will exchange their shares for an equivalent shareholding in the new parent company, Holdco.  There will be provisions in the <Col N="11" /> Articles of Association of the new companies allowing for a more realistic dividend to be paid to shareholders necessary for capital expansion.</P>
    <P>The approval of the courts in Ireland and the UK is necessary for the transfer of business of Irish Life of Newco.  The courts will have to be satisfied that the rights of existing policyholders are not being diminished and will have before them a detailed scheme for transferring the business, which will be drawn up by the actuary of Irish Life, and reported on by an independent actuary.  The object of this scheme will be to ensure that the interests of policyholders are not compromised by the restructuring.  The insurance regulatory authorities in the UK and Ireland will also be consulted in the restructuring process.</P>
    <P>Before going into detail on the mechanics of the matter and the provisions of this Bill, it is essential to outline the background to the proposed restructuring and the complex issues involved.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it is necessary to describe the current position of Irish Life and to look back to the origins of the company.  This is important when considering the future of the company after restructuring.  Irish Life are of major commercial importance not only in their own right but to the very many people in this country and elsewhere whose savings and pension provisions are under their control.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years Irish Life have grown at very rapid rate and have become the main life assurance company in the State with almost 40 per cent of the market.  Total funds and reserves at end-1989 amounted to £4.5 billion.  The company operate in Ireland and the UK and have expanded into the US markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance owns 90.25 per cent of the shares of the company. The remaining shares are held by Irish Life's own staff pension fund, 5 per cent and a variety of private shareholders.  The present status of Irish Life as a Stateowned company arises from the insolvency of several small life assurance companies in the 'thirties.  The Minister for Finance, on behalf of the Government, <Col N="12" /> contributed just over £1 million in 1938 to making good the deficiencies in the funds of the insolvent assurers.  The Minister for Finance subsequently acquired a controlling interest in the company now known as Irish Life Assurance plc.</P>
    <P>The ownership of the company came about through historical accident.  It was not a conscious decision to nationalise life insurance in the State but rather an <i>ad hoc</i> solution to a problem of an insurance insolvency.  We have seen such arrangements recently in the insurance field.  In both cases, however, the ongoing business of the companies was transferred back to the private sector within a relatively short period.</P>
    <P>Irish Life have remained in State hands but have been run with the minimum of State involvement.  The company have operated for all intents and purposes as an insurance company like any other. They are not guaranteed by the State in any way and look to their own resources to meet the statutory EC solvency requirements applicable to all life insurers.  The company have never had to rely on State funding since their inception.</P>
    <P>I find it necessary to underline these facts to assure those who feel that a change in the State's shareholding will in some way affect the security of policyholders. It will not.  I say it also to counteract those who might argue that Irish Life are a company controlled by the State whose investment policy can be directed by the State for particular policy reasons.  They are not.  We are dealing with a financial institution in State ownership which can easily, and, it will be argued, can more readily be run without the need for a majority State holding.</P>
    <P>Irish Life have been a remarkable success due to the efforts of their staff, but it is not sufficient to rely on this past success.  We must look to the future of the company.  The Government believe that the company must develop as an Irish-based international financial services company specialising in long-term insurance and savings.  Key elements in achieving this strategy have been the continued development of the Irish and UK <Col N="13" /> business, the acquisition of a US life insurance company and the development of links with other EC life insurers.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a crucial impediment to implementing this strategy. Under the present corporate arrangements, profits are largely locked in and cannot be distributed to shareholders. Expansion is, therefore, limited by the level of retained profits and reserves. While a capital injection is not an immediate, or short-term need, access to capital will be vital in the future.  The development of new markets takes careful planning. To undertake this expansion, the company must be secure in the knowledge that they can raise the capital as required.</P>
    <P>To overcome these difficulties, Irish Life put forward proposals for restructuring which would make it more attractive for investors to provide additional capital.  This restructuring would also allow the sale at a realistic price of part of the State holding.  The Government agreed in July 1988 that Irish Life should be restructured to facilitate their development as an Irish-based institution in the financial services area.</P>
    <P>The Government also decided to appoint a team of consultants to examine the particular proposals put forward by the company and to review the options open to the Government in relation to the State's shareholding in the company after restructuring.</P>
    <P>The consultants examined the operations of Irish Life and identified the strategic options available to the company in developing into international markets. The consultants pointed out that Irish Life are competing across a broad spectrum of financial products with other major international insurance companies and the life assurance arms of the domestic banking groups.  As quoted companies, many of Irish Life's competitors have access to very substantial resources throughout the entire range of debt and equity markets in order to fund expansion at home and abroad.  The consultants confirmed that the company's capacity to do so is limited and that access to equity markets for new capital was a key <Col N="14" /> element of any viable competitive strategy for the company.</P>
    <P>Having examined the scheme put forward by Irish Life, the consultants agreed that it represented the best practical solution to the problems outlined above. The consultants put forward a number of options for the State holding in the company.  All of these involved the sale of the majority of the State's shares and one option proposed a complete sale of the State's shareholding in the company.</P>
    <P>The Government considered the consultants' reports.  I met the main union representing the staff of Irish Life and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I listened carefully to their views and concerns particularly as regards employment. I had discussions with the chairman and the managing director of the company and received clear assurances on employment.  I should point out that Irish Life have consistently expanded their work force in the past ten years and I have every reason to believe that with restructuring they can continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Having examined the options for the development of the company, I announced last March that the Government had decided that the restructuring should proceed and that the State's holding should be redused from 90 per cent to 34 per cent through a sale involving a public flotation of the company's shares. This will mean that the State will no longer have majority control but will retain a substantial shareholder interest in the development of the company.  This holding will be maintained for the foreseeable future but it will always be open to the Government to consider the size of their holding from time to time in the interests of the company and the wider public interest generally.</P>
    <P>This decision represents a fundamental change in the status of the company, a change from State control to a more widely diffused ownership.  From a general viewpoint, there is no overriding reason why the State should own a life assurance company.  The arguments which are normally used to justify State involvement &mdash; i.e. the existence of a <Col N="15" /> natural monopoly, the absence of potential private investment capital, and overriding social and strategic interests &mdash; do not apply in this case.</P>
    <P>The returns which the State has earned by way of dividends from the company are very small e.g. £440,000 in 1989.  A sale of the Minister's shareholding following a capital restructuring will yield a significant capital gain which can be used to benefit the Exchequer.  Furthermore, the retention of even a small share of the restructured company can be expected to yield an annual return in dividends which will easily exceed those received from the 90 per cent holding in the present company.  Disposal of the Minister's shareholding and the consequential freeing of the company to raise additional private sector share capital will provide the Irish public with an opportunity to invest directly in a successful Irish company.</P>
    <P>The Government acknowledge the importance of Irish Life and the investments they control.  It is essential that Irish Life should retain their Irish ethos and their local base.  To maintain this ethos and to avoid unwelcome takeover of the company, provisions will be included in the memorandum and articles of the new holding company to limit the percentage of shares to be held by any one private shareholder, or consortium of shareholders, to not more than 15 per cent of the total share capital.  A special share will be held by the Minister for Finance to enforce this limitation and the arrangement will continue in place for at least five years after floatation.  The company are in favour of this arrangement which I believe will be generally welcomed.  This special, or golden, share arrangement will reinforce the interest being retained through the 34 per cent holding.  As Deputies will know, such special shares are a common feature of sales of State assets in other countries.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government decision in relation to Irish Life is a balanced and reasoned response to the needs of the company.  We must build on the strengths <Col N="16" /> of the successful firms here in developing the economy.  I am convinced that the plans now being made by Irish Life will not only protect the company's position and that of their staff, but will lay the foundations of continued success and expansion.  We will need to reply on the skills and expertise of companies such as Irish Life to ensure that the fullest advantage can be taken of 1992 and the opening up of financial markets in the Community.</P>
    <P>I know that the staff of the company wish to participate in and facilitate this success.  The union representatives have expressed to me a desire for employee share schemes and I will be anxious to address this aspect in planning the flotation. There are many difficult tasks for both staff and management.  It will be important for the company to develop their management skills further to take advantage of the opportunities afforded through flotation.  This will be the key role of the new chairman-designate of Holdco, a task which I am confident will be undertaken with efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the company will be a complex process and, together with the flotation, will take up to 12 months or more to complete.  It will involve considerable devotion of resources by the company and within my Department.  I will be appointing financial advisers to assist in the sale of the shares on the State's behalf, to plan and carry out all the necessary and detailed preparations for this sale, and to advise on the pricing and method of sale to be employed.  For their part, the company will be assisted by advisers on the restructuring and the preparation of the various financial statements and prospectus required from the company in connection with the flotation.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that we will see in 1991 Irish Life successfully launched on this new and dynamic phase of their commercial life.  I am hopeful also that the flotation will yield a significant return to the Exchequer.  It would be inappropriate for me to speculate on the value that will be realised, for reasons I need not explain. The value of the shares will be ultimately <Col N="17" /> determined by the market conditions at the time of flotation.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the particular provisions of the Bill.  Although the essential element of the Bill is to enable the Minister to acquire shares in Holdco, the opportunity is also being taken to clarify certain other matters of direct bearing on the restructuring of the company.  Section 1 is the usual definitions section and calls for no particular comment.</P>
    <P>Section 2 allows the Minister to exchange his shares in Irish Life for shares in the new holding company and to acquire by purchase, capitalisation, issue or otherwise any further share or shares in the holding company.  The Minister may hold the shares or dispose off these by sale, exchange or otherwise as he sees fit.  If it is necessary to acquire shares at any stage the moneys will be advanced out of the Central Fund.  Any dividends and other moneys and the proceeds of the sale of shares of the holding company must be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.  Section 3 provides that the Minister may exercise all their rights attaching to his shares in the holding company including, where applicable, the exercise of those rights by attorney or proxy.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the allotment of shares and empowers the Minister to appoint nominees and to transfer shares to such nominees to act on his behalf. The section sets out the rights and duties of nominees and the power of the Minister to issue directions.</P>
    <P>Section 5 to 8 deal with matters arising from the transfer of Irish Life's business to their new sister company, Newco.  The overall purpose of the sections is to ensure a smooth transition from one operating company to another once the insurance business is transferred by the court order.  The new company must be able to continue the normal day-to-day operations of Irish Life without interruption.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the court order requiring or approving the transfer of property from Irish Life to Newco or any deed or agreement made under that order need not be registered under the acts <Col N="18" /> relating to the registration of deeds or title or under the Companies Acts.  This will remove the need for the title to properties to be re-registered individually.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that every person who was an employee of Irish Life immediately before the date of transfer of the business from Irish Life to Newco will become an employee of Newco on the same terms and conditions.  The section also provides for the transfer of pension and superannuation rights and gives effect to certain changes in pension schemes introduced by Irish Life in 1979 as if those changes had been registered at the time under the Perpetual Funds (Registration) Act, 1933.  Existing pensioners of Irish Life will transfer to the new scheme in Newco without any loss of benefits or rights.</P>
    <P>Section 7 permits the new company to act in place for Irish Life as trustee, or in any other fiduciary capacity, in regard to any trust, settlement, covenant or agreement that empowers Irish Life Assurance plc to do so.  Section 8 grants relief from stamp duty on any agreement, transfer, conveyance, assignment or lease whereby the business is transferred to Newco and provides that stamp duty shall not be charged on the vesting of property in Newco by order of the court. This relief is a common feature of group reconstructions.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is new and is of general application to life assurance companies. It will enable a life assurer to hold up to 10 per cent of the shares of their parent company on behalf of their policyholders, provided that the shares in question are listed on a recognised stock exchange. The Minister for Industry and Commerce may vary the percentage by order and impose prudential requirements on life assurers covered by this section.</P>
    <P>While Irish Life are not the sole beneficiary of this section, it will be of particular importance to the company.  After restructuring and flotation, Holdco will be one of the largest companies listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.  Other life assurance companies in the State will be entitled to invest in the shares of Holdco on behalf of their policyholders but, <Col N="19" /> under present law which prevents a subsidiary having shares in its parent, Newco will be unable to do so.  This would place Newco at a disadvantage compared with their competitors for investment business in the State.  The consultants who advised the Minister on the restructuring of Irish Life recommended that this anomaly should be removed to enhance the value of the company on flotation.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the repeal by order of the Insurance Acts dealing with Irish Life Assurance plc.  Once the restructuring is completed, Irish Life will be wound up and these Acts will no longer be applicable.  Given that the full restructuring can only be put into effect after court approval, the repeals will take place on such dates and to such extent as may be specified in the orders.  Section 11 deals with the laying of orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The orders will come into effect immediately but may be annulled by either House within 21 sitting days.  Section 12 contains the usual citation and commencement provisions. The Act will come into operation on such day or days to be fixed by order of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies considered the restructuring and flotation of Irish Life in their comprehensive and detailed report on the company in 1988. I believe that it is fair to say that the committee, generally, listened sympathetically to the case being made by the company for restructuring and flotation. It was clear that all the Members of the committee had a high regard for the company as an example of a successful Irish enterprise and were keenly interested to see that success continue.  I feel sure that Deputies here today will express similar sentiments of goodwill toward the company.</P>
    <P>I know that the House will be eager to act in the best interests of the company and pass this legislation.  I have taken some time to explain the background and need for the changes being proposed. I hope that Deputies will respond in a positive manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to thank the Minister for his detailed speech which expands on the provisions of the Bill and provides us with some of the information we require to understand the Minister's intentions for the remainder of the year, up to and including the flotation of a certain percentage of the shares he now holds in Irish Life.  It is a great pity that the debate is to be curtailed and that the Bill was not taken earlier in this session so that we could have had an open-ended debate.</P>
      <P>Even though the Bill is a very short one, and many of the sections are such that they will be dealt with rather expeditiously on Committee Stage, issues arise from it which are very important in themselves.  They also have an importance in so far as they will by their very nature be establishing precedents on the attitude of the House, and that of the Minister and the Government, to the sale of State assets.</P>
      <P>I know that people in the House &mdash; and outside it &mdash; have the view that one's attitude to this Bill is almost for touchstone of how one positions oneself in relation to economic issues, and questions of whether one is in favour of a more muscular State role in the economy or the privatisation of certain companies which are now semi-State, will be the subject of debate and possibly controversy inside and outside the House.  My view is that these issues do not particularly arise from this Bill.  A flotation of Irish Life shares must be approached in a pragmatic fashion; it is quite clear from many comments since the examination of the issues, that it is in the national interest &mdash; by that I mean in the interests of the Exchequer &mdash; and in the interests of Irish Life, their employees and customers, that such an initiative should take place.  In that context, I welcome the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deplore the fact that debate is curtailed because the more important issues which will arise directly from a flotation of shares in Irish Life are not addressed in the Bill even though they will arise <Col N="21" /> from its provisions.  I should like to deal with some of those issues later.  It would have been helpful &mdash; and might still be helpful &mdash; if the Minister would consider issuing a White Paper on the whole flotation of shares in Irish Life so that a better public debate will ensure and that the public are apprised of the key issues. There is an enormous misunderstanding in and outside the House of the issues involved even though they have been addressed before.  Because it is the first major sale of a State company it would be in everybody's interest if the Minister approached it by publishing a White Paper in which the issues were clearly outlined.</P>
    <P>This Bill, by its very nature, is enabling legislation where the issues are quite confined. The Minister expanded on the issues in his speech but very important questions have not been dealt with which will take us from the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas through the debate in the courts; through the submissions made by the regulatory authorities here, in the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Trade in the United Kingdom; through the input of the actuary who will represent the interests of the &ldquo;with profits&rdquo; policy holders up to the point of the flotation, its manner; the whole issue of the golden share to which the Minister referred; whether the flotation will be a once off, whether it will be on an instalment basis or over a period of time; whether the flotation will be confined to the Dublin market, to the Dublin and UK market; whether the 15 per cent ceiling which the Minister intends to put on the amount of shares which can be held by an institution of individual is the appropriate ceiling; and the implications of all these matters.</P>
    <P>A major area of discussion will now open up in regard to which the public lack essential information.  It is very important &mdash; as this is the first sale of portion of a State company &mdash; that it is done right, without misunderstandings, and that it will be a successful flotation.  I ask the Minister to consider the publication of a White Paper which would deal with those issues.  I understand that if and when this <Col N="22" /> Bill passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas the next phase will be the submission to the courts of an actuarial scheme prepared by the Irish Life actuary which will have to go through the courts in Ireland and the United Kingdom. There will be an input from the sources I indicated and there will be time, between now and the end of the year, for the Minister to publish a White Paper to deal with the issues so that when it comes to the flotation some time in the first half of 1991 the public will be in possession of all the facts.  In so far as this will be a kind of touchstone issue on where parties stand on privatisation and the role of the public and private sectors in a mixed economy, I should like to indicate my party's position.</P>
    <P>In the last general election we published <i>Election '89 &mdash; Putting The Country First,</i> and under the section on institutional reform on page 33 we outlined our attitude to the sale of shares in semi-State bodies.  For the purposes of clarification I will quote from it.  We said we would make the following changes:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes that the sale of shares in semi-State bodies would be beneficial once proper groundwork for such a move has been laid.  It could be beneficial in the following ways:</P>
    <P>It can strengthen the capital base of the company, thereby facilitating investment and expansion</P>
    <P>It can involve employees directly in the success of the company through share ownership</P>
    <P>It can sharpen the commercial management of the company</P>
    <P>It can open up the opportunity of joint ventures in new commercial fields  </P>
    <P>At the present time it is necessary to sell shares because the Government is unable to provide the funds for the vital expansion plans in companies like Aer Lingus and Irish Life.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will immediately put in train the necessary preparations to sell shares in appropriate companies.  The <Col N="23" /> key elements in that preparation will be:</P>
    <P>1.  A clear definition of the social objectives which the company must continue to pursue and the basis on which any new commercial costs involved could be funded</P>
    <P>2.  The terms of a Golden Share Mechanism whereby the State could guarantee the protection of certain strategic national interests</P>
    <P>3.  Establishment of a system for ensuring that the market power of the companies is not used against the consumer's interest or fair competition</P>
    <P>4.  Putting the company in such a position of efficiency and profitability, prior to the disposal of shares, that the shares will realise their full potential value for the tax-payer</P>
    <P>The proceeds of such share sales will be used to strengthen the capital base of the company or to reduce the debt, either of the company itself or of the State.  They will not be used for current Budget purposes.  Shares will be made available on preferential terms to the employees of the companies concerned. The size of the continuing State holding in any company will be a pragmatic commercial consideration. The important purpose is to achieve an incentive structure for key decision makers within the company which will maximise its commercial and the financial returns to the company itself, its employees, the Exchequer and its customers.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael welcomes the policy statement of the Irish Association of Pension Funds which suggest that they, in particular, might wish to become involved in taking shares in some of the bodies named above.  Pension funds, which represent the savings of Irish workers, would be particularly useful co-owners in important Irish State companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> That outlines our position on the sale of shares in State companies.  It is quite clear, while it is a statement of general intent, that those who drafted the statement had the issue of Irish Life very clearly in mind.</P>
    <P>On 1 March 1988 a Private Members' motion was put down in my name.  It was, &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to make an early decision to privatise Irish Life Assurance plc.&rdquo;  In his reply, the then Minister for Finance, Commissioner MacSharry said that the Government would make an early decision but that they were not in a position to make it at that time because certain considerations had to be taken into account.  Earlier this year the Minister, Deputy Reynolds indicated that the Government were proceeding and that 56 per cent of the company would be offered to the public or to public institutions.</P>
    <P>The question of Irish Life has received quite a lot of consideration.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies in their first report to the Dáil recommended that the Government should take an early decision on the submission to the Government by the company.  That submission sought the restructuring of the capital base of the company in a manner which would effectively lead to its privatisation.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have introduced this Bill and that its provisions are along the lines sought when the company wanted restructuring.  It will enable the company to expand their business internationally and at the same time enable the State to realise some of the shareholdings of the company for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Irish Life plc were incorporated on 15 March 1939 to carry on the business of life assurance, but the decision by the State to enter the life assurance business was not an ideological one.  The Taoiseach of the day, as I said previously in the House, was no Hugh Gaitskill capturing the demanding heights of the economy for State companies.  The decision was pragmatic.  The private companies who were rolled together to form Irish <Col N="25" /> Life were broke.  The State came to the rescue to protect the policyholders and, when the State was in it, stayed in.  The company prospered but the original decision was based on the same pragmatic criteria as involved the State in other areas of the company, those of the rescue and protection of the savings of citizens.  The Minister referred to this in his opening remarks.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to go into the origins of the company or the composition of the constituent companies who in the first instance were taken over by the State, but it is important to remember that the initial State involvement in the insurance industry was for pragmatic reasons.  If the State is now deciding to get out or partly get out of the company by offering shares to the public the same pragmatic considerations should apply. Even though I know the case will be made, I do not believe that this legislation is going to be the kind of basic law on how we approach the sale of State assets in the future.  The flotation of Irish Life is totally different from flotations which may arise in other companies subsequently. Pragmatic considerations rather than considerations of ideology should apply here and we should approach the debate in that manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance holds over 90 per cent of the shares in the company but little or no profit accrues to the Exchequer from this holding.  This has been the case since the company were incorporated in 1939, but this situation was exacerbated in 1971 when, to enable the company to compete more effectively in the area of life policy with profits, the company were virtually mutualised.  The company's capital structure was restructured in 1971, whereby the shareholders' entitlement to profits was reduced from 20 per cent to 2 per cent.  To compensate the shareholders for this a sum of £1.6 million was paid to the shareholders and the Minister for Finance as the principal shareholder received the bulk of this. Issues arise from this which will be relevant when the scheme of arrangement prepared by the Irish Life actuary goes before the courts in both jurisdictions, <Col N="26" /> here and in the UK.  I will return to that later.</P>
    <P>As a result of the restructuring of the company in 1971 they were run to all intents and purposes for the benefit of policyholders, with profits, rather than the shareholders.  The principal module of business at the time consisted of with profits policies.  The company were run for the benefit of the with profits policies. Under the company's articles the with profits policy-holders have a perceived right to 98 per cent of all the surplus it is chosen to declare for policyholders and shareholders and the shareholders simply get 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the decision made in 1971.  It was the correct decision at the time.  When giving evidence before the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies on 23 July 1986 Mr. David Kingston, Managing Director of Irish Life said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>In this particular situation there was an actuary from the UK, an expert in this area, employed by the Government. The position has shifted somewhat since 1971.  At that time the company was keen to become mutual because the with-profit business, giving bonuses to policy holders, seemed to be the core of the business.  The business has changed somewhat in the last 15 years and the bulk of our business now is unit linked business where the investment performance goes to the policy-holder, what we call non-profit business.  In other words the policyholder puts in his £100, we invest it on his behalf, we take a proportion of that for expenses, mortality risks and so on and he gets the rest.  We make our profit out of hoping that we keep our expenses below what we are charging him and we hope that our death claims will be below what we are charging. This is not just true of Irish Life, it is true of the life assurance industry generally.</P>
    <P>He goes on to explain that the nature of the business has changed.  I believe that at present there are about 30,000 with profit policyholders in the company. <Col N="27" /> More than half of those are in Ireland and somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 are in the UK.  It is essential that the company be restructured so that they-are not handcuffed in a capital structure which does not allow them to expand. That is the situation at the moment.  Secondly, some benefit should accrue to the State.</P>
    <P>David Kingston's comments are fair comment on the position in 1971, and I stress I am not critical of the question. Business decisions have to be made in the light of prevailing circumstances and it was the right decision in 1971, but the structure put in place then is not the structure for the benefit of the State, the benefit of the company, the benefit of the staff or the benefit of the policy holders, in 1990.  Whatever ideological trappings are paraded across the Floor of this House in the course of the debate, at the bottom line the capital structure of Irish Life has to change anyway.  Any commonsense person looking at the problem would have to say that we have to make the changes.  The changes are necessary for two reasons which I have referred to briefly and which I now wish to expand on.</P>
    <P>The present structure is inhibiting the growth of the company.  Secondly, one of the largest and most successful multinational companies in Ireland is owned by the State but the Exchequer does not benefit directly from the success of the company.  We own one of the biggest companies in the country as citizens of the country through the Minister for Finance's shareholding, and we get nothing out of it.  That makes no sense when the structure is inhibiting the growth of Irish Life.</P>
    <P>If it was a kind of general privatisation debate we would be looking at all the literature from the heritage lectures and various other places where we get loads of advice always on the benefits of selling off State assets, but many of those arguments do not apply here at all.  Irish Life has always been run on commercial lines. The State has put in no capital since 1939. <Col N="28" /> The State does not guarantee the company in any way.  The State does not interfere in any way whatsoever in the day to day running of the company and, as Mr. J. P. Rehill, who was Chairman at the time the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies looked at the matter said, and I quote from page 112 of the report:</P>
    <P>We trade and compete as a commercial life insurance company and unlike the other State controlled companies, do not fulfil any special role on behalf of Government.</P>
    <P>There is no social role here.  They are not being directed, like CIE used to be, to keep buses on certain routes for social reasons.  They are not being directed, like the ESB, to provide rural electrification for everybody who demand it.  Regardless of cost, everybody was entitled to a power supply so you had to provide 20 poles down the valley to the last house. There were no considerations like that ever and there was no attempt to establish policy for Irish Life either in this House or in the Minister's Department in a manner which did not allow them to act in exactly the same way as a private company would act.  The chairman went on to say:</P>
    <P>Our principal job is to provide the best possible returns to our policy holders &mdash; our shareholders are entitled to a tiny proportion of our surpluses. Shareholders have never been asked for money since the company was founded</P>
    <P>I say these things at this stage so that you will appreciate that Irish Life is run as a commercial concern.  Future planning and detailed running of the company in the competitive markets in which we operate in Ireland and the UK must be a matter for the board of the company and its management. </P>
    <P>To sum up, Irish Life is one of the biggest life companies in the country owned by the State but run as a private company.  The State has not put in any capital or guaranteed the borrowings of the company.  It has not interfered in any <Col N="29" /> way so that when the capital structure is changed the manner in which the company is managed will not change.  All the arguments on either side of the privatisation scale suggesting that they will suddenly become a more efficient company because the shares have been floated to the private sector do not apply at all because the company have operated as a private company since their foundation and as they have gone from strength to strength, especially in the last decade, they are very much operating as a private company.</P>
    <P>They have a large share of the Irish market and have gone into the UK market as well.  They are at the stage now where it is bad for the company to have too many eggs in the one basket.  They have over 40 per cent of Irish business; they have gone into the UK and are significant in the UK from an Irish perspective but are not significant comparatively in the UK, where they have 20 offices, and a parent insurance company there would have something like 300 offices.  They would have a very small amount of the UK market but have the capacity and the ability to expand under a new capital structure.  The UK market is so big that a small percentage share would be very significant even for Irish Life.</P>
    <P>Another issue arises which inhibits expansion of the company.  Some Governments, particularly the US Government, will not allow companies owned by foreign Governments to take over native companies, so the normal process of expansion of Irish multinationals by acquisition in the US is not a route which Irish Life can follow easily. I know that French insurance companies discovered a mechanism in the US for getting around this and that Irish Life have followed the same route, but there are still inhibitions on the scale of operation which can be organised in this way. I understand that the Irish Life subsidiary in the US is worth about £30 million or so; it is not a huge acquisition.  The same considerations apply in parts of the continent &mdash; they certainly applied in Spain until quite recently &mdash; and that would be <Col N="30" /> an inhibiting factor as well in the expansion of Irish Life.</P>
    <P>There are reasons for a restructuring of Irish Life which arise not from considerations about privatisation but simply to take the handcuffs off the company to allow them to expand and become a multinational.  The company dominates the Irish market at the moment.  There is very little room for further expansion here.  The company are significant in the UK market and have room for expansion there.  They can expand in France or anywhere else in the EC under the latest EC Directives and it is probably the intention of the company to expand further in the US.  To do that the company will require capital.  The State will not provide the capital so they must be positioned to get capital elsewhere.  At the moment because there are only 30,000 &ldquo;with profit&rdquo; policyholders it has been the custom of the actuary not to declare significant surpluses because &ldquo;with profit&rdquo; policy holders are entitled to the declared surpluses.</P>
    <P>A significant amount of the profit of Irish Life has been put into a reserve fund.  While the reserve fund provides the company with a source of capital for limited expansion, only a restructuring along the lines now suggested by the Minister will enable Irish Life to become a very big player in the European market. It is important that the company would continue to grow.</P>
    <P>The company have given good employment for a long time.  They employ about 1,800 people in good quality jobs.  As well as that, with a new regime in Europe after 1992, only the big will survive, and only growing companies will survive.  It is a question of Irish Life expanding and by acquisition becoming a major player in the UK and on the continent or, alternatively, being exposed to competition from bigger continental companies already in the country with them capturing the business.</P>
    <P>The case is very clear for restructuring of the company so that they will have access to sources of capital which will allow them to put their expansion plans in place.  The company do not have that <Col N="31" /> access now and there is no possibility of having it without a restructuring of the company.</P>
    <P>The State have had no direct benefit from Irish Life for a long time.  There was a payment of about £1.4 million when the arrangements were changed in 1971 &mdash; there was some benefit at that time &mdash; but if we look at the company we see that various estimates give it a value of somewhere between £0.5 billion and£0.6 billion.  It is unfortunate that the State has not benefited directly.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends selling off 56 per cent of the company.  As the Minister says, it is very difficult to put a figure on what that would be worth but the figures which the press have speculated upon are not too far wide of the mark &mdash; it is probably worth £250 million or £300 million. A sum of £300 million to the Exchequer is a significant input especially when done in a fashion which will be of benefit to the company.  The money, in effect, is locked up and a long process must be gone through before the Minister can realise this benefit.  I would like a commitment from the Minister before the end of the debate that the money gained will not be used for current expenditure but will be used to reduce the debt. To take £300 million from the national debt would remove servicing charges of about £24 million or £25 million.</P>
    <P>Even though we are talking about a large capital sum, when one looks at the debt service side it is not huge when one considers the amount of interest being paid out every year to service the debt. The benefit of £25 million to £30 million each year to the Exchequer would at least give a start to reducing the size of the national debt.  All that has happened up to now, despite the good progress that has been made, is that the rate at which the debt is increasing has been slowed down although the debt has been rising every year and will again rise this year by about £0.5 billion; the Exchequer return figures recently published will confirm that the debt will rise by near enough to £0.5 billion this year.</P>
    <P>If there are ways and means of reducing the outstanding debt they should be <Col N="32" /> used and if this is to be the first instalment in the sale of the State assets which will be dedicated to a reduction of the national debt, it is very welcome indeed.  That is my party position, and the general background, and I will move now from the presentation of the Bill, because issues arise which are not clear and which have not been dealt with in detail in the Minister's speech, which should be dealt with by means of a White Paper so that everybody who has an interest will know the position and also because this is the first legislation which deals with the sale of State companies or shares vested in the Minister for Finance.  A procedure should be laid down to be followed in future.  It is important that the full story be told at the start so that the debate here and outside will be on the facts rather than idle speculation.  The articles I have read by people one would consider well informed were totally off the mark so far as Irish Life are concerned.  I am not speaking here about the opinions expressed in the articles but rather about the facts.  There is a responsibility on the Minister to ensure that all possible information is made available.</P>
    <P>As is clear from section 4, the courts will be involved.  As I said, the actuary will have to present a scheme of arrangement on behalf of Irish Life.  The key question to be addressed is how the with profit policyholders are to be treated and compensated for the change in the scheme of arrangement.  When the company was restructured in 1971 98 per cent of the surplus, declared by the actuary, was given to the with profit policyholders. However they now only represent a very small tranche of the total business of the company.  There are not that many precedents for this.  When the schemes of arrangement were changed in France and the United Kingdom the rate of interest to with profit policyholders was affected but it is not clear how things will go.  I presume the actuary in drawing up the scheme of arrangement will be generous to the with profit policyholders.  If he is to be at fault he will be at fault on the side of generosity.  The with profit policy-holders have rights which are enshrined <Col N="33" /> in the articles of the companies since 1971.  I presume the Minister, the actuary in Irish Life and the financial advisers have far more information in this regard than any of us in this house has, but, again, it is only fair that those of us debating the issue here, and the general public, have the same information.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, when the actuary has put the scheme of arrangement together it will be submitted to the courts both here and in the United Kingdom as there are policyholders in both jurisdictions. The Minister in his speech indicated that it is unusual for a Minister for Finance to introduce an Insurance Bill given that the supervisory authority is the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Therefore the supervisory authorities in both countries, the Department of Industry and Commerce here and the Department of Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom, will both make submissions.  It is also the intention that an actuary will be appointed, I presume by the company, to represent the interests of with profit policyholders and that he, too, will make a submission to the courts.</P>
    <P>Courts are peculiar places.  When people ask me in my clinics if they would be wise to go to court the advice I give them is that, if at all possible, they should avoid doing so.  I know Deputy Taylor will be upset when I say that I always advise my constituents to stay away from solicitors, barristers and courts and to keep free of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I advise them to stay out of the hands of the law. Without getting involved in a general legal debate, suffice it to say that courts are very uncertain places.  The Minister's financial advisers, the Department, the people at Irish Life and the actuary cannot be certain how the courts both here <Col N="34" /> and in the United Kingdom will adjudicate on the scheme of arrangement put before them.  Furthermore, all those who advise the Minister cannot be certain that the courts both here and in the United Kingdom will adopt the same attitude. They are two separate court systems and it is possible that the courts in the United Kingdom will adopt a different attitude to the one adopted by the courts here. Having regard to the fact that the profile of business written here is different from the one in the United Kingdom, effectively the respective courts will be adjudicating on two different issues.  I understand that many endowment mortgage policies with profits were written in the seventies in the United Kingdom whereas many of the Irish Life with profit policies here were surrendered when people needed the accumulated savings from time to time.  However it is very hard to surrender a policy which is tied to a mortgage.  Therefore there are significant differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the company was restructured in 1971 the existing shareholders were compensated for the additional benefits transferred from the shareholders to the with profit policyholders.  At that time the Minister for Finance received £1.4 million which may sound like a trivial amount, relative to the value of the company at present, but it was probably full and fair compensation relative to the value of the company at the time.  The people who represent the interests of the with profit policyholders will say that given the arrangement was made in 1971, the with profit policyholders should be entitled to a &ldquo;divi-up&rdquo; of the full surplus of the company and that the man now trying to sell 56 per cent of a shareholding cashed in his chips in 1971.  I hope this does not happen.  The case being made by the Minister is a very good one but the courts are very uncertain places. Given that the courts in both jurisdictions will have to decide on the issue separately, and the regulatory authorities in both jurisdictions will make separate submissions, it is not clear what will happen when the matter goes before the courts in the autumn.  It is also not clear <Col N="35" /> if it will reach the court by then.  It is my understanding, despite the best efforts of the President of the High Court to shorten the lists, there are still significant queues.  Has the Minister got a mechanism whereby he can jump the queue and put the scheme of arrangement prepared by Irish Life before the courts here or in the United Kingdom where there are still significant delays in having cases heard in the High Court?  Given that the Minister wishes to put this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas in the next week or so and enter the lists in the courts with a view to having the case heard between October and December it seems that the timescale is quite short.  At the risk of boring the Minister let me say that a number of issues arise which are appropriate to a White Paper, when, at least, people would see what the overall shape of things is.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the way in which the company will be floated. Those who fly the red flag will make reference to taking the company and handing it over to private capitalistic investors.  Again, the Minister should deal with this issue by way of a statement or a White Paper.  In what manner will the company be floated?  Will it be floated on the Irish stock market only or will it be floated on both the Irish and UK stock markets simultaneously or, as was the practice in the case of the larger floatations in England, will tranches be distributed around the world with 5 per cent in Tokyo, 10 per cent in Wall Street, 3 per cent in Hong Kong and so on?  The Minister's attitude to the sale of shares is not clear.  Will the sale of shares be confined to Irish nationals and institutions?</P>
    <P>That is a key question and if the Minister proceeds in this way he will not realise the full value of the company; its full value will be realised only on the open market.  This is a key issue and it has to be addressed.  Is it possible, in the Minister's view, for the Irish stock market to absorb a flotation of £300 million in the one week or will it have to be spread, as I said, to the United <Col N="36" /> Kingdom or further afield?  Furthermore, because of liquidity problems in the market and other technical reasons, would the Minister be in favour of an arrangement whereby the flotation would be met by way of instalments with one-third being paid now, another one-third in 12 months time and the final payment in 18 months time?  I do not know what the answer to that is but the question should be addressed.  Certainly all of us in this House who are debating the issue and who are expected to give the Minister statutory permission to proceed should have access to that kind of information.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister confine the flotation of the company to institutions or will there be a sale of shares which can be subscribed to by ordinary individuals? The Minister will hold 34 per cent of the company, roughly 10 per cent is in private hands already, half of which is the Irish Life pension fund.  In effect, only 5 per cent of the shareholding of the company is in private hands.  I welcome the provision in the Bill which allows the new company, Newco, to purchase 10 per cent of the shares in Holdco.  Irish Life are going back in and will take 10 per cent of the shares.  I persume Irish Life and the Minister will try to place some of the shares with friendly institutions, by friendly I mean non-predatory institutions. The Minister has indicated that no one institution or individual will be able to hold more than 15 per cent of the company.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister would spell out clearly how he sees the shape of the shareholding in the new company, how he sees the breakdown between Irish institutions and shareholders and foreign institutions and shareholders.  If he has information to the effect that the main Irish institutions and pension funds will be taking up, perhaps, 30 per cent of the total, that Irish Life will take a further 10 per cent that other insurance companies may take another 10 per cent and in the heel of the reel we will be down to 5 per cent or 6 per cent held by individual shareholders.  I have no doubt that neither the Minister nor Irish Life are <Col N="37" /> working in a vacuum.  I have no doubt that these issues have been discussed behind closed doors and that Irish Life and the Minister's Department have an optimum shape in their minds, after the flotation, as to who holds what.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the principle of this Bill, to a very large extent it is merely enabling legislation and the consequential issues are more important than the issues on the face of the Bill.  While some of the consequential issues have been dealt with by the Minister, many of the consequential issues are not touched on.  Both for reasons of information on this flotation, and because it is the first which will provide a range of precedents for subsequent flotations, we need more information.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the issue of the golden share, to which the Minister referred in his speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> Many commentators think that the 34 per cent share being held by the Minister after flotation is the golden share but of course it is not.  As the Minister pointed out, the golden share will be effectively a ministerial veto enshrined in the articles of association of the holding company.  I was surprised at what the Minister said in his speech because this golden share will no longer be an absolute hit.  The golden share, according to the Minister, will have a finite period of, perhaps, five years.  The golden share is, therefore, a temporary rather than a permanent mechanism to protect the interests of the State.  That is a significant movement and it is given out to us as a statement of intent by the Minister but what seemed, from the Minister's press statement that he was floating 56 per cent of the company, to be a firm commitment to a veto to protect the interests of the company, the policyholders and the Irish Exchequer, is now a temporary mechanism. Perhaps the Minister is right but I would like to hear the arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing to be said about the golden share is that any qualification in <Col N="38" /> the articles of a company which restrict the company makes the holding of shares by a private individual and institutions less desirable and, consequently, tends to reduce the value of the shares.  There is no point in buying out a majority shareholding in any company if somebody with a minority shareholding has a veto over everything you can do.  It stands to reason that the Minister must, in the area of the golden share, make a very careful pitch because he may affect the value and the attractiveness of the flotation by being over-protective and over-eager.  It seems that the Minister for Finance will put certain provisions into the articles of association of the holding company. These provisions will allow the Minister a veto over certain undefined areas of activity for a certain period.  He suggested this period might be five years.  With respect I think this is very fudgy altogether, and I would like him to spell out the issue and to what extent the national interest can be protected by the golden share mechanism, as this is one of the key issues for all of us.</P>

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> In relation to the issue of the golden share I quote from the Minister's speech as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government acknowledges the importance of Irish Life and the investments it controls.  It is essential that <Col N="39" /> Irish Life should retain its Irish ethos and its local base.  To maintain this ethos and to avoid unwelcome takeover of the company, provisions will be included in the Memorandum and Articles of the new holding company to limit the percentage of shares to be held by any one private shareholder, or consortium of shareholders, to not more than 15 per cent of the total share capital.</P>
    <P>That is fine, that is clear.  We know what the Minister's intention is and I presume he will not have any problem such as they had with Jaguar in the United Kingdom.  I presume he will be even handed between Irish nationals and members in other Community states and that he will have no problem with the ceiling on the shares. That is not the issue I am addressing.</P>

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> It is the next part of the Minister's statement I am addressing where it is stated that:</P>
      <P>A special share will be held by the Minister for Finance to enforce this limitation and the arrangement will continue in place for at least five years after flotation. </P>
    </Speaker>

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> That is putting a finite limit on the holding of the golden share or the holding of the veto. There would be no necessity to mention five years if it was the Minister's intention to have a permanent arrangement whereby he could exercise control indefinitely over the future of the company. The only reason five years is mentioned is that the Minister is now informing the House that this golden share is more likely to be a temporary arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick-East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;than a permanent arrangement, and consequently we would like more information on this issue.  I know there is a long tradition in the Minister's party of legislation by kite flying.  That kite is now up in the air and the Minister is asking the question: &ldquo;Would I get away with confining this to five years.?&rdquo; If he wants an answer from me he had better be more forthcoming with the information, because as it stands it does not look great. I understand the reason it is included is that he might frighten off the investors if he said he would have a veto over the running of the company by the person with the 34 per cent of the shareholding and this veto will last indefinitely.  Once the Minister is limiting the total shareholding of any individual or company, or consortium of shareholders, to 15 per cent, he has got over that problem.</P>
      <P>In order to ascertain what the Minister is doing we must examine the purpose of a golden share.  If Irish Life were a company which had not operated under a commercial regime but, in effect, was like a Government Department going for the first time into the private sector, the golden share, would be very important for that reason.  Suppose Telecom Éireann was being privatised but, instead of privatising it at its present stage as a very effective semi-State organisation, there was an attempt to privatise it directly at the time when it was run directly by the civil servants in the Department of Communications, there would be a very strong case for a golden share for a long time to protect a company unused to operating in the competitive commercial world; that would be a justification for so doing.  Irish Life do not need that protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1939 Irish Life have operated in the commercial world; their operations never have been interfered with by any Government.  Consequently, that cannot be the reason for its privatisation.  The reason must be to avoid take-overs; it must be a device to protect the company from predatory take-overs which would be against the interests of the company <Col N="41" /> and the national interest.  That is fine so far as that goes.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact when I stated my party policy at the beginning of the debate one of the conditions we introduced for the privatisation of companies in our election manifesto, 1989, under &ldquo;Institutional Reform: General Policy&rdquo; we had this to say:</P>
    <P>2. The terms of a Golden Share Mechanism whereby the State could guarantee the protection of certain stragetic national interests ...</P>
    <P>But this golden share mechanism which, in the Minister's press statement, was an absolute commitment to protect all our interests, is now becoming a temporary little arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;a temporary little arrangement for five years.  That brings me back to the point I have made already.  The Bill is an enabling one from which we are now expanding on a nod and wink basis whereas what we need is a White Paper in which all of the issues would be laid out in full.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>The company is in favour of this arrangement which I believe will be generally welcomed.  This special, or golden, share arrangement will reinforce the interest being retained through the 34 per cent holding.  As Deputies will know, such special shares are a common feature of sales of State assets in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special arrangement of a golden share got into great difficulty in the Jaguar case.  I presume the Minister will so organise matters that he will not encounter the same difficulty here.  But certainly a prerequisite will be that he will have to be even-handed with all shareholders whether they be native or foreign, national or residents of the EC countries.  Any inhibitions which appeal to foreign shareholders must also apply to Irish shareholders.  I am still fascinated <Col N="42" /> by the movement which now suggests that the exercise of the golden share arrangement will continue in place for at least five years and, thereafter, will not be necessary.</P>
    <P>To turn to the provisions of the Bill with regard to staff, maintenance of employment, security and so on, I must say they are very welcome.  Probably they are unnecessary because I am sure all of that could be done by way of regulation anyway.  But the fact that it is written into the Bill I am sure will be a comfort to and will allay any anxiety on the part of staff.  That is no problem and I would support it.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister talked in terms of a shareholding being dedicated to the staff.  That is absolutely essential.  I would not support this Bill unless there was a commitment to allocate some of the shares, in a manner to be agreed by the company and the trade union representing the workers within the company, to staff.  At least 5 per cent of the total share capital should be allocated to the staff.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to a little point I made already: if one starts dividing up 56 per cent, if Irish Life are to take 10 per cent themselves &mdash; as they would be entitled to do under a provision of this Bill &mdash; give the staff 5 per cent, with various friendly institutions taking various tranches and then the other insurance companies who have already expressed an interest taking a tranche each, at the end of the day, the shape of the shareholding could be very acceptable to everybody.  But the Minister should come clean on these issues.  He should tell us here what arrangements are being put in place behind closed doors at present of which those of us who are expected to agree this Bill are not being made aware.</P>
    <P>Certainly the staff should be facilitated. One of the great problems in the growth of the State sector in this country has been the inadequate compensation to key staff members and all the problems arising therefrom: between the Devlin and Gleeson reports putting caps on the remuneration of chief executives, then <Col N="43" /> the structures which ensure that nobody can get more than the chief executive, that there must be relativity right down the line to the hall porter, means we are left in circumstances in which highly successful State companies, such as Irish Life, are not in a position to reward their key employees.</P>
    <P>We must acknowledge that Irish Life have been enormously successful.  The insurance business is a people-centred one &mdash; there is no doubt at all about that &mdash; and it is the people in the company who have made it such a success and it is they who should be rewarded.  This Bill affords an opportunity to reward them also by having shares in the company they have built into one of the great successes of the State sector here.</P>
    <P>There is no point in giving staff shares unless they are allocated to them in a tax efficient manner.  There is no point in holding shares for the sake of having paper in the blue jug on the dresser.  I am sure it is the Minister's intention to put a scheme in place to allocate at least 5 per cent of the shares to the employees of Irish Life, done in a fashion which will allow them realise those shares in a tax efficient manner.  Perhaps the Minister would address that issue also when replying.</P>
    <P>I might deal with a point now not very relevant to the major issues in the Bill but which is a source of annoyance: who thought up the crazy new names?  Could there be anything as inelegant as talking about Holdco, because it is the holding company and Newco because it is a new company?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> But they appear in the definition section of the Bill.  I can appreciate that, naturally enough, when civil servants and employees of Irish Life were organising events, they used shorthand.  But is the Minister saying that, when the flotation comes, it will not be a flotation in Holdco Holdings?  The Minister will have to hire <Col N="44" /> the Taoiseach's cultural adviser, Mr. Cronin, at a rate of £117 a day for at least a fortnight to think up more elegant names for the new companies.  At present Holdco does not have a great ring to it but we might get used to it; Newco does not have a great ring to it either.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The trouble about the working titles is that they are written into the only legislation which will come before the House in the course of this flotation.  Since working titles happen to be the statutory titles, it will be difficult enough to have any other titles for them.  I am sure the Minister will deal with this as well in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with the main issues.  I will summarise briefly what my attitude is. First, we have been pressing for this, as a party, for a long time.  When we were in Government we took the first steps, with the agreement of the Labour Party, to examine the situation.  The first Private Members' motion after the change of Government was on the privatisation of Irish Life.  It was in my name and we strongly advocated in 1988 that this would be done; and we support the flotation of shares in Irish Life.  It is absolutely essential for the future of the company that the capital would be restructured in <Col N="45" /> this way, and it is absolutely in the national interest as well that a company which has been so successful would provide some direct benefit for Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Where I part company from the Minister is in regard to the manner in which he is proceeding.  There is a necessity for far more detailed information to be provided because this enabling legislation which allows the Minister to proceed is very much the tip of the iceberg.  The main issues will arise in the courts and in the course of the flotation and we have very little information from the Minister on these matters.  I advocated that the Minister would produce a White Paper and we could debate that in the House in the autumn when all the issues would be put before us.  Whether by way of a White Paper or some other mechanism I would ask the Minister to produce a detailed document addressing all the issues and give us a commitment that we can debate that detailed document here in this House in the autumn before these matters go before the courts in the UK and in our own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I would like to finish with some questions which the Minister might deal with. What is the position of the minority shareholders at the moment under the new arrangements?  Will the minority shareholders, for example, be able to exchange their shares in Irish Life plc for shares in Holdco, and, if so, what provision of the Bill enables them to do so?  Certainly the Minister's right to do this is enshrined in the main sections of the Bill but I cannot &mdash; and it is probably my own lack of perspicacity &mdash; identify where the Bill empowers the people who hold the 5 per cent minority shares, and indeed the Irish Life Pension Fund which holds 5 per cent as well, to exchange their shares for shares in Holdco.</P>
    <P>The next issue is whether I am right in saying that the provisions which empower the Minister to buy and sell shares in the holding company apply to all the shares which he will hold in the holding company and that there will be no necessity at any future date, if the Minister decides to dispose of the 34 per cent which he holds, <Col N="46" /> as well as the 56 per cent that he holds, to return to this House to get any kind of parliamentary permission to proceed.  It seems that the Minister is now taking power to himself which not alone gives him the right to sell the 56 per cent, which is his stated intention by way of press statement, but to sell the whole lot if he feels like it.  It seems the Minister is empowered to sell the whole caboodle without coming back here or even telling us what he intends doing.  Would it be the Minister's intention to do that at the same time as the provision for the golden share no longer applies at the end of five years?</P>
    <P>That is the situation as I see it.  I have serious doubts about the procedure being adopted, that we should be debating such a key issue with whatever is the polite name for a guillotine motion hanging over us.  I would prefer to have an open-ended debate.  I have had plenty of time to state my views on Second Stage but this is the kind of debate where there are many people who would like very much to state their views on it but they will not have the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will be supporting the Bill on Second Stage when the question is put at midnight tonight.  I would like the Minister to seriously address the points I have made about how it will proceed in the autumn.  To a large extent this is a Second Stage Bill.  It is the principles that are important.  I do not see major issues arising on Committee Stage in regard to what is in the Bill.  Major issues do arise from what flows from the Bill, however, and I would like the Minister to see if he can meet my request to have a full debate based on detailed information on all the issues that flow from the Bill when we reach phase II of the process and the actuarial report goes before the courts and when we reach phase III of the process and the actual flotation takes place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that the people of Ireland have to take note of on this issue is that the Fine Gael Party agree with the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats that this very fine major asset which belongs to them is to <Col N="47" /> be disposed of and sold off after all these years of building up.  I have made the point on many occasions in this House, and indeed outside it, that on all crucial matters affecting the economy of this country, Fine Gael hold exactly the same views as Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  That is clearly highlighted here this morning by Deputy Noonan's contribution.</P>
      <P>I want to put the Labour Party position on the record right away.  We are totally opposed to this measure.  We are totally opposed to the principle behind this measure.  We regard this as a sell-out rather than a sell-off, a betrayal of the true Republican ideal that Fianna Fáil pretend to aspire to in this day and age. It is an outrage in what it intends to do.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of sham being talked in this House here this morning by the Minister and by Deputy Noonan, as much sham as I have ever heard contributed in this House.  Let us deal with one aspect first.  This nonsense of talking about this measure as a restructuring for Irish Life should stop.  Let us get away from these euphemisms and call it what it is.  It is a privatisation measure to sell off the fine public asset of Irish Life to the capitalist backers of the big parties.  Let us stop this nonsense about restructuring.  Restructuring has nothing whatsoever to do with it.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to every word that the Minister has said and that Deputy Noonan has said.  I have read the material and I have read such reports as are available on it.  I find the arguments put forward very unconvincing.  They are put forward with such lack of enthusiasm or confidence that I doubt if there is any real belief in the arguments being put forward.  The arguments are just a colour and a sham to try to give a cloak of respectability to what is really going on behind the scenes.  I would say to Deputy Noonan that there is plenty going on behind the scenes.  There are plenty of ready-up operations going on and plenty of people in institutions will become rich very quickly indeed as a result of what this House is discussing here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> The whole issue can be encapsulated in two of the statements made by Deputy Noonan which have their mirror image in the Minister's own statements.  The Minister said that Irish Life has to be sold off to the private sector because at present they are locked in a structure that does not allow them to expand.  This poor little company, struggling, losing money, cannot expand, and are in great difficulties. On another occasion he said they are hand-cuffed.  You would imagine the debts had built up and that the company were going into liquidation.  What a load of rubbish.  About three minutes later the Minister said the company have gone from strength to strength in the past decade and it is one of the great success stories of the last 50 years.  Which is it? They cannot be so locked in and hand-cuffed that they cannot expand while at the same time be one of the success stories of the last 50 years.  This is the kind of double think and sham that is being put before the House this morning.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to say the company have not been allowed to expand.  They have expanded hand over fist and have done magnificently.  They have built up their business, assurance, insurance, property development and all kinds of commercial activities.  They have built up massive assets running to millions of pounds over the years.  They have done brilliantly and it is nonsense to say they cannot expand. The Minister knows they have expanded brilliantly, and that is why the private sector want to get their hands on it.  If they were doing badly, we would not be hearing about Holdco or Newco today. It would not be proposed that the company be handed over in Thatcherite fashion to the private sector who are waiting to get their hands upon it.</P>
    <P>Another attempt to pull the wool over the people's eyes is the fact that the company have not produced much by way of dividends, having regard to the very valuable holding the country has in Irish Life.  The Minister is a businessman who build up a successful business and he knows the score well enough.  You can build up a business in varying ways.  If you wish, you can pay the shareholders <Col N="49" /> a dividend out of your profits and carry on with your existing capital or you can plough the money back into the business so that it will build up and expand in an ever-increasing way.  That is what Irish Life did.  They ploughed back their profits using the best techniques and skills of commerce in an extraordinarily successful way.  They ploughed back their profits year after year, resulting in the very fine multi-faceted company Irish Life are today.  That is the reason they have 1,800 employees.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, or any previous Minister, had decided to slow that down in some way there was nothing to stop him doing so.  He has a 90 per cent shareholding in the company.  When annual general meetings of Irish Life are called there is nothing to stop the Minister saying it is time we got more out of this company, and that we ploughed back a bit less, that the company pay a dividend of £X million and put that into the Exchequer.  It is debatable whether it is a good idea to do that or if the money should be ploughed back into the company. The Minister can do that at any time.  He should not come into this House and eschew the argument that we have to sell off and realise our asset because we have not been getting enough by way of dividend.  There is nothing to stop the Minister having any dividend he wants out of the company by the exercise of his 90 per cent fully-controlled shareholding. He could have done that at any time, and he can still do so if he retains control of this company.</P>
    <P>What is so clever about having a fine asset and saying we are going to sell it off and transfer it into a once-off cash injection at considerably less than its worth?  You do not gain anything when you sell off a very fine productive asset and take the cash.  You are transferring one asset to another, and nothing more.</P>
    <P>With the commencement of the debate in the Dáil today, the general argument about the privatisation of State assets in Ireland moves to centre stage.  Let us be clear about this.  The only purpose of this Bill is to enable the State to sell Irish Life to the private sector.  The Government's <Col N="50" /> decision in this matter and the decision made by the Dáil on this Bill will be one of fundamental principle.  It is entirely unacceptable in that context that this debate is taking place in the absence of so much vital information about this company, about the principles involved and the consequences of change.  In effect, this House is being asked to take on trust that the Government's intentions in the matter are entirely honourable.  There is adequate evidence available which ought to make us deeply suspicious of the Government's intentions.  For that reason, before dealing with the issues of principle involved I want to put the following on record.</P>
    <P>In 1986 and 1987 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, developed an interest in this subject, specifically the privatisation of Irish Life.  I have in my possession a note of a meeting which took place in Irish Life on 11 December 1986 between officials of the Department of Finance and officials of the Irish Life company.  In the course of that meeting the valuation of the company was discussed in some detail.  The point was made at the meeting that &ldquo;as regards valuation, the company have at present about £200 million of free reserves over the solvency margin which would be allocated between policy-holders and the company&rdquo;. I have also in my possession a letter written by an official of the Department of Finance two days earlier, on 9 December 1986.  In that letter the official stated:</P>
    <P>In recent years the company has generated substantial profits on its overall business and it was possible to declare an actuarial surplus which gave a reasonable return on the funds of the with-profits policies and sustain a growth in dividend payments while simultaneously accumulating significant hidden reserves.  As a result, the company now has hidden reserves of the order of £300 million which it will shortly be obliged (by EC regulations) to disclose in its accounts.  In the normal course of events, such <Col N="51" /> reserves would be regarded as shareholders' capital, but because of the rights granted to with-profits policy-holders in 1971, the question of whether they have a claim on those reserves arises.</P>
    <P>These two quotations, which I am quite sure are available to the Minister, raise serious question marks about the value of this company.</P>
    <P>On 10 January 1988, for instance, the chief executive of the company was quoted in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> as placing the value of the company at between £100 million and £200 million. An analysis in the <i>Sunday Press,</i> on the other hand, on 31 January 1988 said the State was unlikely to get more than a few million pounds for its shares.  On 13 March this year, after the decision had been announced, the general speculation in the press was that the value of the company was around £250 million.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> on the same day, even though sources were estimating that the sale of the company could raise £300 million, the chief executive of the company was quoted as now admitting that there were about £500 million in reserves.  This brings me to the point of this nonsense about privatisation being essential for the company to expand.  Mr. David Kingston, the chief executive of the company, has been quoted as saying on many occasions and confirming that the company have £500 million in reserves and as such the group have no immediate need for funds and it was unlikely to tap the market for funds for up to three years after its flotation.  What is all this about the great need of privatisation to enable the company to expand?  The reserves are more than adequate for any expansion they would want to undertake and it is unlikely they would look for further funds for up to three years after flotation.  Privatisation is not a prerequisite for getting extra funds.  That is another canard.</P>
    <P>There is a clear pattern in this speculation which we have seen in other countries.  In Britain public companies have been routinely sold off at less than <Col N="52" /> their value and speculators who were in on the ground floor were able to make a killing within days of trading their shares. It is clear that this House is being asked to approve the privatisation of Irish Life without being given any clear idea of the value of the company or the sale price. As the elected representatives of the people we are the owners of that company. It is absolutely scandalous that we should be asked to make a major decision of this kind without any information about the implications of the decision for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked whether the Minister will be entitled, following the enactment of this legislation, to sell the entirety of Irish Life.  The answer is yes. The Minister will be able to do what he likes with all the shares the State owns in Irish Life without the necessity of coming back to this House for permission of any kind.  What he is undertaking to achieve is mind boggling.</P>
    <P>This is not a privatisation Bill; it is a Bill by which the Minister arrogates to himself alone the right to do what he would wish with all or any of the shares of Irish Life.  He could sell the 34 per cent as well in whatever way he wants.  There is no provision for coming back to the House for authority.  He is not telling the House what price he expects to get, yet he seeks the imprimatur of the House, which Deputy Noonan and Fine Gael are happy to give.  He is to be given power to sell off all the State shareholding in Irish Life without referring to this House with regard to the sale price or the proportion of the shares.  He is taking the power with the consent of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats to do all that upon his own imprimatur.  This House will be finished with the issue when the Bill is passed by the Dáil.  The elected representatives here will have no further say in regard to the sale of Irish Life. There is no second chance.  The power that rests with the Dáil will be handed to the Minister for Finance who will have no further recourse to this House in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has been a businessman in his day.  I can well imagine <Col N="53" /> his reaction if we proposed to sell his business without any valuation being made and without any indication of the sale price.  Because the Minister has a reputation as a successful businessman I know he would not agree under any circumstances to sell his business without knowing its worth and what he might realise from the sale.  Yet that is precisely the decision he is asking us to take in respect of one of the largest and most profitable State assets.</P>
    <P>If we were to realise as much as £300 million from the sale of half the State shareholding in this company, that would value the company at around £600 million, but Irish Life have reserves of £500 million or more.  They have 40 per cent. of the Irish insurance market and one of the biggest property portfolios in these islands.  They have substantial institutional shareholdings in a large variety of major enterprises, including the two largest banks.  How can a company with that list of assets be worth no more than £600 million?  Why are we not being told the truth on this issue?</P>
    <P>That is only one of the principles involved in this debate.  The central issue is the privatisation of the assets of the people and their sell-off to private investors. It is worth recalling a speech made by the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, during the AIB-ICI affair when he said that his aim was to protect the interests of the taxpayers and ensure that the taxpayers were not compelled directly or indirectly to assume responsibility and to pay the bill for something which was not of their making and for which they had no responsibility.  He said that if a mistake is made involving major losses then those losses could and should be borne by the private financial sector and not by the taxpayer.  It would be an absurdity, he said, an unacceptable injustice and totally ridiculous if the general public, the great majority of whom have never benefited one iota from banking profits, were asked to step in and take up an additional burden because of someone else's mistakes.  Deputy Haughey said the taxpayer had no responsibility for the matter and would <Col N="54" /> not have benefited one whit if the acquisition of ICI by AIB had proved a complete commercial and profitable success. In such circumstances, he said, nobody would have come here with a piece of legislation seeking to provide that those profits would be applied to the benefit of the Irish taxpayer or the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey's concern then was to ensure that the taxpayer did not suffer as a result of grievous banking mistakes but where is his concern now?  Why is he not moving now to protect the taxpayer and to ensure that the taxpayers' interests in Irish Life are fully protected?  Why is the Taoiseach allowing a position to be connived at where Irish Life will be sold off to the highest bidder, in all probability for significantly less than its true value? Can this really be the same Taoiseach whose photograph appears in full colour at the beginning of a document called <i>National Recovery &mdash; The Next Phase,</i> the manifesto on which Fianna Fáil fought the last election?  Page 28 of that document deals with commercial State enterprise, in bold type it states and I quote:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will encourage the development and expansion of State companies, if necessary in joint ventures, so as to create wealth and sustain employment.  Fianna Fáil remain fully committed to the maintenance of a viable and profitable commercial semi-State sector, in providing vital services. The strategic value these companies can assume has been underlined by recent events...</P>
    <P>One used to think that Fianna Fáil stood for something, and if nothing else, they stood for a commitment to the development of Ireland.  It is clear now, surely, that Fianna Fáil threw out more than one core value when they entered coalition with the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>On the one and only occasion on which the principle of privatisation was discussed in the Chamber in April 1987, the then Minister for Finance, now Commissioner Ray MacSharry, firmly set his face against the concept and dismissed the whole notion as ideologically motivated, and not in the interests of the <Col N="55" /> development of the economy.  The motion before the House on that occasion &mdash; ironically, a Progressive Democrats Private Members' motion calling for an accelerated programme of privatisation &mdash; was soundly defeated.  In other words, on the only occasion on which this House has discussed the principle of privatisation, it was rejected.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> ostensibly, is towards the development of a dynamic contribution from the State sector to job creation and the modernisation of the economy.  There is not a word in that programme which could lead anyone to believe that the Government which drew it up had any interest in privatisation. The Fianna Fáil-PD Programme for Government entitled, In the National Interest, not only reaffirmed the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> but went on to comment on commercial State companies and to say that the parties were, and I quote:</P>
    <P>committed to the maintenance of a viable and profitable semi-State sector. Any changes in the ownership structure of particular State companies will only take place if it is in the public interest, and in the best interest of the company and its employees, and following consultation with the Social Partners.</P>
    <P>Even then Irish Life was exempted from this promise &ldquo;as the process was already underway&rdquo;.  That process appears to have included the commissioning of a number of reports, none of which has ever been published, not even the terms of reference given to the consultants have ever been published.  We do not know the extent to which the consultants ever inquired into the welfare of the company or of its employees; what value they put on public interest, what process of consultation with the social partners they recommended; or any of the other issues which the Government apparently deemed to be important.  We may not <Col N="56" /> know, but we can guess just how much priority was accorded to these issues.</P>
    <P>The issue of privatisation, which is now being intensely discussed behind many closed doors, is of fundamental importance. It is impossible to make decisions about privatisation without deeply affecting the national interest, and yet a great many of these decisions are going to be made without the slightest involvement of the public at large.  There is a number of issues involved in the privatisation debate.  It often seems to me that the public good is the last issue on the agenda to be discussed but these issues must be addressed before any rational decisions can be made on the subject and certainly before the public can be assured that their interest is being served by a privatisation programme.</P>
    <P>To listen to many of the commentators on this subject, one would almost believe there is no point in raising one's voice about the subject.  A culture has been growing up in the financial press and in the pubs frequented by business gurus, to the effect that privatisation is the only sensible way to approach the development of State companies.  They proclaim that all right-thinking people will readily agree that it is nonsense for the State to be holding on to valuable assets when they could be offset against the national debt or sold off in order to reduce taxation. What these so-called independent experts never talk about is the large fees to be got for advising and consulting with the State about these matters.  Ever since the good people in NCB were paid more than £500,000 to advise the Government to sell Tara Mines to Outokumpu, the fashion for consulting about privatisation has grown.  There are huge question marks about the reason that fee was paid in the first place, especially when anyone with eyes to see could have told the Government that once the decision to sell had been made, there was only one company that made any sense as a customer.</P>
    <P>Since then there have been consultancy reports on State companies generally, on Irish Life, the Irish Sugar Company, the Great Southern Hotels and Irish Steel &mdash;<Col N="57" /> these are the ones we know of.  So far as we know, all of those reports would be saying roughly the same things, and there are two reasons for that.  First, no consultant worth his salt nowadays will say something that his paymasters do not want to hear; second, all of these reports were prepared from the base of anti-public sector bias.</P>
    <P>In the case of Irish Life, as I have said, four options have been recommended, but each one is a different method of privatisation.  No serious examination was given to the possibility of developing Irish Life into a strong player on the European insurance scene as a native owned Irish public company.  When will these reports be published?  When are the policyholders in Irish Life, the workers in Irish Steel or the farmers who supply the Irish Sugar Company to be consulted about their future or when is the tourist industry generally to be consulted about Great Southern Hotels?  When are the people as a whole going to be consulted?</P>
    <P>If a consultant prepared a report, for example, for somebody like Dr. Tony O'Reilly and told him that the only sensible way of dealing with his overdraft was to sell off all his most profitable businesses, I doubt very much if the consultant would ever work in Dublin again. That is what we have been told and when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the Irish people and we are not even being given an opportunity to express our views about all these consultants and their conventional wisdom.  The argument is being bolstered, of course, by some public company managers who feel constrained by the influence of Government Departments, and who long for the excitement of the private sector.  I have great sympathy for them in his dilemma and would argue strongly that when public sector control becomes public sector interference they have a case.  Surely the way to deal with this is hardly to swap the control of a Government Department for the control of a German multinational. If our public sector managers believe they are going to be better off in the private sector, many of them are going to have a rude awakening.  Over and above that it <Col N="58" /> was the spirit of public service in our public companies that was one of the main springs of our national economic development in the sixties.  We cannot and should not allow that to be frittered away in dreams of private sector glory.</P>
    <P>On this subject of national development, there is another side to the argument. How can our national interest be served by selling our insurance companies to the French; our steel industry to the Germans; the flagships of our tourist industry to the English; our sugar industry to the Americans or our aviation industry to the Arabs?  Surely the future economic prosperity of this country depends on the development of strong native owned industries.  How can we be so blind as to be willing to sell to the highest bidders without any regard for where the future lies?</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there are a great many issues involved in this whole subject but they are being swept under the carpet. The debate is being conducted only among the vested interests and the decisions are being made in secret.  The Labour Party fully endorse the call by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for a White Paper on this subject which would set out all the arguments and not just the self-serving ones.  I would go further and assert that the Government who sell off any of these State companies without consulting the people involved will have lost all sight of the need for accountability. Irish State companies are the property of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our past and our future are bound up with those companies and we are entitled to a say in what happens to them.  They are not the property of any Minister, consultant or entrepreneur; they are ours, and we demand to know what is going on before any final decisions are made on those issues.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Bill before us.  As I understand it, when the Bill is boiled down to its essentials, privatisation will proceed as follows.  Firstly, the present shareholding of the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State will be transferred to a company called Holdco which is being set up for this purpose.  Secondly, <Col N="59" /> Holdco, in turn, will set up a subsidiary called Newco which will take on board the trading activities of Irish Life Assurance plc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I hesitate to interrupt my colleague, Deputy Taylor, but I want to ask if the Irish language version of the terms Holdco, Newco, etc., referred to in the legislation will be circulated during the afternoon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirdly, by means of ministerial orders, the assurance business of Irish Life Assurance plc will be transferred to Newco and when this has been completed, Irish Life Assurance Company plc will effectively be wound up. Fourthly, the Bill will enable the Minister to dispose of his shares in Holdco whether in whole or in part at a future date, thus effecting the privatisation objective.  Finally, there are various provisions in the Bill to safeguard the continuity of employment and conditions in respect of employees transferring from Irish Life Assurance plc to Newco.</P>
      <P>There are a number of issues requiring clarification in relation to, for instance, the rights of policyholders and whether they will be adequately rewarded under the restructuring.  Clarification on these points will have to wait until the details of the ministerial orders are available. However, there are certain aspects which can be questioned at this time, as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, approximately 5 per cent of the shares of the present Irish Life Assurance plc are held by private individuals who receive them in consideration of shares held in old insurance companies which were amalgamated to form the Irish Assurance Company in 1938, which was the predecessor of Irish Life.  There seems to be no provision in the Bill where such shareholdings could be converted into shares in Holdco.  Does the Minister propose, under existing legislation, to <Col N="60" /> buy out such shareholders prior to the establishment of Holdco?  If so, the basis of valuation of such shares has to be clarified and there will be a cost to the State becoming the 100 per cent shareholder effectively in Irish Life Assurance plc.</P>
    <P>Second, if these private shareholders are not being bought out prior to the establishment of Holdco, there appears to be a most unusual situation in prospect where a company, Irish Life Assurance plc, will have 95 per cent of the shares held by a holding company, the balance by private shareholders and the subsequent liquidation of Irish Life Assurance plc will leave such shareholders, including Holdco, entitled to a cash residue for distribution by the liquidator on the winding-up.  That seems to be an extraordinary way to proceed.</P>
    <P>Third, apart from their life assurance business Irish Life have various other activities, for example, Irish Estates, which is a subsidiary company owning and letting apartments.  They have a controlling interest in Maguire and Gatchell Builders Providers, which may well have been liquidated but which had property interests close to the city centre.  Furthermore, there is the shareholding in Church and General Insurance.  It will have to be clearly established what subsidiary interests were in the beneficial ownership of Irish Life and not the policy-holders via, say, their life funds, as presumably interests controlled by life funds will be treated as the property of the policyholders and will form part of the transfer of the assurance business to Newco.</P>
    <P>Fourth, because of the substantial costs involved, relief is being accorded on the transfers of property from Irish Life to Newco.  It could be argued that there will be a substantial loss of revenue to the State by virtue of such relief being granted and that there are many companies in the private sector which could benefit substantially from a reorganisation in line with modern management structures but are precluded from doing so because of onerous stamp duties which would arise on the transfer <Col N="61" /> of property.  Indeed, it could be argued that part of the proceeds of privatisation could be derived by virtue of such stamp duties which the Minister proposes to waive under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Fifth, there is a specific provision in the Bill for an assurance company to hold shares in their own holding company, with such shares held as assets of their life assurance fund.  There is the usual stipulation that the shares must be traded on a recognised stock exchange.  There is an overall limitation of 10 per cent on the amount of shares in the holding company which can be so held.  However, there does not seem to be anything to prevent the new Irish Life, as an investment manager of a pension fund which is the property of the members-beneficiaries of such a fund, from investing in the shares of Holdco in the same way as the existing Irish Life Assurance plc are significant shareholders in various quoted public companies at present.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in essence, there could be a way around the 10 per cent ceiling and effectively the new Irish Life Assurance Company plc could control substantially more than 10 per cent of Holdco.  Would this defeat the object of privatisation or could it be a means of maintaining the value of Holdco shares?  While section 9 (2) seems to provide for an overriding control by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, this could not in practice extend to shares which were held on behalf of the pension funds managed by Irish Life which were not part of their life assurance fund.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the meat of the privatisation proposal.  The relevant aspects will be the various ministerial orders giving effect to the transfer from the present Irish Life Assurance plc to Newco and the method where the valuation of shares is established and how the policyholders' interests are being protected. For all these reasons we, in this House, are being asked to buy a pig in a poke where this Bill is concerned.  Leaving aside the issues of principle involved, there is no way this Bill should be allowed to pass into law until all those issues are <Col N="62" /> cleared up to the full satisfaction of this House.</P>
    <P>The late Frank Cluskey once said that a tree can be pruned for growth or it can be pruned for destruction.  In the last few years there has been extensive pruning of our State companies, in many cases forcing them into new eras of competitiveness and efficiency.</P>
    <P>The result of that operation has been two sided.  Many of the public companies are now much stronger and more efficient than they were ten years ago.  From a position where they were a drain on the resources of the Exchequer many of them are making a significant contribution now.  However, the process has been very painful not only for the people working in those companies but also in many cases for the communities in which they were operating.  The B &amp; I, Irish Sugar, Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus, RTE, Bord na Móna, the ESB and others, have all seen upheaval and dramatic change in the past ten years, some of it for the better but some of it for the worse.  What a shock for those companies to now discover that Fianna Fáil do not want them to be strong.  The more successful they become the more likely they are now to be penalised. Aer Lingus have lost key routes in order to provide a commercial life-line for a small private airline and we have all witnessed the disgraceful treatment meted out to RTE in order to secure commercial advantage for Fianna Fáil associates.</P>
    <P>Now, Irish Life, one of the most successful companies of all, are to be offered up on the altar of speculation.  Surely, there is justification for a great deal of cynicism among the people about all this. The taxpayers already contribute more than £1 billion every year to the private sector in tax breaks and other incentives. They already watch while more than £2 billion is drained out of the country each year by the multinationals private sector. They have seen 15,000 jobs disappear in the public sector under Fianna Fáil and a dramatic reduction in the quality of life of many of our citizens as a result.  On top of all that the Government they <Col N="63" /> elected are embarking on a programme of privatisation aimed at stripping the country of some of its greatest assets with no assurance that those assets will not be passed into foreign ownership.  The question they must ask is, who owns Ireland?  The answer has to be that every day Fianna Fáil remain in office fewer of our people have a stake in their own country.  That is the path Fianna Fáil, the sometime Republicans, and the Progressive Democrats, who were founded to stand by the Republic, are bringing us to.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the golden share issue mentioned by Deputy Noonan.  That Deputy was puzzled why a five year limitation period was introduced into the issue this morning by the Minister who said it was expected that the arrangements would continue in place for at least five years after flotation.  The reason is that at the very least there is a very serious question as to the legality under EC law of the golden share retention.  We must face the fact that there is a strong probability that Irish Life, after the manipulations by the Government and the Minister, will pass entirely out of Irish control, notwithstanding the Minister's golden share.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to face up to EC law on this issue.  We know from experience that he often treats EC law or rulings of the European Court with gay abandon. He tells us that he will consider the rulings rather than comply with them but, at the end of the day, it was the decision of the people to join the EC and the Minister knows as well as we do that we are bound by its laws.</P>
    <P>The issue of the golden share in privatised companies was examined in Europe.  In one case in Britain, that of Rolls Royce, permission was given to retain the golden share but that exceptional position arose only because of the security interest involved in the case of a defence contract, namely Rolls Royce. That was the only reason the golden share provision was validated by the EC.  Those I have consulted about this issue maintain that the golden share provision runs <Col N="64" /> counter to the general trust of EC competition policy.  It is almost certain that at the end of the day Irish Life will disappear as an Irish company.  If the Minister is concerned to retain Irish control of Irish Life he has a simple way to do that.  It is not a complicated matter and he does not have to devise a golden share scheme which is dubious under EC law. The Minister could retain at least 51 per cent control of Irish Life for the people of Ireland in his name.  That is all he need do if he wants to retain control of that company.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are opposed to selling even one share of the people's holding in Irish Life but if the Minister wants to joint venture with the private sector he can do so by retaining a 51 per cent control of the company.  In that event he would not have to worry about golden shares or any artificial arrangement which is of doubtful legal validity under EC competition law.  That is not what the Minister is doing in the Bill.  He is selling off the birth right of the Irish people on spurious grounds and the arguments put forward by him today do not hold water under any analysis.</P>
    <P>The idea that the present structure of ownership of 90 per cent by the people of Ireland inhibits the growth of the company is on any examination of the company arrant nonsense.  The company have grown magnificently in their 50 years' existence.  Where has the constraint been in that regard?  The company could continue to grow at a greater level with the new opportunities in Europe.  I am sure the Irish people would be proud to own a magnificent commercial insurance and property holding company that can expand here, in Britain and, after 1992, in Europe.  Deputies should not forget that after 1992 European insurance companies will come to Ireland.  Some come here by the back door and they will expand their operations after 1992.  Those companies will make inroads into the Irish insurance and commercial scenes. We need the strongest possible companies to resist that threat and to hold our own.  We need Irish companies to provide employment and give our people <Col N="65" /> the standard of living they are entitled to. Instead, we are letting foreign companies have Irish Life.  I have no doubt that foreign companies will be jumping in to get their hands on shares in that company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked the Minister what type of structure will be introduced and how it will work out.  What nonsense, what rubbish.  The Minister, according to a speech he made as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 March 1990, said that the intention was to sell the remaining shareholding in Irish Life in separate chunks. It was a very good phrase, and I forecast that those chunks will be very tasty morsels indeed for those who have the political clout to get their hands on them. Who is interested in knowing whether 10 per cent will go to Japan, 20 per cent to Paris or Zurich or 15 per cent to Washington? This company, owned by the Irish people, are doing well and have magnificent prospects.  They are making profits and if the Minister wants to tap into them there is nothing to stop him. He can send his nominee to the annual general meeting and declare a dividend if he wants ongoing funds from the profits. In the past, Ministers for Finance over the decades were well advised not to do that and to allow the profits to build up, with the result that the company is a magnificent resource today.  This kind of spurious argument does not hold water.</P>
    <P>We were also told that this has to be done because, otherwise, Irish Life could not get into the American market.  I will at least say this for the Minister, he dropped that one this morning.  On the other hand, it is interesting to note that Deputy Noonan, for some reason best known to himself, in support of the Minister, introduced that argument.  However, we know that that argument is totally without foundation as Irish Life already operate in the United States market.  There are facilities and arrangements in this regard and Irish Life &mdash; more power to them &mdash; have done extremely well in a number of investment and insurance operations in the United States.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that profits are largely locked into Irish Life and cannot be <Col N="66" /> distributed to shareholders.  Why did he make a statement like that in his speech when it does not stand up to any close examination?  Profits are not locked into Irish Life and of course they could be distributed to shareholders, namely, himself, and the people of Ireland, through the Exchequer, if a decision was made in that regard.  It is true that up to now the dividends declared were small, the reason is that the profits were retained to build up the company but there is nothing to stop larger dividends being declared if that is required.  Why put in that kind of spurious statement?  It is an attempt to cloud what is really going on, the sell-out for no good, sound commercial reason of this asset of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I also want to turn to this canard that money cannot be raised to expand Irish Life to enable them to go into bigger and better ventures unless they are privatised. As I said earlier, the chief executive, Mr. David Kingston, said that they have £500 million in reserves which they do not intend to use for expansion purposes. He said that it would be at least three years before the question of further expansion would arise.  If the Minister retains &mdash; as he says he will &mdash; 34 per cent and the question arises in, say, seven years time in relation to raising additional capital, what will happen?  Companies can raise capital in different ways.  It could be raised by loan capital without difficulty.  Irish Life could raise all the capital they wanted for expansion either by borrowings or by issuing preference shares or measures of that nature.  The Minister will retain 34 per cent and the company may decide that the method of raising capital they will adopt will be by a rights issue which would require capital subscription from the members of the company.  In that case, the Minister will still have to take up his rights issue in respect of his 34 per cent holding.  No doubt he will do that as it would be a worthwhile commercial objective.  The question then arises, if it is worthwhile putting money in in respect of a 34 per cent interest in the company, why is it not also worthwhile doing the same thing in respect of a 51 per cent or a 90 per <Col N="67" /> cent shareholding?  These arguments do not hold water from the commercial point of view as they are unconvincing in the extreme.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats Party should at least come clean regarding their intentions.  They should stop pretending that this is being done for commercial purposes because it would be good for Irish Life.</P>
    <P>Irish Life could not have done better. They performed magnificently in a position of public ownership.  There is something else behind it.  It is to get their backers on to the loot, to sell the company at a knock-down price as Mrs. Thatcher did in Britain.  The Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil speak deprecatingly about Mrs. Thatcher when it suits them but the measure before the House today is Thatcherism at its worst.  It is the idea that there is a capital gain to be made by the State from the sell-off.  These smart boys and companies waiting in the wings to get their hands on a chunk of the company know perfectly well what they are putting their money into.  If it is not a very good and smart investment they are not interested.  If they consider that it is in their economic and profit interest to take their chunks of the company it is certainly worthwhile for the Irish people to use it as it has been used over the last 50 years &mdash; to build up valuable assets for the Irish people and to be tapped into by them at the appropriate time.  It is a shabby operation and codology to suggest that this measure is required for good commercial purposes.  This should be seen by the Irish people for the sham it is. I hope the people will react accordingly at the appropriate time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, the purpose of the Bill is to enable the privatisation, either in part or in whole, of the uniquely successful Irish Life Assurance plc.  From what the Minister said it would appear that we may well be talking about the entire privatisation of this uniquely successful company.  He said that the restructuring &mdash; the euphemism used throughout &mdash; is to reduce the State's holding from <Col N="68" /> 90 per cent to 34 per cent through a sale involving a public flotation of the company's shares.  In the same paragraph the Minister conceded that this holding will be maintained, &ldquo;for the foreseeable future, but it will always be open to the Government to consider the size of their holding from time to time in the interests of the company and the wider public interest generally.&rdquo;  I do not think it is possible to signal more clearly than that, that it is this Minister's intention and this Government's intention, as soon as it is considered decent to do so, to let the ownership of Irish Life pass out of the hands of the State acting on behalf of the people of Ireland and, ultimately, the State will be left with a tiny stakeholding, if any.</P>
      <P>Privatisation, of course, is more a political question than an economic one.  The precedents in Britain show clearly that the winners from privatisation are those who bought the shares at artificially low prices, the management of the newly privatised companies whose salaries increased on average by 78 per cent, financial institutions, professional advisers and the Government.  The losers have been the workers in the companies and the general taxpayer and consumer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor spoke about the culture of privatisation that has now grown up. It is extraordinary that we have to follow on the end of these trends in Europe and Britain, so many years after there is adequate data available to us to examine. We have to ape Thatcherism at the end of the Thatcher era when it is patently evident to everyone that the experiment has not worked, that it has devastated one part of Britain and sold off the family silver in so many of the fine public enterprises in the UK.  The evidence is there and I will come to some of it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can suggest that Irish Life must be privatised in order to improve efficiency.  They are an outstandingly successful, well-managed company who hold strategically important stakes in a wide range of Irish companies.  The argument really boils down to the raising of money for the State's coffers.  In fact, the money raised from the sale of Irish Life shares <Col N="69" /> would make very little impact on the State's finances.  A great deal of misleading comment has been made on this point.  The very people who were responsible for the extent of the crippling burden of national debt repayments are the people who are now arguing that we sell off the family silver in order to make an impact on those repayments.  The impact is minuscule.  One such comment from a Mr. Gerry Moloney of Allied Irish Securities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>A spokesperson for Allied Irish Securities, in this instance a generic term is adequate because they all represent the same interests.  A spokesperson for Allied Irish Securities commented: &ldquo;Various figures have been quoted but the £250 million cash injection sems to be a not unreasonable ballpark estimate.  This is the equivalent of over 10 per cent of all income tax paid in this country last year&rdquo;.  The purpose of that was to imply that the sale of Irish Life would somehow allow the Government to cut taxes by 10 per cent.  That is a manifest nonsense and untruth.  The £250 million, if we take that figure, would be a once-off injection of funds arising only in the one year, saving the Government probably about £20 million in interest repayments on the national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Life control between 10 per cent. and 15 per cent of the shares in many of the major companies traded on the Dublin Stock Exchange.  More Irish companies will be subject to unwelcome takeover bids after 1992; the Minister has conceded as much.  Irish Life's position as a substantial shareholder in such companies as the two major banks could be of even greater significance in the future. Irish Life has had a criticial role in deciding takeover battles in the past.  The Irish-owned Roadstone Limited, for example, fought off British Ready Mix for control of Cement Limited and more recently <Col N="70" /> they were centrally positioned to influence the outcome in the case of Irish Distillers.</P>
    <P>In other ways the privatisation of Irish Life would have a detrimental impact on the Irish economy.  The capacity required to purchase shares in Irish Life will reduce the funds available for other uses. In Britain the £5.5 billion sterling offered for the Trustee Savings Bank shares was accompanied by a drop of £800 million sterling in building society deposits. Similarly, a flotation of Irish Life shares is likely to be accompanied by withdrawals from unit-linked funds and building societies and it would leave less money in the market for investment in other Irish companies.</P>
    <P>As recently as 1980 the then managing director of Irish Life.  R. P. Willis, stated explicitly, and I quote: &ldquo;If we didn't have a sense of being Irish and if we had total freedom we would move more money out of Ireland&rdquo;.  The privatisation of Irish Life would inevitably mean that some of their shares would be bought by foreign companies and financial institutions and they would eventually be taken over if they were successful or, alternatively, if they were viewed as under-performing and therefore a good buy.  The statement of the chief executive, Mr. David Kingston, that it &ldquo;should be possible to safeguard the essentially Irish nature of Irish Life&rdquo; after privatisation is no more than a mere aspiration.  Privatisation has generally meant in the medium term that there are job losses.  The newly independent management under intense pressure to perform in the newly privatised company, will want increased profits at all costs.  It is generally not achieved by increasing revenue but by cutting costs and, in particular, labour costs.  The most effective way of achieving this goal is by job losses.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has claimed in various interviews and inspired leaks that one need not worry about the Irish people through the State having and retaining a major shareholding in Irish Life through this arrangement that he has suggested of retaining a golden share. Indeed, quite recently in the House in <Col N="71" /> answer to a parliamentary question from myself and at direct meetings with representatives of the ICTU and the MSF, the main union concerned in the company, the Minister reiterated his confidence that the golden share arrangements would be sufficient to guarantee the retention of that significant stake in Irish Life, and it would limit the size of individual private shareholdings after flotation and, therefore, safeguard against takeover attempts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 25 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>I consider that it is essential that the whole issue of social protection be brought to the forefront of EC Council business during the run up to 1992.</P>
      <P>There is a danger, that in pursuit of the maintenance of economic competitiveness in the Single Market, levels of social protection may be reduced in real terms.  This is particularly so, given the increased burdens which social protection systems in all member states will have to bear arising from the common problems they face, including high levels of unemployment, the ageing of the population and changes in family structures.</P>
      <P>The policies adopted by individual member states to deal with these problems in the years ahead could also lead to a further divergence in the already very different social security systems of member states.  This could have the effect of further exacerbating the imbalances in this area between the different regions of the Community and placing a brake on the freedom of movement of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Freedom of movement may also be impeded by the inadequacy of the existing arrangements at Community level for the protection of the social security entitlements of workers who move to other member states either to take up employment or, if unemployed, to seek employment.  Many highly skilled workers depend to a significant degree for their pension cover on occupational pension schemes and existing EC Regulations on social security do not apply to such schemes.  The protection afforded <Col N="75" /> by these regulations to migrant workers who are unemployed, in particular those unemployed for long periods, is also unduly restrictive.</P>
    <P>The Informal Council of Ministers for Social Security in Ashford Castle on 26-27 April 1990, which I hosted, afforded Ministers an opportunity to focus on the implications of the Single Market for social protection and to establish a consensus on what the priorities for action should be at both national and Community levels.  Broad agreement was reached on the importance of ensuring that: the completion of the Single Market will result in a real improvement in the living standards and levels of social protection afforded to all Community citizens; and that the future development of social protection systems in the Community contributes to its economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>The exchange of views made a significant contribution to the establishment of a consensus on the need for a strategy of convergence of social protection objectives and policies, if these aims are to be achieved.  This would involve the development of an agreed set of objectives for social protection, with member states being committed to the gradual introduction of appropriate measures, having regard to levels of economic development and financial capacity, to meet the objectives.</P>
    <P>Progress in achieving the objectives would be monitored at Community level. Arrangements would also be made to enable member states to exchange information and compare experiences on the effectiveness of their social protection systems in achieving the objectives. Such a process would greatly contribute to the evolution in a converging manner of systems of social protection throughout the Community in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Commission was encouraged to expedite the work in this area in consultation with the senior officials of the member states, with a view to bringing forward proposals before the end of 1991, in line with the commitments in this regard in its action programme, relating <Col N="76" /> to the implementation of the Community Charter of Basic Social Rights for workers.</P>
    <P>There was also broad agreement on the need to improve the co-ordination of social security systems with a view to eliminating all obstacles to the free movement of workers.  Priority will be given, in this regard, to the protection of entitlements under occupational pension schemes in the case of workers who change jobs and/or move to other member states.  The Commission was also encouraged to bring forward proposals which would provide that unemployed persons, who wish to move to a country with which they have close ties, may retain their rights to unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>The developments in the area of social protection which have now been initiated will have a major impact on tackling poverty at European level.  In addition, the third Community programme to combat poverty was launched in March 1990.  This programme will last for five years and has a total budget of 55 million ECUs.  Through the programme the Community is supporting 39 pilot projects, including large-scale model projects and smaller innovative projects. Three of the projects are located in Ireland, one in north-west Connemara, one in Limerick city and a smaller project in Dublin working with travellers.  The aim of the programme is to identify effective strategies for tackling poverty throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>As part of the 3rd programme I hosted a major EC conference in Galway in June on the role of voluntary or non-governmental organisations in delivering social services and tackling poverty.  The conclusions of the conference will be an important input in the context of the future development of the role of voluntary organisations in Ireland and in the Community.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister when he says that social security Ministers are operating in a hostile environment given the need for financial rectitude, but is it not the case that social <Col N="77" /> affairs were put on the back burner during the Presidency?  Can the Minister explain the reason that social affairs took up all of three paragraphs of the 39 page communique issued after the final meeting of the Presidency?</P>

      <P>As I explained in my initial reply on the social security and social welfare aspects of the work of the Community, the question of social security is now back on the agenda and we got agreement in principle to deal with this question in the run up to 1992.  At present the Commission are in the process of preparing a set of objectives for the Community with a view to bringing forward proposals before the end of 1991.  In holding the Informal Council of Ministers we provided Ministers with the opportunity to come together and make their views at this time known to the Commission. They welcomed that opportunity and I hope it will be followed up during the Italian Presidency.</P>

Will the Minister give a commitment to redouble his efforts?  Having regard to the major political changes in Europe there is a clear need to speed up the process to ensure that we will have something of substance on the social side to offer to the European worker in 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 5, 14 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the study on the financial consequences of marital breakdown which was recently published by the Combat Poverty Agency.  The study contains a clear and detailed analysis of how the statutory provisions governing financial support for separated spouses and their children work in practice.  The author obtained full co-operation from my Department in carrying out the study, particularly in relation to a survey of claims for deserted wives' payments on which some of the main findings in the study are based.  The completion of major parts of the report and its publication was made possible through financial assistance provided by the Combat Poverty Agency, who are funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>The support received by the author indicates the importance which a study of this kind has for social welfare.  There are currently over 15,000 deserted spouses receiving weekly payments from my Department and, in addition, allowances are paid in respect of over 27,000 child dependants.  It is estimated that total expenditure on the deserted spouses' schemes this year will amount to £67.5 million.</P>
      <P>Marital breakdown results in many cases in the family being deprived of the income of the main breadwinner.  For that reason such families receive, after the three month period, the same weekly social welfare payment as other families so deprived, notably the families of widows and widowers.  In addition, the same contribution conditions apply under social insurance and the same means conditions under social assistance to those who are deserted by the other spouse, as apply to those who are widowed.  Accordingly, the cover provided for families under the social welfare code against the consequences of marital breakdown is essentially the same as that provided in the event of widowhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study has shown that up to 20 per cent of claimants for deserted wives' payments do not qualify because they have either failed to prove that they were <Col N="80" /> actually deserted by their husband or that they made reasonable efforts to secure maintenance from him, or both.  I have already introduced major reforms to deal with these problems.  Parents who are left to look after child dependants on their own are the most vulnerable and the most numerous group in this regard.  Under the lone parents' allowance scheme, which will come into operation with effect from next October, all lone parents with child dependants will be entitled to a weekly payment, irrespective of the cause of the lone parenthood or the sex of the parent.  The study acknowledges that the introduction of this scheme is a progressive step and in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare in this regard.</P>
    <P>The desertion condition will now only remain for claimants for the non-means tested deserted wives' benefit and for deserted wives who have no child dependants.  The National Pensions Board are reviewing these schemes in the course of examining the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women to schemes of this nature including, in particular, schemes for survivors. The report of the board is expected to be completed later this year and I will consider what further measures are necessary in the light of the board's recommendations.</P>
    <P>One of the main conditions for entitlement to a weekly payment as a deserted or separated spouse is that the claimant had made and continues to make reasonable efforts to obtain maintenance from the other spouse.  The new liable relatives provisions will fundamentally alter the way in which this condition will apply in future.  At present in cases where the deserting spouse is mainly dependent on a weekly social welfare payment, the claimant is not required to seek maintenance from that spouse, as it is clear that he or she would not have sufficient income to provide such maintenance. However, in cases where the deserting spouse is employed or self-employed, claimants are normally obliged to institute maintenance proceedings, as this is the only means of determining whether <Col N="81" /> the deserting spouse has sufficient income to provide maintenance and, if so, to enforce payment.</P>
    <P>Under the new provisions officers of my Department will be in a position to obtain this information directly from the other spouse.  In addition, the other spouse will be required to contribute towards the cost of any social welfare payment which has to be made as a result of his or her wilful refusal or neglect to maintain the family.  In practice this will mean that my Department and the health boards, in the case of supplementary welfare allowance, will be assuming the major share of responsibility for ensuring that such spouses meet their maintenance obligations.  This will result in a significant reduction in the number of claimants having to institute maintenance proceedings</P>
    <P>A detailed report on the application of the new liable relatives provisions has been prepared by my Department and the administrative arrangements are being worked out at present with a view to the new provisions coming into force next October.  Further legislative changes are also being considered in consultation with officials of the Department of Justice which would involve more effective provision being made for the enforcement of court orders in relation to contributions due by liable relatives.</P>
    <P>I have been conscious for some time of the shortcomings of the existing statutory provisions governing financial support for the separated spouses and their children, as they apply in practice.  The major reforms in this area which I have introduced go a long way towards dealing with these shortcomings, in so far as they relate to social welfare.  My Department will be monitoring the effects of the new measures, in consultation with officials of the Department of Justice, with a view to establishing if any other changes are required to ease the plight of families affected by marital breakdown and to ensure, in particular, that they have adequate income support.  Full account of this important study will be taken in the course of the ongoing monitoring of the situation of the families concerned.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  He will probably agree with me that the report makes very sad reading.  It highlights also the horrendous inequality and subsequent poverty facing many women and their children as a result of marital breakdown. In the face of such incredible statistics would the Minister agree that only 30 per cent of maintenance orders are fully paid up, that 87 per cent of orders paid through the District Court clerk are not paid regularly, that 49 per cent are six months in arrears and that 28 per cent of orders were never paid, not even once, to the dependent spouse?  In order to overcome these difficulties would he agree with the Commission on Social Welfare and the National Economic and Social Council and support the need for the State to have the power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some of the questions raised are for the courts.  When the new liable relative provisions are in place &mdash; I hope to have them functioning in October &mdash; if it is established that the husband has been failing to regularly maintain his spouse it is envisaged that the Department will then use their <Col N="83" /> powers to directly pursue the husband to pay contributions towards the cost of the social welfare payment being made to the wife.  That will be a very important provision.  My intention is to ease the burden on wives and to make the situation much simpler from their point of view.  The wife may do better if her husband has a lot of money.  In any of the cases with which we are dealing there is not very much money involved but in cases where there is a substantial amount of money then it has to be determined in court.  I would prefer to proceed along the lines we are pursuing at present and see how we get on.  The pursuit of orders made by the courts is a question for the courts.</P>

Is it not a further fact that not one single maintenance order has been put into operation as a result of the power which he first assumed under the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1989?  Is he aware of and has he studied the Australian situation where only one in ten maintenance orders were paid in the past, but where, because of effective action, they reached the point whereby eight out of ten are paid?  Is the Minister serious about this issue or is it simply a repeat of last year's good intent where, after 12 months, we find he has absolutely nothing to show for it?</P>

      <Quest>the steps he intends to take to assist those on low pay, who are not in receipt of the family income supplement, to meet the extra cost of fuel, arising from the Government decision to prohibit the sale of bituminous coal from September; the reason the proposed £3 per week will not be payable until mid-October as the ban on bituminous coal comes into effect in September; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 32 together.  The additional fuel allowance of £3 per week which I am introducing for low income households in built up areas of Dublin is designed to compensate some 81,000 households for the additional costs arising from the ban on bituminous coal in these areas.  There is no such ban outside Dublin and the question of extending the additional allowance to persons resident in other areas does not arise.  The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal will come into effect from 1 September so as to ensure that it is effective in time for next winter. Payment of the additional fuel allowance will coincide with the period of the heating season under the national fuel scheme, namely mid-October to mid-April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from persons entitled to a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme, the new allowance for smokeless fuel will also apply to persons receiving short-term unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or disability benefit for at least three months and to recipients of family income supplements, provided these categories satisfy the other conditions for entitlement under the national fuel scheme.  In relation to family income supplement I have made significant improvements in recent years in the benefits available under this scheme and further measures, aimed at increasing the numbers entitled to payment under the scheme and the level of take-up, will take effect later this month. These improvements include substantial increases in the rates of payment and the introduction of a new minimum payment of £5 per week.  I am satisfied that the measures being taken to compensate those on low pay to meet the additional costs arising from the ban on bituminous coal in the Dublin area represent a very substantial package designed to protect <Col N="86" /> social welfare clients against the additional costs involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the improvements in the Dublin area are welcome would the Minister not agree that they create anomalies for the poor in the rest of the country who may also want to use smokeless fuel?  If the Minister agreed to use his offices to extend the free fuel allowance throughout the country there would be a beneficial effect on the environment and it would assist recipients of social welfare payments.  It would also help Bord na Móna to dispose of their massive stocks of smokeless fuel which could be channelled through the Department.  Would the Minister agree that that would be the right way forward to remove the anomalies between the poor in Dublin and the poor in the rest of the country?</P>

      <P>This is an allocation which will form part of the national environmental action plan.  It is in that context that the sum of £3 million was allocated to me, in addition to the 1990 provision of £28.1 million, for the national fuel scheme generally.  Therefore this year I will have the £28.1 million generally, plus the £3 million which comes under the national environmental action plan.  The question of covering additional areas within the country is a matter for the national environmental action plan.  I will certainly convey the Deputy's views to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.</P>

My reply is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; under the conditions set out in my reply.  For anyone in receipt of such benefit for over three months who comes within the terms of the <Col N="87" /> national fuel scheme the answer is a simple &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, once they comply with the other conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I must correct the Deputy.  I am not bringing in any regulation on 1 September.  I am making arrangements to extend the provisions of the national fuel scheme to cover additional people.  We are providing an extra £3 per week under the national fuel scheme for its duration.  The reason it covers that period is that it relates to the temperatures obtaining within that period &mdash; that is well established &mdash; from mid-October through to mid-April.  I can show the Deputy these some time if he wishes, if he is not familiar with them, but it is those temperatures on which the provisions of the national fuel scheme are based.  The Deputy is referring to the date on which my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, will bring in the order for the ban on the sale of bituminous coal which is 1 September.  That is a different matter.</P>

      <P>In view of the rather disappointing information the Minister has now given us in relation to disability benefit and unemployment assistance recipients and the extra fuel subsidy and in view of the fact that it will not be automatically available to all recipients &mdash; as he has clarified today &mdash; does this mean they will all be subjected to a means test or will have to apply to their local health centre, because I am sure the data in relation to &ldquo;other income&rdquo; is not readily available to the Minister?  What will be the mechanism to be applied in the case of those who will qualify for, apply and receive such benefit?  The Minister indicated on the last occasion on which we discussed this that it would be paid automatically with their benefit. How can that be if they are to be subjected to a means test?</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the national fuel scheme.  It was never anything other than under the terms of that scheme.  One would be creating a great distortion and be spending money in a very wild fashion if one were to throw it out to everybody who happened to be eligible for a social welfare benefit because, as the Deputy will know, some such people will have considerable additional income separately.  It was always a question of the national fuel scheme being extended to cover people who would not normally be covered by its provisions, for instance people in receipt of disability benefit in excess of three months who will be eligible under the terms of the national fuel scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I have read Professor McAleese's recent article in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> with interest.  Given the significant improvement in the Irish economy in recent years the article aims to examine the changes in Irish fiscal policy and how these have affected different sections of the community.  The analyses are based on the key economic indicators over the 1986-89 period, and on the increases in the incomes of various groups.  The article concludes that the process of fiscal adjustment did not involve a burden on any major sector of society, because, it is stated, the adjustment process led to growth rather than halted it.  The report therefore concludes that &ldquo;Ireland seems to have brought off a dramatic double; a significant adjustment in the country's fiscal balance combined with a resurgence of GNP growth and greater spread of the benefits of growth.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not consider it appropriate to enter into a debate on the merits of what is an academic economic paper.  I would say, however, that the analysis is at a broad macro level and to gain a full picture of the impact of the adjustment process on different sectors of the community would require further study, including detailed data on household incomes and living conditions.</P>
      <P>In relation to social welfare services the analysis refers to the percentage adjustments in social welfare rates over the period 1986-89, and documents the Government's success in implementing increases in rates, in many cases considerably in excess of the inflation rate.</P>
      <P>Over the period 1987-90, I have raised the personal rate of long term unemployment assistance by 41.5 per cent, representing an increase of 25.4 per cent in real terms.  This may be contrasted with an equivalent increase of 14 per cent in the period 1983-86.  Similarly, I have increased the minimum payment for child dependants from just over £8 per week in 1986 to a minimum of £11 in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increases of this order have contributed significantly to improving the living conditions of the poorer sections of <Col N="91" /> our community.  However, there is scope for further improvements.  I intend, in future budgets to continue my policy of focusing resources on those most in need.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Deputies that the Government's commitment, set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> to improve the position of those on the lowest incomes will continue to be the focus of our attention as the adjustments which have been made in the economy bear fruit over the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should say to the Minister that one can produce statistics to prove anything.  I would respectfully submit that the statistic advanced by his eminent right-wing professor would not confirm what we hear on the ground. Whereas the Minister has maintained incomes in the social welfare categories in line with inflation, would he agree that his Department and the Government have rendered it more difficult for people to qualify for some benefits for which they automatically qualified in the past, with fewer contributions?  In other words, entry into some of these categories has been rendered more difficult.  Furtheremore, would he agree that, since he assumed office, under this and the preceding Government overall spending in his Department in relation to GNP has been reduced by 1 per cent?  Therefore, I do not know how the professor arrived at these statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall expenditure of my Department is up rather than down. The Deputy is referring to the net position.  Obviously by including the self-employed the net position is changed as distinct from the overall position.  The amount paid to people is what constitutes the overall total.  The overall payment in 1986 was £2,513 million, and in 1990 it was £2,793 million.  The amount has been increasing while, at the same time, there has been a considerable improvement in efficiency and very substantial savings which have been ploughed back into the system, that is, a broad macro-economic study looking very much at the overall <Col N="92" /> picture.  We used the detailed research on poverty which was prepared as part of the second EC poverty programme.  That research indicated that certain groups in the community such as households headed by an unemployed person, parents with large numbers of children and lone parents are at risk of poverty. That is why I have been taking steps in recent budgets to improve their position in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the quality of life of the poor is affected by the actions of Government and various Government Ministers?  Will the Minister agree that while the Department of Social Welfare might have kept spending on those classified as in the poverty net up to a reasonable level, the effects on the quality of life in the fields of health and education for people on low incomes in local authority houses was disastrous and the proof of this is that 40,000 people have to emigrate annually?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne, I would like you to be relevant and brief and not make statements.  The Deputy should seek information rather than passing it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to agree with the Minister that his Department might have kept spending to a relevant pitch, but would he agree that the effects of the decisions of his other Government colleagues have undermined the quality of life and created greater poverty traps for the poor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The report points to the fact that in 1986 £1,154 million was spent on health and in 1990 the figure was £1,312 million.  That again is an increase. Over this period the overall economic policy has been to keep inflation low and we have succeeded in that.  In education the amount was £1,013 million and that has risen in 1990 to £1,303 million.  Taking these macro-economic indicators into account there is no doubt that the increased allocations have gone to those <Col N="93" /> sectors.  The report would not deal with how the money is spent within a sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer we are getting here is that the poor did not suffer.  What we are saying is that our information is that the poor have suffered irrespective of the figures the Minister can give.  It has been made much more difficult for the poor to qualify for benefits as a result of the actions of this Government and the Minister's Department.  The poor have suffered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The only figures available to the Department of Social Welfare were based on the 1988 income level for farmers.  Farmers who now have to apply for social welfare because they have no income are being assessed on their income in 1988.  They are not being <Col N="94" /> assessed on their real incomes this year. Can the Minister do anything about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. Since 1987 the position of farmers has been considerably improved by the removal of the rural rate, the levels of increase that have been given to farmers and a number of other measures.  If there is a special problem with farming, the system is geared to reflect that.  The assessment is normally based on the previous year's income but if there are special problems the system can adjust to that.  It would be a question of showing what the real situation is.</P>

      <P>The extension of the social insurance dental benefit scheme to dependent spouses, which I introduced in 1987, was opposed by the Irish Dental Association which advised their members not to sign the contract to operate the extended scheme.  Some 240 dentists to date have signed agreements to operate the extended scheme.  Discussions were held subsequently in an effort to find agreement with the association on the implementation of the extended scheme. A total of 18 meetings were held with the association between November, 1987 and March, 1989, when I introduced a package of improvements in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989 as part of their continued <Col N="95" /> opposition to the extension of the scheme, the association called on their members to discontinue providing certain treatments under the scheme.  As a result, a number of dentists are improperly charging patients fees for extractions, root canal treatment and dentures which are not in accordance with their contract.</P>
    <P>I met the association in January this year to discuss the action and to see whether an agreed basis could now be found for operating the extended scheme.  There have also been subsequent contacts at official level.  Within the last month there was a meeting at official level to clarify certain details regarding dental costs supplied to me by the association.  Since then my Department have been in correspondence with the association and a further meeting at official level is envisaged.  In the light of these discussions I intend to meet the association to discuss what further changes in the fee structure may now be justified.</P>

I want to give my support for the scheme for insured workers and their spouses but because the decision has been taken by the Irish Dental Association to extend their dispute with the Minister, the health of insured workers and their spouses is being affected adversely to an unacceptable degree.

      <P>The Dental Association have prepared costings which are currently being examined and discussions between my Department and the association will conclude soon.  Many dentists are still treating.  The idea is being put abroad that all dentists are making these charges.  Certainly a percentage of dentists are doing so, and that raises the question of the contract.  Under the terms of the contract I am empowered to take specific action against such dentists. Deputies will appreciate that while discussions continue with the Irish Dental Association I am reluctant to exercise these powers.  However, I cannot indefinitely permit the situation to continue whereby patients are being refused benefits to which they are entitled.  If this matter cannot be resolved through the current discussions with the association, I will be left with no option but to take the action against the dentists concerned.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister could stand indicted of inactivity and a total lack of industrial relations skills?  If he was a manager of an industry and he had not resolved a dispute after two years, he would neither have his position nor his industry.  Is it not true that he imposed a scheme on the dentists without agreement?  The net effect of his failure to resolve the issue has had the most serious consequences not just for those who were included in 1987 but for those who have been insured for a lifetime? These people cannot get basic dental treatment and are suffering as a consequence.  They will not go to dentists when they realise they have to pay for the service, which they previously received free of charge.  When is the Minister going to resolve this problem?  If he has no serious proposal to resolve it, would he consider referring the matter to his colleague, the Minister for Labour who has a long tradition of dealing with <Col N="97" /> matters like these?  How much longer will the Minister allow this position to continue?</P>

      <P>Because of the serious nature of the problem, will the Minister assure the House that if he has not reached an agreement with the Irish Dental Association next month, he will vastly expand the dental hospital services and recruit dentists directly into the health board system, using the vast numbers of clinics that are available throughout the <Col N="99" /> country, as a way of circumventing the obstructionist strategy of the Irish Dental Association?  The Minister might ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food how he managed, indirectly recruiting vets, to circumvent the actions of vets who were obstructing the bovine TB scheme.  The vets who were recruited directly were far more productive than those operating under the private veterinary system. Would the Minister consider that strategy in this case?</P>

In that case all workers outside the medical card scheme would be treated in the private market.  I take it that is not what the Deputy is talking about when he mentions the dental hospital.  I am anxious to take whatever measures are necessary to ensure a continuation of treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1990, provides for the phasing out of the arrangement whereby women getting widows pension, deserted wives benefit, deserted wives allowances or unmarried mothers allowance pay PRSI contributions at a lower rate than employees generally.  From April this year, these women pay PRSI at a rate of 3 per cent on earnings from employment.  Next <Col N="100" /> year, the rate will rise to 4 per cent and the following year the standard PRSI rate of 5.5 per cent will apply in all cases.</P>
      <P>In the light of this development I have provided that women getting these payments will be entitled to half-rate disability benefit, in addition to their pension, for a period of up to 15 months when they are out of work through illness. They are already entitled, where they become unemployed, to half-rate unemployment benefit which also applies for 15 months.  In addition, they will now receive the full PRSI tax allowance for which they were not previously eligible.</P>

      <P>The net effect is that a widow with three children on contributory widow's pension and earning £120 a week will receive £101 from the social insurance fund with effect from 27 July. The PRSI payable would be £3.60 and the reduction in tax, £2.64.  Therefore the net cost per week would be £0.96.  In addition, the disability benefit for 15 months is restored.  The cost of restoring the disability benefit for that period far outweighs the cost of paying the PRSI contribution.  That is why the Widow's Association welcome that move.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12, 20, 57 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics are not maintained in a form which would enable the information <Col N="103" /> sought in the first question to be provided. The value of free board and lodging enjoyed by claimants living at home with their parents is assessed as means in accordance with specific provisions of the Social Welfare Acts which provide that the means of a person for unemployment assistance purposes must take account of the yearly value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by him or her.  The requirement to take account of board and lodging has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants in different family circumstances, between applicants whose parents are well-to-do and those whose parents are in poorer circumstances.  The criteria are kept under continuous review.  Any concessions in this regard would have to be considered within a budgetary context.</P>
    <P>The person referred to as living in County Kildare returned from the United Kingdom and went to live with her sister and brother-in-law.  She renewed her claim to unemployment assistance on 5 February 1990.  Her claim was approved for payment at the short-term weekly rate of £42.00 less means of £20.60 based on an existing qualification certificate.  Following reinvestigation her means were assessed at £20.90 per week derived from the value of benefit and privilege of residing in her sister's home.  It is open to her to appeal this decision and have her case determined by an appeals officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the endemic and long-term nature of unemployment and the particular problem for young people, would the Minister not agree that at a certain age &mdash; we suggest 26 &mdash; a person should be entitled to social welfare payments in his or her own right? This would remove from adults who are suffering from long-term unemployment the humiliation of still being asessed as dependants of their parents, to whom they have to go cap in hand to get even spending money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of a minimum income for all, would the Minister not agree that it is unacceptable that teenagers who are not in receipt of any financial support from their parents should be left in the incredible predicament of having to decide that in order to eke out an independent existence they might have to leave the family home and thereby qualify for unemployment assistance? The social welfare code was not designed to break up families in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach to date has been to provide the additional money where it is most needed.  There are many other steps which could be taken were the money available.  The cost of abolishing board and lodging was examined in detail in 1981 and was put at £21.5 million.  The cost at this stage would be very much greater.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that women who give up paid employment outside the home to look after their children for a number of years are severely disadvantaged in claiming social welfare benefits upon their return to the paid workforce; his views on whether this is fair and equitable and in keeping with the constitutional guarantee to the family and to mothers in the home; the plans he has to change the regulations and remove this anomaly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for short-term benefits under the social insurance system two conditions must be fulfilled.  The claimant must have a minimum of 39 contributions paid since entry into insurance and must have a minimum of 39 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  Entitlement to pensions requires at least 156 paid contributions since entry into insurance plus a yearly average of paid or credited contributions.  The option of maintaining entitlement to pensions is also available through the payment of voluntary contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women who leave insurable employment to work in the home remain eligible for short-term benefits for up to two years after ceasing to pay PRSI contributions. In addition, those who have at least three <Col N="107" /> years contributions may apply to become voluntary contributors in order to preserve their insurance for pension purposes. The question of maintaining pension entitlements of people in this situation is one of the issues addressed by the National Pensions Board in their examination of pensions policy in the context of their final report.</P>
    <P>The present conditions for entitlement to short-term benefits are designed to ensure that claimants have a recent attachment to the workforce.  To award automatic credits to persons who have left the workforce for long periods and thereby qualify them for short-term payments would have major financial implications.</P>
    <P>The extension over two years ago of dental, optical and aural benefits to the dependent spouses of qualified insured workers has been a major recognition of women working in the home.  To date, some 154,000 dependent spouses have claimed treatment under the new scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if he applied a scheme to women who are forced to leave work to look after their family similar to his Department's interpretation of educational credits which apply to young people who work, then go back to school and take up work again, this could overcome the anomaly the Minister has just mentioned when women return to work, and give equality to the family?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I am examining this area and I have asked the National Pensions board to examine the longer term pensions aspects and, indeed, we are looking at this ourselves. I am concerned about this area and I will certainly be examining it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Has this area come up for discussion at EC level?  I understand that there is a wide divergence of treatment and countries such as Germany and France, for example, give much more <Col N="108" /> favourable treatment to women returning to the workforce.  Could we anticipate some positive benefit from the convergence of EC social schemes as a result of the deliberation referred to earlier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the aspects that will be considered in discussions between Ministers at EC level.  It has not been considered as yet but it is one of the subjects I want the EC Ministers to discuss so that we can share objectives in that area.  As Deputies know, some countries have very extensive schemes in place while others have none at all, and we are somewhere in between.  Deputies can take it that we will be looking further into this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 58 to 61, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the financial needs of families with children and I have made significant progress in recent years in increasing the level of social welfare payment to such families.</P>
      <P>Following on the achievements of the 1989 budget, improvements costing £216 million in a full year have been made in this year's budget.  These include an increase in the minimum child dependant payment from £10 to £11, the payment of child dependant increases until age 20 to recipients of long-term payments where the child continues in full-time education, a 5 per cent increase in the rate of child benefit and the introduction of a footwear and clothing allowance of up to £40 for families on social welfare. The tax exemption limits for low income families have been increased and a child-related allowance of £300 per child has been included.  Improvements costing £1 million are being made to the family income supplement scheme.  Deputies will recall that one of the main improvements last year was the introduction of a widowers' and deserted husbands' assistance scheme for men with children.  This is being built on this year by the introduction of a lone parent's scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus of recent budgets has been very much on the family, as the following examples of increases in this year's budget indicate: a couple with two children on long-term unemployment assistance will receive £105 per week, an increase of £8, while a couple with four children will receive an increase of £10 bringing their payment to £127; a couple <Col N="110" /> with four children on short-term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance will receive £120 per week, which is an increase of £11.10, while a couple with six children will get an increase of £13.10, and a total payment of £142; a lone parent under 66 with three children on an assistance payment will receive an additional £5.20 per week, giving a total payment of £93.50; a widow or deserted wife on a contributory payment with four children will receive a payment of £116 which is an increase of £5.10 per week.</P>
    <P>In addition to these substantial increases in payments for families with children, considerable progress has been made in recent budgets in streamlining the child dependant allowance payments &mdash; the number of these has been reduced from 36 to six.  I would like to assure the House that the Government will, as resources permit, continue to review and improve the position of families and thereby build on our progress to date, and this will include the examination of age-related child dependant payments, and of improvements in child benefit. As Deputies will appreciate, any such proposals would be costly and would have to be considered in a budgetary context. It is the Government's intention to extend child dependant allowances to all long-term recipients in respect of children up to age 21 who remain in full-time education.  The improvements in the last two budgets in this area have been steps in this direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply indicates quite clearly that he is going to do nothing about bringing in a tiered rate. In the absence of a minimum income for all, would the Minister not give a commitment at this late stage to introduce a tiered system knowing that to maintain teenagers is far more costly than maintaining babies, so that teenagers between 15 and 18 would be entitled to 55 per cent of the adult rate and those up to the age of 20 would be entitled to 70 per cent of the adult rate and this should be the direction that the Department's inspectors should take?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should give credit to the fact that the Government introduced a clothing and footwear allowance this year which is age-related and a payment of £25 is made to those in primary school and a payment of up to £40 is made to those at secondary school. This is an age-related payment and it is only fair that credit be given where credit is due.  In so far as other developments are concerned, these are matters for future budgets.</P>

      <P>The European Council met in Dublin Castle on 25-26 June.  I presided over the meeting with the assistance of my colleague, Deputy Gerard <Col N="169" /> Collins, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. A copy of the Presidency conclusions and related documents have been circulated to Deputies for ease of reference, and placed in the Library in the usual way.</P>
      <P>The Council took place against the background of major international change over the last nine months in Central and Eastern Europe, the USSR and in South Africa, which has reinforced the Community's determination to strengthen its role as a force for stability in the world.</P>
      <P>Our meeting was very successful.  We dealt with a major and substantial agenda and took important and far-reaching decisons:</P>
      <P>We agreed to a date for the Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union on 13 December.</P>
      <P>We decided to convene a parallel Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union to begin on 14 December.</P>
      <P>We reviewed and welcomed recent progress on completion of the Internal Market and set priorities for the coming period.</P>
      <P>We adopted a major Declaration on the Environment.</P>
      <P>We considered two major reports on the drugs menace and decided on the preparation of a European plan.</P>
      <P>We asked the Commission to urgently prepare proposals to assist in the restructuring of the Soviet economy.</P>
      <P>We welcomed the changes taking place in south Africa, but maintained a unified approach on sanctions, until there is further clear evidence of profound and irreversible change.</P>
      <P>We adopted declarations on nuclear non-proliferation, the CSCE, and the Middle East, and other international issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three main areas of discussion. First, this Dublin European Council represented an important advance in the construction of a new Europe.  The process of transforming the relations between the member states into <Col N="170" /> a full political and economic union took on a new reality and urgency.  The Council confirmed the strategy, first outlined at Dublin 1 in April, of bringing to completion by the end of 1992 the three basic elements &mdash; the full implementation of the Single Market, economic and monetary union and political union.  Having reviewed the preparations made, we fixed the date, 13 December 1990, for the Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union and decided to convene an intergovernmental conference on 14 December 1990 on political union.</P>
    <P>Secondly, keenly aware of the fact that the Community we are building must be for the benefit and well being of its citiznes, we dealt with aspects of concern to them.  The Council adopted a comprehensive Declaration on the Environment, laid down guidelines for action on the problem of drugs and organised crime and condemned racism and xenophobia.</P>
    <P>The third main area of discussion was the increasingly important area of external relations, particularly the current political and economic situation in the Soviet Union, the political changes in South Africa, the Middle East and the CSCE.  Our declarations on these represent important political statements by the Community and reflect the Community's growing influence in international affairs.</P>
    <P>Our ambitions for 1992 now extend far beyond the arrival of the Single Internal Market.  The goal of economic and monetary union has been confirmed and the preparations for it advanced.  The agreement to call an intergovernmental conference on political union adds the final element of a triple agenda to be completed by the end of 1992, an agenda which will require major political determination and effort to complete.  During our Presidency we have played a significant role in developing the concept of political union and the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference to shape it.</P>
    <P>The special meeting in Dublin on 28 <Col N="171" /> April placed Political Union on the forefront of the European agenda.  At that meeting the European Council confirmed its commitment to political union.  We identified three important objectives for possible treaty changes in pursuit of our commitment of creating a political union invested with the necessary means of action &mdash; strengthening its democratic legitimacy; enabling the Community and its institutions to respond efficiently and effectively to the demands of the new situation, and assuring unity and coherence in the Community's international action.  As a follow up the Council requested the Foreign Ministers to undertake a detailed examination and analysis on the basis of ideas and proposals put forward by member states to be submitted to the June summit.</P>
    <P>At an informal meeting at Parknasilla on 19-20 May the Foreign Ministers considered the issues involved and continuing their work in the weeks that followed produced their report which was considered as planned by last week's European Council.  A copy is annexed to the Presidency Conclusions.  Its main thrust is that the further dynamic development of the Community has become an imperative, not only in the interest of the member states but as a crucial element in establishing a reliable framework for peace and security in Europe.</P>
    <P>The aim of political union is to strengthen the capacity of the Community to act in areas of common interest by providing strong and democratic institutions.  The paper also makes it clear that the union remains open to membership by other European states who accept its final goals, while developing closer relations with other countries.</P>
    <P>The set of issues that will be addressed by the Intergovernmental Conference include the question of whether a further transfer of competence to the Community is needed; the concept of European citizenship; the institutional balance; the definition of subsidiarity; improved democratic accountability, including possible future involvement of <Col N="172" /> the European Parliament in the legislative process; the extension of majority voting, and improving the decision making capacity in the area of foreign policy, and the definition of the security dimension or the aspects of security that will be covered by the union.  This list gives some idea of the ground that will have to be covered.  Our specific Irish priorities and concerns have of course been taken into account in the preparatory work carried through under our Presidency.  During this period our interests have been best served by advancing the Community's agenda in a way that incorporates the concerns, concepts and proposals of all the member states including ourselves.</P>
    <P>The intergovernmental conference convened under Article 236 of the treaty will adopt their own agenda.  They will conclude their work so that there can be ratification by member states of the results of both IGCs on EMU and political union by the time of the entry into force of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>To anyone who might be tempted to underestimate the importance of these major decisions by the European Council I would like to cite the comments of President Mitterrand as reported in <i>Le Monde</i> on 28 June.  He said, and I quote: &ldquo;The decision fixing the date for convoking the two intergovernmental Conferences on Economic and Monetary Union and on political Union went through as easily as posting a letter.  I wanted to rub my eyes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first stage of economic and monetary union came into effect on 1 July 1990.  The European Council, noting this with satisfaction, underlined the importance of using this stage for ensuring convergence in the economic performance of member states for advancing cohesion and to further the use of the ECU.</P>
    <P>The preparations for an intergovernmental conference on economic and monetary union was a priority item on our Presidency agenda.  The initial concentration was on the decisions to enable Stage I of EMU to start in July. Agreement was reached on the procedures to govern multilateral surveillance <Col N="173" /> of member states' economies in Stage I, and a preliminary surveillance discussion took place at the June ECOFIN Council on a trial basis.</P>
    <P>The European Council noted the satisfactory functioning and recent development of the EMS, which, <i>inter alia</i>, refers to the entry of the lira into the narrow band.  One of the very positive developments that has taken place has been the recent UK proposals for a parallel currency approach to monetary union. Britain's ERM membership would contribute to greater stability and reduce uncertainties in trading relationships between Britain and Ireland and could have a positive effect in terms of commercial development generally.</P>
    <P>The intergovernmental conference will be concered with Stages II and III of EMU, and the task of the Irish Presidency was to ensure that the necessary preparatory work was carried forward.  A Commission paper setting out the costs and benefits of EMU and proposals for the final shape of EMU was made available in March and was discussed at the informal ECOFIN in Ashford Castle, which also had before it reports from the monetary committee and from the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The discussions at Ashford Castle indicated a considerable degree of agreement on the design of future economic and monetary union, particularly on the future central banking structure and on procedures to ensure budgetary discipline.</P>
    <P>The ECOFIN Council in June built on their earlier progress by addressing the issues of the phasing of Stages II and III, and the operational and institutional conditions which must be fulfilled before advancing beyond Stage I and the likely regional distribution of the costs and benefits of EMU.  Ireland and other less prosperous member states have at all times stressed the importance of continuing and intensifying economic and social cohesion in the Community after 1993, and this is reflected in the conclusions of the European Council.</P>
    <P>The preparations for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference on EMU <Col N="174" /> were reviewed by the European Council, which noted that all the relevant issues are being fully and thoroughly clarified with the constructive contribution of all member states and that common ground is emerging in a number of fields.  In the light of this, the European Council decided that the intergovernmental conference should conclude their work rapidly with the objective of ratification by member states before the end of 1992. The purpose of the conference will be to agree the final stages of economic and monetary union in the perspective of the completion of the Internal Market and in the context of economic and social cohesion.  The objective of EMU has thus been significantly advanced in the course of the Irish Presidency, with progress behing made towards defining some of its principal features.</P>
    <P>The completion of the Single Market remains the bedrock of European integration. The creation of an economic area without internal frontiers ensuring the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital and underpinned by economic and social cohesion and other accompanying measures is an essential foundation of economic and monetary union and of political union.</P>
    <P>The European Council welcomed the good progress that has been made towards completion of the Single Market during the Irish Presidency.  Indeed, several heads of Government congratulated the Irish Presidency on this progress and noted that two-thirds of the measures had now been agreed.  Despite the need to respond to the great political challenges that arose over the last six months, the day to day work of implementing the Single Market Programme was not neglected, but on the contrary was pursued with exceptional vigour.  The 26 measures adopted and 11 common positions agreed under the Irish Presidency, amounting to 37, constitutes a record performance for any Presidency. In addition, progress has been made in advancing the discussion of many other important items with a view to their early adoption.</P>
    <P>One of the most important functions <Col N="175" /> of the European Council is to guide and stimulate the work of the Community. The European Council meeting in Dublin indicated the areas, where it wished to see further rapid progress being made; for example, extending the opening up of public procurement to services, the creation of a free market in the areas of investment services and non-life insurance and completion of the internal market in agriculture and foodstuffs.  The Council reaffirmed the need for overall timely decisions in the fiscal area in order to complete the Internal Market by the end of 1992.</P>
    <P>The extension of the opening up of public procurement in the important sectors of energy, transport, water and telecommunications is one of the measures fundamental to the achievement of the Single Market, and will be of particular interest to Irish small and medium-sized companies, seeking opportunities abroad.</P>
    <P>In the consumer area a directive was agreed on package travel which will provide protection for customers.  Major progress was achieved towards the liberalisation of motor and life assurance, which extends services to consumers, while strengthening their protection.  In particular, niches will be opened up in the wider Community market of interest to the life insurance industry here.</P>
    <P>Progress was made on the harmonisation of technical standards.  There was a first reading of the European Company Statute first introduced 20 years ago, and common positions agreed on accounts directives for small and medium-sized companies and partnerships.</P>
    <P>In the area of research, the major achievement of the Irish Presidency was the adoption of the five year Third Framework Programme, which involved delicate negotiations between the Council and the Parliament.  Discussions has commenced on nearly all of the 15 specific action proposals.  Irish scientists and researchers, whether in industry or third level institutions, draw substantial benefit from EC research programmes. <Col N="176" /> In 1989 approvals to a value of £24 million were given to Irish projects.</P>
    <P>In the telecommunications area we advanced the standardisation of networks and liberalisation of services.  In the energy area directives on electricity transit, which will help avoid over-capacity, on price transparency to avoid hidden subsidisation, and a new energy efficiency programme THERMIE were adopted. There was a full debate on energy and the environment, including nuclear safety in all its aspects, in the Energy Council.</P>
    <P>The creation of a Single Market in European air transport took a major step forward when the Council adopted the second phase of the liberalisation of air transport, which will open up additional air routes to Irish carriers and create greater competition on fares.  Ireland has been to the forefront in the Community in arguing for greater liberalisation, and with it one of the important original aims of our Presidency has been achieved.</P>
    <P>A major breakthrough has been the agreement, in principle, on providing a proper legal basis for a programme for the development of transport infrastructure in the Community which has been under discussion since 1976.  The upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast railway line and the North Wales road to Holyhead could be among the projects eligible for support under this programme.</P>
    <P>The European Council stressed the importance of sustained progress in all areas of transport.  Special concerns were raised in a memorandum by the Dutch Prime Minister, particularly in the road transport sector, on which we have asked for a report from the Transport Ministers for the next European Council.  The Council also asked for agreed guidelines before the end of the year on the development and interconnection of trans-European networks, for example in energy, transport and telecommunications.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made in discussions on tax harmonisation, but decisions in this area are difficult, given the sensitive economic and budgetary issues involved for all countries, including Ireland.  Three long standing company tax directives <Col N="177" /> were agreed which will facilitate the operation of companies across national borders. Useful progress has been made in preparing some of the groundwork for resolution of the outstanding issues in VAT harmonisation before the agreed deadline of the end of 1991.</P>
    <P>In May the Council adopted a decision on the revised financial perspective in the context of the agreement on budget discipline, setting out increased ceilings to the end of 1992, to accommodate financial assistance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, amounting to well over 2 billion ECUs, as well as additional measures for co-operation with Mediterranean, Latin American and ASEAN countries.  The revised perspective also confirms the doubling of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>This year a widely welcomed agreement on agricultural prices was achieved before the end of April, which included measures in favour of small farmers and rural development, potentially serious differences over a well publicised animal disease problem were resolved, and a conflict which could have been very damaging to the Single Market was avoided. Last week a major package of veterinary proposals was agreed, which are essential to the achievement of the Internal Market.  The proposals included the establishment of a veterinary fund to provide assistance in the eradication of animal diseases, which could be of great significance for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The first formal Culture Council for 12 months was held during the Irish Presidency. It had a useful discussion on the protection of national treasures in the context of the Single Market.  The Commission is to study Ireland's proposal for the establishment of a Community supported residence for artists, and report back.</P>
    <P>The social dimension in all its aspects is an essential component of the Single Market and of European Union, and we have made a worthwhile contribution to its development during the Presidency and laid a good foundation for further progress.  The Irish Presidency has given significant impetus to work on the <Col N="178" /> implementation of the Social Charter. The European Council welcomed the timetable which we have established with the succeeding Italian and Luxembourg Presidencies and with the Commission for dealing with the specific proposals contained in the action programme in application of the Charter.  The first proposals under the action programme have been presented, and discussion on them has started.  The General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, Matthias Hinterscheid, speaking last week at the European Foundation in Loughlinstown, acknowledged that Ireland had been more interested than other EC countries in ensuring that the confederations's social demands were respected and that the relationship between the Government and the trade unions in Ireland was not likely to be encountered elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The European Council welcomed the measures adopted by the Council of Social Affairs to assist the long-term unemployed, including more integrated approaches to blackspot areas, greater emphasis on the role of employers and an action programme on vocational training. A number of directives on health and safety have been adopted, for instance, on VDUs and the manual handling of heavy loads.  The EC's role in promoting positive health, in relation to tobacco advertising, cancer, alcohol and drug abuse and AIDS was also agreed.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency considered it was essential to bring the whole issue of social protection to the forefront of EC Council business during the run-up to 1992, to ensure that levels of protection are maintained, that divergences are not increased, and that mobility between member states is not impeded.  EC Social Security Ministers reached agreement on the need for the convergence of social protection policies as part of the goal of social cohesion, having regard to different levels of economic development and financial capacity.</P>
    <P>The Commission is to report before the end of the year on the progress towards achieving the Internal Market within the timetable set down and in December the <Col N="179" /> European Council will undertake a general examination of progress.  The importance of transposing Community decision at national level was emphasised. Ireland ranks high, after the UK, Denmark, Germany and France in terms of implementing Internal Market decisions.</P>
    <P>The European Council heard a report from Chancellor Kohl on the progress towards German unification, with German monetary union due to commence at the beginning of July.  The Chancellor emphasised the German Government's absolute commitment to maintaining anti-inflationary discipline. He emphasised strongly the European significance of German unity.</P>
    <P>The Council welcomed the conclusion of the inter-German State Treaty, which will hasten the integration of the GDR into the Community.  Transitional arrangements are to be submitted by the Commission in September, and the Council of Ministers have been asked to reach early agreement in accordance with the principles laid down at the Dublin I Council in April.  The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Herr de Maiziere and his Foreign Minister Meckel attended the formal luncheon in Dublin Castle offered by the President of Ireland, and spoke briefly to us about unification from the viewpoint of the people of the GDR.</P>
    <P>This year has seen a major acceleration of the process towards German unity, which even at the Strasbourg European Council last December appeared to be some considerable distance away.  The outcome of the Special European Council on 28 April ensured the success of the concept of German unity taking place under the Community roof.</P>
    <P>I saw our role in the Irish Presidency to welcome and assist in every way possible this historic development, not by seeking any intrusion in the fundamental internal decisions of the two states in Germany, but by facilitating the smooth integration in stages of the territory of the GDR into the Community, and providing the <Col N="180" /> opportunity for concerns or fears of possible instability to be allayed.  The European Council in April expressed confidence that German unification will be a positive factor in the development of Europe as a whole and of the Community in particular.  Maintaining and even accelerating the momentum of the Community's own integration has played a significant part in this positive outlook. The Finance Ministers have also been kept fully informed of developments by the German Minister at each meeting of ECOFIN.  Economic and financial stability has been fully maintained.  Other Ministers have also been kept informed by their German colleagues.</P>
    <P>German unification will constitute <i>de facto</i> a significant enlargement of the Community, the broad principles of which have now been settled.  It is also a major development in the history of postwar Europe, a break with a sterile past. The key role played by the Community has been widely seen as confirming the fundamental importance of the Community's role in Europe's future and the increasing significance and influence of the Community ideal in our affairs.  The German Foreign Minister has given full and regular reports to his colleagues in the Twelve on the wider implications for Europe of the German unification process, as dealt with in the CSCE, for instance.</P>
    <P>The People's Europe is a concept, as the European Council emphasises, that draws attention to the crucial importance of promoting the rights, freedoms and welfare of the individual citizen and which seeks to bring home in a direct and practical way the benefit of the Community to all its citizens.</P>
    <P>Concern about our environment is now universal.  It is accepted that steps must be taken to ensure that we stop depleting the finite resources of our planet.  The earth's atmosphere is seriously threatened, and the condition of water resources is causing serious concern.  I planned from the very beginning to focus attention on the environment and to initiate action in this vital area.  I designated the Irish Presidency a Green <Col N="181" /> Presidency.  My primary objective was to have the June European Council adopt a major Declaration on the Environment. This has been done and it is the first time that the heads of Government have addressed the full range of environmental issues.  I saw it as vital that environmental action should receive political support from the highest Community body.</P>
    <P>We are taking action at three levels. First, we are declaring the right of citizens to a clean and healthy environment, including the quality of air, rivers, lakes and coastlines, the quality of food and drinking water, protection against noise, and against soil contamination and erosion, preservation of species, habitats and the natural heritage, and the amenity of residential areas.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we identify the action that needs to be taken at Community level, and the Declaration maps out the direction of future Community environment policy and targets areas where improvements need to be made.  The Declaration identifies new ways of approaching and funding Community environment policy and calls for the more effective enforcement of environmental legislation.  I would draw attention to the emphasis on the protection of seas and coastal regions to the west and south of the Community from the threat of pollution caused by the transport of oil and hazardous substances, which would include nuclear waste.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, at global level, as the Community develops greater cohesion and its importance in world affairs grows, it is in a position to exercise considerable influence and leadership in global environmental policy.  The Declaration, therefore, sets out Community policy and priorities in areas such as the ozone layer, the use of energy, tackling the greenhouse problem, and development assistance. During my meetings with President Bush earlier this year we agreed on the need for joint action to protect the environment. Co-operation between the US and the EC on global warming, depletion of the ozone layer and the protection of endangered species will be followed up later at the appropriate levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> There was particularly strong emphasis and discussion at the Summit on the need for urgent action to halt the destruction of the tropical rain forests, before it is too late, including co-operation with Brazil and consultation with other industrialised countries.  Priority consideration is to be given to the relationship between debt repayment and forest conservation, codes of conduct for timber importing countries, and resources to aid forest management on a sustainable basis.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this Declaration will give added impetus within the Community to work on the environment and will serve as a benchmark for environmental policy over the coming years.</P>
    <P>While the Declaration on the Environment was a major focus of the European Council, the other achievements of the &ldquo;Green&rdquo; Presidency have been substantial. There has been an acceleration of activity and new environmental instruments have been adopted.</P>
    <P>The regulation establishing the European Environment Agency, which will provide the Community and its member states as well as the wider Europe with reliable and objective information on the state of the environment, was adopted at the March Council.  In addition, an important Directive on Freedom of Access to Environmental Information, agreed in March and formally adopted at the June Council, will greatly increase the availability of information to the public and will lead to the publication of regular state of the environment reports. Other important environment measures agreed included two directives on the use of biotechnology, the establishment of a modern Community waste strategy with a new emphasis on recycling and selfsufficiency in waste disposal, the extension of an EC environmental information programme, the ban on the use of batteries with a high mercury content, and provision for their separate disposal, and a measure to control very strictly discharges into water-courses of four dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>One of the most appalling revelations to emerge following the collapse of the totalitarian socialist regimes in Eastern <Col N="183" /> and Central Europe was the disastrous state of the environment in the countries concerned.  Their governments had presided over the wanton devastation of the environment on an unbelievable scale. There are today a large number of nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe in a dangerous state, dead rivers, and noxious air pollution in heavily industrialised regions.  During the Irish Presidency the Community has been coming to grips with these problems, which are a cause of grave public concern right across Europe.  A Presidency initiative was taken to bring together in Dublin the Environment Ministers from Eastern and Western Europe for the first time in midJune. They agreed that the new European Environment Agency would be a pan-European agency open to all.  It has also been agreed that Community firms should be subject to a code of conduct, so that they are not tempted to exploit lower environmental standards in Eastern Europe.  The European Council endorsed the agreement on the steps to be taken to improve the environment in Europe as a whole and in Central and Eastern Europe in particular, and the role that Community aid through co-operation agreements and the EBRD will play in this.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency also ensured that the Community played a leading role in important international negotiations on the environment.  For example, a strong unified Community position was achieved in preparation for the negotiations in London last week on the revision and amendment of the Montreal Protocol on the Depletion of the Ozone Layer; this ensured that the agreement reached in London was more ambitious than it might otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>We have been particularly concerned througout our Presidency to ensure the greatest attention to nuclear safety.  This subject is also dealt with under the European Council Declaration on Nuclear Non-Proliferation.  The Twelve have proposed that the International Atomic Energy Agency, the principal international body in this field, convene a <Col N="184" /> technical conference in 1991 to review the situation in the field of nuclear safety as well as to formulate recommendations on further measures for improving safety.</P>
    <P>At home the Government announced a major £1 billion ten year programme to tackle major environmental issues.  To sum up, the Green Presidency has been a worthwhile and successful initiative and we have played a formative role in setting the environmental agenda for Europe over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The areas of immigration, police co-operation (TREVI) and legal co-operation are of major significance in view of the Single Market, the dismantling of borders and the free movement of persons. It is essential to ensure that a Europe without internal frontiers is protected against terrorism, crime and drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>The convention determining the State responsible for applications for asylum in one of the member states was finalised and signed on behalf of 11 member states, a major achievement welcomed by the European Council.  This convention is intended to prevent multiple demands for asylum or, on the other hand, the undignified transfer of persons seeking asylum from one country to the next without any state having responsibility.  The convention provides the member states with an orderly and humane method of dealing with those who apply for the protection of the Geneva Convention. Reports are to be made to the next meeting of the European Council on national positions on migration and on national policies on asylum, which are major issues for some of our partners.  The European Council adopted a Declaration on anti-semitism, racism and xenophobia against the background of recent outrages. We have recently passed legislation here against racial incitement.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention the agreement reached by Justice Ministers on an important proposal of the Irish Presidency, aimed at facilitating the enforcement of maintenance payments for deserted spouses throughout the Community, as the non-incidence of non-payment as the result of increased <Col N="185" /> movements of persons within the Community following 1992 is likely to grow. It is expected that the draft convention will be adopted and signed before the end of the year.  This represents a good example of practical co-operation for the benefit of the less fortunate in the Community.</P>
    <P>The European Council noted with satisfaction that there was agreement on three draft directives on rights of residence for students, retired people and other persons who are not economically active, which is all part of the people's Europe.  EC Social Security Ministers have asked the Commission to bring forward proposals whereby unemployed persons, wishing to move to a country with which they have close personal ties may retain their rights to unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>The threat which the pernicious trade in drugs poses to the people of Europe has concerned the Heads of State and Government for some time.  As we state in our conclusions: &ldquo;drug addiction and traffic in drugs are sources of great damage to individuals and society as well as to states and constitute a major menace&rdquo; to Europe and to the rest of the world.  It was pointed out during our discussions that there are one million drug dependents in the EC, with 4,000 deaths last year compared to 1,800 in 1980.  Throughout the world the value of illicit drug sales is estimated to exceed that of petroleum products.  The international drugs problem is one that today has reached alarming proportions.  No country is safe from it, and no country can afford to be complacent about it.  The drugs area is a lucrative one for organised crime, which today operates on an international scale.  In some areas of the world it is capable of posing a serious threat to governments struggling to build up democracy.</P>
    <P>The Council had a thorough debate on this based on reports from the high level drugs' co-ordinators group, and from the TREVI group, and endorsed the conclusions and recommendations in the two reports.  It asked for priority action on money laundering, on co-operation with <Col N="186" /> Colombia to help it transfer to substitute crops, and on trade in chemical precursors used in refining drugs.</P>
    <P>Effective action in each member state, supported by joint security action is required.  At Community level CELAD has been asked by the European Council to prepare a comprehensive European plan to combat drug abuse, covering health and social policy measures in the field of prevention, the suppression of drug trafficking and an active international European role.  The TREVI group have been asked by the Council to speed up work on the creation of a common information system and the establishment of a European central drugs intelligence unit.</P>
    <P>Since the Summit the CELAD, meeting with US and Canadian representatives, agreed to establish an informal consultative committee to look at the drug problem in a global sense and, in particular, to cover demand, production, international co-operation and any other relevant drug problem of the day.  The committee will meet at least once a year and the Italians have been asked to hold the first meeting in their Presidency.  In addition, at an operational level, it was decided to set up six regional groups to deal with specific problems in different regions.</P>
    <P>The European Council had a substantial and lively discussion on the situation in the Soviet Union.  We all have an interest in the success of the political and economic reform instituted by President Gorbachev.</P>
    <P>As President Delors has said, we sent a clear signal of our willingness to assist the reconstruction of the Soviet economy, and the Community is playing a leading role in organising western aid. We have asked the Commission to consult the Government of the Soviet Union, and as necessary the international financial organisations, with a view to urgently preparing proposals to be made regarding on the one hand short-term credits and on the other longer term credits for structural reform.  The Dutch Government proposal for a European energy network allowing fuller exploitation of Soviet <Col N="187" /> energy resources will be studied by the Commission in this connection.</P>
    <P>The European Council discussed the developing relationship in Europe between East and West and expressed deep satisfaction at the progress already made and in prospect towards overcoming the divisions of Europe.  It looked forward to the restoration of the unity of this continent whose peoples share a common heritage.</P>
    <P>We welcomed the progress in establishing pluralist democracies based on the rule of law, full respect for human rights and the market economy.  We welcomed the holding of free elections in many of these countries, hoping that this would lead to a fuller realisation of democratic ideals, including unreserved support for the right of individual citizens to play a full part in the democratic process and for opposition parties to operate freely.</P>
    <P>The democratic and mainly peaceful revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe placed an obligation on the Community to provide constructive support, assistance and encouragement to these countries.  One of the main achievements of our Presidency was the establishment of a coherent and effective response to the rapidly changing situation in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The EC and G24 programme of economic aid in support of reform is well under way in the case of Poland and Hungary.  Extensions beyond those two countries have been decided upon in principle. The revised financial perspective provides for assistance equivalent to nearly £1.8 billion pounds over three years.</P>
    <P>Trade and co-operation agreements were signed during our Presidency with the GDR, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, and negotiations were concluded with Romania.  No decision has yet been taken on signature of the latter agreement because of recent developments within that country.  Thus, in our Presidency the network of &ldquo;first generation&rdquo; trade and co-operation agreements with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has been completed.  The Commission has <Col N="188" /> described this as completion of the first phase of the Community's &ldquo;Ostpolitik&rdquo;. Proposals are to come forward for a new set of association agreements.</P>
    <P>Amid all the changes in Eastern Europe the CSCE is playing a vital role as an overall framework for stability and reform, and as a link between all the peoples and Governments of Europe, the United States and Canada.  Support and enhancement for the role of the CSCE has been an important objective of our Presidency.  We look forward, therefore, to the Summit meeting which is proposed for 19 November this year and where the Twelve intend to play a leading role.  We consider that the CSCE Summit should provide the political guidance necessary to strengthen stability in Europe.  We also agree on institutional arrangements within the CSCE which would enable it to build a new set of relationships among the 35, based upon the principles of the Helsinki Final Act.  We have in mind arrangements such as regular Summit meetings supported by a mechanism of meetings of Foreign Ministers as well as the holding of more frequent follow-up meetings.</P>
    <P>The European Council made its first ever Declaration on Non-Proliferation, with the Fourth NPT Review Conference beginning this August in Geneva.  The Dáil will recall that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, &ldquo;the NPT&rdquo;, owes its origins to an Irish initiative at the UN in 1958-59 when the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Frank Aiken, brought the issue to world attention.  I was, therefore, particularly gratified to have steered this Declaration through the Council.</P>
    <P>There was, as expected, a full discussion on recent developments in South Africa.  The Council welcomed the many fundamental changes which have taken place in South Africa, since the European Council last discussed this in Strasbourg in December, including the lifting of the ban on the ANC, the release of Nelson Mandela and the partial lifting of the state of emergency.  In the conclusions we pay tribute to both President De Klerk <Col N="189" /> and Mr. Mandela for their roles in bringing these changes about.  We believe that both deserve the full support and encouragement of the Twelve to continue in the process in which they are engaged.</P>
    <P>We want to see substantive negotiations on ending apartheid get under way as soon as possible.  The objective of such negotiations must be the establishment of a united, non-racial and democratic state in which all South Africans enjoy common and equal citizenship including a system based on one person one vote and where human rights are fully respected.  Urgent action must be taken to help those who have suffered under the apartheid system to prepare themselves for future leadership.  The European Council, therefore, confirmed the decision to increase the funds available to them under the Community's Special Programme of Assistance.</P>
    <P>The Council also considered the Twelve's sanctions on South Africa and maintained a unified consensus that, while many positive changes have been affected, they do not as yet fully meet the criterion of &ldquo;profound and irreversible change&rdquo; which we set at Strasbourg.  The Council affirmed its willingness to consider a gradual relaxation of existing Twelve restrictive measures, when there is further clear evidence that the process of change already initiated continues in the direction called for at Strasbourg.  I note that our position has been widely welcomed in South Africa both by the ANC and the Government.</P>
    <P>We also adopted an important declaration on the Middle East where the situation is untenable and holds the seeds of even greater conflict.  The Prime Minister of Israel has addressed a letter to me as President of the European Council committing his Government to continuing the peace process.  The European Council expressed the hope that this commitment will be followed up in a concrete way.  We believe that the way forward is for a settlement to be negotiated in an international conference in which all parties, including Israel and the PLO, participate. The European Council has stressed the urgent need for Israel to <Col N="190" /> begin a political dialogue with the Palestinians.</P>
    <P>It was decided to appoint a Commission representative to the Occupied Territories responsible for our increasing programme of aid and for developing trade with the Palestinian economy.</P>
    <P>We expressed sympathy to the Iranian Government and people at the terrible loss of life, injury and destruction caused by the earthquake.</P>
    <P>As shown by the number of bilateral meetings I have had with their leaders, I have attached particular importance to relations with the EFTA countries and to expediting the negotiations, which have now commenced, on a European Economic Space.  The objective is to complete them as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The European Council again expressed its satisfaction with the new political relationship established between the Community and the United States as a result of an Irish Presidency initiative, to improve the liaison between the two great power blocs.  At my meeting with President Bush at the end of February, there was formal agreement to meet at the highest level every six months, and at Secretary of State-Foreign Minister level. Subsequently a very successful meeting between EC Foreign Ministers and Secretary of State Baker was held in Brussels on 3 May, and there was general agreement among participants that this represented a very important development for the future.  President Bush has been gracious enough to commend our efforts in the following terms:</P>
    <P>At this time of historic change in Europe &mdash; and around the globe &mdash; we regard the US-EC relationship as increasingly pivotal.  The agreement which we reached during your visit to Washington in February for strengthened US-EC consultations reflects this and has already proven its worth.  The United States is particularly gratified that Ireland, a traditional friend, played such a constructive role in promoting the new US-EC partnership during the past six months. </P>
    <P>The European Council stressed the <Col N="191" /> importance of a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round, which is vital both from the agricultural standpoint and from the point of view of the maintenance and extension of the multilateral trading system which is essential to the improvement of living standards throughout the world.  EC solidarity on the basis of reasonable and agreed positions has been fully maintained.</P>
    <P>The two European Councils in Dublin have increased the standing of the Community in the world.  The European editor of <i>Le Quotidien de Paris</i> has summed it up best, when he wrote on 27 June that Dublin II will enter into history after Dublin I as the first exercise in joint foreign policy with decisions showing a common diplomatic will.  What is without precedent, he wrote, is that the Twelve are now taking decisions, not on some remote foreign policy question, but on the most important issue of all for the future, the fate of the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>There has been intensive diplomatic activity throughout our Presidency.  A meeting took place between the Community and the ASEAN countries in February to discuss such matters as aid, market access and environmental issues. In March there was a joint meeting with Foreign Ministers of the Gulf Co-Operation Council with a view to intensifying economic and technical co-operation as well as to exchange views on the political problems of the Middle East.  This was followed in June by a meeting of the Euro-Arab Dialogue in Dublin attended by delegates from 21 Arab countries, designed to promote co-operation between the two regions.  In April there was a meeting in Dublin with the countries of Central America to discuss the establishment of peace, democracy and greater prosperity in the region, a meeting which had important concrete results including a commitment by the Community to assist in the creation of a Central American Payments Union.</P>
    <P>The scope of EPC and the responsibilities of the Presidency have expanded <Col N="192" /> considerably, with the growing international role and influence of the Community. The close linkage between the Community and EPC, in relation to Eastern Europe, Latin America and many other regions and issues, has been particularly evident in this period, and underlines the desirability of integrating as closely as possible the international action of the Community and of the Twelve.</P>
    <P>One of the features of these last six months has been the prominent role of the European Parliament.  By maintaining an effective dialogue with Parliament and its committees throughout the Presidency and engaging in a continuing process of consultation, the Presidency ensured the benefit of excellent relations and co-operation with the Parliament during what has been a momentous period in the development of the Community and in European history.</P>
    <P>I reported to Parliament on the outcome of the special meeting of the European Council; the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, attended the monthly plenary sessions of the Parliament to answer questions on behalf of the Presidency and to speak in debates on a wide range of Community and political co-operation topics.  Irish Ministers have attended a total of 25 formal meetings with the Parliament's committees and maintained regular contacts with the committee chairman for the purpose of keeping Parliament fully briefed and maximising co-operation for the smooth passage of legislation. These contacts helped to remove blockages in a number of important cases.  The Parliament has been consulted at an inter-institutional meeting in May on the preparation for economic and monetary union and political union, and the European Council had the opportunity to listen to the views of the President of the Parliament, Sr. Enrique Baron, on these and other subjects at the commencement of our meeting.  I will be visiting Parliament again shortly to report on the outcome of the European Council.</P>
    <P>The last six months have been a historic <Col N="193" /> period in the construction of a new Europe.  It has been a great privilege for this country to preside over the European Community at this time.  We held two Summits concerned largely with the rapidly changing pace of events in Germany, Central and Eastern Europe and the USSR.  To prepare for these Summits, I personally visited the Heads of State or Government of the other member states, and the Commission, and held detailed and wide ranging discussions on the issues and the agenda.  These meetings contributed greatly to the proceedings and to the smooth running of the councils.</P>
    <P>The meetings also gave me the opportunity to strengthen relations with other Community leaders.  Indeed, there has also been an unprecedented level of political and diplomatic contact at all levels with Governments outside the Community. One of the lasting benefits of the Presidency will undoubtedly be a much greater international awareness of Ireland as a modern nation with a contribution to make in world affairs.</P>
    <P>I believe that Anglo-Irish and North-South relations have also benefited from the Presidency and from the wider focus which it has given.  In April, I had the opportunity, as President of the European Council, to talk to the Institute of Directors in Belfast on the very important subject of the implications of the Single Market for the economy in both parts of this island.</P>
    <P>Ireland had concluded a highly successful Presidency, which was praised by other Heads of Government and by the President of the Commission.  We have seen not only great progress in the Community's development, but also an effective response to the major challenges created by the democratic revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank warmly the Minister for Foreign Affairs and all my ministerial colleagues for their tremendous work during the Presidency in charging councils, and in fulfilling innumerable other Presidency duties.  At the beginning of the Presidency, Ministers were asked to set their objectives for the Presidency. Now, at the end of our six month period, <Col N="194" /> each Minister has reported almost complete success in the attainment of these objectives.  I would also like to pay special tribute to all the public servants involved in the work of the Presidency, whether as chairmen or delegates of working groups and committees or as organisers of the meetings and of all the back-up arrangements required, including the Army and the Garda, for their outstanding contribution, their hard work, and their magnificent devotion to duty.  Our country is, indeed, fortunate to be so well served.</P>
    <P>The Commission and its President Jacques Delors gave us their full co-operation from the first meeting we held in January, between the full Commission and the Irish Ministers.  I am very happy that the European Council decided to extend President Delors' term of office for another two years in recognition of his outstanding vision, capacity and contribution to Europe.  I want also to thank the Secretary General of the Council, Mr. Niels Ersboell and his staff in the Council Secretariat, for their invaluable assistance.</P>
    <P>We would wish our Presidency performance to be judged by the progress achieved, and in the final analysis by the influence that decisions made in the last six months will have in the future.  We have not just presided in a formal sense over the Community, we have helped to shape and influence developments by concentrating on the priorities we feel to be important and identifying future goals that need to be accomplished.  We have advanced perceptibly closer to a European Union which will adequately accommodate our interests and aspirations as well as those of all the people of Europe.</P>
    <P>It was very satisfying to have the opportunity during the Presidency to work with the other Heads of State and Government in promoting the advancement of the European ideal.  I am glad to state my view that the Community is fortunate in having, at this time, at the head of its affairs, a group of political leaders of great ability, with a firm commitment to the Community and a vision <Col N="195" /> of its future.  There is a sense of achievement, a constructive, progressive outlook and a spirit of co-operation.  It augurs well for the future of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just listened to the Taoiseach's account of the Irish Presidency of the European Community for the first six months of 1990.  I suppose it is understandable that his account was laced with large dollops of self praise.  I will pass it over except to remind the Taoiseach that self praise is no praise.</P>
      <P>This is our fourth Presidency and on each occasion when we have held the Presidency a different Government has been in power and a different Taoiseach has been leading the Government, except for a very brief period when there was a change in leadership in Fianna Fáil in 1979 when Deputy Haughey took over for the last month of the Presidency. Behind the four Governments and the four Taoisigh there is a vast army of what are now very experienced, dedicated, hard working and brilliant civil servants. As the Taoiseach said, they have made a great contribution to the success of this and other Presidencies.  In the future it will be recognised that in comparison with public servants in other countries, the contribution of Irish civil servants has been enormous not just because of the manner in which they upheld the position of this country and the ability of this country to undertake huge tasks on the European mainland and carry them off with great credit, but for the contributions they have made because of their vision of the European Community and their building of that Community over that period.</P>
      <P>It is a little ungracious of the Taoiseach not to have paid greater tribute to Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn whose contribution during the six months was beyond that of other Ministers who had far more public and prominent roles to play.  My understanding is that her contribution was exceptional and should have been recognised here today by the Taoiseach.  I recognise it now on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> The context in which we discuss developments in the European Community today is not only a great deal more complex than in previous years but it is a great deal more compelling.  We are all aware that profound changes are taking place in Europe.  The rapid pace of those changes demands a greater sense of urgency from our deliberations and decisions.  It is this sense of urgency that is missing from the conclusions of the European Council, which is what we are debating here today.</P>
    <P>The Council outlined and underlined some of the major challenges facing the Community but it did so in a general fashion.  Because the agenda beforehand suggested a lengthy and substantial debate, the results are disappointing and reflect the fact that most of the member states are unclear as to what greater political union will mean.  The major item on the agenda was political union and apparently neither the Commission nor the member states has an idea what that means.  This is clear from the results of the Council as published in this document before us today.  In our case there is a serious lack of clear priority and policies in this crucial area.  This comprises two areas &mdash; European union and the kind of institutional changes that are necessary to facilitate this union.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach asked a number of questions which are important and deserve answers.  The conclusions of the Council refer to the transformation of the Community from an entity mainly based on economic integration and political co-operation into a union of a political nature, including a common foreign and security policy.  In 29 pages of script the Taoiseach did not make one reference to a security policy and to what the Government mean by it.  This House is entitled to know what the Government's views on this matter are.  At no stage has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the Taoiseach, who made a very lengthy speech today and has given many interviews during the past week since the Council concluded, referred to this matter which is referred to twice in the Presidency Conclusions. What is meant by &ldquo;a common <Col N="197" /> foreign and security policy&rdquo; and what is the Government's understanding of the term &ldquo;security&rdquo; in this context?  We do not know the answer to that question. What implications does it have for our foreign policy?  The Government must have a clear idea of what this entails otherwise they would not, or should not, have agreed to the inclusion of this phrase.</P>
    <P>It is not something which was drafted on the spot by some less important civil servant in a back room of Dublin Castle last week, rather it was passed from COREPER to the Council of Ministers and would have been debated at every stage.  The precise wording of each draft, each of which contained this phrase, was passed by the Irish representative on the lower committees, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the European Council and by the Taoiseach at the Summit without any explanation been given to the people as to what exactly was involved.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat a point that I have made a number of times before.  The making of statements does not facilitate a real discussion on the complex and farreaching developments that will take place in the European Community in the coming months and years.  One can well understand Deputy Garland's protest in this regard today.  Following each European Council meeting statements are made in this House by representatives of each party.  I accept that this format is agreed beforehand, and that is what is going to happen today, but it is not a debate in the true sense and someone like Deputy Garland, who does not represent a group in this House, should be allowed to have his say &mdash; this goes for the other Independents also &mdash; on a matter as important as this.  Given the scale of the task ahead of us it is crucial that we are clear on the choices we have to make and that we are equally clear of the impact these choices will have on our political economic, and social lives.  I strongly urge the Taoiseach and the Government to consider making some practical changes to enable the House to discuss and debate <Col N="198" /> the issues and political priorities pertaining to our membership of the European Community.</P>
    <P>As the member states of the European Community move closer together and more decisions are taken on a Europe-wide basis, it is absolutely vital that the Dáil remains a relevant and responsible body.  It has been said that by the end of the decade, 80 per cent of the decisions in the transport, environmental and social areas will be taken in Brussels.  We do not want to reach a point where this Parliament, who elect the Taoiseach who represents the Parliament when he goes to Europe &mdash; we represent the people &mdash; should not be sidelined in the discussion on the future of the Community.</P>
    <P>The question that must be asked is what impact will this process have on the notion of domestic accountability and on the future role and development of national parliaments?  For all its shortcomings our political system is based on a democratic electoral system and there is a direct link between the electors and those who are elected.  The notion of accountability underpins the operation of our political system.  There is also a clear system of checks and balances on our institutions and decision-makers regardless of how imperfectly they work.  There was an example of this during the past week.</P>
    <P>Indeed Deputy Garland's protest is another indication of this.  We all recognise those checks and balances and people can see the link between us and the laws we pass.  However, the position becomes less clear at European level.</P>
    <P>I have to say, even though my original canard of self-praise is no praise has been thrown back in my face, that my party have been far more aware of the necessity to reorganise the business of this Parliament to ensure that it becomes much more relevant than it is at present, than any other party in this House and I can say this without fear of contradiction.</P>
    <P>We must now ask how we can translate this direct relationship and accountability into the European context.  There are a number of political innovations the Government could make in this regard <Col N="199" /> instead, as I have said, of making statements following meetings of the European Council.  Why not arrange a three or four hour debate prior to the Summit meeting to ensure that the Taoiseach has some idea of what the Dáil's view is on the agenda?  If this were to be done there could be a debate instead of statements in the House lasting for three or four hours prior to the Summit meeting when the Taoiseach of the day would get a good idea of what the Dáil's view is on the proposals which have been made.</P>
    <P>This mechanism would also ensure that the Irish priorities for the Summit were clear and coherent.  Such clarity and accountability is essential to sustain public support for the European Community. Let me repeat that it is also vital that we ensure the continued relevance of Dáil Éireann.  Let me say in this context that this is the only Parliament in Europe which does not have a foreign affairs committee.  We need to address this issue.  I do not want to make a political point but I have written to the Taoiseach twice within the past month and made a number of suggestions to him in this regard.  I hope he responds positively to these suggestions.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the European affairs committee or to give it its correct or more cumbersome title, the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, of which I am chairperson, is properly funded.  As the Taiseach is probably aware, it is under-funded.  That committee could facilitate an exchange of views with Ministers. Indeed, prior to European Council meetings Ministers could attend for a short period one of the four sub-committees of that committee.</P>
    <P>This Parliament and the people do not know what takes place or what is discussed at a Council meeting.  They are only told of the decisions arrived at.  We should consider the suggestions that a Minister, prior to making his way to a Council meeting, attend the committee or a sub-committee of the committee for half an hour &mdash; as little as that &mdash; to outline the agenda for the meeting and <Col N="200" /> get the views of the committee rather than telling them later what decisions were arrived at.</P>
    <P>For instance this week the Fisheries Council will meet in Brussels when important decisions will be taken on the questions of the total allowable catch and the buying out of the boats of Irish fishermen. These issues have implications for our coastal areas, yet the decisions will be taken behind closed doors, admittedly in the presence of our Minister for the Marine.  However, the views of this Parliament, as expressed through the European affairs committee, and the people will not be taken into account.  Despite differences between the parties on this matter, it should be possible to come up with an Irish viewpoint through a European affairs committee rather than across the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the European affairs committee should be properly funded and expanded.  Ministers should also be required to attend the committee before leaving to attend meetings and to report back to them afterwards to ensure there is a constant flow of views, opinions and suggestions from parliamentarians to Ministers and that an Irish view is presented.  At present views on European affairs tend to be expressed across the floor of the House in a party political way. It would be far better if the Government departed for a European Council meeting knowing they had the support of the House for the point of view they would express at the meeting.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in referring to relations with the European Parliament had this to say:</P>
    <P>One of the features of these last six months has been the prominent role of the European Parliament.  By maintaining an effective dialogue with Parliament and its committees throughout the Presidency and engaging in a continuing process of consultation, the Presidency ensured the benefit of excellent relations and co-operation with the Parliament... </P>
    <P>Irish Ministers have attended a total  <Col N="201" /> of 25 formal meetings with the Parliament's committees and maintained regular contacts with the committee chairmen for the purpose of keeping Parliament fully briefed and maximising co-operation... </P>
    <P>The Taoiseach found it appropriate to appoint a journalist to beef up or to keep that liaison with the Parliament in place during the Irish Presidency.  Yet, this Parliament to which we are all elected does not receive the same attention from the Government.  Ministers do not come in here to keep us fully informed and briefed for the purpose of maximising co-operation. The Taoiseach does not come in here and tell us what will happen in Europe yet he can do it for the European Parliament, which though 18 of its members are elected by the people of this country, has no power.  All of this Parliament is elected by the people of this country and we have power, yet the Government do not think it necessary to seek our co-operation or to keep us informed about what is going on.  There is a democratic deficit there which needs to be redressed very quickly if we are to have more political union in the future.</P>
    <P>If I could make a plea for the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities to the Taoiseach.  It is virtually impossible to keep the work going because of the amount of funds available and the fact that some of the staff are out sick and the place is understaffed.  That applies to all the committees of this House.  If we want to have real democracy here and real reform we must fund these committees properly so that they have the research resources and the staffing that will allow them to do the work which this House decided they should do.  It was this House that established many of these committees yet we starve them of funds so that they become ineffectual. This situation must change.</P>
    <P>It is in the long-term interest of the Oireachtas, regardless of who is in Government, to have a well informed, business like and effective Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of <Col N="202" /> the European Communities.  As I have already underlined the pace of change as well as the complexity of these changes demand a response and a change in the way we think about and talk about the European Community.  The European Community will be more relevant in all our lives in the future and not only the lives of this Parliament but it must be the voice and the means of communication between the electorate and the European Community.  That sense of involvement by the Dáil and its committees in the affairs of Europe must be evident to the electorate.  At present they do not see that but rather the Government dealing with the European Community and the Dáil being irrelevant.  If that position is not changed the Community will lose and certainly democracy in this country will lose.</P>
    <P>The range of issues dealt with in the conclusions of the Council need a structured consideration of the issues and policies on the European agenda at the moment. One of the most pressing areas for consideration is the question of political union.  The Council conclusions report on the calling of an intergovernmental conference on political union.  The conclusions further report that:</P>
    <P>Foreign Ministers will prepare the Conference.  Preparatory work will be based on the results of the deliberations of Foreign Ministers and on contributions from national governments and the Commission, and it will be conducted in such a way as to permit negotiations on a concrete basis to begin from the start of the Conference.</P>
    <P>What will the Government's contribution be in this area?  The reference to national governments clearly underlines a commitment and an expectation that all governments will be making a contribution. The Taoiseach must undertake to have the Irish conference proposal debated in the Dáil and Seanad before the intergovernmental conference in December.  We must have an opportunity in this House to give our opinions on whatever paper the Government intend <Col N="203" /> to put before the intergovernmental conference. If this was a debate, as it should be, I would be asking the Taoiseach in his winding up contribution to confirm that that would happen.  I hope he is taking the point.</P>
    <P>Likewise, what is called an assizes is taking place in Rome in November.  The Italian Presidency will be bringing together representatives of the parliaments of the Twelve Community countries and the European Parliament to discuss the implications for both sides of European political developments. Before that happens I hope that we in the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities will have the opportunity of seeing the Government's proposals so that we can attend that assizes armed with the Government's point of view not with the Fianna Fáil, the Fine Gael, or Labour or any other point of view &mdash; the Irish point of view as enunciated by the Government, debated and agreed on consensus in this House.  It would strengthen very much the Government's hands and it would allow those who will be attending that conference in Rome at the end of November to be confident that the views they are expressing are the views of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>In the interests of a real discussion it would be preferable if the Government undertook to publish a White Paper so that the many interested groups &mdash; outside this House as well as in it &mdash; and the public whose future will be affected, would have the opportunity to state their views.  While it may not be the ideal it is something the Government should consider.</P>
    <P>The move towards a more politically united Europe and the completion of the Internal Market will mean new challenges and perspectives in European politics. It is very important that people understand the choices and decisions that are on offer.  If people are not clear about the choices facing them and the impact of these choices, the support for and the interest in the European Community <Col N="204" /> could soon turn to disillusionment and cynicism.</P>
    <P>In the Summit Conclusions under the heading of &ldquo;Unity and the coherence of the Community's international action&rdquo; the question of the security dimension of European foreign policy is raised.  I want to ask the Taoiseach and his Government what do they understand by the &ldquo;security dimension&rdquo;?  Once again it is crucial that we are clear on what the implications of this undertaking is with regard to our foreign and domestic policies.  We cannot be pawned off with vague generalisations about changed political relationships. Does our undertaking to contribute to a common foreign and security policy mean an end to neutrality?  We should be clear about the ramifications of a major change in this regard.</P>
    <P>Any changes which take place should be debated and agreed in this House and not out on the streets.  It is a matter for this House to decide any changes in that regard and not for the Government to try to slip them in.  It is referred to twice in the Summit Conclusions, yet the Taoiseach did not make any reference to it in his contribution today.  That is regrettable and it is the wrong way to go about it. If changes are contemplated and if the Government have something in mind in this regard, I am willing to debate them and my views in that regard are pretty well known but the Government's views are not known and what the Government mean by this is not known.  That should be put on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>Our contribution to the process of greater European unity will require a critical reassessment of our policy towards the European Community.  This reassessment must take place in as wide a forum as possible and in a mature and constructive manner.  The issue at stake may be our political and economic survival. Unless we face into European union with the support of the majority of our people, the challenges ahead may prove too daunting for them and for us.</P>
    <P>One of the issues which was not discussed was the enlargement of the Community at the European Council.  The enlargement is already taking place <Col N="205" /> because the two Germanys are being united, that is something I welcome.  The status of the other applicants, such as Austria, must be clarified.  What is the position of Austria?  Is their application still on the table?  Will it be dealt with in an expeditious manner?  The inclusion of Austria in the European Community is becoming more important as days go by. We must see that Austria becomes a member of the Community as quickly as possible without disturbing the balance inside the Community.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Summit did not discuss the question of aid to Central European countries, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.  I know the Taoiseach referred in his speech &mdash; it is implicit in what he said &mdash; to the bank being set up and to the need for democracy in those countries.  Without financial and economic aid these countries could slip back to dictatorships.  Their transition to free market democracies will be difficult and painful for their citizens and they must be helped.  It is in the interest of the Community to have democratic states on their eastern border rather than having dictatorships there.  At this stage it might be useful if the European Community were to discuss a firm and possible timetable for the application for membership of the European Community by Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland, in particular, as an encouragement to continue on the road to democracy and a free market.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the position in the Soviet Union was recognised and the Council have agreed to some plan of action in that regard.  It is equally urgent and important that a similar plan be drawn up &mdash; politically, economically and financially &mdash; to help Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</P>
    <P>In the Taoiseach's contribution today and in the conclusions of the Summit it was reported that over 60 per cent of the directives and proposals for the completion of the Internal Market by 1992 have been adopted by the Council.  The more difficult decisions still remain. Transposing them into national laws <Col N="206" /> probably will take longer than 12 months. There remains very little over a year in which to have the balance of the 35 or 40 directives &mdash; not yet adopted &mdash; adopted and translated into national law by 1992. It is my fear that, with so many other distractions, the momentum towards the completion of the Internal Market will be lost.  It is already clear that there is no chance that a unified tax system will be in place by 1992.  I wonder how many other deadlines will not be met.</P>
    <P>What about the impact on our fiscal policy and economic planning?  In 1992 we cannot turn round and claim that we did not expect the changes that will come about.  We have known about this process for many years and should have been planning to accommodate the requisite changes.  The process of economic integration is supposed to underpin the process of political union.  It is important that those processes complement each other.</P>
    <P>The Council's conclusion with regard to the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade &mdash; the GATT round &mdash; was also disappointing and did not underline the necessity to conclude this round by the already agreed December deadline.  This round of GATT talks are considered to be the most important in the history of world trade agreements.  Reports from the talks suggest that the United States and the European Community have come to an impasse on the question of the Community's agricultural export subsidies operating through the CAP.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy is highly vulnerable in this regard as our agricultural community are highly dependent on the transfer of resources through the CAP.  The Community maintains the right to modify the CAP by way of negotiation between the member states.  That is the correct way to proceed.  But the Community must also take account of the interests of the business and industrial sectors.  It is vital to all sectors that the Uruguay Round of talks be concluded on time. Indeed so much concern is being expressed about the implications of a failure to complete the GATT talks, that the so-called &ldquo;committee of eminent people&rdquo;<Col N="207" /> will attend a meeting in Texas next week of the seven most industrialised nations. They want to lobby the support of those countries to ensure that the GATT negotiations are concluded by December.  In that regard I am sorry to note that the Community has not a much clearer view of the urgency, necessity and importance of concluding that round of talks.  Four of the seven are European Community Members, one of whom, Italy, holds the European Presidency for the next six months.</P>
    <P>The declaration on the environment communicated no new decisions and announced no concrete action.  In spite of the Taoiseach's promise that the Irish Presidency would be a Green one, in fact the declaration is no more than that &mdash; a declaration of future intentions.  The Summit conclusions set out guidelines for future action and I quote:</P>
    <P>It requested the Commission to use the objectives and the principles contained in the declaration as the basis of the Community's Fifth Action Programme for the Environment and to present in 1991 a draft of this programme.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is no sense of urgency there. It says that the draft programme is to be presented to the Commission in 1991. Surely the time has passed for aspirational statements on the environment. No decision was taken on the location of the proposed European Environmental Protection Agency.  Until that has been decided and somebody made responsible concern for the environment will be confined merely to rhetoric, statements and aspirations.  Environmental issues are urgent and crucial.  There must be a recognition of the need for collective action in this regard.  The kind of declaration included in the conclusions of the most recent Summit is shortsighted, promoting the kind of cynicism that suggests that Europe is all about communiqués and talks, not about action.</P>
    <P>The declaration on South Africa is not <Col N="208" /> sufficiently strong on the issue of sanctions. The European Council in December last said that &ldquo;profound and irreversible&rdquo; changes are required in South Africa.  This week they spoke of &ldquo;gradual relaxation of this pressure when there is clear evidence that the process of change already initiated continues in the direction called for at Strasbourg&rdquo;.  This suggests disquieting evidence of a faltering resolve on the part of the Council. The Taoiseach was present in this House on Monday last and heard Mr. Nelson Mandela make the point that sanctions had contributed to the impetus for reform and change in South Africa.  He will also have heard Mr. Mandela make the point that talks about change do not constitute change.  He said the pressure must be maintained to ensure the complete dismantling of the apartheid system in South Africa.</P>
    <P>I should like to revert now to the question of institutional changes and areas of increased co-operation.  First, let me make it clear that the future success of the European Community will be dependent on the effectiveness of its institutional framework.  Suggestions of co-operation in area such as the fight against drugs, police and judicial processes are very much dependent on what the summit conclusions call democratic legitimacy. While on that subject I might refer to page 19 of the summit conclusions, a paragraph headed &ldquo;Terrorism.&rdquo;  It is somewhat disconcerting that, at a time when the Presidency had been held by Ireland for the past six months, the paragraph on terrorism should contain less than four lines.  It read as follows:</P>
    <P>Following the most recent bombing outrage in London, the European Council renewed its categorical condemnation of all forms of terrorism and expressed its deep sympathy for the victims and their families. </P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that a country that has suffered more from terrorism &mdash; which held the Presidency for the past six months &mdash; could issue a statement like that given what is done by the greatest polluters, in the real sense of the word, <Col N="209" /> in the taking of lives in Europe, and who purport to act in our name in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is also somewhat odd that this statement emanate from a Government who have refused to change the laws in relation to extradition.  Despite the fact that one wing of that Government, the Progressive Democrats, clearly want to have a change in the laws in relation to extradition their demands were resisted by the then President of the European Council.  That is very odd.  While on the subject it is also extremely odd that the Progressive Democrats, who say they want change in the extradition laws &mdash; which in the view of my party would have the effect of saving lives &mdash; do not care to use their muscle within Government; nor do they care to use their muscle within Government in relation to divorce while 70,000 families are affected.  Of course they do use their muscle when there is a danger of their losing publicity on RTE over the Broadcasting Bill. There is certainly a credibility deficit there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestions of co-operation in areas such as the fight against drugs, police and judicial processes &mdash; so dependent on what the Summit Conclusions call democratic legitimacy &mdash; a number of issues need to be clarified. First, what does greater co-operation in police and judicial matters entail? Exactly what do the Government understand in this regard?  Are we talking about new extradition arrangements?  What is our view on the speculation about a European police force fashioned on an FBI-type structure?  These are issues about which we must be very clear.  The Government must come forward and tell us why they agree to such words being included in a document because they must have understood what they had in mind when they allowed them be inserted.  We have had no indication from the Taoiseach of precisely what they mean.  Those are very important issues both constitutionally and otherwise in this country.</P>
    <P>On the central question of the European institutions a number of very important philosophical and practical <Col N="210" /> considerations arise.  The advent of a more politically unified Europe will mean an expanded role for all its institutions. We might well ask: what form will this expanded role take?  How will the balance of power be maintained?  How will the central notion of democratic accountability be maintained?  The conclusions of the Summit talk about the role of the institutions in a general way.  There is recognition that an expanded role for the institutions requires a strengthening of democratic control.  The Taoiseach did list in the course of his remarks today a number of questions that must be addressed in this regard.  Virtually all the things I have thought of were included in that list and must be addressed again in this House.</P>
    <P>If the central locus of power and decision making is to be the European Council, this could have a detrimental effect on national parliaments, particularly in our case as the role of the Oireachtas is seriously under-developed, as I have been maintaining for the past half hour.  Indeed, the role of the Opposition could be undermined and effectively excluded from influencing policy.  The European Council meets in secret; we are merely informed of results.  We must facilitate a more structured input on the part of the Opposition by way of a Dáil debate, or through the committee system to which I have referred.  We must remember that the national parliament constitutes the direct link with citizens, which link must be maintained.  The role of the European Parliament will also be expanded.  It is suggested that a direct link between the European and national parliaments be established.  How do our Government envisage this happening? We will be discussing this at the European Affairs Committee in Rome at the end of the year.  We want to know what the Government's view on this is because we will be discussing this in the European Affairs Committee in Rome at the end of the year.</P>
    <P>What is the Government's view about the French proposal for a bi-cameral European Parliament?  Would a second <Col N="211" /> chamber increase democratic accountability, and what expanded powers will the Parliament be given?  These questions lie at the heart of our deliberations on our contribution to the European Community.</P>
    <P>What of the European Commission? The conclusions talk of an increase in the number of members and a strengthening of its executive role.  What exactly does this mean?  Will an enlarged Commission become unwieldly and inefficient?  What about democratic accountability with regard to the Commission?  The Commission is essentially a bureaucracy and must be subject to regular scrutiny and control.</P>
    <P>The conclusions also underline the need for the application of the principle of subsidiarity.  This means delegating power and responsibility to a level where it is most relevant and effective.  The whole question of local and regional authority is a crucial one in the context of the Community.  Our own local and regional structures are seriously under-developed. This Government's notion of decentralisation is to transfer civil servants down the country to implement decisions that are taken centrally.  That is not what decentralisation should be.</P>
    <P>We must re-examine our local structures with a view to giving real decision making power locally.  This will help offset the increased centralisation of decision making within the European Community and help to maintain a sense of involvement and control.</P>
    <P>These key relationships are only the beginning of the considerations and choices facing the member states of the European Community at present.  But they are by far the most important and crucial. We must get the institutional balance right.  On it will depend the effectiveness and the very survival of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The task facing us as elected representatives is to ensure that our priorities and policies are clear and coherent.  Our task is also to ensure that all our people know just what is involved in European Union. The impact of European Union and the <Col N="212" /> ramifications at every level of our political, economic and social lives must be spelt out.</P>
    <P>These are challenging times.  Our future lies in Europe and I believe that it offers the best hope for our people of a peaceful, just and prosperous future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of this debate, and on the conclusion of the Irish Presidency, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, in particular, together with the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the other Government Departments who have been involved in the Presidency for the last six months, for the efficient manner in which the Presidency has been conducted on behalf of the country.  We are indebted, in particular, to the public servants who serve this country.  It was a huge undertaking for a very small country with limited resources and I certainly believe we have done extremely well in relation to the manner in which we have conducted our Presidency.</P>
      <P>Overall, this has been a good Presidency which has coped with a very heavy agenda in a manner which has brought credit to the country.  The early hype was totally unnecessary and it was overdone, whether by over-enthusiasm or not I do not know and, I believe, it took away from the basic soundness of the work being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to contributing to these statements here today, I feel one would be in a far happier position to contribute if the Government were prepared to answer, in a detailed manner, the questions submitted by my colleague, Deputy Quinn, for answer on Thursday, 3 July, in relation to the formal decisions which were made during the Irish Presidency. Unfortunately, the reply was to the effect that the Government will be compiling soon a detailed account of progress made in the different Councils during the Irish Presidency and that this will be circulated to all Deputies for their information. That is the response from the Taoiseach, <Col N="213" /> who at least answered the question, whereas the other Ministers refused to answer the question, which I find hard to understand because I would assume that the files are on the ministerial desks and certainly within the Departments, and in the context of the last meeting having taken place in Dublin a detailed statement in reply should have been available by yesterday.  That detailed reply would, one would hope, certainly have been informative to the Opposition Deputies in this House so that we would have an opportunity of making a considered contribution to the debate here this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The recent European Council meeting was less headline making than the earlier one, but some progress was made. However, it is once again necessary to stress that the real issues and the real decisions are not those made at the Summit but those which must be faced up to at the level of the individual Councils and, more particularly, in the two Intergovernmental Conferences over the months ahead.  We should not be misled into thinking that the Summit has resulted in economic and monetary union, in political union or in environmental policies which will have any real effect &mdash; processes have been started and declarations made and the real, detailed work is now to be done.</P>
    <P>It is fundamental, therefore, that this debate should not be seen as Dáil Éireann's last word on the major themes of the Dublin Castle meeting.  It is essential that the House should take steps to equip itself to address the very important political and economic issues which are now on the Community agenda.  This cannot be done by the mere formal exchange of party leaders' statements on occasions like this.  We must have an efficient and properly staffed committee of the Oireachtas to deal with the entire range of Community policy matters and with the broader aspects of foreign policy.  I am not sure at this stage whether the obstruction of that desire comes from the Taoiseach and the Government or from the longstanding distaste of Iveagh House for such an instrusion by the <Col N="214" /> elected representatives of the people into their areas of influence.  We should face up to that at this stage and we should equip ourselves better in this House by way of a Foreign Affairs Committee of the House, particularly given the wide political changes that are taking place on the European map at present.</P>
    <P>As <i>The Irish Times</i> said on Monday, &ldquo;the Government should have the confidence to take their Oireachtas and the public more fully into account in the formulation and debate on foreign policy issues which now touch on all domestic affairs.  The Oireachtas urgently needs a committee on foreign affairs and the resources to examine the flow of Community legislation in far greater detail than theretofore&rdquo;.  And, the need is not merely to consider legislation but more basically to evolve a national strategy towards the emerging European of the nineties and beyond.  We need to be able to develop an informed and comprehensive consensus on the future of the Community and on Ireland's place in that Community and to move from general passivity to a more dynamic and positive role in a changing continent.</P>
    <P>Turning to the European Council itself, the most important decision taken was that to convene the IGC on Political Union.  It is now quite clear that the concept of political union which informs the decision of the European Council is a pragmatic one with the goal of strengthening the Community's capacity &ldquo;to act in the areas of their common interests.&rdquo; That is as it should be &mdash; there is no sense in pursuing utopias of federalism but every reason for working to make the Community more cohesive, more balanced and more democratic.  The IGC must seek to achieve those aims while ensuring that there remains within both the structures and policies of the EC a proper recognition of the fundamental interests of all member states and of all regions.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the principle of subsidiarity which is now invoked on all sides must be very carefully and seriously considered by the IGC especially in respect of the decision-making processes related to <Col N="215" /> economic and monetary union and economic and social cohesion.  The regions and the local communities which make up the Community must have their proper voice and the farce which passed for consultation here in relation to the Regional Fund must never be permitted again.</P>
    <P>It is now essential that the Government prepare and fully debate in this House an Irish input into the intergovernmental discussions.  We must have a clear position as a nation on the agenda items of the Intergovernmental Conference which are of critical importance to us. The Government failed, prior to the Dublin Summit, to outline an Irish position.  This is a fundamental weakness in the performance of the Taoiseach and the Government in relation to the Irish Presidency.  Among the items which should be listed and outlined in an Irish input to the intergovernmental discussions, I would submit, should be the expanding role of the European Parliament, decision making in the Council, more majority voting or otherwise, involvement of the national parliaments, definitions of the areas to be covered by foreign policy and definition of the security dimension.</P>
    <P>The last of those points is of special significance for this country.  We must accept that the pace of change in Europe demands that security concerns will be considered within the Community's institutions, and that the EC will play a political role in the evolution of the new European security framework.  The creation of a Europe free of nuclear weapons and rid of the confrontation of power blocs is the great task facing all of us in the period ahead and the EC will have a part to play in building the new relationships of peace and co-operation. Indeed, I welcome the statement of the European Council that the Community will remain open to membership by other European states who accept its goals and in particular I look forward to early accession by Austria.</P>
    <P>What we must now work for is the establishment of a new peace and security order in Europe based on mutual trust <Col N="216" /> and co-operation.  That is the true meaning of common security and it is a goal which must be worked for through the framework of the CSCE above all.  In that framework all the nations of Europe can find a way of making their special contribution to the building of peace and to the phasing out of the military alliances which have threatened us and our children for too long.  There can be no place in the future Europe for alliances armed to the teeth with nuclear weaponry espousing ghoulish doctrines of mutual assured destruction and first strike.  This must be replaced by arrangements in which what is mutually assured is development and all prospects of aggression by one European nation against another, are precluded.  That will take more than pious statements and will involve much detailed work on institutions and on policies.  It will call for commitment and for a willingness to be open and receptive to the ideas and concerns of all nations.  And it will demand a new and total commitment to the role of the United Nations at the world level in the ending of conflict and the building of lasting peace.</P>
    <P>Through the CSCE we can all contribute to the achievement of a lasting peace.  Through the EC we can help to build a Europe of economic and social progress which is the best guarantee of peace and stability.  But we should set our faces against any attempt to graft on to the Community any military role.  For those countries which continue to see some need for military co-operation &mdash; that is their business and not ours &mdash; there are available and established fora.  There is no need to retrace history to the early fifties and to the failed European defence Community concept.</P>
    <P>Neutral Ireland must play its full part in the common security of Europe, and of the world, by its political commitment and by its continued willingness to participate in peacekeeping and other activities geared to reduce tensions and to faciliate reconciliation between peoples and nations.  There can be no benefit to this country from entering anyone's armed camp and there can be no benefit <Col N="217" /> to the Community from seeking to become one.  A truly open EC cannot have military entanglements.</P>
    <P>The other Intergovernmental Conference dealing with EMU, will have important implications for every citizen of the Community.  The positive outcomes which many commentators anticipate from the movement towards EMU are, like those forecast for the internal market project itself, dependent upon recognition in practical terms of the potential downside.  Here I can recall the words of the oft-quoted Mr. Cecchini who stated in his report that &ldquo;if the rewards are not shared fairly the EC home market will rest on a brittle skein of regional and social tensions... the extent to which the 1992 programme can attract economic and social cohesion around it will be the key to its chances of success&rdquo;.  That is even more so the case in respect of EMU and I support fully the strong stand being taken in the European Parliament by the Socialist group to ensure that the entire EMU process is designed to give priority to the attainment of cohesion and true balance between regions and sectors.</P>
    <P>On this subject also I am calling on the Government to produce, and to debate here, a full Irish position paper on the key issues and especially those related to regional balance.  The excellent work done by NESC in this regard provides us all with the basic material and with the correct orientation.  The NESC report concluded that a prime requirement for Ireland at this stage of European development is &ldquo;a clear national strategy for European integration which will provide a guide to external negotiations and domestic decision-making&rdquo;.  Such a strategy must be enunciated by this House and it is not a matter for secrecy or for so-called diplomacy.</P>
    <P>The European Council also agreed on a major statement of principles on the environment.  This is to be welcomed as is the decision to commence work on a fifth action programme for the environment. It is impossible to disagree with the conclusion that &ldquo;a more enlightened and more systematic approach to <Col N="218" /> environmental management is urgently required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is now needed is clear evidence that this sense of urgency is reflected in the practical implementation of the declaration.  We must resolutely refuse to fall into the temptation to believe that the endorsement of a ringing declaration is in itself a solution to the great world ecological issues.  We must press for immediate action by the Commission on the range of subjects covered by the declaration, and we must underline the significance of the declaration's emphasis on a guarantee of the rights of the citizen to a clean and healthy environment.</P>
    <P>The environmental area is one area in which, in the last six months, some hard decisions could have been made but unfortunately have not been made.  The question of the location of the European Environmental Agency should have been tackled before the end of our Presidency. The fact that the legislation regarding our own environmental agency will not be before the House before the end of this session is unfortunate in the context of the declarations and aims of the Taoiseach in relation to a Green Presidency. As was stated in the House on Monday last, the promise of change is no substitute for the reality of change.  Unfortunately we are not going to see change on those two issues, which should have been easy enough to achieve in the context of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>The decision of the European Council to maintain sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa is to be welcomed and the clear stance of the Government on this point is to be commended. We have heard the firm message of Nelson Mandela on this critical point of principle and practice and we must respond.  The pressures on the incoming Italian Presidency to move away from this position must be resisted and we should all commit ourselves to the continuance of a strong Irish stance on sanctions. We all equally welcome the major moves towards a settlement in South Africa and look forward to the prospect of a democratic and prosperous South Africa in which all races and groups can <Col N="219" /> participate fully in building a future together.</P>
    <P>The Declaration on the Middle East is important in stressing the necessity of continuing the peace process and the restoration of basic human rights in the occupied territories.  The support for an enhanced role for the UN in the search for a lasting peace is to be welcomed. This is a tragic and unacceptable situation and anything that can be done to achieve movement demands our support just as we must condemn provocative and unhelpful actions such as the settlement policy of the Israeli Government which fuel tensions and render dialogue more difficult.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the Declarations on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and on Drugs and Organised Crime are worthwhile exercises in building Community policies which are relevant to the needs of the moment.  The sheer scale of the Declaration of the European Council reflects the extraordinary times through which we are living.  It is very important that we try on an occasion such as this to get back to the basic principles which should inform all of our policies on Europe and on the wider world.</P>
    <P>I would assert that we must work at all times for a Community: which can meet the aspirations of its peoples to economic prosperity, job opportunities, regional balance and social justice; which is democratic with full accountability of all its institutions and with proper consultation and involvement of legitimate interests; which contributes to the solution of the great world issues of peace, disarmament, détente and development; and which balances the effects of the liberal market with policies devoted to economic and social convergence and cohesion.</P>
    <P>At a time when the pace of events is such as to place all of the institutions of the Community under great strain, it is the role of the European Council to provide an over-view and to reflect on the long-term implications of policies and of evolving situations just as much as to act as a mixture of super-executive and court <Col N="220" /> of appeal.  The two Dublin summits have turned the Community in the direction of very fundamental decisions which will affect the lives of all its peoples.  We must take care that the full implications of each and every one of these decisions are being considered &mdash; and not least the implications of economic plans on individuals, sectors and groups and of all policies on the world environment.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate my conviction that we need to equip this parliament to deal with the in-depth questions which arise for this nation in its relationships within the Community.  The Presidency has given Community matters a higher profile and we should not permit this opportunity of creating a new approach to be lost.</P>
    <P>I urge the Taoiseach, as Deputy Barry has done, to give immediate consideration to establishing and properly funding a committee on foreign affairs. It would be of enormous assistance to the Government in the development of foreign policy and in the development of a better understanding throughout the political parties in this House and throughout the country of the many complex issues which are facing us in the context of our participation in the European Community.  What is at stake is far too important for everyone in the country for us to continue in the absence of such a committee, and I urge that it be set up as a complement to the work that has taken place in the last six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Proinsias de Rossa Proinsias de Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other speakers, including the Taoiseach, should like to pay tribute to the public servants who provided the back-up to the Irish Presidency. It is clearly not an easy job in a country the size of ours and with a public service which has been depleted in numbers over several years to cope with the enormously increased workload they faced.  We should acknowledge and appreciate the effort they have put into it.  It is not stretching the truth to say the public service we have is second to none, certainly in the European Community.  It is clear that the Taoiseach and his Ministers also put very great effort into the <Col N="221" /> Presidency.  I have no doubt that they all worked very long hours.  I know the Taoiseach did so.  It is not easy to travel around so many states, meeting heads of Government and discussing major topics, while at the same time pursuing business in this House.  We should acknowledge the effort put into the Presidency by the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
      <P>In many respects I am disappointed at the political outcome of the Presidency, in terms of both the objectives set out by the Presidency itself last January and the opportunities which were presented by the developments which occurred throughout Europe during our term.  For instance, this was to have been a Green Presidency, but there is little evidence of any concerted effort by the Government on the issue.</P>
      <P>Much of the Government's action in this area was in response to existing EC regulations.  The problem of smog control is, if the House will excuse the phrase, a clear example.  Despite a pressing problem in Dublin and Cork cities where EC smog limits were breached consistently during the late eighties, the Government moved only earlier this year to tackle the problem.  This was presented as an example of the Government's commitment to the Green Presidency when in fact it was simply fulfilling EC regulations and responding to EC and public pressure that steps should be taken.</P>
      <P>No concrete action on the environment was decided, just a list of matters to be referred to the Commission.  No new role has been suggested for the European Parliament, despite the parliament's leading role in this area.  In view of the Committee's criticism of member states for failing to implement environmental Directives, I am disturbed that existing Directives are to be reviewed &ldquo;to resolve the persistent difficulties in implementation&rdquo;. This may result in dilution of the Directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only significant achievement of the Green Presidency is the Directive on a European Environmental Agency.  Even this is defective because the Council of Ministers, of which Deputy Flynn was President, refused to accept suggestions <Col N="222" /> from the European Parliament that the agency should have an inspection role or that member states should be required to supply information to it.  It will as a result have very little power to carry out an inspection of Sellafield, for instance, possibly the greatest environment threat to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Indeed on the overall danger to the environment from the nuclear area, and in particular from Sellafield and the transport of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea, the Government seem to have failed totally to use the Presidency to highlight the longstanding demand for closure of Sellafield. Indeed during the term of the Presidency, the likelihood of continued long-term operation of Sellafield received a boost with new deals involving nuclear waste from West Germany and Spain being agreed.  What type of protest did the Irish Government make on these developments and how did they utilise the position of the Presidency to the press for moves towards the ultimate aim of closing Sellafield?  If anything the Government appear to have relaxed their position on the issue of Sellafield during their term in the Presidency.</P>
    <P>At the June session of the European Parliament I suggested that urgent action needs to be taken on the movement of ships carrying nuclear waste through the Irish Sea.  These ships carry the equivalent of the amount of radiation released in the Chernobyl accident.  I proposed, given that closure of Sellafield will not be achieved overnight, that at the very least there is a need to confine these ships to stipulated sea lanes to lessen the danger of an accident involving passenger or fishery vessels in the Irish Sea.  The Government, it appears made no progress on this issue.</P>
    <P>On the issue of Sellafield I would suggest that there is a role for the Irish Government in examining how such installations can be transformed or new industries established which would absorb the existing workforce.  Over 10,000 people are employed at Sellafield. While it is essential for us to call for the closure of Sellafield, we also have a responsibility to see if we can engage in <Col N="223" /> research, possibly related to research in other parts of Europe, as to how such installations, particularly those which are arms related, can be transformed into peaceful industries.  There is a fairly strong movement in Europe for such developments.  Ireland could do well to use the expertise it has in research and development and science to assist in this area.  It is a topic which will be debated while the Taoiseach is at the European Parliament next week.  The Parliament will discuss the whole question of arms and the transformation of arms industries and the Taoiseach may have an interest in listening.</P>
    <P>I was also extremely disappointed that the draft directive on preservation of natural and semi-natural habitats was not adopted during the Presidency.  This was among the directives which were outlined for priority at the start of the Presidency.</P>
    <P>While I accept that some of the delay was due to delays in the Commission providing required annexes, the draft Directive itself is now over two years old. What efforts did the Government make to speed up the process of having the Directive adopted or to increase the proposed funding allocation for implementation of its provisions?  The present figure is only 2 per cent of the amount which environmental groups in Europe say is needed.  This is indeed a good example of how the Irish Presidency acted in almost a caretaker role, failing seriously to address many issues of importance, and shepherding the discussion on to the incoming Italian Presidency.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that such slow progress is being made on implementating an action programme on the Community's Social Charter.  Indeed in a letter dated 14 June which I received from the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, outlining the achievements of the Presidency in the social affairs area, the action programme is referred to almost as an afterthought.  We have so far little more than a timetable to examine instead of actual implementation for the provisions.</P>
    <P>The Social Charter started as a citizens' <Col N="224" /> charter but is now confined to workers' rights only.  In many cases it is simply a set of aspirations rather than binding regulations.  Having been presented with a greatly weakened Social Charter, there is now a very real danger that the Internal Market, already in the process of implementation, will be introduced without any adequate or equal implementation of the Social Charter, despite the clear statement in the Presidency's conclusions that the Internal Market and monetary union would be carried out in the context of a social dimension.  Declarations of that kind are welcome but we need to see actual progress being made. The fact that a number of European journalists walked out of a Press conference last month where the Minister for Labour was either unable or unwilling to deal with this issue shows the extent of the failure to make progress on this matter and the further problem of the rights of migrant workers.  The charter needs strengthening and expansion from being a workers' charter to one for all of Europe's citizens.  It seems to be the intention that the charter remain little more than a piece of paper allowed to gather dust while the restructuring of the internal market proceeds.  If this happends it will further erode the conditions and income of the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    <P>I am thinking in particular of the 1,000 part-time workers in Ireland.  The figure runs to millions in the European Community in total.  Beyond the workforce, the problems facing women outside the workforce, of young people and school leavers, of the disabled and of people in retirement must be addressed, as must the problems of the young homeless, who run to tens of thousands right across Europe, including Ireland.  It is all very well to discuss ideas for a brave new Europe and the ins and outs of political union but when the Irish Presidency had an opportunity to do something positive for these people in Ireland and throughout the community, it clearly failed and failed miserably.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast this with the progress reported on the implementation of the <Col N="225" /> Internal Market in the Presidency conclusions, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The European Council welcomed the good progress ... and noted that two-thirds of the measures had now been agreed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These include changes in company tax measures, liberalisation of air transport, changes in public procurement policy in the previously excluded sectors of water, energy, transport and telecommunications and, of course, rapid moves towards economic and monetary union.  Again, the social dimension is referred to almost as an afterthought, with the welcoming of a timetable for presentation and examination of the Social Charter Action Programme &mdash; and there is no word of two-thirds of that being implemented at this stage.  I wonder whether one-third will be implemented by 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I am saying there was an opportunity for progress to be made but in my view progress was not made.  I am not saying that it was possible for the Irish Presidency to have implemented the action programme &mdash; that would be total nonsense &mdash; but I have said on a number of occasions that I believe in many respects the Presidency carries forward the programme it is presented with by and large and must do the best with it and initiate what it can.  However, I believe there were areas where progress could have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are still questions that remain very much unanswered despite the rapid implementation of the Single Market. How control and accountability of the new European Central Bank will be worked out is unclear.  Questions such as the effect of European Monetary Union and how peripheral areas like Ireland will be affected by ever closer integration must be answered.  The West German Government have already expressed <Col N="226" /> their concern that a European central bank will not fight inflation as strongly as the Bundesbank and they will be seeking guarantees to protect their interest.  We must ask what pressure is being exerted by the Irish Government to ensure that the effects of ever closer integration will be adequately taken into account in European Monetary Union plans?</P>
    <P>Given the lack of moves towards economic, monetary and political union there is a need for the Government to clarify their position on the matter and to provide this House and the Irish public generally with a full insight and discussion on the issue.  Facilities for this are simply not available at present.  Even the format of this discussion, which has been referred to by other Deputies who have spoken, illustrate the inadequacy of how the issues are being dealt with by this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Allowing the parties simply to make statements on an event which will have a fundamental bearing on our future economic, social and political development and status, with no obligation on the Taoiseach to respond to the points or questions raised, is a travesty of the normal democratic process, particularly when major changes are in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>I believe it is virtually necessary, as I stated in the Dáil last week, that the Government produce a position paper on the question of economic, monetary and political union.  Equally, I recommend the setting up of a special committee to look at the question between now and the resumption of the Dáil in the autumn. In my view, the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation do not have adequate terms of reference to deal with the major issues involved and, if they are to deal with them, their terms of reference would need to be changed and they would need additional resources in order to pursue the work that is required to be done on the matter.  Indeed, we should also require that the committee produce reports: whether they come from the committee, as I have proposed, or from a revamped joint committee does not matter, but the reports should be debated on the floor of the House so that there can <Col N="227" /> be wider public debate on these issues.  It is important that sufficient resources will be allocated to ensure that the committee can carry out their work.  As I have already said, their reports should be made available to the Dáil and to the general public so as to ensure that an informed debate can take place on the implications of European Union and on the different options open to us in striving to ensure that economic and social conditions can be maintained and improved.</P>
    <P>When we discussed issues relating to the Presidency on 14 June last, I made the point that we should not look on European Union simply in terms of the existing Twelve member states of the Community.  Indeed, I was glad to see in the conclusions of the Presidency that it was made clear that it was not the views of those who participated in the Council that it should be confined.  We already have an application for membership from Austria, which appears to have been put on indefinite hold.  I notice that the question of Austrian membership is not addressed in the Presidency conclusions, much less the interest in EC membership expressed by other countries, such as Turkey, Malta, Cyprus, and the countries of Eastern Europe.  We cannot seriously hope to address the question of political union without referring to the other countries in Europe.  The fears expressed in the past about the emergence of a &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; policy in regard to relations with developing countries, now appears to be equally applicable to the countries in Europe outside the European Community.</P>
    <P>Let me return to Austria's application for membership of the Community.  That country submitted their application well over a year ago, having debated and decided on the issue in detail in their own parliament.  It would appear to fulfil all the normal requirements for membership and, indeed, would act as a net contributor to EC coffers.</P>
    <P>The problem would appear to be that Austria is an avowedly neutral country and wishes to join the Community with its neutrality intact.  That does not appear <Col N="228" /> to fit in with the plans.  Indeed, many of those countries which seem likely to become EC members in the foreseeable future such as Sweden, Malta, Cyprus and countries like Hungary and Czechos-lovakia would be able to add a strong non-militarist emphasis to the Community. I am amazed that the Irish Presidency did not see fit to emphasise our own neutrality and, second, did not seek to promote the extension of a non-militarist policy for the Community in general in place of the existing and clearly out-dated NATO mentality among the other member states.  This is particularly the case with regard to the assimilation of the German Democratic Republic into the Community.  Had the Irish Presidency nothing to say on the debate on the military status of a united Germany, other than following an approach which appears to be dictated more by decisions at NATO Council meetings than the real needs in the nineties?</P>
    <P>The question remains still to be answered whether the Taoiseach believes a united Germany should be part of NATO, should be neutral, be demilitarised or non-aligned?  Would he favour a unified Germany remaining outside NATO and being designated a nuclear free zone as a step towards creating a nuclear free Europe?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fine to adopt that position and pretend it has no impact on the rest of Europe, but clearly it has. There are at least six states, including the two Germanys, trying to sort out the role a unified Germany would have in the security of Europe.  Surely as a member state of the European Community and a part of the CSCE process and a neutral country we have an interest and a view on what precise form a unified Germany should take and whether it should be a base for nuclear weapons.</P>

      <P>It is a sad reflection on the input and achievement of the Irish Presidency that a clear exposition on our views on this issue was not made. However, the failure to specify a policy was not due to ineptitude on the part of the Government but rather to what appears to have been a substantial surrender of their commitment to neutrality. <Col N="230" /> Last week's Summit should have been used by the Taoiseach to promote the dissolution of the NATO and Warsaw Pact military alliances and that progress towards a non-militaristic Europe be placed firmly on the agenda of the CSCE Summit proposed for 19 November next.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a report entitled <i>International Meeting &mdash; What Security Concepts for Greater Europe?</i> I recently received.  The conference was held on 23-25 February 1990 under the auspices of the International Committee for European Security and Co-operation, a non-governmental organisation which monitors what goes on at CSCE for the public and attempts to have an input into what goes on under the Helsinki Act.  This report makes interesting reading and refers to the CSCE and Europe's security system.  It outlines a number of points which were made at a workshop of that committee at the conference.  It refers to such issues at the creation of a permanent CSCE secretariat, the creation of a European Security Council in the CSCE framework or a mediation machinery for disputes among CSCE member states, the filling of the economic basket in which there have been only very limited CSCE activities so far and the consideration of the formation of an all-European military force in the CSCE framework.  It also deals with the basic concepts for the future of Europe and the need to over-come the threat perceptions, to prevent the restoring of old enemy images, to work for a definition of common values, to establish a &ldquo;contract between the generations&rdquo; by devoting greatest attention to long-term problems, to the future of our planet, to make human values the basis for evolving the economic aspects of the new Europe security and co-operation system and of integrating European security and co-operation into a peaceful world structure.</P>
      <P>The rapporteur at that conference concluded his presentation by saying:</P>
      <P>I want to point out the essential elements in the Final Act of Helsinki which allows the CSCE to play such an important role now:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" />&mdash;an all-embracing view of security, outlining principles in international relations between the European States;</P>
    <P>&mdash;in the field of military security: confidence-building and disarmament;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the elements for what has now been summed up under the term &ldquo;human dimension of the CSCE&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the principles for co-operation in many areas &mdash; from economy, technology and industry to environment, education, information and culture;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the all-embracing membership, with 33 European States, the USA and Canada, all having equal voice;</P>
    <P>&mdash;and very important for a meeting like this one: the Final Act formulated already the need to inform the public of this great plan, to ask for their support.  Now it turns out that public opinion is becoming even more important.  There is a need to call on public opinion, on non-governmental organizations of many kinds, to take a share, alongside governments in the implementation of the great CSCE scheme for a safer and better life on the European continent, for friendly relations and intensive cooperation of all its peoples, and their cooperation with a peaceful and progressing world... </P>
    <P>It is important to read that into the record because on a number of occasions the Taoiseach has indicated that he favours the use of the CSCE as the framework within which a new European security system can be evolved.  That conference made a clear call for involving the public in developing that new approach. However, the public cannot be involved if they are not aware of the ideas being expressed.  They cannot know of these ideas if there is no debate going on here and no clear views are being expressed in relation to issues such as the unfication and military status of Germany.  The <Col N="232" /> public need to be involved because obviously they will be more effected by what is going on than we will be as individuals in this House.</P>
    <P>I again urge the Taoiseach to produce a position paper on the various points raised and to give serious consideration to the setting up of an Oireachtas committee to look at what we are doing, what we are involved in, our approach to the CSCE and to the intergovernmental conference which will take place in December. What will be our approach, for instance, at the assizes which will be held in Rome in October?</P>
    <P>There is a need for a public debate on these issues.  The Irish Council for the European Movement in Ireland recently held a conference and addressed the issues to which I have referred.  On 14 June I referred to some of the contributions to that conference.  There is a genuine and definite interest among the public on the issues involved and this House will be in dereliction of its duty if it does not address them.</P>
    <P>The Government have dodged these issues and we are confronted in the Presidency Conclusions with vague references to this Summit making a decisive contribution to disarmament.  What does this mean?  It means whatever one wants it to mean, and it could easily allow the continuation of a NATO military alliance simply to preserve the interests of the generals and the military industrial complex and it will no doubt be defined by the 11 member states of the European Community who are also in NATO as simply maintaining the organisation of NATO.  It is not too late to save the day.  Ireland should co-operate with other neutral and non-aligned states in Europe in promoting a policy throughout Europe where there would be no expectation or toleration of the use of military force between states.  In addition, we should take the initiative in supporting measures geared to ridding Europe of the military bloc mentality by, for instance, establishing contact with the new Czechos-lovak Government concerning the recent proposals from their President, Vaclav <Col N="233" /> Havel, for a single security system in Europe.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is the question of democracy within the European Community. The short reference to the role of the European Parliament in the Presidency conclusions leaves many questions unanswered.  Terms such as &ldquo;increased involvement for the European Parliament&rdquo; and &ldquo;possibly involving forms of co-decision&rdquo; are vague in the extreme. No progress appears to have been made in defining a future role for the Parliament since the Taoiseach referred to working-out &ldquo;arrangements for democratic control, including an appropriate role for the European Parliament&rdquo; in his address to the European Parliament last May.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has not displayed a sense of commitment to expanding the role of the European Parliament during the terms of this Presidency other than the rather negative approach of arguing that it should only take on issues with which the national parliaments cannot deal.  That is a rather negative and insular definition of the concept of subsidiarity. It is noteworthy that when that definition was offered to the European Parliament the only group in the Parliament who applauded it with any vigour and gave the Taoiseach a standing ovation were the European Right.  That is an indication of how they understand subsidiarity and if they find the Taoiseach's definition of South Africa hard to understand, we should work hard to find out why that is the case because, what is satisfactory for Europe may not be satisfactory for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>To all intents and purposes the Community already looks on and treats Ireland as simply a region in the wider EC but in future we should seek to work positively with other disadvantaged areas to seek support for approved and relevant policies for economic and social development.</P>
    <P>The Commission and the Council of Ministers are already exercising many of the decision-making roles previously reserved for national parliaments and <Col N="234" /> indeed the Irish Government are increasingly under pressure to implement policies, directives and regulations decided by these two EC institutions.  It is in this area, at least initially, that we should be seeking a greater role for the European Parliament, that is, the transfer of some of the powers which have moved from national parliaments to the EC, the European Council and the Commission.  The Parliament should have a greater role in the implementation of those decisions and their making rather than simply addressing them from the point of view of extracting further powers from national parliaments and giving them to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The fears highlighted by the President of the European Parliament, Sr. Enrique Baron, in his address to the Summit last week should be borne in mind.  He expressed particular concern over the tendency to short circuit Community institutions on important issues, such as the discussion between the four wartime allied powers and East and West Germany on German unification.  The approach of Fianna Fáil MEPs in abstaining whenever the issue of increased powers for the Parliament is raised in Strasbourg does not indicate any great commitment to having this problem tackled on the part of the Taoiseach's party.  Indeed it echoes what the Taoiseach said today, that he does not see us as having a role or a say or the right to have a view on German reunification.</P>
    <P>This short circuiting is doubly evident in the case of the European Parliament which, despite being the democratically elected voice of the citizens of Europe, is still being denied a real role in deciding policy.  The attitude of demoting the Parliament was again in evidence at the Dublin Summit when the President complained about his exclusion from the Summit lunch hosted by President Hillery. As President Baron said, it was a matter of elementary hospitality.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to redefine the relationship between the Parliament and the other institutions of the Community but again the Irish Presidency has shown a dearth of ideas on how or even if this <Col N="235" /> should occur.  At present the Commission members are not elected, properly accountable or even of a guaranteed calibre. The Belgian Government, for example, have proposed a reorganisation of the Commission, one feature of which would include its members being selected by the European Parliament.  At the very least &mdash; and as an interim measure &mdash; the Parliament should have the right to remove individual commissioners.  At present they have the power to remove the Commission <i>en bloc</i> but it would make more sense if Parliament had the power to remove individual commissioners.</P>
    <P>There will be an opportunity to discuss the future role of the Parliament, particularly <i>vis-á-vis</i> national parliaments of member states at the assizes due to be held in Italy in October.  I mentioned that I wanted to make a specific point about this.  Because of the importance of this meeting will the Taoiseach confirm that adequate resources and funding will be provided to ensure that the Oireachtas can send its full representation to those assizes?  My understanding is that the interparliamentary committee of the Dáil and Seanad have no budget to cover the expenses of such a delegation.  I also understand that, as proposed at present, the delegation would consist of eight Members from the Dáil and Seanad and, therefore, there is a need to address this question.  The committee concerned, according to correspondence I have seen, have already been prevented from participating in delegations to other countries and the only resources they have left, as far as I understand it, are the allocations which were given for the Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Taoiseach addresses the question of resources available to ensure that Members of this House and the Seanad can attend the assizes in Rome in October.  The major issues regarding the role of the European Parliament, this Parliament, the powers of the Commission and those of the Council will arise as well as the question of political, economic and monetary <Col N="236" /> union and the subjects of the intergovernmental conference on 13 December. It is important that we are represented.</P>
    <P>It is also important from my point of view &mdash; and from that of my party &mdash; that each of the parties in this House is represented.  If the delegation is confined to eight people &mdash; indeed it could be fewer &mdash; if the European Parliament so decide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am just making the point that two major reports will be discussed next week and we do not know how many people will participate in this. The question came up in Cork with regard to having 260 people from Europe and the national parliaments but that has now been reduced.  Even if the number is maintained at eight, the possibility of The Workers' Party having a representative from the Oireachtas is slim.  It is important that all parties are represented, at least one member from each party should be on that delegation and surplus places could be allocated on a proportionate basis.  The meeting is too important to restrict Members attending.</P>
      <P>On the question of foreign affairs, I am glad that it has been decided to maintain economic sanctions against South Africa. However, I am disturbed by reports that sanctions may be eased in the near future. The principle must be that only when there is profound and irreversible change in South Africa can there be an easing of sanctions.  I remind the Taoiseach that Nelson Mandela, honoured in this House earlier this week, is still denied the right to vote in parliamentary elections in his own country or even to contest an election there.  Until these and the other trappings of apartheid are removed, it is vital that sanctions are maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of the Israeli Occupied Territories, I note the support given for the holding of an international peace conference with the involvement of the PLO in an effort to achieve an acceptable settlement.  I also welcome the concern <Col N="237" /> that newly arrived immigrants to Israel should not be settled at the expense of the rights of the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories.</P>
    <P>It is wholly unsatisfactory, however, that proposals made in the European Parliament Resolution on the Occupied Territories, adopted last month, appear to have been largely ignored.  Proposals for an international commission to investigate the situation there and on the possibility of a report on human rights violations and sending a UN peace-keeping force into the region, have not been addressed.  The issue of increased political and economic pressure on Israel to bring about progress towards a settlement has not been dealt with either.</P>
    <P>There is a grave danger that if there is not a response to the consistent diplomatic and political initiatives from the PLO, the initiatives will move to those with guns in their hands.  It is disturbing that while successful efforts have been made to solve major problems in other parts of the world, the situation in the Middle East appears to be deteriorating with even a danger of open warfare breaking out in the region.  The fact that the Community continues to adopt a softly softly approach to the iron first security policy of the Israeli Government is, therefore, to be deplored.</P>
    <P>Why has so little attention been devoted to the issue of development aid in the Presidency Conclusions?  The huge debt problems facing developing countries and the chronic underdevelopment facing many African countries in particular need detailed attention.  With the end of the cold war and the resultant opportunity to divert arms spending for social and economic development, there is an urgent need for the European Community to take a more assertive position on the issue.</P>
    <P>Once again the issue of Cambodia seems to have been dodged.  The continued failure to grant economic assistance to that country, still struggling to overcome the ravages of the Khmer Rouge tyranny, is a disgrace.  The sudden cancellation of a meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and a senior <Col N="238" /> Cambodian delegation to this country in the last few days of the Irish Presidency is odd and has yet to be explained. Recently, however, the Irish Government signalled that they may finally be about to change their shameful position at the UN, which has allowed the Khmer Rouge to remain recognised in that body, despite having had no power or acceptability in Cambodia for the past decade.</P>
    <P>What was the reason for the failure to meet the Cambodian delegation?  It can only be as a result of the Government bowing to pressure from the United States, probably from China, and from those Community countries which feel it is still necessary to teach Cambodia and neighbouring Vietnam a lesson for daring to assert their independence in the seventies.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Irish Government now they have shed the responsibility of the EC Presidency, to take up more vigorously the issues I have referred to in the international area, the question of the Palestinians and the Cambodian issue in particular.</P>

      <P>When on the Adjournment of the debate, I was referring to the undertakings given by the Minister for Finance to the ICTU and the main union involved in Irish Life, the MSF, to the effect that by use of the golden share he could assure them that the substantial stakeholding by the State in Irish Life would be retained.  The Minister claimed that his retention of a golden share in this company would limit the size of individual private shareholdings after flotation and safeguard against hostile takeover attempts.  According to the Minister, legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General confirmed that the exercise of such a golden share option would not contravene EC laws provided <Col N="239" /> it did not discriminate against EC citizens on the grounds of nationality.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister to tell the House whether forthcoming EC legislation will alter this opinion.  There is currently a proposal from the EC Commission on the 13th Council Directive on Company Law concerning takeovers which may already change the basis on which the Minister gave the assurance on the golden share option.  Article 4 of this Directive would oblige any shareholder holding or bidding for in excess of one-third of the voting rights in a company to make a bid for 100 per cent of the shares in that company.  For example, if a shareholder had 15 per cent of the shares and made a bid for a further 20 per cent which would bring the total holding up to 35 per cent, then the shareholder would be compelled to offer to purchase all the shares held by others.  As I understand it, the Minister for Finance intends that the golden share proposed for Irish Life would prohibit any shareholder bidding for more than 15 per cent in the first instance.  If this Directive becomes law will the ceiling and the golden share itself be open to challenge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that worries me most about the whole development of the Irish Life privatisation saga is the misleading impressions that were given out from time to time and communicated to the public.  For example, if you were to ask the man in the street why the Government propose to privatise Irish Life he would say it has something to do with enabling them to expand into the US market.  We now know that is nonsense. Similarly, on this question of the golden share, I was led into a false sense of complacency, believing that if the political battle is lost in this House &mdash; as, regrettably, seems likely to happen &mdash; at least the Minister through the use of the golden share could retain this substantial holding.  Now it turns out from the Minister's speech delivered this morning that that is no longer the intention.  The Minister spells out the purpose of the golden share and then goes on to say: &ldquo;A special share will be held by the Minister for <Col N="240" /> Finance to enforce this limitation and the arrangement will continue in place for at least five years after flotation.&rdquo;  That is completely different from the impression I had from what the Minister was saying about the use of the golden share, and I know from very recent discussions with the main union involved, the MSF, that they understood they had commitments from the Minister to the effect that the golden share would enable them to retain this interest.  Now it looks, as Deputy Noonan described it this morning, as if the whole option of the golden share is in any event no more than a temporary little arrangement.</P>

      <P>I know he has had correspondence quite recently on this very matter from the MSF and they have specified certain questions which the processing of this Directive in the European Parliament threatens.  It seems that, depending on the priority the Italian Presidency give that Directive, it may be law later this year or in 1991.  Therefore, I look forward to hearing the Minister on this point.  I wonder whether he is familiar with the text of an article by Mr. Colin Browne, political correspondent of the British newspaper, <i>The Independent</i> of 24 October 1989.  I quote the relevant section:</P>
      <P>EUROPEAN directives on company law could block Labour's controversial plans for taking some of the privatised public utilies back into public ownership, according to John Redwood, the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.</P>
      <P>Mr. Redwood, the Minister leading Britain's negotiations on the directives in Brussels, said in an interview for <i>The Independent,</i> a takeover directive currently under discussion in the EC,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> could make it &ldquo;politically impossible or illegal&rdquo; for Labour to carry out its policy.</P>
    <P>The directive could require bidders to bid</P>
    <P>this is the relevant part&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>for 100 per cent of the stock.  Mr. Redwood said this would make it impossible for Labour to carry out its policy for some utilities, such as water and electricity, of taking a majority 51 per cent stake by taking back only 2 per cent of the shares which had been sold off.  It could also rule out Labour's option of creating a &ldquo;golden share&rdquo; to give the Government a controlling interest.</P>
    <P>It would appear that Mr. Redwood is ready to argue, according to this article, that a statutory system must have a time limit for bidders to make their moves and that he will be seeking equivalent treatment to protect the small shareholders.</P>
    <P>If we get that established, there will be an EC directive saying if you bid for 30 per cent, you have to bid for 50 per cent.  This would make it impossible for Labour to carry out its policy, </P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

      <P>The writ of our European paymasters runs on the neighbouring island just like it does here, whether we like it or not.  If this EC Commission's 13th Council Directive on Company Law concerning takeovers and other general bids becomes law, then golden shares which give governments a controlling interest in companies could be illegal, according to the British Minister. I would like to hear our Minister address that point because the Directive, as I understand it, requires bidders who are making a bid for extra shares in a company to bid for 100 per cent of the shares, if their existing holdings plus the shares they are bidding for, exceed a threshold of 33.3 per cent of the voting rights.  Member states may reduce this threshold &mdash; in Britain it is 30 per cent &mdash; but they cannot increase it.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Directive is to stop partial speculative bids for companies and to ensure equal treatment for all shareholders.  I submit, therefore, that this development very significantly changes the understanding that, for example, the staff of Irish Life and a great many members of the public have about the comfort that is provided by the golden share.  They will, of course, have a great deal more discomfiture when they read the Minister's address today which explicitly states that the use of the golden share is for a limited period, probably five years.  That is a matter that the staff in Irish Life will want to consider seriously as well as the rest of the public on whose behalf the Government currently hold the shares.  I am all the more suspicious about the motivation behind the privatisation of Irish Life when that kind of misleading inference can be drawn from official statements.  After all, this campaign has been running now for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to have a copy of a press release, two paragraphs of which I will read, that I issued in a different capacity in 1987 when the word abroad was that <Col N="243" /> we were considering the expansion potential of Irish Life because of its 90 per cent-plus ownership by the State.  We were told that we could not expand into the US because of the commercial laws applying to the US.  It became &ldquo;the man in the pub&rdquo; economics that the reason we were doing this was to facilitate expansion to the US.  At that time I made this statement on behalf of my union:</P>
    <P>Irish Life's upper management's major plank in its drive for privatisation is that it wants to expand into the world's largest life insurance market.  The ITGWU would support such a move but the union is critical of the twist that upper management is placing on this ambition, which is that half of the States prohibit companies with more than 51 per cent State shareholding from operating in their jurisdiction. This is a spurious argument in favour of privatisation.  The US economy is 170 times larger than Ireland's, and if Irish Life got a toehold in even one or two states it would be doing very well.  It is patently ludicrous to say that it must be privatised in order to trade in this vast economy of 239 million people.  Even if it is true that half of the 50 states do preclude companies with more than 51 per cent State involvement from establishing subsidiaries in them there are still the other 25 States where per capita income is two and a half times higher than Ireland's.</P>
    <P>That was ridiculed at the time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after that the chief executive again made his statement emphasising the necessity to be seen to expand into <Col N="244" /> the American market and so on, and that became the folklore about the necessity to privatise Irish Life.  From the Minister's script today we find that that was all a bag of wind that had little or nothing to do with the motivation behind Irish Life.  The description by the Minister of how Irish Life, such a uniquely successful Irish commercial State company, came into the ownership of the State or into public ownership, was that it was an historical accident.</P>
    <P>I know this Minister is given to describing historical accidents like coalitions as &ldquo;a temporary little arrangement&rdquo; but one could scarcely describe the roots and origins of Irish Life as an historical accident. What actually happened was that Irish Life had its roots in the failure of the private sector and a number of private companies.  The State was forced into the general insurance sector by the failure of the PMPA and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and that is what happened in the case of Irish Life.  The State were forced in by the imminent collapse of three Irish Life insurance companies and the threatened withdrawal from the market of a number of British companies. I would not describe that as an historic accident.  I would take certain lessons from it, lessons that would induce me to believe that it is desirable that the State retain a majority stakehold in this company.</P>
    <P>In 1938 a new company was set up to take over the business of nine of these offices.  It was known as the Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company. The Government promised to make good any deficiency and got 18 per cent of the equity for its trouble.  The promise eventually cost the Exchequer just over £1 million.  Five British offices held 72 per cent of the shares and four Irish companies the remaining 10 per cent.  Irish Life was set up as a subsidiary to underwrite new business but took over all the business in 1945 when the parent company was wound up.  In 1947 the Government bought the 72 per cent stake owned by the British companies for the princely sum of £110,000, bringing its stake to 90 per cent, which it has since <Col N="245" /> slightly increased.  The remaining shares held by the old Irish companies are now distributed among the private shareholders. The largest single shareholder after the State, with something less than 5 per cent of the shares, is the Irish Life Staff Pension Fund.</P>
    <P>By any measure Irish Life has been a success and is by far the market leader in Ireland with subsidiary interests in banking through its stake in Irish Inter-continental Bank and in general insurance through its stake in Church &amp; General Insurance.  It has recently acquired an insurance company in the United States of America and is planning further expansion abroad.  It employs almost 1,700 people and is of strategic significance in the economy given that it is a substantial stakeholder in some of the major companies quoted on the stock exchange.  This morning I instanced the role it played in the Roadstone struggle for the control of Irish cement and, subsequently, in the Irish Distillers case.</P>
    <P>Life insurance companies operate on a number of levels.  At the basic level they accept risk promising a payment on death in return for premiums and at other levels they manage the savings of those looking ahead to their own needs in the future, for instance on retirement, or the needs of their dependants in the event of death. The basic insurance role of life insurance companies is now a minor element in the total.  They are, essentially, the managers of people's savings.  The bulk of the funds under the control of life insurance companies at any time belong to the policyholders and they must share in the returns on those funds.</P>
    <P>The division of the profits between shareholders and policyholders is at the heart of the argument for capital restructuring. It has been claimed that the rights of shareholders must be enhanced if the company is to raise the fresh capital it is said to need to fund expansion.  This would mean a reversal of the capital restructuring initiated by the Irish Life board in 1972.  They did exactly the opposite &mdash; Deputy Noonan dealt with this matter at length this morning &mdash; in <Col N="246" /> that they reduced the rights of shareholders and enhanced those of the policyholders.</P>
    <P>The move made at that time seemed to make sense.  Like Deputy Noonan, I am not questioning the wisdom behind the commercial decision taken at that time.  To understand why it is necessary to know a little about the different types of policy issued by life insurance companies. At this time the most popular are those linked to unit funds.  Part of the customer's premium goes to cover the life insurance element of the policy, the risk part, while the remainder is invested in the unit-linked fund which is simply a fund of money managed by the life insurance company.  Each company could have any number of such funds, some devoted solely to shares, others to property, to high risk, to low risk, and to a wide spread of investments across all areas.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to railroad this Bill through after a debate lasting only one day.  There is also the ludicrous suggestion that we complete the Committee and Final Stages in three hours next week. According to the 1989 balance sheet of the company the assets of the company stand at £4.214 billion.  If we put this sum of £4.214 billion against GNP, and I know it is not entirely reasonable to make this analogy, one would get some idea of the size of the assets of this company.  As I said, this sum is made up as follows: Mortgages and loans, £24 million; fixed interest securities including, I presume, Government stock and other debentures, £1,355 million; ordinary shares most of which, but not all, are quoted, £1,860 million; property, including, ironically, ground rent &mdash; an issue which has been raised in this House on many occasions &mdash; £437 million; unit trusts £268 million and, deposit and short-term interest, £619 million.</P>
    <P>We are all supposed to put up our hands and say, after the minimum discussion, that we agree with handing over to someone else control of this substantial asset which has been built up under public ownership through the work and ingenuity of Irish workers and managers during <Col N="247" /> the years.  In all probability, it will pass out of the control of Irish hands.  This is inevitable once the company is floated. This morning Deputy Noonan asked the Minister to indicate in what way will the company be floated and what proportion of the shares will be offered on the Dublin and London stock exchanges as compared with the percentage offered on the Tokyo and New York stock exchanges. If someone does not have a great deal to say and supports the thrust of the Bill I suppose they can put that question to the Minister as a major issue.  I do not believe it is a major issue.</P>
    <P>The major issue is whether ownership and control should pass out of Irish hands.  Fianna Fáil instead of using Irish Life, as they claim they have done ever since the Lemass era, as a strong, major, indigenous company to create jobs in Ireland are now abandoning that tenet of Fianna Fáil economic philosophy and are going to allow this major public asset to pass out of the control of Irish people. This is most regrettable and marks a major development in Fianna Fáil economic policy.  In 1987, the leader of Fianna Fáil said to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that Fianna Fáil did not in the past and would not in the future tamper with the major State commercial companies. The shopping list of hit companies for privatisation announced some months ago by the chairperson of the Progressive Democrats has proved to be true.  This list includes Irish Steel, the Irish Sugar Company, the Great Southern Hotels Group and Irish Life.  If one of the scale and significance in the economy of Irish Life is allowed to get through the net &mdash; and it looks as if this will happen &mdash; anything is possible.  Unfortunately, that will be the decision of this House after the minimum discussion.</P>
    <P>I have made reference to the pressure which was brought to bear within Irish Life to complete the mutualisation of the company in 1972 which would enable it to compete more effectively.  There was a certain moral basis for this.  After all, policyholders had provided the funds during the years.  Therefore why should <Col N="248" /> they not get the surplus earned on these funds?  From the point of view of the management, mutualisation had much going for it since it would leave them in total control, answerable to no master other than a diverse group of policyholders who would never be able to take any concerted action.  That desire to remove any vestige of State control may have been a stronger motivation for pushing for change than any need to compete more effectively.  I ask the Minister to address this question.</P>
    <P>If the company is privatised will it become more effective and has there been a problem with its competitiveness? I ask the Minister to give us some specific figures as it is extremely difficult to deal with a company with assets of £4.5 billion without them.  On what basis are we being asked to agree to the sale of the company? Will a multiple of the normal price earnings ratio, depending on the industry, apply?  We do not know.  Will it be based on the net worth of the company as stated in the balance sheet?  We do not know.  On 14 March 1990 I asked the Minister for Finance &mdash; column No. 82 of the Official Report &mdash; in a parliamentary question whether he would make available to us the contents of the report of the consultancy that studied this question in terms of what would be a reasonable valuation to put on Irish Life.  In his reply, at column No. 84 of the Official Report, the Minister for Finance, Deputy A. Reynolds, said:</P>
    <P>...I am sure the Deputy appreciates that before one attempts to float any company on the market they would not be foolish enough to publish a sensitive and confidential financial report, especially when one considers the effect this could have on the market when one gets around to flotation...</P>
    <P>I do not appreciate any such thing.  I would like to know, as an elected representative of the people, on whose behalf the Government are holding their shares in Irish Life.  How am I to make a valuation on Irish Life shares or will we <Col N="249" /> experience the pattern that is now evident in Britain where all the public utilities have been sold off at artificially low valuations?  Within a very short time, in almost all cases, when the shares settled, it became clear that they were put on the market at artificially low valuations.  Will that happen in the case of Irish Life?</P>
    <P>I will return briefly to my submission that privatisation is a political rather than an economic question.  Economic questions that were advanced for this privatisation apparently no longer demand the same credence.  I would like to refer to a book entitled <i>Does Privatisation Work Lessons from the UK</i> by Bishop and Kay.  That book is available to the Minister and the officials in the Department of Finance and shows very clearly that in the United Kingdom the shareholders gained substantially from the privatisation programme with extremely generous discounts &mdash; which averaged 14 per cent &mdash; five times the average private sector discount and 28 times that in the case of British Airways, according to Bishop and Kay.  The extent of the loss to the taxpayer was difficult to perceive because it is a complex area where those with the requisite expertise are generally those who have much to gain, and because it involves the transfer of wealth from the passive total population to the active articulate minority.  That is precisely what happens.  It is a regressive transfer of wealth because this passive total population referred to are the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland own the shares in Irish Life.  What is going to happen? There will be a regressive transfer of wealth to what is decribed here as the &ldquo;active articulate minority&rdquo;.  In other words, only those with the money can afford to buy the shares.  This talk about a capitalist democracy, or a shareholding democracy has been shown to be a nonsense. Those holding shares in Britain have gone up from 9 per cent to 21 per cent, but studies have been done that show conclusively that within 12 months of the privatisation taking place, the share have reverted and again aggregated to the financial institutions.  The banks <Col N="250" /> and the financial institutions got back the majority of shares in a very short period, because the ordinary people do not have the expertise, the inside knowledge, or the money, cannot afford to engage in dealings on the Stock Exchange.  The professions which gained enormously, greatly assisting the big bang in the city and the development of the whole yuppie culture, included banks, stockbrokers, advertising agencies and public relations consultants.  The most expensive flotation was British Gas which cost 3 per cent of the money raised.  This may not appear to be a great deal until the absolute sum is revealed at £160 million sterling.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Wednesday, 18 April 1990, an economist, Paul Sweeney, had this to say about the UK experience:</P>
    <P>An examination of the UK privatisation programme shows that there were far greater efficiency gains in public enterprises prior to privatisation than since, and the remaining public enterprises outperformed private industry as a whole on a number of criteria.  The transformation of public sector monopolies into private ones has not led to the expected improvements in services, but to higher profits at the expense of the consumer.</P>
    <P>For example, last week it was revealed that the privatised British Telecom, whose service is constantly criticised, was over-charging its customers to the tune of stg £6,000 million a year.  However, privatisation appears to be on the agenda in Ireland and it is not unrelated to the fact that the restructuring of many Irish public enterprises has been completed and most are now profitable.  A minority of people may gain substantially, particularly if the sales are handled in the same say as in the UK.</P>
    <P>I must say since this country has the good fortune to benefit from the experience in the neighbouring island, it is most distressing that we are rushing in where Thatcher has failed.  It must be one of the ironies that the Taoiseach should be converted to the monetarist Thatcherite <Col N="251" /> position at this stage in his career.  As the tide of Thatcherism ebbs in Britain, leaving a trail of human debris, poverty and unemployment in its wake, that it should be espoused so wholeheartedly by the recently retired &mdash; as Deputy Higgins calls him &mdash; President of all the Europeans, is most distressing.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil always cherished the role of the leading commercial State companies in Ireland and were never in favour of going down this road.  One could not say that about their partners in Government, or about the main Opposition party here who made very clear this morning, despite a fancy piece of footwork by the finance spokesman who asked a number of very intelligent cosmetic questions but did not conceal the fact that Fine Gael will be supporting the selling off of Irish Life.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the major union involved in Irish Life &mdash; the ASTMS &mdash; referred to the rush to privatisation, or as it is sometimes called, the case for new capital restructuring.  They pointed out that the arguments in 1972 &mdash; about which I spoke earlier &mdash; were turned on their head. The case has been made for increased shareholder participation in the company. The fact that a case for capital restructuring has been linked by its main proponents with a case for privatisation must raise suspicions about the motives of these advocates.  I submit they are two different, distinct, separate issues.  I might quote from the ASTMS document which says:</P>
    <P>The capital of the company can be restructured without any of the State's shares being sold off to the private sector.  The reason for linking privatisation to the proposed capital restructuring may simply reflect the fact that the case for a capital restructuring is a lot stronger than the case for privatisation but there are many people who have a vested interest in having the company's shares floated on the stock exchange.</P>
    <P>Let us first look at the case for capital restucturing.  Irish Life claim that their <Col N="252" /> expansion plans will be curtailed unless they can increase their capital base.  To date expansion has been funded by retained earnings and they have been substantial, but it is claimed that these may not be sufficient to fund the type of rapid expansion which the company now envisage.  Another call on retained surpluses is the maintenance of required solvency ratios.  Expansion has been rapid in the recent past.  To date there has been no sign that the expansion has been curtailed because of a shortage of capital, but it is pointed out that these investments may need to be topped up as they themselves expand and further acquisitions are actively sought.</P>
    <P>The case is made that the company may require fresh share capital to fund this planned expansion but, because of the existing capital structure, there is no incentive for shareholders to put up extra cash; the potential return is just too small.  Since the restructuring in 1972 shareholders are entitled to only 2 per cent of any surplus distributed while policyholders must get 98 per cent.  So, if more is to be paid out to shareholders then a lot more would have to be paid out to the &ldquo;with profit&rdquo; policyholders. There is an uncertainty over the rightful ownership of the company's internal reserves.  A capital restructuring need have no major impact on either staff or policyholders.  It could simply readjust the share-out of surplus between shareholders and policyholders.  Any reduction in policyholders' rights would have to be compensated.</P>
    <P>Ownership of the company's investment reserves would also have to be decided.  It would take some time and make little or no difference to the bulk of Irish Life policyholders &mdash; those who do not have &ldquo;with profit&rdquo; policies.  There is a suggestion that the company could be restructured with a holding company created so that new non-life subsidiaries could operate completely separately from the life company.  This might have some implications for staff but they are hardly adverse ones.</P>
    <P>After the restructuring the rights of <Col N="253" /> shareholders would be such that the company would have no difficulty in getting them to subscribe new capital.  This would be the case no matter who are the shareholders. The case for privatisation is either an ideological one &mdash; based on a view that the State should not directly own profitable enterprises &mdash; or else it is based on a claim that State-owned companies are essential, inefficient, monopolistic or all of those things.</P>
    <P>The important net point is that the capital restructuring which Irish Life is said to need can be achieved without privatisation.  Without a capital restructuring, or the promise of one, no private investor would be likely to buy the shares. But that is no good reason the State should not maintain its 90 per cent stake, or at least a majority stakeholding, after such a restructuring.  Privatisation is a completely separate issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister and other proponents of the case for privatisation have advanced two arguments.  The first is based on the need for capital restructuring with the implication that this can be achieved only through privatisation.  But, as pointed out already, the company's capital can be restructured without any need to sell off shares.</P>
    <P>The second argument points to the restrictions operated in the United States against state owned companies; I have already dealt with that.  Indeed it is a particularly spurious reason to advance having regard to the protectionism operated within a good many of the states of the United States in this area.</P>
    <P>The board have decided against expansion in Ireland.  The company have such a lion's share of the life assurance market that further rapid growth is not possible but they could consider expanding outside of their core business.  That is one of the main planks that those of us on these benches would like to advance &mdash; that there is no conceivable reason the marvellous public asset that is Irish Life could not be utilised for expansion purposes outside its core business.</P>
    <P>We are now rapidly going down the <Col N="254" /> road of the other major private, indigenous companies, companies such as Roadstone and Smurfit, which have experienced unprecedented expansion but all of it outside Ireland, expansion providing employment in the United States and in other countries so that there is very little spin-off to Irish workers, to the generation of wealth in Ireland, or indeed to tax revenue from the fact that these companies are expanding outside of Ireland.  It is a tragedy to see Irish Life going headlong down that road because, inevitably, that is what will happen.  They cannot wait to get the shackles off so that they can expand into the American and other markets.</P>
    <P>I should have referred to one animus for this privatisation I passed over earlier which is the question of what it does for the advocates of privatisation in senior managerial positions.  For example, a recent survey conducted in Britain showed that, immediately on privatisation being implemented, the salaries of chairmen, chief executives and senior managers, on average, increased overnight by 78 per cent; that was the percentage increase in salaries of those former public sector managers.  Indeed, I think on the front page of today's <i>Financial Times</i>&mdash; the Minister may wish to engage in some light bedtime reading tonight and check this out &mdash; Sir Trevor Holdsworth, head of National Power, one of the about-to-be-newly privatised companies in the electricity sector, has seen his salary as part-time chairman rise to £185,000, representing precisely a 70 per cent, increase on what the full-time chairman of the total company had been earning.  That will give the House some insight into why there are chairmen, directors, senior managers and others feverishly arguing the case for privatisation &mdash; because their salaries will treble if not quadruple overnight.  In addition they will have extremely attractive share options on which they will make a killing within a very short period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred this morning to some financial information in his possession, to meetings that took place <Col N="255" /> between officials and the then Minister, Deputy John Bruton, in, I think, 1986.  I have been supplied with similar information which suggests that at one stage a document was put to Cabinet on this issue which valued Irish Life not at the £250 million ballpark figure that we have all been discussing in this House, not at the upper limits of that at £400 million, but the paper actually prepared for Cabinet listed a figure of £800 million.  I do not think that the people outside of this House, the people who put us in here, appreciate the enormity of the decision we are about to make during the course of this debate.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Arigna Coal Mines Proposed Closure:Motion (Resumed):</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy R. Bruton on 4 July 1990:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to establish an Enterprise Fund for the Arigna area, which would be used to develop alternative employment for those involved in coal mining and power generation at Arigna, and that the date for termination of coal purchases by the ESB be extended to give an opportunity for these alternatives to become established. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;welcomes the steps which the Minister for Energy is taking to examine whether there is a valid possibility for the continuation of employment in coal mining and power generation at Arigna, and the other measures being taken by him to provide alternative employment opportunities in the region.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy John Connor. A national and natural resource such as coal or coal products is most important.  We should be fully aware of their importance and where an opportunity exists to further develop such an industry we should not lose sight of the prospects particularly in areas where unemployment has affected the local economy to a considerable extent.  We should be anxious to ensure that our proposals in relation to mining or the provision of energy requirements in such areas is such that it will provide for the energy requirements and also the longterm employment of the local community.</P>
      <P>I wish to conclude now and hand over to my colleague, and hopefully at a later stage I will pursue a similar matter with the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to go over all the reasons my party have put forward this motion.  That has been well put by Deputies Bruton, Reynolds and Nealon. I will instead deal largely with what the Minister said here last night when he set out the Government's position on the social-economic tragedy of Arigna.  What the Minister said last night was sorely disappointing.  He went out of his way to belittle the contribution of Arigna Mines to the energy sector of the Irish economy for generations.  He said, not just by implication, that for the last 30 years or more the existence of the Arigna mining and power generation industry amounted to no more than a mendicant or beggar's existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is the Deputy purporting to quote me, because if he is, I do not recall having said what he is attributing to me?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is attributing certain remarks to the Minister it would be well if he did quote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>He stressed over and over again the economic contribution that has <Col N="257" /> been made to keep this place in existence for 32 years.  He mentioned the subsidy that every ESB consumer has made to mining and power generation for three decades.</P>
      <P>What the Minister conveniently forgot, of course, is that the view he was giving was hardly an objective one.  He said, line for line, what the ESB wanted him to say.  In fact his script could have been written by the ESB, or apologists for the ESB's position in his own Department. We all know that for a decade the ESB have wanted to close down this station at Arigna.  The Minister gleefully said that it takes 9.32p to produce a unit of electricity from Arigna and that it only takes 1.5p to produce a unit of electricity in Moneypoint generated from imported coal.  Of course, when one applies the most simplistic rules of economy one is bound to get a figure like that.  Moneypoint is bound to win out, because it is so much larger and because places like Arigna are so much smaller, if one applies that simplistic economies of scale formula.  If one takes each station in insolation and calculates the amount of labour costs, fuel and other fixed local charges that go in there every year, and the amount of units of electricity that come out of that power station, one will find that some stations are more efficient than others.  In that kind of comparison smaller stations always suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this simple comparison leaves out, conveniently of course, is that in a large company like the ESB there are other huge outgoings that affect the efficency and economy of the various product outlets or stations.  The ESB has a debt overhang of about £1 billion or more and a lot of that debt overhang can be traced to their newest and largest power station, Moneypoint, which cost about £750 million or £75 billion mostly paid for by borrowings.  If one were to isolate Moneypoint, and along with its fuel costs in any one year one were to add in the cost of servicing the debt, then the price of the unit of electricity coming out of moneypoint would be a lot more than 1.5p per unit.  Arigna has no borrowing overhang, and if one calculates by pricing <Col N="258" /> the average value of each unit generated to all the costs, debt service, depreciation and all that the company has, the Moneypoint unit would go up dramatically and the Arigna unit would come down.  Of course, when one wants to blacken a place like Arigna one selects one's cost to paint the worst possible picture.</P>
    <P>There are people who will say that Arigna is now 32 years old and is at the end of its useful life, and if it were to be replaced a huge amount of additional expenditure would be involved, which would mean borrowings, and that would do a lot for the formula that the Minister is applying.  But I say no.  Arigna is 32 years old, but I believe it has a useful life of 20 more years.  Most people agree that Arigna is in such good condition that it has a life span of 50 years and that gives it about 20 years to go.</P>
    <P>To all of this, of course, the Minister's sole response to the crisis is a task force, and it is all dressed up now in this new upbeat language that Fianna Fáil nowadays call being positive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>You might at least attribute the right party to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be right if I went back a few years.  The task force, we are told, was set up because the closure would cause hardship to some and if the Minister looks at the text of his speech he will find that.  One might say I am being negative when I point out the plain fact that this closure will bring hardship to all the mining families, the families who earn their living from the power station and the hundreds of families who make a living directly or indirectly from the spending of the wages earned from mining and power generation in Arigna. This closure will affect quite a number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not decry the setting up of the task force.  It is led and staffed by excellent people whose brief is to identify other areas of potential employment and nothing more.  I can already give the results of the task force investigation. They will tell us there is great potential for the lumber industry in the area, given <Col N="259" /> the huge forests in the surrounding counties, that there is potential in tourism and in the production of smokeless fuels and so on, but we have known that for the last ten years or more.  Such a task force which will have no power to direct funds into worthwhile replacement ventures is useless.  The ESB have vaguely said they will help but have not given many details, leaving themselves with options to give help or refuse it as they so wish.  I predict that in the majority of cases, whether the proposals are good or bad, they will decide to refuse it.</P>
    <P>The Government have no commitment in this regard.  Promises were made about the IDA.  The business expansion scheme was mentioned and we have been told how helpful it will be.  We have been told what the International Fund for Ireland might do to help, but not mentioned is the fact that proposed projects for County Roscommon do not benefit from the International Fund for Ireland.  We must bear in mind that the brunt of the economic decline consequent on these closures will be borne by County Roscommon, or at least a portion of north County Roscommon.  That, sadly, is the Government's response.</P>
    <P>The task force may seem respectable but their remit is to be a talking shop, to be used as an instrument by Government to talk themselves past the closures and, they hope, past the evacuation and emigration of most of the families in the area. When these families have been shipped to Britain and the US, where most of them will work illegally, the Government will disband the task force and will say to the striken community of Arigna, &ldquo;wait another while and when the sky falls we will all catch larks.&rdquo;  The Government should not be so blasé.  They have a moral obligation to this community.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last night that in the eighties various Ministers for Energy considered the possibility of a new power station to use a fluidised bed-burner to burn Arigna's low quality crow coal.  The Minister is wrong.  The decision had been made in 1979.  The then Minister, the late George Colley, announced that the <Col N="260" /> Government had decided to build a new station to burn crow coal in Arigna.  That announcement was accompanied by great political publicity, and a start up date of 1980 was given.  That promise was made over a decade ago.</P>
    <P>The ESB were never happy with this idea and they stalled the project from the beginning.  Matters were brought to a head in the general election campaign of January-February 1982.  There was a lot of local agitation, and rightly so, at that time.  People working in the mines and the power station wanted to know what the politicians had in mind.  On 14 February 1982, four days before polling day, a famous meeting was convened in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, at which a letter was read out to hundreds of people, including almost all the miners and power station workers.  The letter stated that if Fianna Fáil were re-elected they would build the new crow coal burning station and to hell with the ESB and their misgivings. It stated that this was a political and final decision, a promise given under the hand and seal of Charles J. Haughey. The speaker making the promise on that day was Mr. Haughey's then favourite and most trusted Front Bench colleague, Mr. Seán Doherty.</P>

      <P>I apologise if I cause trouble for the Ceann Comhairle but he will know I am the most obedient and, indeed, the most taciturn of Deputies.</P>
      <P>It is little wonder that promise was not believed.  Most people would not believe that such a solemn, open-ended promise could be made.  No doubt those who made the promise would have tried a short time later to deny it but we are grateful that RTE were on hand to record that event and were able to show it to the nation on a recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on the Arigna crisis.  Fianna Fáil were elected to Government and in the summer of that year surreptitiously shelved the idea of a second power station in Arigna.  The final irony was that two Cabinet Members who were part of that decision are from the area, the then Minister for Finance and Tánaiste from the Sligo-Leitrim constituency, and the then Minister for Justice from the Roscommon constituency.  Both gentlemen stood on the back of a lorry in Drumshanbo on 14 February, one read the promise and the other was there in support of it. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since and, as somebody said last night, the sands of time for Arigna are down to the last few grains.  The Minister came in here last night and said they had insisted on an extension of the social welfare service for far too long.  He said they were an unacceptable type of diseconomy whose existence could no longer be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, that is what the Minister said.  The people were told to forget about the promises of the past; it is the promises of the task force they have to believe now.  The upbeat mantra on that is there will be a skills audit and a counselling service where ambitions and attitudes in relation to alternative employment will be looked at.  The IDA will publish brochures about these people <Col N="262" /> and there are vacant advance factories in Drumshanbo.  A wood pulp industry, would not suit because, we were told last night, it would need a marine outlet.  That is the pathetic offer to this unfortunate region.</P>
      <P>In many ways it is worse than the down-right lies told nine or ten years ago about new mining and new power stations.  The people there do not believe a word of it. They want a meaningful enterprise fund to help them.  There is plenty of enterprise in the region to take up funds and make a success of small new businesses based on local resources and initiatives. A task force with no powers to do anything is useless.  A fund into which the ESB say they may put some undisclosed sum if they like the use to which it will be put is useless too.  If a single one of the 300 jobs is to be replaced there must be tangible help in terms of money.  That is the kernel of it.  There is no point in telling the community that the ESB and certain other State agencies are there to help such as the IDA, FÁS and the foreign-funded agency, the International Fund for Ireland, although we welcome everything they do.  There is no point in saying that the business expansion scheme exists to help them.  All these cannot help unless there is real money in a kitty for this area.  There is a moral obligation on the Government, given all they promised in the past, to come to the assistance of these people.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of waffle and meaningless talk about the potential help from State agencies.  It is like Robert Peel telling the House of Commons that distress in Ireland could not be relieved because the <i>laissez faire</i> economic thinking was that you could not intervene to stop people starving to death.  There is a modern parallel today.  The Minister is saying he has a quote from <i>Political Economy</i> and that they shall try to save themselves by finding resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people lack resources because mining and the allied power generating industry which began in the 1950s was all they had.  It is a mountain area and the land is of very little use.  There is farming in the area but it is becoming more and <Col N="263" /> more marginal because we have an agricultural policy which no longer wants to transfer due income supports to farmers like that.  We have the dismantling of the market supports but under the promise of the Structural Funds we were told that every pound lost to larger farmers would be replaced by a pound to smaller farmers, who would suffer even more by the withdrawal of market supports.  We have been very enthusiastic about negotiating certain market supports but far less enthusiastic when it has come to negotiating ordinary income supports for people who live at the margin in regions of this kind.</P>
    <P>This shows the total bankruptcy of policy with which we are dealing.  There is no concern for these people.  No account is taken of the fact that 300 job losses in this region impacts as badly as the loss of thousands of jobs in a major urban area.  There is no sympathy for the fact that all that awaits these people is the dole queue and then emigration.  Surveys recently conducted, which when published will certainly frighten the Government, show that parts of Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo are losing the equivalent of 6 per cent of their population per year and most of those leaving are young.  It is often said that Leitrim, the great demographic tragedy, lost 50 per cent of its people in the 50 years between 1936 and 1986.  At the rate they are leaving nowadays theoretically it would take ten years to lose more than half.</P>
    <P>The response to that reality in respect of a place like Arigna is the litany we get every day that the State agencies such as the ESB and FÁS are there to help and the IDA will publish a brochure about the green mountains and the nice setting. The naivety of it all.  Are the IDA expected to bring a major industry to Arigna when it is serviced by the worst road infrastructure anywhere in the country?  This is the greatest disincentive possible to anybody establishing an industry.  There is no way to bring in raw materials efficiently and quickly or to get out any finished product.  The people are <Col N="264" /> expected to be naive enough to believe what they are told.  I do not think the Minister fully believes what he says when he preaches in that manner.  The infrastructural services for which a Government Department are responsible do not exist.</P>
    <P>My party insist on putting this matter to a vote of the House.  We have accepted that power generation and the mining of coal seem to be at an end in Arigna.  All the forces are against those of us who do not want this to happen.  Being realists, we have to accept it.  We are asking in this non-controversial motion that the ESB should continue to accept deliveries of coal until such time as alternative employment is put in place in that area. I would sincerely hope that Members on all sides of this House would support this motion.  There is an obligation on others besides members of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and Independents.  There are Members present who have a major interest.  I would compliment Deputy John Ellis on his speech last night.  I hope that words will be matched with feet going up those steps tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take roughly 20 minutes and my colleague will take approximately ten minutes.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to welcome to the House representatives of the action group of the mines and the power station and I compliment them on their positive approach to this crisis in their area.  This is a time of major concern to them and to all the people of Arigna and surrounding regions in County Leitrim and south Sligo.  I am personally aware of the difficulties arising now and in the future in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the motion tabled is not strong <Col N="265" /> enough and I recommend that the House supports the amendment put down by the Minister for Energy, Deputy Robert Molloy which states that Dáil Éireann&mdash;</P>
    <P>welcomes the steps which the Minister for Energy is taking to examine whether there is a valid possibility for the continuation of employment in coal mining and power generation at Arigna, and the other measures being taken by him to provide alternative employment opportunities in the region.</P>
    <P>This is a very positive amendment.  I seek the support of Members for that amendment which allows the Minister and the Government to give every possible consideration to this issue.  Mining of one sort or another has been an integral part of the Arigna area for several centuries. More recently, during World War II, the coal mines performed an important function providing badly needed national fuel supplies.  With a gradual decline in demand following the war, the Government of the day decided to have the ESB construct a coal-burning power station and the station was commissioned in 1958.  The station and mines combined are now the mainstay of the local economy. However, in the 32 years since the station was built, the economies of electricity generation have changed substantially and this has led to the present situation.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment to the Fine Gael motion deserves the support of all Deputies from the area because it represents a positive and mature approach to the Arigna problem.  The present study, which is a thorough evaluation of all the possibilities for the continuation of coal mining and power generation in Arigna, is clear evidence of the Government's determination to explore fully the whole situation before any final decision is taken.  This contradicts any suggestion that decisions are being taken in the absence of complete geological information on the area.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all Deputies representing the constituencies of Roscommon, <Col N="266" /> Galway East and Leitrim-Sligo to combine in their support for the people in the area.  I had hoped, and indeed expected, that Deputy Connor would have put forward proposals instead of going back over the historical situation which has no relevance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to see the workings of the mines.  I can say without fear of contradiction that the men of the area worked extremely hard to obtain the coal for the power station and they deserve praise and credit for that work.</P>
      <P>The Government have commissioned this study in spite of earlier indications that the coal reserves in the area were not adequate to sustain viable coal-mining operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, and as the Minister for Energy stated last night, the preliminary results from his latest study are not very encouraging and we must now await the results of a joint ESB-Geological Survey analysis of the cost of mining the existing reserves.  In tandem with this approach, the Government adopted a suggestion which I had put forward for the setting up of a task force to look at the employment alternatives in the region.  This is not to prejudge the <Col N="267" /> coal reserves study; it is the only sensible strategy to adopt.  We must be prepared for whatever conclusions emerge and I have to say that, having attended the first meeting of the task force last year, I was struck by the very impressive way in which they went about their business.</P>
    <P>They gathered information on all aspects of the situation, from surveying the miners to looking at the potential for the development of the area's natural resources.  All the relevant agencies were involved: Roscommon, Sligo and Leitrim County Councils the IDA, FÁS, Teagasc, my own Department, the Department of Energy, the Central Development Committee, the regional tourism organisations, and three county development officers and, of course, the ESB.  The chairman is Mr. Donal Connolly, the Roscommon county manager. Resources had been provided to enable the task force to carry out their work effectively and Mr. Tom Lynch, the Roscommon county development officer was assigned full-time as secretary, with a base in Arigna itself.</P>
    <P>Already this joint approach, involving all the organisations which might possibly have an input into job creation in the area, has borne fruit in the shape of the Kennedy boats project, which has received funding from both the ESB and IDA.  This commitment of money by the ESB clearly shows that the board are very much aware of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Essentially, therefore, what the Fine Gael motion is calling for is already happening on the ground.  Employment opportunities in all sectors are being examined and I am assured that the IDA are giving very special attention to the area.  Indeed, contrary to what has been said by some uninformed commentators about County Roscommon as a whole, job creation in IDA assisted projects is very buoyant.  The county was the most successful of the four counties covered by the IDA Midland region in terms of new jobs created last year.  This trend seems to be continuing this year and, in addition to some projects which I have already announced, I am confident there <Col N="268" /> will be more good news before the year is out.</P>
    <P>A project in the north of the county which has exceeded all expectations is the Polar West facility at Boyle, County Roscommon.  I was pleased to present not one, but two marketing awards to the company and this marketing success has been reflected in excellent sales figures to the extent that an extension to the factory is being built and additional workers taken on.  This project is also supported by the EC.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this project specifically because it is a fine example of what can be achieved.  No one underestimates the massive difficulties which the Arigna area will face in the event of the closure of the mines, but I am confident that, with the type of determination evident at all levels, worthwhile sustainable jobs can be created, and as the Minister for Energy said last evening this would represent an improvement in an area where the entire local community is totally dependent on a single industry, particularly and industry which has suffered in recent years from huge job losses and closures all over Europe.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there are substantial quantities of crow coal in the Arigna area, the bulk of which, unfortunately, is up to 70 per cent stone, is extremely high in ash content and is not suitable for burning in the existing power station.  The question of using crow coal at Arigna station arose in the late seventies when it became clear that the main seam of coal being supplied to the power station was becoming exhausted and the quality of the remaining reserves was falling rapidly.  It was known at the time that there were considerable quantities of low grade coal in the area but it was recognised that this was not suitable for burning in the 15 megawatt station.  Everyone realised that and it was accepted.  Arigna Collieries spent considerable amounts of money in researching the burning of crow coal which is in vast quantities in the area.</P>
    <P>Following the oil crisis in 1979-80 when the price of oil rose to $33 a barrel, with the development of new fluoridised beds combustion technology which it was <Col N="269" /> expected would burn the low grade Arigna coal, an examination of using the low grade crow coal was undertaken by the ESB.  This examination led to a proposal to build a new 45 megawatt station at Arigna to be fuelled by the local crow coal with a commission date of late 1988. Unfortunately in the meantime, because of the subsequent reduction in the demand for electricity, the ESB's over-capacity and the high cost of building the station at the time &mdash; £80 million in 1980 prices &mdash; the board of the ESB deferred indefinitely the construction of the station in 1982.  This was a major devastating blow to the region.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident, of course, that certain Deputies were in Cabinet at the time, but Governments change, and they changed from 1982-87, and if there was good reason to change the decision I wonder why it was not changed in that period.</P>
    <P>I do not want to have a historical debate on this issue, that would not be of any benefit.  We will not achieve anything by debating whether Michael O'Leary, Deputy Dick Spring or Deputy Bobby Molloy was the responsible Minister.  We have a crisis on our hands and it will not be solved by scoring political points.</P>

      <P>We must try to retain and develop the maximum number of jobs in the Arigna area.  I agree that this will not be an easy task; job creation is not an easy task.  If previous administrations were aware that difficulties would arise in the area in the future why did they not set up a task force or provide alternative <Col N="270" /> employment in the area?  Unfortunately jobs were lost in the Drumshanbo area at that time but this was not the fault of the IDA.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the use of crow coal and why it was decided not to proceed with the new station.  I agree that this decision was a blow to the region because it would have maintained employment there.  Crow coal has a very high ash content but it was not regarded at that time as being economically viable.</P>
      <P>The recent geological survey report indicated that there are substantial reserves of coal in other seams similar to the main seam coal.  There is some doubt about its usability by the station and the Minister for Energy has taken the very prudent move of having a detailed study carried out on the possibility of burning this coal in the station.  I understand there is some doubt about the combustibility of this coal and the method of extracting it from the mine will have to be ascertained. This confirms the view of the action group in the area that there is suitable coal there.  They stated this at public meetings and I am delighted the geological office have confirmed this.  It is now a question of assessing the quality of this coal and whether it can be used in the Arigna power station.  I sincerely hope that this coal identified by the geological office will be suitable for use by the station and that electricity generation will continue at Arigna for years to come.</P>
      <P>However, as there is still some doubt about the possibility of using the coal at the station I do not think I should raise expectations in regard to the quantity and quality of the coal available.  The Minister clearly indicated last night that the Electricity Supply Board and the geological office will examine the quality of the coal to see if it can be burned at the Arigna power station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to maintain the maximum number of jobs in this area and the negotiations in relation to agreements being reached between a major mine owner in the area and the ESB should be postponed for as long as possible until such time as jobs are provided on <Col N="271" /> the ground.  I have stated my position on this publicly in Drumshanbo and I am making it clear again in Dáil Éireann. I am aware that agreements are being worked out at present but there are smaller mines in the area, for example, Flynn and Lehany, Wynne's and Greene's, and the station should continue to take its supplies from them as long as they are available.  This point has been made to me very strongly.  In a sense this view is incorporated in our amendment which seeks to retain the maximum number of jobs in the area. Our amendment welcomes the steps the Minister for Energy is taking to examine whether there is a valid possibility for the continuation of employment in coal mining and power generation at Arigna. I support this amendment and I appeal to Deputies from all sides to do likewise. The steps outlined in this amendment can be realised by the Government and the Minister for Energy, who has ultimate responsibility.</P>
    <P>We should all work together in trying to resolve the problems in this area.  As Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, I am endeavouring to ensure that all the resources which can be made available by the IDA, the local development teams and the task force will be placed at the disposal of the people of the Arigna area in order to provide alternative employment for them.  Ultimately, supplies will run out and we must plan ahead in order to retain the maximum number of jobs.  As I have to share my time with Deputy Foxe, I will conclude my remarks.  I hope the people of Arigna will receive better news in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Both yesterday evening and this <Col N="272" /> evening the physical facts concerning Arigna have been dealt with and it would be pointless for me to reiterate them.  The ESB have given two reasons for closing the power station at Arigna.  The first reason they gave is that it cannot be kept open on economic grounds.  They have said that the production of a certain quantity of electricity at the Arigna power station with the use of Arigna coal costs more than the production of electricity at any other power station in the country using imported coal or oil.  They are right that it is more expensive to produce electricity at Arigna but I question how much more expensive it is.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 1.25 million consumers of electricity in Ireland and the cost to them of keeping the Arigna power station in operation is the same as the price of one pint of beer per year per consumer.  It is not the same as the price of one pint of beer per day, per week or per month; it is the same as the price of one pint of beer per year per consumer. Therefore, I do not think their argument that the Arigna power station should be closed on economic grounds can stand up.</P>
    <P>The second reason they give for the closure of the power station is that its life span is over.  This power station as set up in 1958, over 30 years ago.  We were told at that time that the life expectancy of the power station would be 30 years.  It has lasted for over 30 years and experience has shown that stations similar to the Arigna station have a life span well in excess of 50 years.  This makes sense when one thinks of the life span of goods which were manufactured several decades ago, for example, cars, tractors and lorries.  The materials used in those goods several decades ago were longer lasting than the material being used today.  The life span of 50 years for the Arigna power station is a conservative estimate because people with experience believe it is the minimum period for such power stations.</P>
    <P>Nobody in his right mind would say that the mines at Arigna should be kept open if there is no coal there or the deposits are not of good quality.  Nobody is asking for that.  Nevertheless, the mine <Col N="273" /> should not be closed while there is a sufficient quantity of quality coal below the surface.</P>
    <P>To put things in proper perspective for people from city areas, the population of Tallaght is approximately the same as that of the combined counties of Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon.  It would be very easy to understand the plight of people in Tallaght if a source of employment for 300 people closed.  It is easier to understand the devastating effect of the closure of such a source of employment in a rural, mountainous area, where the prospects of alternative employment &mdash; at least in the short term &mdash; are minimal to nil.</P>
    <P>The news of the closure of the power station in Arigna made the headlines in October 1989.  The Minister, Deputy Molloy, was bombarded with advice from many quarters.  Some people recommended closing the mine as it did not have any coal while others wanted to close it because, although there was coal, it was of a very low grade.  Others, particularly those who knew the area, said that there was coal of sufficient quality in the mine to justify its being kept open.  The Minister, a wise and practical man, set up a geological group to survey the area and to report back to him.  While the final report is not ready the indications are, according to the Minister last night, that the future of the mine is quite good.  The Minister should be complimented on his initiative in setting up the survey group against the advice in certain quarters.</P>
    <P>In February of this year the task force was set up.  I thought it was merely a camouflage in view of the fact that we had been told the mine and the power station would close within a matter of months.  They have done tremendous work but I should like to remind the Minister that they are not superhuman and they could not, in the intervening months, have identified the various possible industries which would be suitable for the area in the event of the mine closing.  It would take years rather than months for such a group to identify and locate the most suitable industries for the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> In modern times, tremendous advances have been made in science and technology.  An expert who visited the Arigna area suggested that technology should be applied to the existing geological data of the area which would show whether there where coal deposits deep in the earth's crust because of geological eruptions.  No doubt, the Minister will take that advice on board to receive first-hand information on the availability of hidden coal seams.  Some months ago a group of people exploring for oil and gas in the Cavan area discovered deposits of gypsum lying 150 feet beneath the earth's surface.  If technology can pick up a deposit of gypsum, no doubt it is also possible to pick up a deposit of coal.  I hope that this will be the case in the near future.</P>
    <P>This motion should not be treated as an ordinary one before the House because it deals with the future of Arigna and the surrounding area.  Indeed it refers to the future of a whole locality.  It should cross political boundaries, and I ask all Members to vote in favour of the motion. When the Minister, Deputy Molloy, makes his final decision on the future of the mine and the power station, I understand it will be based on sound sociological grounds.  When we look back in the years to come on the happenings of 1990 in this House and elsewhere concerning the Arigna area we will say that the Minister's decisions were not only based on sound sociological grounds but also on sound economic grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the previous two speakers for sharing their time with me.  Having listened to the Minister last night I am hopeful that the results of the geological survey will show that there is adequate coal in the Arigna mine.  I compliment the Minister for carrying out that survey to ensure that every effort is made to try to keep the mines open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of the day in the fifties were concerned about Arigna and the same applies to the Government of today.  Indeed the House knows that the Government are very concerned about <Col N="275" /> this issue and that a decision will not be taken lightly.  I also joined the march in Drumshanbo on 14 February and I heard the then Minister for Energy giving a commitment to keeping Arigna open. Fianna Fáil were not in Government at the time and, as the incoming Government lasted for only seven months, it was very hard to make a decision about Arigna.  However, the Fine Gael Coalition Government were in office for four years after that and they did not make a decision about Arigna.  It is now up to this Government to make a decision.</P>
    <P>I should love to see Arigna power station kept open.  The decision to close it should not be taken until the results of the survey are known.  If the ESB cease taking coal from the mines in Arigna it will be devastating for counties Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon.  It will affect counties Roscommon and Leitrim more than County Sligo but a number of the miners live in Geevagh, County Sligo.  It will also affect Drumshanbo, Ballyfarnon and Arigna and all the small towns in the area.  This area has already a high population.  It is an area of farmers, many of whose holdings are small, consequently the incomes from them are considerably low.  If this power station and the mines close many of these people will have to emigrate or go on unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>That is not going to happen.  The task force set up will, I am sure, find some alternative industry.  There is an IDA advance factory in Drumshanbo which will be well able to cater for at least 100 people if we can find alternative employment in the Drumshanbo area.  I have full confidence in the task force.  Like my colleague here who spoke last night, Deputy Ellis, I am hoping for alternative industry if anything happens to the mines and the power station, but the power station should not close.  I ask the Minister to try to keep it open, if possible even putting fluidised burners in it to make sure it is kept open to burn the coal that is there in loads which are unsightly. A committee decided some time ago that <Col N="276" /> coal would be taken from Arigna, brought by road to Sligo, put on a boat at Sligo and taken to Moneypoint.  That never happened.  Coal is being imported for Moneypoint though we have the raw materials.</P>

      <P>Ní bheidh me rófhada. I do not want to go over ground that has already been covered but I want to make a few points.  First, I am very disappointed at the stance of Deputy Leyden who at one point would lift your heart but then suddenly you were down again.  What he was saying was that there was no hope at the end of the day really. Various possibilities were spoken of but none of them was on when it came down to brass tacks.  His entire speech might well bear the title, &ldquo;nothing doing.&rdquo; However, I join with the Minister of State in paying tribute to the joint committee established in the area for the wonderful work they have done in publicising the plight of the people there and uniting Leitrim west, Cavan, north Roscommon and that whole area, and bringing everybody into the campaign to prevent the closure of the mines and the power station.</P>
      <P>The ESB have been at all times a vital instrument in the development of the economy of the State.  Steps taken by them in regard to expanding rural electrification rapidly in the fifties and using the indigenous fuels turf and coal, were based on political decisions.  I worked for 30 years in the ESB.  I was there at the time of the development of rural electrification, of the setting up of Bord na Móna and the building of the Arigna power station.  There was much excitement in the ESB then.  They took up those Government policy decisions wholeheartedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the decisions were policy decisions.  They were not taken on economic grounds.  If they had taken decisions <Col N="277" /> on economic grounds, the turf fired stations or the Arigna power station would never have been built and we would not have had the little hand-won turf stations at Clady in Donegal and in Kerry.  There was no economic viability for the ESB in that development, but there was fantastic economic viability in it for the whole country.  In the forties and fifties the midlands were a very depressed area as was the area covered by the committee set up with regard to the Arigna coal fired station.  These decisions uplifted the whole area and were a fantastic boon.  Great co-operation between the ESB and Bord na Móna brought new prosperity to the midlands and the building of the coal fired station did the same for the Arigna area, bringing development of the coalmines and an injection of investment into the area. However, a new policy decision has been made and all that is now changed.  The policy decision to use indigenous fuels, even though they were not economic for the ESB, has been changed.  That, obviously, is a Government decision.  The Government have told Bord na Móna and the ESB that they must become efficient, that that is the business now, that there must be redundancies, that they must get rid of some of their workers, close down uneconomic stations, get with it and be efficient.  That is the new policy.  That means closing down eventually all the turf-fired stations, Arigna station and so on and finishing up with a new major gas fired station plus Moneypoint.  From the ESB point of view it is economic not to bother with these little uneconomic ventures that help only people.  They help people all over the country and they help the prosperity of the country as a result.</P>
    <P>In the 25 or 30 years since the decision was made and those power stations were built in the knowledge that there was a limit to the life particularly of turf-fired stations and coal mines, what plan did any Government produce for what is going to happen in those areas?  Running around thinking of new jobs here and there is ridiculous.  What plans were made for this?  No plans were made for it and those <Col N="278" /> areas are just as dependent today on the power stations and on turf and coal mines as they were 25 or 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is odd that when the ESB were doing all this they were at their weakest.  They were struggling to expand, to extend rural electrification and build new power stations as rapidly as possible in order to keep up with the demand for supply. Nevertheless they proceeded and they helped the whole development of those depressed areas.  Now the ESB are rich and powerful.  They have ample capacity without further capital investment.  They have a large surplus of income over expenditure for the first time and at the moment the extra costs of maintaining the ESB coal-fired power station in Arigna would be as imperceptible in the ESB accounts as a wart on an elephant. It would be as nothing compared with what it was in the fifties and sixties.  It need not cost the ESB one penny more because all the Government have to do is stop putting their hand in the ESB till. The ESB are not allowed under Statute to make a profit so the Government have been creaming off the surplus by way of levies.  Last year in addition to the levy, the Minister for Finance just grabbed a few more million pounds from the company. The Government should cease doing that and allow the ESB to continue with Arigna power station and continue with the turf-fired stations.  There would be no cost to the consumer if the ESB were allowed to do that job from their surplus.</P>
    <P>I dispute the figure given by Minister Molloy last night with regard to the unit cost of electricity for Moneypoint.  That was in fact the unit cost of production without taking into consideration the £1,000 million construction cost of Moneypoint and so on.  The minimal extra cost to the ESB would be as nothing.  It would be far better for the economy generally if the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance would leave the money with the ESB and allow existing stations to continue at least for another eight to ten years to give opportunity for development.</P>
    <P>The ESB, in a report in 1975, said that <Col N="279" /> there was up to 20 years' supply of coal, so even on their terms they are closing down five years too soon.  The ESB did not refer to any problem with regard to the life of the power station.  The power station at that time was considered quite capable of surviving until 1995.  There is no reason for the power station not to continue for another seven to ten years in order to give the Government an opportunity to develop plans for alternative employment and to assess the viability of a crow coal station.  I do not know anything about it but the commission who have done their homework about this maintain that despite the huge ash problem it can be disposed of as there is a demand for the ash from the cement industry.  I would therefore ask the Government to carry out a further study as to the viability of a crow coal power station and, in the meantime, to stop robbing the ESB till and allow the station to continue for another eight to ten years.</P>
    <P>I support the Labour Party amendment asking the ESB to continue the contract for the supply of coal to the power station until the full implications of the survey are available.  I also agree with the proposal which calls for the continuation of the ESB power station until further alternatives are available.</P>

      <P>Many on this side of the House listening to the Minister last night were very depressed by the scenario he painted.  When Arigna was established it was established with the explicit recognition that this was a region with particular economic problems, a depressed region which needed the support of this major employing industry.  The Minister said last night that things are not as bleak now as they were in the fifties and suggested that the social arguments for maintaining employment in this area are no longer as strong.  All the statistics for the region would dispute what the Minister said.  Emigration is reaching proportions that have not been known in this area for many years and surpasses the bleak years of the fifties.  The alternative employment opportunities in the area, as the Minister <Col N="280" /> recognised, are very slim.  The Minister must look at this sector in a special way and not simply by comparing Moneypoint and Arigna.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister quoted figures for the cost of producing electricity at Arigna compared to the cost of producing electricity in Moneypoint.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, those figures were selective in that they ignored depreciation and interest charges on the major investment in Moneypoint.  We must realise that this plant has succeeded in operating efficiently throughout its life and a great achievement of the people in the area is that they have kept its performance up to a high level.</P>
      <P>We must cast our minds back to the real economic difficulties we faced in 1979 and in 1980 when energy prices rose to unprecedented levels.  At that time public policy recognised the invaluable contribution Arigna was making and it was Government policy to establish another power plant in Arigna to further develop that indigenous resource.  The Minister has said that now that prices have gone down that proposition is no longer viable and cannot be considered. Arigna served the community well at a time when we had no indigenous resource to turn to, except peat.  Arigna provided competitively priced electricity in the eighties.  It was then economic and very acceptable and Governments were delighted to have it.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that things have changed and the ESB face a £2.8 million handicap by continuing to operate this station.  What will happen if these workers are laid off and go on the dole? The Government will pay out about £1.5 million in social welfare to these workers and their families and will forego an equivalent sum in lost tax and PRSI payments. The £2.8 million handicap would be wiped out by what the Government would have to forego in tax revenue or pay out in social welfare.  We must look at it in that context when examining an area like this which has been dogged with major employment problems over the years.  It is crucial to keep job opportunities alive for these workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> We can recognise that in the long term there will not be such a great future for a power station in the area, if the Minister's figures stand up but, on the other hand, the Minister told us that there are very encouraging signs from the geological surveys showing that there are further reserves to be exploited, and that there is an opportunity for development.  What I find incredible about the Minister's position is that he is quite happy to countenance the closure of mines and the dispersion of a valuable workforce of 200 skilled mining people while he says that he hopes there will be a future for coal mining in the area.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister say that we should disperse the workforce while he continues to study the possibility of producing new resources and expanding the industry once again?  The Minister said last night that we should wait and see and that in about a month he might have the report of the task force and the geological survey.  Does the Minister realise that in a month the mines will be closed and the workers will be gone?  The hour glass is running out for these workers.  There is no point in the Minister saying that he will come up with ideas as to how this industry can be kept going for many years to come, while allowing the mines to be closed down while the Minister studies the opportunities.  We have here an area involving six parishes and four counties. Not only are the 200 people concerned earning an income for themselves and their immediate families they are also doing so for the region where there are very few other wage packets of the scale involved.  We simply cannot say to the people living in that region that we are to go ahead and close the mines and that perhaps at some stage in the future we may come up with an alternative.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister gave us very depressing news in relation to the setting up of a wood pulp industry in the Arigna area.  Many peope had hoped that such an industry would be the source of alternative employment for the workers of Argina.  The Minister went on to say that a location in the north west would be suitable but added that Arigna did not <Col N="282" /> appear to have the advantages required. This nails one of the possible recommendations of the task force and one opportunity for workers in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the estabishment of a task force but it has to be said that this proposal was made at the eleventh hour. The task force was established in February when political pressure in the area was mounting and the Minister wanted something to hide his nakedness.  It is too much to expect a task force to come up with viable projects in a matter of five or six months.  To date, there are no signs that any viable projects have been found.  I searched the Minister's speech in vain for any solid project about to be established to offer employment for those living in the area.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that the task force have not found it possible to achieve results in the time available to them.  It takes time, certainly longer than six months, to come up with viable projects on the scale necessary.  I do not believe for one moment that the report of the task force when it comes to hand some time after the mines have been closed will suggest viable projects to be set up as alternatives.  History shows that the promises made have not come to fruition. The people of Tuam, Thurles and, indeed, Ballyforan in County Roscommon would testify to the fact that these promises have not led to the creation of employment which is badly needed.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons the Minister should take on board the suggestion that we postpone the closure of the mines and give the task force more time to come up with projects.  I was somewhat puzzled when the Minister indicated last night that it would be insane to continue to mine coal beyond the end of July.  In February the Minister thought the sensible thing to do was to continue mining beyond the end of March, the proposed closure date.</P>

      <P>The impression we got is that it would be extremely difficult to continue mining beyond the end of July. We will have to recall that the Minister recognised in February that the proposed closure date of the end of March would have to be extended to see if alternative sources of employment could be found. We are now approaching the end of July, yet we have nothing to offer to the people of the area.  How can the Minister expect those people to believe him when he says that we should let the mines close and that we will come up with alternatives in the future?  If the mines close amd the workforce are dispersed they will soon find that they are unable to pay high mortgages or to continue to live in the area.  Even though the Minister may be committed to coming up with new ideas people will not wait if they have no wage packet coming in to repay their mortgages or sustain their young families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion offers the Minister the opportunity to extend the proposed closure date and come forward with new ideas.  I hope that alternative employment can be provided in the mining industry but I accept this may not be possible. Last night the Minister dismissed the idea of establishing an enterprise fund which is at the heart of the motion.  He said it was not necessary to establish such a fund.  He also indicated that the Government would support any viable project. <Col N="284" /> As I said, those facing the prospect of collecting the dole at the end of the month will take no encouragement from the Government's commitment to support any viable project.  Therefore I ask the Minister to think again and establish an enterprise fund.  I would also remind him that the workers have not been idle and have come forward with very solid suggestions on what can be done to improve and develop their area.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an enterprise fund is at the heart of their proposals. This fund would be made up not only of funds provided by the ESB, who have expressed a willingness to provide funds, but also funds provided by the Government. I can well understand the reason the establishment of such a fund is at the heart of their proposals because without money the task force is working with one hand behind its back.  The way in which other countries provided assistance once industries began to decline was through the establishment of a fund, with the workers, businesses in the area and the local authorities and agencies getting behind it, to fund viable projects.  The establishment of an enterprise fund lies at the heart of the strategies adopted in the UK and other western European countries whose coal industries are declining, with small and medium-sized enterprises being able to tap this fund. The Minister is not being sincere when he ignores the examples which have been given.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that our solid fuel industry is not the only one going through a very difficult period.  At present Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and France are undertaking massive revitalisation programmes in their coal regions.  What we are seeking this evening is a revitalisation programme for the Arigna area in the same way as the German, British and Spanish Governments have drawn up revitalisation programmes for their coal mining regions.  It is crucial that we, too, travel along that road.  I doubt if there is anyone who would criticise the Minister for establishing an enterprise fund given that other European countries have established <Col N="285" /> such funds with European Community funding.  It is a tragedy that the Government last year did not avail of the opportunity to seek European Community funding for the task force and an enterprise fund.  Such funding was made available under the Rechar programme to be invested in depressed coal mining regions.  Unfortunately, the Government let this opportunity slip.  Because of this blunder there is an onus on the Government to come up with a sensible set of proposals before the mines close to ensure that alternative employment is made available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> I would ask the Minister at this stage to reconsider our proposal.  I am happy to accept the amendment offered by the Labour Party.  It amplifies our existing proposal.  I hope that the Minister at this late stage will see the wisdom of what the workers and the community in the Arigna area have put forward in the way of an enterprise fund as a solid way forward to exploit not only the coal industry, which hopefully will be a viable prospect, but also the very many other economic opportunities that are available to the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of this debate I was about to conclude by saying that The Workers' Party will be opposing this Bill.  As far as we are concerned the capital restructuring of Irish Life is a completely separate issue from its proposed privatisation.  A case may be made for a restructuring &mdash; which would give shareholders a right to a greater share in the company's profits &mdash; but this is not a case for privatisation.  Those pushing for privatisation are trying to merge the two issues simply because the case for privatisation is so weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Life board have taken the decision to maintain their dominant position in Ireland and to expand abroad. This is exactly the same corporate policy adopted by companies like Cement Roadstone and Smurfit whose growth abroad has produced little benefit in Ireland.  The expansion of life assurance business abroad is likely to produce even less benefit at home because of the need to meet the requirements of local states with regard to investment policies and so forth.  Indeed, initially it is likely to drain <Col N="289" /> capital out of Ireland to meet foreign solvency ratios.</P>
    <P>Experience in Britain would indicate that the financial community has a lot to gain from the offer of sale of Irish Life shares.  The costs of such an issue would be heavy.  There would be rich pickings for stockbrokers and the financial institutions from fees and commissions.  The relatively small number of private Irish Life shareholders, who include some stockbrokers, would make a killing in the event of privatisation.</P>
    <P>Irish Life hold strategically important stakes in a wide range of Irish companies; its vote maintains Cement Roadstone Limited in Irish hands and could have determined the outcome of the battle for Irish Distillers.  It may not be possible for the State to maintain voting control of Irish Life in the new circumstances.</P>
    <P>The sale of Irish Life would be in clear breach of the commitments given by Fianna Fáil in the very recent past and would be in conflict with the spirit of the commitments given by the Government to the unions during negotiations for the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which have not yet expired.  The pressure for privatisation is coming from speculators who would wish to make a killing on the Stock Exchange in the event of the sale and from senior management within Irish Life who would stand to benefit financially from privatisation as they would then be freed from Government imposed restrictions on salaries of executives in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Given the experience in the case of the PMPA and ICI &mdash; both of which had to be rescued by the State &mdash; it would be an act of folly to risk handing over Irish Life to the private interests who made a botch of both those companies.  If Irish Life has to be sold off if would be virtually impossible to prevent its control passing outside the country.  The main argument advanced for its privatisation is the restrictions which exist in some States in the United States on State-owned companies. I contend it would not be beyond the ingenuity of Irish Life to find a way of operating within the existing US legislation, so that argument no longer holds <Col N="290" /> water.  As one of the most important financial institutions in the country, Irish Life should have a crucial role to play in stimulating employment, especially in the construction industry, and would be a major force for urban renewal.</P>
    <P>The priority should not be expansion in the US but increasing investment here. Irish Life, unfortunately, was just the first target.  If the Government are successful in steamrolling through the sale of Irish Life to private interests, then we can expect a number of the more profitable and successful State companies to follow. Irish Life's contribution to the economy cannot be measured simply in terms of the dividend paid to the State but rather in terms of the impact that the proper use of its assets, which are worth about £4.5 billion, could make.  The suggestion that the proceeds of Irish Life could be used to reduce the national debt makes very little sense.  It is tantamount to selling off the pots and pans to pay the gas bill.</P>
    <P>It is a shame if the Government persist in their determination to take the Committee and Final Stages of this Bill in three hours next week.  A great deal of misleading information has been put out about the significance of the decision we are about to make.  Even the commitment so recently given by the Minister for Finance concerning the use of the golden share has been proved to mean, according to the Minister himself, that he is only going to hold out the prospect in order to kill off the golden goose.  What he is doing is tantamount to theft on a large scale from the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this major legislation.  I compliment the Minister for Finance and the Government on bringing it forward. Unlike the two previous speakers I am satisfied that the Government are taking the correct road in agreeing to the privatisation of Irish Life.  The original corporate objective of Irish Life as set out in its memorandum of association was to carry on the business of life assurance. The context in which it was established was such that it was to act as a rescue agency for several small firms who got <Col N="291" /> into difficulties in the thirties.  That objective has now become irrelevant and the company has formulated a new corporate strategy.  Indeed it is interesting to note that similar circumstances occurred recently in the insurance field when the Government had to step in in a similar capacity to help out in regard to PMPA and ICI.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed in July 1988 that Irish Life should be restructured to facilitate its development as an Irishbased institution in the financial services area.  It is important to reiterate that privatisation would enable Irish Life to overcome, on a permanent basis, the problem of the legal objections of certain states in the United States to foreign Government controlled companies operating within their jurisdiction.  It is only fair to say, because it has been mentioned by a number of speakers, that Irish Life are in fact doing business in the United States. They are, however, doing so by means of a back door method which a French company used; the procedure was called the voting trust where a majority of the trustees of these companies were to be US citizens.  While this might be a shortterm solution to getting into the expanding US market, for an international company of the size of Irish Life a more permanent footing is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Life has, for some time now, sought a change in its structures.  This will have the effect of allowing Irish Life to expand and it will also allow the State to realise some of the assets that could be used to benefit the Exchequer.  Some recent figures have been put on the value of that to the State as being £250 to £300 million.  Apart from that there is also the added interest which normally the Government would have to pay to service such a loan, and if this were to be used to defray some of the colossal national debt which we have, about £2,000 million, that £250 million might seem insignificant. However, if the £20 to £25 million interest payments which occur on an annual basis were to be added to it, over a ten year period the Exchequer <Col N="292" /> would see the value of realising some of its assets in Irish Life.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that the unions in Irish Life are dissatisfied with the privatisation of their company. It is worth noting, however, that the Minister and the Government have secured in the legislation the golden share option and this has been used successfully by the British Government in the privatisation of such companies as British Gas, Jaguar, Rolls Royce and the British Airport Authority, where it has worked very effectively.</P>
    <P>It is important not to underestimate the value of Irish Life in the Irish assurance market.  It is the leading company in this market, currently holding something like 40 per cent of the Irish assurance market with total funds and reserves now in the region of £4.56 million.  Great credit must go to the management of Irish Life for the manner in which they have conducted the business of Irish Life because they have been allowed by successive Governments to work on their own, independent of departmental or Government interference to a large extent, and the company have been successful within the confines of the legislation and how they can operate.  They have been hamstrung by legislation and from a general viewpoint I do not think there is any reason for the State to involve itself in life assurance. I do not, therefore, understand some of the comments from the Labour and Workers' Parties as to why they do not see a bright future for the company as an independent, to a certain extent, commercial entity.  It is worth noting and restating that the Government will not give total control to the private sector in this.  They will have a major role to play in the new company that is set up.</P>
    <P>A lot of comment has been made about the solvency ratios of Irish Life.  Irish Life are rather unique in that they enter into commitments with policyholders which extend over many decades. For that reason the consumer must be satisfied that the office will be there to fulfil its commitments when these policies mature.  A much higher level of solvency <Col N="293" /> is demanded of life assurers than of most other forms of enterprise.  The life assurance company must not only demonstrate that they are not insolvent in the conventional sense, that assets exceed the real value of liabilities, but that they possess a great degree of solvency.  In the first instance, they must demonstrate that they have assets in excess of their actuarial liabilities.  As I understand it, these are assessed within the regulatory constraints by the company themselves, having regard to future projections.  In addition, the company must have sufficient surplus to meet future requirements. It is important to state that the purchaser must have confidence in the company with which he is dealing.  It has been proved down through the years that Irish Life's policyholders have the utmost confidence in them.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the company have worked with little if any direct interference from the Government.  They have been allowed a free hand with minimum State interference.  This company have succeeded in what many people would say is a very competitive area. Given that they will now be freer to seek business and to seek funding from outside the State, they can continue to prosper. From the point of view of the State and the Government, we can get a better return on our investment.</P>
    <P>The primary function of this legislation is to enable restructuring to take place, and the sooner this happens the better. For a long number of years we have been listening to commentators saying that Irish Life should be privatised as soon as possible.  It is timely that that is happening now so that the new companies will be set up and ready for the internal market in 1992.  As a quoted company, Irish Life will have access to very substantial resources which will assist in their expansion not just at home but also abroad.  As a result of the internal market there will be great potential for this new company.</P>
    <P>The sale of the Minister's shareholding following restructuring will yield a significant capital gain which can be used to the benefit of the Exchequer.  It is <Col N="294" /> important that this matter be referred to again.  Because of the substantial burden of the national debt and the interest payments on that debt, it is important that the Minister should do everything within his power to try to reduce that debt.  It is also important that the company develop their management skills further in order to take advantage of the opportunities afforded to them following the passage of this legislation.  As I have said, the track record of the company has been first class to date and I have the utmost confidence that they can build on their successes.</P>
    <P>Finally, we must build on the strength of the successful firms in this country in developing the economy further.  We will need to rely on the skills and experience of companies such as Irish Life to ensure that every advantage is taken with the opening up of the financial markets in the EC in 1992.  I hope this legislation will be passed not just by this House but also by the Seanad, prior to the summer recess. I wish the Minister every success with the legislation and I wish the new restructured company continued success.  I have the utmost confidence that they will become a major financial player in Europe after 1992.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike most other people in this House, I do not have hard and fast views as to the correct procedure to follow in relation to this legislation.  I have listened to the previous speakers extol the virtues of privatisation and public ownership.  Solid arguments were put forward on both sides.  There is a lot of expertise in this House and, indeed, outside it.  I often wonder how one would define &ldquo;expertise.&rdquo;  I used to believe that the real experts are those who know when to call in the experts, but I am not sure if that is valid at present.  Quite valid arguments have been put forward both for and against privatisation.  In the past, both in the case of public and private ownership, difficulties have arisen for a variety of reasons, some due to market forces, some due to bad management and some due to circumstances outside the control of the companies concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> As previous speakers have said, the origins of Irish Life are well known.  The company were formed as a result of the collapse of a number of companies and the need for insurance cover in various areas.  Since then, admittedly, developments have taken place which seem to raise the question as to the validity of continuing on that course.  Arguments have been put forward by Deputy Rabbitte in relation to the attractiveness of privatisation as a means of getting away from public service pay embargoes and so on.  This brings us back to the arguments we have often heard in this House regarding the need to provide for our public servants an adequate pay structure so as to attract the right people into the service.  That argument is not valid at present.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether we can take the question of privatisation versus public ownership in isolation or whether we have to examine, as previous speakers have said, the implications of 1992 and liberalisation and the effect it is likely to have on the State or semi-State sector. Without doubt, the effects on the insurance industry will be considerable, both positive and negative.  One question which comes to mind is whether the changes that will take place will be beneficial to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Irish Life have been a very successful company and have provided a great service to the people.  I will deal later with the difficulties experienced by the consumer on occasion in extracting from assurance or insurance companies their rewards at the time they are due. Generally speaking, Irish Life have done a good job and have come through the difficult times of the late thirties, the forties and the fifties.  It has laid a very firm structure on which to operate.  The question arises as to whether they might be better served by being private or semiprivate. The procedure proposed by the Minister is probably based on the British model which has seemed to be fairly successful so far.  However, there are downsides. The Minister could find himself at some later stage having to face a liability <Col N="296" /> in the event of some difficulty arising and pressure being brought upon such a company, since developments of a highly competitive nature are likely to take place.  Murphy's law must always apply &mdash; if something can go wrong it will go wrong.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to have adopted the policy of realising certain assets in order to balance the books or improve the budgetary position.  That is quite all right.  The previous Fianna Fáil Government decided on an extensive campaign of realising assets in the national housing stock and bringing forward ten years' sales in order to capitalise and achieve a lump sum in a single year. It was very successful but there will be a void for at least eight or nine years to come.  No Minister can dip into that area for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>In this case we are informed, according to today's Press, that the Minister was somewhat concerned at what he saw as the lethargic progress of this Bill through the House.  He saw this as an impediment to his objective of balancing the books. Once this asset is realised it will not be available for future use.  There could well be a negative element in the event of international competition creating a situation where the Minister might inherit a liability.  That element has not been referred to, except by my colleague, Deputy Noonan.  With all the positive elements of such packages there is also the other side of the coin.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the general insurance and assurance position and ponder on how this is likely to develop in the years ahead and whether it will be to the advantage of domestic consumers, both policyholders and shareholders, many of whom may be outside this country after the passage of this legislation. In the free and open market there is likely to be less emphasis by an international company on ensuring that the bulk of their business is carried out on home soil.  It is a very competitive business and many of the multinationals, some of them Irish corporations, have found it more lucrative to operate abroad <Col N="297" /> rather than at home because the economic base here is somewhat limited.  This brings us to the reason for proceeding with this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that life assurance and pensions seem to be lucrative areas, while motor, fire and other high risk areas are not so lucrative and there is no rush from any quarter to become involved in this sector of the market.  I regret that a little more care and attention has not been shown for those areas which have caused considerable problems for Irish consumers over several years and will continue to do so for years to come.  Is there any way the Minister could introduce some element which would be seen by the people who seek motor and fire insurance to protect their interests in that they may see on the horizon the possibility of reduced premiums?  They are two separate areas but it is all insurance or assurance.  The average Irish consumer will see a new company of international standing forging ahead and will ask why some of the benefits of this expertise cannot percolate into the area of motor insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is deviating somewhat from the subject matter of this Bill.  He may certainly make a fleeting reference but he should not continue to deal with a very distinct and separate aspect of insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to this because it is an issue I have raised on numerous occasions.  It is raised every time life assurance is discussed.  Questions are asked as to why one side of the insurance industry is so profitable and the other such a burden on the consumer.  The point is well made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibility of any insurance company to policyholders has been discussed at considerable length by speakers on both sides of the House.  I hope this responsibility will be borne in mind by the company under the new structure and by the Minister.  He should use his influence through the agency which will remain open to him in the new structure <Col N="298" /> to ensure that the interests of policyholders are brought to the fore and that they get the benefit.  Their money will provide the cashflow and it is important that the interests of those people should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I compliment Irish Life and other companies in the same business on the work they have done in providing pensions and life assurance.  They have done an extremely good job, sometimes in a rather difficult climate.  Many firms have availed of facilities offered by Irish Life. The construction industry organised pension schemes through Irish Life which were years ahead of their time and gave great financial support to the people involved in that industry.  From my dealings on behalf of constituents with life assurance companies there has often been a reluctance to place the same emphasis on the small print at the bottom of the page compared with the large, glossy, glaring headlines at the top of the page.  Very often when somebody dies unexpectedly the company goes into the long history of the cause of death and why a certain condition was not brought to the attention of the company at the time.  In the context of the proposals before us now, I wonder whether matters will change for the better or for the worse.  There may well be a tendency for things to change for the worse from the policyholder's point of view, but I sincerely hope that will not be the case.  I am not referring specifically to Irish Life but this applies to almost all companies who deal in this type of insurance. Obviously life assurance has been regarded as a lucrative area.</P>
    <P>How well will the newly named Irish Life Company compete with companies from France, Germany and Holland in the period post-1992?  I know the Minister and various Members, including some on this side of the House, will say that they will compete more effectively on the basis of the proposed structures than they could have done otherwise.  The same argument has been applied to the cooperative movement.  However, questions have been raised in recent times as to whether that is true.  Again, it may be <Col N="299" /> no harm to weigh the benefits against the negative aspects and we must ask whether circumstances will be similar in ten years' time as they are now.  We should also consider how the company will react to competition from European companies who will be able to operate there in a free market.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte quoted a former managing director of Irish Life suggesting that we move more money out of the country, but I cannot verify that other than say that I heard it in the House today.  If there is a recession in this country, or the economy is in the midst of a downturn, the tendency is to move money out of the country.  That may have the effect of giving the company an immediate artificial injection, but it does not do a great deal of good for the country.  If a company's development has slowed down, or failed to make progress, one of the oldest and accepted ways of dealing with this is to trade out into a better area through the procedures that are normally available to them.  That applies, in particular, to the property market in which insurance companies, and Irish Life in particular, have a considerable interest.  However, the tendency to take the easy option and to move money into what appears to be more lucrative areas is all very fine but if you want to make real profits &mdash; that being the general idea &mdash; the obvious thing to do is to reinvest where you are, even when times are bad, on the basis that you will get the benefit when improvements come about.  Insurance companies, the banks and the building societies and all those involved in lending money to the building industry find it hard to accept that fact and they find it very hard to wait while they find it quite easy to sell their mortgages, insurance policies and pension plans.  This should be borne in mind in case at some later stage if the economy is not going too well two or three large insurance companies decide to move out of the country in order to protect themselves and improve the structure of their own firms.  I do not think this is necessarily a good thing.  I think there is room <Col N="300" /> for a blend which should not necessarily be dictated by the health of the economy in the parent country at any given time.</P>
    <P>We saw the collapse of ICI and PMPA &mdash; two totally different situations, of course.  Problems arose within these companies in the past five or six years.  The State had to bail out these companies which had traded into difficulties.  They did not get into difficulty overnight and this did not befall them some morning at 5 p.m. or at 9 o'clock when the computers went into operation.  It happened over a period of time.  During the ICI debate, I remember asking why nobody had shouted &ldquo;stop&rdquo;, or nobody had put the brakes on, and how the situation could have developed to such an extent that a problem affecting the whole insurance and banking industries should suddenly have erupted with possible dire consequences for the Exchequer and for the whole country.  I hope we have learned a lesson.  I hope there are sufficient safeguards in this legislation to protect the Exchequer, the taxpayer and, indeed, the economy as a whole.  Many of these corporations have far bigger budgets than this country has.  The frightening aspect is any move out of the country, particularly by companies who have had the advantage of having been State or semi-State companies and have benefited from that protection over the years.  While it is easy to say they can develop better in open markets, we must ask whether they are fully aware of the competitive element they will face as soon as they are in the open arena.</P>
    <P>Again and again we hear about the level playing pitch in the post-1992 period.  We hear about the goal posts being moved or changed, perhaps the goal posts may be narrowed in the future which will make matters more difficult or, at least, seemingly more difficult for companies who have enjoyed the privilege of being State or semi-State companies sheltered from the threat of outside predators.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would again like to comment on the building industry which I have already referred to briefly.  I hope we will not be in the situation where this <Col N="301" /> company, or a multiplicity of companies, might find it more lucrative generally to become involved in the construction industry in other countries at a time where there is a downturn in our own economy.  If that were to happen we could have a very serious problem on our hands.  The company would have a very healthy balance sheet and operate satisfactorily but they would have moral and financial responsibilities to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>The State used to provide funding for low cost housing for those in the lower income group but the number of people now in that market are very few and far between.  I am sure that we will have the opportunity to refer further to this point in another debate.  I would point out to the Minister that the majority of Irish people are not multimillionaires and those people on low incomes cannot get large mortgages from insurance companies, banks or building societies, nor can they get SDA loans or HFA loans.  I am sure that other Deputies would agree that the number of people in this position is growing.  People who have good incomes and the ability to save can get loans from an insurance company, building society or bank but the people who would previously have qualified for an SDA or HFA loan are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain house mortgages.  In the event of the State not directly providing loans for these people there should be a moral responsibility on companies such as Irish Life to make some provision for them.  In fact, the Minister for the Environment has stated that these people should apply to such companies for loans.  The chances of these people obtaining house finance at present are very slim, and they are getting slimmer.</P>
    <P>With the growth of &ldquo;yuppieism&rdquo; over the past couple of years there seems to be a tendency to accept the standard that the fittest shall survive.  We are inclined to forget and neglect those people who ten years ago would have expected to be able to provide for themselves at no cost to the State.  These people are being pressurised to the extent that they cannot <Col N="302" /> obtain mortgage finance from the usual sources.  They will be left to live in bad housing and the State will ultimately have to house them through one means or another.  I do not think that is a healthy process and it should not be ignored in this debate.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there are divided views on the advisability of proceeding in the way proposed in this Bill. However, it is only with the passage of time that people will be able to say whether the Minister was right and the experts on all sides of the House will find out whether they did the right or the wrong thing.  It is essential that those Deputies who have experience in this area should put their views on the record of the House.  Even with all the expertise available, experts have been proven to be wrong before and as time goes by no doubt they will find out that they are not infallible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to some of the comments made by previous speakers.  Deputy Durkan made some very interesting points but in the latter part of his contribution he used the phrase &ldquo;I would hope&rdquo; again and again. It is worth noting that this debate is about the disposal of a State asset.  It is important to remember just what a State asset is: it is an asset held by the institutions of the State responsible to the elected people in this House for all the people. It is about the taking of an asset secured by statute.  There is agreement between the two major parties on giving this Bill a Second Reading.  Yet they have used the phrase &ldquo;I would hope&rdquo;.  This is like saying &ldquo;I will sell you my horse but I would hope that you will treat him well&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Durkan also used the phrase &ldquo;it is only with the passage of time that we will know&rdquo;.  I can tell the Deputy that we do not have to wait to know what the outcome of this Bill will be.  There is nothing original in this proposal.  These views &mdash; I will refer in a moment in detail to what I mean &mdash; are old hat.  Anyone who is half literate economically only has to look at what has happened in Britain. These are pieces of furniture moved from <Col N="303" /> the secondhand shop of Thatcherism. One may say that they have been around since 1972 &mdash; I will refer to this in a moment &mdash; but the opposite of these proposals were advanced in 1972.  Their arguments were borrowed arguments and they were debunked.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan in his enthusiastic speech about the golden share referred to Jaguar.  That was a very bad example because it was the failure to use the golden share which allowed a Ford bid for Jaguar.  Deputy Nolan should know that and I am sure the Minister could tell him that this is so.  There is also the scandal which has been revealed about Ministers in Britain who could have used the golden share and who now sit on the boards of companies which were affected by the decision not to use the golden share.  I am not going to make any allegations about the Minister or any member of his party in that regard.  What I am simply saying is that we do not have to wait to see what the outcome of the Bill will be; the evidence is there in Britain about much of this.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to other points made by Deputy Nolan and the scandalous abuse by the monopolised media of their position.  A headline in one of the evening papers more or less suggests that there will be a tax bonanza for the taxpayers if the Minister manages to get away with this legislation before the summer.  In fairness to the Minister, he has continually disabused the Irish public of such a facile notion.  It is very interesting to ask why this headline is in the front page of this particular paper.  Perhaps it is not unrelated to the ownership structure of that paper which is part of the monopolised print media.  Their concentration of power and share ownership in the Irish print media &mdash; I repeat this every week in this House &mdash; is one of the things which would not be tolerated by people who purport to believe in the market in any civilised country in the world.  The idea that a single individual could control so much, perhaps between 75 per cent and 85 per cent, of all the news printed in any week is an outrageous <Col N="304" /> condition of total monopoly.  Yet because the State is not involved this issue is not addressed at all.</P>
    <P>The headline on one of the evening papers states that the taxpayers will enjoy a bonanza through the sale of their asset which is worth £250 million.  It is insulting to say that this will be taken out of current revenue by way of tax relief.  I wonder who is floating these ideas because they are not being floated accidently.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan said that the sale of this company would yield a capital sum of £250 million.  I will refer in a moment to what the Minister said in his speech about it being a capital gain.  I wonder where that idea came from.  I will refer later to how the sale of an asset and the effective erosion of your interest in it can be regarded as a gain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan said that if you had £250 million you would save on the borrowings in relation to the interest payments.  He could not understand the reservations of the Labour Party and The Workers' Party about Irish Life.  We do not have any reservations about the performance of Irish Life.  We have no illusions about why it came into existence or about this debate.  Neither have we any doubts about their capacity in relation to the future.  In a way, the Minister has solved some of the problems and Deputy Nolan's comments are indicative of the kind of perception of this legislation. Within the first few minutes of his speech Deputy Nolan said that the Bill is about the privatisation of Irish Life but, by the time he got to the end of it, it was about the restructuring of Irish Life.  That is very interesting because there is confusion between the two concepts of privatisation and restructuring.  The confusion is not accidental because the Minister, in an ideological speech, said many profound things.  I compliment him on the manner in which ideology is creeping into his speeches and in the statements coming from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech on Second Stage was profoundly ideological.  For example, in relation to some of the concepts he said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> I find it necessary to underline these facts to assure those who feel that a change in the State's shareholding will in some way affect the security of policyholders.  It will not.  I say it also to counteract those who might argue that Irish Life is a company controlled by the State whose investment policy can be directed by the State for particular policy reasons.</P>
    <P>The House will notice the anti-State thrust of the speech, that there is something wrong with the State being involved.  I will continue to quote:</P>
    <P>It is not.  We are dealing with a financial institution in State ownership which can easily, and, it will be argued, can more readily be run without the need for a majority State holding.</P>
    <P>One must look for what might be called the subject of a statement like that.  Let us look at it again in relation to the revealing words in it.  &ldquo;We are dealing with a financial institution in State ownership which can easily, and, it will be argued, ...&rdquo; Who is arguing that?  Where is the orthodox wisdom which suggests that there is something inherently wrong with State involvement, State control and so forth?  It is part of the arrogance of the people who write this rubbish to imagine that they are telling us some truths written in stone.  I will again quote: &ldquo;can more readily be run without the need for a majority State holding&rdquo;.  Who decided that point?  Why is it a disability or disadvantage to be involved with a majority State holding?  That statement is not a neutral economic or political statement, it is a profoundly ideologically anti-State piece of rhetoric which would do credit to any one of the many people who have been in and out of the Treasury during Mrs. Thatcher's period in office.  It does not have to be stated; there is something inherently dirty, filthy, rotten, not to be desired about involvement with the State.  Why not have the guts to come out openly and say that we are against State involvement in the economy and so forth?  It is this creeply-crawly kind of rhetoric which is not politics and has no mandate from the public.  It is just slipped <Col N="306" /> in.  &ldquo;It will be argued...&rdquo;  By whom? To whom?  On whose behalf?  There is another phrase, &ldquo;can more readily be run without the need for a majority State holding&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I said I would give examples of the profoundly ideologically nature of the Minister's speech.  Further on in his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>This decision represents a fundamental change in the status of the company, a change from State control to a more widely diffused ownership.</P>
    <P>How is that consistent with the previous statement that the company were not guaranteed by the State, were distant from the State, were not directed by the State, and were not controlled by the State?  Lo and behold, the company is rescued from that control in the speech. Watch for the manner in which it is suggested that there is a national consensus that there is a natural truth in favour of privatisation.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>From a general viewpoint, there is no overriding reasons for the State owning a life assurance company.</P>
    <P>That is a militant right wing statement, it is not a neutral economic statement and it has nothing to do with financial policy.</P>
    <P>I lectured in financial economics 25 years ago and I would find such a statement in an essay from a first year student an outrageous piece of rubbish.  If that statement had been made by a first year student he or she would be told to stop reading the strips in the <i>Evening Herald</i> and to read economic text books. However, perhaps the reason for making such a statement is to exploit the consensus in favour of private greed over public policy which we have taken from over the water.  These little bits of ideological rhetoric may have been put in the speech as a substitute for policy.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with the Minister's speech &mdash; before I deal with principles in this legislation &mdash; there are other outrageous points on which I wish to comment. I should like to think that parts of the speech are accidentally vague.  For <Col N="307" /> example, early on in the speech I read the following gem:</P>
    <P>The ownership of the company came about through historical accident.</P>
    <P>The origins of the company are well known.  It is interesting that when private assurance companies fail it is an historical accident.  Note the rhetoric masking the ideological greedy view that is stealing the public's asset in the interests of a few private people to whom I will refer in a moment.  The Minister went on to say that it was not a conscious decision to nationalise life insurance in the State but rather an <i>ad hoc</i> solution to a problem of an insurance insolvency.  That is a fine mouthful.  In other words, because it was not nationalised by one of those pale pink Wilsonite people it should be privatised. Why not tell the truth?  Why not say how the company came into existence?  Why not say why people are hostile to State involvement in Irish Life?  Why put in these bits of mealy-mouthed obscurantist rhetoric to hide the true intention?</P>
    <P>In one part of his speech the Minister said that the company would be rescued from State control by this legislation but before that he said that Irish Life are not guaranteed by the State and look to their own resources to meet the statutory EC solvency requirements applicable to all life insurers.  He also said that the company never had to rely on State funding. I wish the people who wrote this speech would make up their minds.  The Minister also said that State ownership is not necessary.  If a different Minister said, &ldquo;Privatisation is not necessary&rdquo;, what arguments would follow and how would they be different?  Why have people deliberately tried to confuse this by mixing the case for capital restructuring with the case for privatisation?  Why have people not had the guts to make the case for privatisation, which is weak, and why are they sheltering behind capital restructuring?</P>
    <P>These are important questions and are part of the reason the Labour Party will not support this robbery from the people, <Col N="308" /> the abuse of the State, through Parliament, to take from the people something they own to sell it to a smaller group of people who are part of the same society who no longer will be accountable. According to the Minister: &ldquo;We are dealing with a financial institution in State ownership which can easily, and, it will be argued, can more readily be run without the need for a majority State holding.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>The Government believe that the company must develop as an Irish-based international financial services company specialising in long-term insurance and savings.  Key elements in achieving this strategy have been the continued development of the Irish and UK business, the acquisition of a US life insurance company and the development of links with other EC life insurers.</P>
    <P>Where is there any indication of the policy implications of that?  For example, why should the board of Irish Life have chosen to put what they see as their prospects from the US market above the prospects of the EC?  What is the Government's view on balance of both these opportunities?  What is the meaning of phrases like &ldquo;Irish Life has had a great past.  I know Government would like to think Irish Life will have a great future&rdquo;? They are meaningless.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a crucial impediment to implementing the strategy is the idea of unlocking profits.  Some policyholders are already writing to Irish Life asking if the profits they might reasonable expect to be distributed to them are to be taken from them and whether reserves are to be used and investment structured in such a way as to remove the benefits from them.</P>
    <P>Later the Minister stated that the Government considered the consultants' reports.  Let me reiterate what my colleague, Deputy Taylor, said this morning. What an outrage it is that we will have continual references to consultants' reports which have not been made available either to Members of this House <Col N="309" /> or the public for scrutiny in relation to detailed options.  It is again standing behind somebody for protection.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I met the main union representing the staff of Irish Life&mdash;</P>
    <P>I presume he meant the MSF&mdash;</P>
    <P>and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I listened carefully to their views and concerns particularly as regards employment.  I had discussions with the chairman and the managing director of the company and received clear assurances on employment.  I should point out that Irish Life have consistently expanded their workforce in the past ten years...</P>
    <P>What about the employment effect in the related activities of the company?</P>
    <P>I have sat here for a very long time and listened to the arguments about privatising Irish Life.  People are really saying they want the brakes taken off them so they can embark on something rather like the Smurfit acquisitions trade in the US.  This is a kind of high glamour activity.  It is also highly lucrative in terms of both remuneration and shareholdings. The best comparison I can make is of a successful co-operative in a village or small town into which people had put their money through shareholdings.  The Minister of State will know there are many such concerns in the west.  It is rather as if the manager of such a co-operative one day decided it would be nice, instead of the village and the people owning the shop, to own a bit of it himself and he sold it altogether outside the parish and community and in turn he got a little share of the ownership and a hike in salary.  That is the long and the short of it in relation to Irish Life.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a strong ideological statement to the effect that, and I quote:</P>
    <P>This decision represents a fundamental change in the status of the company, a change from State control to a more widely diffused ownership.</P>
    <P>Note that earlier they were not in State control at all.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> From a general viewpoint, there is no overriding reason why the State should own a life assurance company.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance what evidence there is that the ownership of the company, when they have been floated, will be in any way more diffused?  What is meant by &ldquo;a widely diffused ownership&rdquo;? I have heard that phrase.  It is in the liturgy of the British Tory Party.  They always talked about diffused share ownership. It is in Mrs. Thatcher's speech about creating a nation of shareholders. That is the kind of notion, the absolute untruth that all citizens are equal in capacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Wyse) Acting Chairman (Mr. Wyse)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, I do not wish to interrupt you, but on a number of occasions tonight you have used the word &ldquo;untruth&rdquo; and words of that kind.  I would like you to make your contribution without accusations of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about Mrs. Thatcher's promise to the British people.  I will manage to put it in a different way, Sir, if it makes you happy.  I think you understand the sense of what I am saying.  The assumption, the statement, taking a State company, that all citizens are equal in capacity to buy shares and participate in industry or services is an absolute nonsense.  I find it sad to hear it here in this House after it has been so clearly debunked in Britain. When this kind of scam went on in Britain in the selling-off of the telecommunications industry even MPs became involved in the racket and applied for shares.  It was not the ordinary people living in Wigan, Newcastle-on-Tyne and such places who were going to own the new telecommunications industry from their savings.  The institutions were in, the people around the city were in and some of them got caught.  It was in the papers, as they say down in County Clare.  Anyone could read about this daft notion that you would have a diffusion of ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> People who are going to vote for this Second Stage are asking if it would not be nice to know how much of it will float in Dublin, how much will be floated in London and how much in Tokyo.  The only thing we are certain of as I speak this evening is that the company are owned by all the people in Ireland but they are being taken from all the people and being given to some of the people who can be easily identified in terms of their capacity to buy shares.  As I will show, it is being given to them at an undervalued sum and it is equally certain that, having been thus given to them, they will be free to sell their shares and make speculative profits on what the people in general owned previously and they now own privately. That is why privatisation, being as it is the theft from the public realm to enhance private speculative greed, has a moral dimension.  I agree with the last speaker on the morality of what is at stake.</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;Disposal of the Minister's shareholding and the consequential freeing of the company to raise additional private sector share capital will provide the Irish public with an opportunity to invest directly in a successful Irish company&rdquo;.  The activity rate for different groups on different stock markets have been studied and are known in the Department of Finance. This has been of academic interest for a long number of years to those of us who are interested in fiscal economics, but what shred of evidence exists for the Minister's statement that it will provide the Irish public with an opportunity to invest directly in a successful Irish company? One could be reasonable and could want to be accurate and one could say &ldquo;some members of the Irish public&rdquo; but, of course, that would not achieve the effect.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Thatcher, the schoolmistress of this school of ideology, is being followed here.  She has said so often that she is very, very happy that the British public are all now investing, but they were not all investing.  There was a selected section of the British public who were over-whelmingly legally, and illegally, buying <Col N="312" /> into a share of what was once owned by the British public.</P>
    <P>Will somebody explain a rather simple and fundamental moral point to me?  The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>Disposal of the Minister's shareholding and the consequential freeing of the company to raise additional private sector share capital will provide the Irish public with an opportunity to invest directly in a successful Irish company.</P>
    <P>The public already own it.  If I owned my house, it is rather like telling me that by it being taken over I now have a chance to invest in it and that it is a fine desirable property.  We know that Irish Life is a desirable property, but we own it; all the Irish people own it, but it will be taken from them and some of the Irish people will have a chance to participate in that theft from the general public.  It is time to expose the morality of this.  One can hide behind all kinds of language but at the end of the day we are dealing with an asset which, this evening, is in public ownership but which, if this legislation goes through, will be thrown open for ownership by a small group, some of them not necessarily Irish.</P>
    <P>I wonder how Holdco and Newco will be translated in the Irish language &mdash; I am very tempted to ask for an Irish language version of this Bill.  When Irish Life was first founded I spoke to some of the people involved and they spoke about the advantage of asking people to take out their insurance with Irish Life with the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; in it instead of &ldquo;Royal Liver&rdquo;, with all the resonance that &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; had and so on.  They spoke about the advantage of it being an Irish company and now that company is being turned into Holdco and Newco which in time can be owned by anybody.  Of course, there need not be an Irish version of such an acronym from the English, because in the new grand times that we believe in, there is about as much merit in speaking about a case for national responsibility or contribution as there is of &mdash; as is usually expressed colloquially &mdash; the wind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> The decent people who were involved when this company came into existence had some spark in them, but there is a profoundly anti-national, anti-Irish public, in the thinking behind this proposal and its consequences.  They are saying that it is irrelevant whether one puts the money from the flotation into one's pocket and heads on an acquisitions trail to the US.  Who knows whom one might hire from among the tens of thousands of Irish illegals who are out there, and does it matter?  The Minister in his script threw in the insulting phrase:</P>
    <P>It is essential that Irish Life should retain its Irish ethos and its local base.</P>
    <P>Its base, I understand, can be paralleled with many of the people I mentioned earlier who are located here but who speculate abroad, who do not provide jobs directly or indirectly but who no doubt provide a kind of Third World type employment in the service sector for instance, supplying strawberries and cream at the races, in the Curragh and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I know what a base is, it is something from which one takes off in a helicopter and comes back occasionally, but what does the Minister mean by the &ldquo;Irish ethos&rdquo;?  After this little arrangement is finished between the two main parties what was owned by the Irish people will not be owned by them any longer.  The funds that were invested in the Irish economy will be free to be invested outside this country.  The people who own it may, in fact, be institutions which are not necessarily Irish but which are internationally based.  What is meant by &ldquo;the Irish ethos&rdquo;?  Will people go around and say &ldquo;God bless us and save us, we are from Ireland&rdquo; as they are travelling around America on their acquisitions trail?  What a lot of nonsense using a phrase like that in the speech of the Minister for Finance &mdash; Irish ethos and its local base.  It reminds me of someone who used to go to Europe endlessly mouthing &ldquo;we are a small country but a proud country&rdquo;.  That phrase is at about that level.</P>
    <P>Then there was the hype about the <Col N="314" /> golden share which is so important that it will last five years.  There is no attempt in the Minister's speech to deal with any of the genuine objections that had been made in relation to the question of how the golden share can fit comfortably or uncomfortably within the ethos of European Community legislation.  The Commission will look at it and tell the Government what to do with their ethos and the golden share.</P>
    <P>There is, in addition, the fact that this is unworkable and it is open to corruption and abuse.  Contrary to what Deputy Nolan thinks, in the Jaguar case it was not used to facilitate one offer.  A golden share was not exercised on several occasions in Britain mostly on the grounds of what could be reasonably assumed to be very near the thin, dividing line of corruption, as the people who had the capacity to use it later turned up on the boards of some of the companies when they had retired from politics.  The golden share is not explained, it is not real and it is not a protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>We will need to rely on the skills and expertise of companies such as Irish Life to ensure that the fullest advantage can be taken of 1992 and the opening up of financial markets in the Community.</P>
    <P>I agree, but why do the skills and expertise of the company have to be privatised before they are released?  There is no justification offered and then there is the business of the few pieces of silver they used to throw from the carriage:</P>
    <P>The union representatives have expressed to me a desire for employee share schemes...</P>
    <P>I do not know whether they did, but in relation to these employee share schemes, it is interesting that where they have been applied, if the likelihood of getting shares in the new entity was based not on what one was earning or on where one was in the structure of the company but on years of service, and if, for example, the person who opens the door in Irish Life and was doing so for forty <Col N="315" /> years had ten times the right to purchase shares as the managing director who was there for four years, a stop would be put to the gallop of people who were looking for bits of the firm that was owned by the public.  However, that is not the way it is.  Irish Life will be swinging under the new conditions, when the people's asset has been taken from them.</P>
    <P>The process outlined in relation to the restructuring of the company is complex. Indeed, the dedication of those involved in the theft of the company from the people is extraordinary.  The Minister stated, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the company will be a complex process and, together with the flotation, will take up to 12 months or more to complete.  It will involve the considerable devotion of resources by the company and within my Department.  I will be appointing financial advisers to assist in the sale of the shares on the State's behalf.... </P>
    <P>The Minister has been given no mandate to sell these shares which are the property of the people.  Prior to the last election the Minister did not go before the people to state that he was standing for election and seeking the right to sell Irish Life, and if they elected people of the same mind to this Chamber he would also sell Telecom Éireann and have a good run at Aer Lingus and a few more companies.  That is what is immoral about the procedure and the disguising language. At least Mrs. Thatcher the old Tory, the old school mistress who taught all those lessons has the courage to go before the public to say that she wanted a mandate to smash the welfare state and that she was against socialism.  But our crowd would not do that.  Instead, they slipped the arguments in the back door and tried to implement their decisions without first seeking a mandate.  They are being cowardly in introducing this legislation as we approach the recess and proposing that we take all Stages without adequate discussion thinking that it can be fixed up.</P>
    <P>In relation to the flotation, who will be <Col N="316" /> appointed and at what cost?  I also ask the Minister to indicate if any comparisons were made with Britain where there have been similar flotations and to comment on the detailed academic studies which show, for example, that the Thatcher Government in Britain made enormous killings, when in relation to the scale of fees, they floated companies or are ethical stockbrokers going to be appointed here who will give a discount?</P>
    <P>In relation to the launch, the Minister has this to say:</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for me to speculate on the value that will be realised, for reasons I will not explain. The value of the shares will be ultimately determined by the market conditions at the time of flotation.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for saying this.  What he is doing is selling shares in something he does not own.  There is considerable speculation, in relation to the value, on what are the upper and lower figures.  Is it not nice that the market will decide?  He is going to take out the family furniture without knowing what he will get for it but he tells us that this is the best thing we can do.  In a few moments I must go through in detail some of the most incredible points made in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>In describing the powers to be provided under the Bill &mdash; Deputy Nolan ended his contribution by calling this the restructuring proposal and opened it by inadvertently calling it the privatisation proposal &mdash; the Minister said: The Minister may hold the shares or dispose of those by sale, exchange or otherwise as he sees fit.</P>
    <P>I would like to give one final quotation from the Minister's speech which I think clearly indicates that our last vestige of self-respect as a nation and as a people and of our belief in people's ability to work in the great State companies and to create jobs is gone and it is as follows:</P>
    <P>After restructuring and flotation, Holdco will be one of the largest companies listed on the Irish Stock <Col N="317" /> Exchange.  Other life assurance companies in the State will be entitled to invest in the shares of Holdco on behalf of their policyholders but, under present law which prevents a subsidiary having shares in its parent, Newco will be unable to do so. </P>
    <P>We must get used to the name Holdco which I am told is the same in Irish.  One can call it what he likes but we know what it is.  The point that needs to be made is that the Minister is not doing anything significant because Irish Life are already a very significant company.  In a few moments I will deal with the problems that may be encountered in restructuring the company and the balance which has to be struck between the rights of policyholders and the rights of shareholders, but before doing so I wish to cut through all this nonsense.  Very simply what is involved is that a company which is structured in a particular way in public ownership will be floated on the Stock Exchange.</P>
    <P>Let me dispose of the Minister's speech by asking where is the evidence to support his speech?  Who are the people who will buy shares and what is the investment strategy of Irish Life?  Furthermore can the Government indicate whether they favour the company expanding into the United States, the EC and answer questions about the golden share, Community law and the operations of the company? Why was the figure of five years chosen? Why did they not opt for the figure ten years, 15 years, 20 years or 25 years?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of what protection will be provided against the taking out of shares in Irish Life by foreign institutions. The truth of the matter is that Irish Life, which could have been a massively successful institution playing in the international services sector, could itself have acquired smaller players in Europe and the United States.  Indeed, Irish Life was headed in that direction in the United States.  However, they may now become a potential acquisition victim and this Bill fails to provide a single shred of protection, I challenge the Minister to stand up and give a guarantee that Irish Life <Col N="318" /> will stay in Irish ownership.  As he is an honourable man, he will probably not do that as he is unable to do so.</P>
    <P>This evening we are presiding over the decision to sell something which was not established by us but rather over the decades by Irish people with funds raised in Ireland.  That company is now being stolen from the people.  The only way to describe it is that it is being removed from their ownership to be floated in an unspecified way.  It is all very fine to speak about parliamentary language but if someone living in a slum in Dublin said that they liberated a box of crisps from the back of a lorry they would be treated in a very thick way by the forces of the law.  This could be described in the same way.  What we are doing is liberating Irish Life so that a few people will be able to speculate in it.  I emphasise we do not need such investment as we already own the company.  I repeat my challenge to those who want a mandate for this kind of Thatcherism to go to the public and tell them what they want to do.  They did not go to the public to argue that they would reduce income tax for a single year by a couple of pence if they would allow them to sell something we all own, as well as Telecom Éireann, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the Great Southern Hotels Group, RTE and so on.  This gutless crowd of imported Thatcherites would not have the courage to go to the public because they know they would be told exactly where to go.  These are just old ideas trotted out by tired people who have no mandate for this kind of highway robbery from the public.</P>
    <P>It is very important to realise what is meant by this historical accident referred to in the Minister's speech.  The accurate position is that Irish Life take their formation from the failure of private sector life insurance companies.  I would like that statement to be included honestly in some speech from the Government side at some stage.  It got into the life assurance business &mdash; I do not intend to go through it all &mdash; because of the imminent threatened collapse of three Irish life assurance companies and the threatened withdrawal from the market of a number <Col N="319" /> of British companies.  In 1938 a new company was set up to take over the business of nine of these offices.  It was known as the Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company.  The Government promised to make good any deficiency and got 18 per cent of the equity for their trouble.  The promise eventually cost the Exchequer over £1 million.  Five British offices held 72 per cent of the shares and four Irish companies held the remaining 10 per cent.  Irish Life were set up as a subsidiary to write new business but took over all the business in 1945.  When the parent company were wound up in 1947 the Government bought the 72 per cent stake owned by the British companies for £110,000, bringing their stake to 90 per cent which they have increased slightly up to 90.25 per cent.  The remaining shares held by the old Irish companies are now distributed among about 165 private shareholders.  The largest single shareholder after the State, with about 4.6 per cent of the shares, is the Irish Life staff pension fund.  All that is summarised in the Minister's speech in two words &ldquo;historical accident&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One would not be consistent with the ideological thrust of the speech if, not only having assumed that there was an anti-State consensus in this country and having peddled all the old ragged arguments from the near-Thatcherism, one also had to do the good job of disguising the facts.  That is what a phrase like &ldquo;historical accident&rdquo; means.  When the private sector fails it is an accident, when the State makes a mistake it is gross mismanagement. Those of us who sit on these benches &mdash; the Labour Party and The Workers' Party who are of the left &mdash; are regarded as the people who are ideologues.  The only distinction between our ideology and the other is that we have the courage to state it.</P>
    <P>There are very important issues that must be addressed.  In relation to the very basic one &mdash; what kind of arguments have been made in favour of privatisation? The two basic arguments have been, first, that the company need to be restructured in capital terms and, therefore, that this <Col N="320" /> is the case for privatisation.  Let me say immediately that it is possible to speak about the capital restructuring of Irish Life without speaking of their privatisation. However, the people who have a weak case for privatisation are seeking to milk this factor of the necessity for capital restructuring.  It is a mask, a scar, a screen because they are afraid to make the case for privatisation which will not stand up.  The company's capital could be restructured without it.  The second argument has been abandoned in the midst of this debate.  It is like people saying that the football is not really pumped up enough, we will have to throw in a new ball.  What deflated the old ball that the game started with, was the bogus nature of the arguments for participation in the US economy.  That one fell apart very quickly.  It is dropped out now at this stage and is being replaced by new arguments.  Restrictions operated in certain states &mdash; that is how the argument began &mdash; would prohibit the entry of companies controlled by foreign governments, and so on.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, apart from Irish Life's own acquisition in Iowa, which is obvious, General Accident and others fought court battles in relation to acquisition. British BAT did the same thing and won their court battles in the end.  What it is saying is that protectionist policies in the United States dictate that we must privatise and change the shape and structure of that which we own here in the name of all the people in order to keep the conditions of fair trading and practice intact.  What kind of logic is that? Another question is provoked by this second justification for this robbery from the people.  Why the US market over the European market where competition rules exist and where it would be very much more logical in many respects for great deal of Irish Life's investment strategy to drift towards?</P>
    <P>Apart from these two specific reasons, in relation to the selling of Irish Life, there are, as I have stated, ideological assumptions contained in the Minister's speech, ones which are rarely aired.  They <Col N="321" /> did surface in some of the other contributions. These are the general points that are made in favour of privatisation. I have listened to them over the years since I came in here.  They are singularly unimpressive.  First, selling off a State company and putting it into the private sector will improve efficiency.  The private sector companies are inherently more productive; the private sector companies inherently give the consumer a better choice.  The idea is that anything that was owned by the State is automatically inferior, tending towards inefficiency, lesser competitiveness and so forth.  That argument is debunked by the very history of Irish Life.  It was formed in the conditions of private sector failure. It was a success where many other private sector ventures of a related kind were failures.  What is not being said is that its very success made it attractive as a target for acquisition.  The second, general point is the now very significant appeal to greed, the suggestion that what is owned in common by the public has something inherently backward about it; that in this modern world some people are very rich and have a natural right &mdash; rather like old natural law theory &mdash; to own disproportionately part of what was once held in common.  It is contended that there is something inherently unsatisfactory about the nature of public ownership; that there is something inherently superior about the private ownership of the few versus that old fashioned notion that the people in general would own anything.  It is that logic that brought Mrs. Thatcher to the idea that even the water in one's glass could not be owned in common, or in public, lest a penny be made from it.  It is that tired, old, debunked logic that is represented here in relation to proposals such as this.</P>
    <P>A third more general argument advanced is that by selling it off some money will accrue to the public purse. This smacks of the argument, God help us, that we all walk around with a bit of the national debt around our necks.  Even one's cat or dog has a bit of the national debt attached to it if one wants to abuse statistics like that, as if all the citizens <Col N="322" /> participated equally in the benefits of the excessive borrowing which I well remember coming, and I well remember from where the proposals for excessive borrowing emanated.  The same people who wrote the speeches in favour of excessive borrowing are now writing the speeches for selling of State companies.  It is this lack of accountability which I find praticularly unimpressive.  By the way, I would absolutely emphasise I am not referring to anybody present; I am simply saying that I was around at the time that people were going to spend their way into growth.  I have read the speeches and many of the people who made those speeches are the same people now in favour of cutting back the economy and developing these anti-State philosophies.</P>
    <P>Let us take this last argument.  Suppose one got £200 million or £250 million, I think the Minister for Finance, being intelligent, will not go the argument of the <i>Evening Herald,</i> the idea that one could use a once-off sale to generate income that would enable one to adjust revenue and relieve taxation, would mean one could only do it if one looked around and asked: what is left to be sold next year, and kept rolling on like that. I would not impute such madness to the Minister for Finance.  I do not believe he holds such a view, but I do believe that the articles in the evening papers I have mentioned are being used mischievously to fool the Irish public into a state of mind in which they accept what is glorified theft from themselves.</P>
    <P>There are issues which have not been addressed in the Minister's introductory remarks, ones which were raised this morning by Deputy Taylor and others. What of the position of people who took our policies because they liked the idea of Irish Life in its present form?  Suppose I was an Irish Life policyholder &ldquo;with profits&rdquo; or whatever and happened to have chosen Irish Life over a British company. Remember that a very interesting issue arose in relation to the different Finance Acts that are available in the Library of this House; we used to discriminate in favour of Irish insurance companies versus others contending that <Col N="323" /> it was, if you like, pro-Irish &mdash; to use a very old fashioned phrase &mdash; or pronation to do such a thing.  What happened all that thinking?  The answer is that everything changed.  But what about those policyholders?  And if their policies are &ldquo;with profits&rdquo; or whatever, who gave any mandate to the Minister for Finance to interfere in the company in which they had invested?  If I took out a policy against the contingency that I might not reach some advanced age, I have not said that I wanted my money taken out of Irish Life and put into some new company to go off on an acquisition trail in the United States.  There is no point in contending that I can be compensated; I cannot because I had a choice only when I took out the policy initially.  I am now much older; I do not have as much of a choice now.  How can one compensate any policyholder for that?  One cannot. The idea is that the policyholder, having expressed confidence, having created something, is having that something changed in a completely unaccountable way.</P>
    <P>This raises the question: what consultation has there been either with the existing shareholders who might do well as a result of privatisation or particularly with policyholders about the future of what is their company at present?  If I recollect correctly the policy decision taken in 1972 was to enhance the position of the policyholders.  Now the decision is to facilitate what might be the potential, unspecified, no one knows, of known shareholders after flotation.  What right has any Minister to do that to the rights of policyholders?  If I were the Minister &mdash; whenever this legislation is passed &mdash; I would not be in a rush with it because I warn him that he will spend years in court anyhow, that policyholders have every right and intention of keeping him there, both here and in Britain, and he will not be free of them for many years.</P>
    <P>A question that must be answered before we come to the end of this Second Stage debate is in relation to the valuation process for the company.  Obviously the company will have a different value <Col N="324" /> depending on the different levels of State participation retained.  It is not impossible &mdash; because the memoranda have been prepared &mdash; to arrive at an upper and lower set of valuations for the company at different levels of State participation and in terms of whether we are talking about Irish Life or about the company broken up.</P>
    <P>Lest people think I am imagining all of this, because it is interesting every now and again to think of the views that people had some time previously, I have here a copy of the Minutes of Evidence of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies &mdash; Irish Life Assurance plc &mdash; of 20 October and 3 November, 1987.  At pages 11 and 12 of the Minutes of Evidence of 20 October 1987, Deputy Roche had this to say:</P>
    <P>I am not quibbling about the price but the point I am getting at is, who makes the decisions with regard to Irish Life and whose interests are being served?  The decision was made because you, and the company, were pressing for mutualisation.  In your terms that made a lot of sense.  I do not know whether the Department of Finance in 1972 were capable of making a judgement with regard to the long-term consequence of what they were doing.  I think they were not...</P>
    <P>I pause to say that this is Deputy Roche of the Government party speaking on 20 October 1987, and I will continue to quote him:</P>
    <P>The point I am really getting at is that the pressure for privatisation which is coming from Irish Life, and which I referred to earlier, is coming because you people want to get into the American market.  I am not persuaded that the taxpayers who are the shareholders are going to be served by that. That is the point.  I have no quibble with you as a corporation because you have to make your decisions as to what you think is best for the corporation but we as politicians have to see what is best for the Irish taxpayer.  It was <Col N="325" /> your pressure that motivated that decision.  It did not originate in the Department of Finance; it originated in Irish Life, rather that idea originated in Irish Life.  We have the same thing with privatisation.  You want to move into the American market and that is one of the technical reasons for your wanting to privatise at this stage.  I know that you have had discussions on this over the years and it has come out of Irish Life but I cannot see how you as Irish Life &mdash; I know that you have big difficulties because you have a submission before the Government &mdash; can persuade us that privatising Irish Life is not going to be another huge cockup like this.</P>
    <P>Those are Deputy Roche's words on 20 October 1987.  My hope is that Deputy Roche has not changed his mind in 1990.</P>

      <P>There are many more quotations with which I have decided not to burden the House.  Even in July 1986 similar views were emanating from across this House about what a dreadful thing it would be to privatise Irish Life and how the whole thing was being set up by a few people within Irish Life and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the case being made in relation to people being for privatisation in the case of Irish Life and the general arguments in favour I had disposed of.  I had raised the question of the valuation, about how much Irish Life is worth.  That is not an academic question.  For example, the point has been made by Deputy Rabbitte that at the moment Irish Life shares are worth a certain amount but that, after flotation, they could be worth a great deal more.  There is a small number of people who might have a chance to, as the <i>Evening Herald</i> would put it, enjoy a bonanza in relation to the flotation.  The question is where have we any guidelines in relation to the Minister's speech.  There is a reference to articles of association of the new company, but after the capital restructuring, if shareholders are to have more rights <Col N="326" />&mdash; and the shares, therefore, would be worth more &mdash; what are these additional shareholders' rights and what will it cost the new shareholders in compensation &mdash; and this is the interesting point &mdash; to the with profits shareholders who are already there, and what is their relationship in turn to the policy holders?</P>
    <P>I believe there is a question that the Minister is dodging and that is the question of the apportionment of the reserves of the company.  Where is this question answered about the disposal of reserves? There is a piece &mdash; I can come back to it &mdash; in which the Minister speaks about how he will avoid certain forms of stamp duty, but that does not answer the question. The fact of the matter is that the reserves are really undistributed profits, and if they are undistributed profits the Minister is left with this problem of deciding on the balance of distribution between the policyholders, the existing shareholders and the new shareholders. It is just not resolved in the Minister's speech.  There is no point in pretending it is.  The Minister cannot say that if he is allowed to sell the thing off he will come back at a future date when he has articles of association and that we can have a little natter about that.  No one sells anything like that.</P>
    <P>The valuation of the reserves are possibly of the order of £258 million.  One estimate has been that maybe 60 per cent to 83 per cent would go to shareholders. I am saying these issues are underneath the question that no valuation has been put on the company, but the valuation is a most political problem.  The tradition of Britain, the kind of minor Thatcherism that these ideas are borrowed from, is one of undervaluing the national asset so that after flotation when the real value of the shares is established in the market place the people can make a quick kill as happened in relation to the telecommunications industry.</P>
    <P>Again there is the uncertain question in relation to those who are certain to benefit, that is those who are involved in the flotation, the stockbroking kind and others, I liked the phrase where the Minister said that there will be a great <Col N="327" /> devotion of resources within the Department of Finance and that new financial advisers will be hired and so on in relation to the flotation itself.  I would advise caution, because it has already been documented that the experts who are asked to advise in the case of Britain consistently under-estimated the public property that was being privatised and thereby set up the massive speculation that took place after the launch of the shares in practically every one of the British launches. People might say that it behoves me to give an example of that.  The financial advisers established to the British Cabinet and to the Minister in particular put a price on British Telecom.  The shares opened at 130p and at the end of the first day of trading were at 241p.  I can in fact give details of every other issue that took place in Britain.</P>
    <P>First there is the moral issue of the removal of this public company into private ownership.  The sloppy way that the flotation is referred to makes it ripe for speculation of the same kind.  The procedures are exactly the same as the British Telecom ones.  There is absolutely no guarantee that people will lose by under-pricing.  Not only was that speculative gain there as in the British Telecom case between 130p and 241p but when an analysis was made of the shareholders who participated in the hike in a single day from 130 to 241p they were a very tiny segment of British society. It was not as diffused as Mrs. Thatcher would say.  The only thing was that there was at least one resignation from the House of Commons over a case of fraud which followed.  In other words, the moral ethos, as one might call it, of this neo-Thatcherism had led to such a state.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear that any shareholders gaining speculatively from Irish Life in the future will in fact be gaining at the expense of the State, at the expense of the Irish people who now own the Company. I repeat my statement: at the moment everybody in Ireland owns Irish Life.  After privatisation a selection of people endowed with resources, with the capacity to trade in stocks and shares, the <Col N="328" /> new Irish, will own Irish Life.  One can say this is the Irish people; but what one is doing is transferring from a general definition of the Irish people to a very specific one.  If that was the case we could have one single person owning the whole country.  We could say that nothing had changed.  That was what one might call the economics of Papa Doc's Haiti, and that is what we are heading for here.</P>
    <P>It is not that there is a wider group of people who will come into the share purchasing arrangements, people who are going to participate, the people who have always wanted to have certificates, to carry them around with them or to store them in a bond box, or somewhere like that, that they bought in Francis Street, this kind of yuppie group of people.  The thing that is very interesting about that is that they are in fact capitalising on something they had publicly. Few of them were privately educated.  In this emancipated peasant's country there is not a great tradition of that.  The fact of the matter is that having got an education they then concentrate on their private advancement through setting greedy eyes on what it was that probably attracted them in the first place.</P>
    <P>It is in fact an interesting transfer of wealth and ownership from the public to a group of people who have already taken benefits from the State to become a kind of a sophisticated hijacker of public property. One can identify these in an inverse way, to take my example of the person who opened the door in a public company to the managing director.  Relate it to the top so that the person with the highest salary will have first whack at what will be given towards the employees, and then run one's way down through the company. Then one can come back and offer the moral argument which I used to hear years ago &ldquo;weren't they all free to buy them if they wanted to?&rdquo;.  That is a good one.  Is not everyone free to go into the Berkley Court?  Thanks very much.  Will everyone not be free to buy Irish Life shares?  Will the people who are below the poverty line, a million or so people, not all be free to buy Irish Life Shares? <Col N="329" /> People in Simon hostels, people in hospital wards, people attending casualty wards, old people, young people, everybody can buy a bit of Irish Life.  That is the kind of old nonsense that is in the Minister's speech.  That is why it is such an anti-egalitarian proposal.  What is being proposed about Irish Life is an immoral proposal, an anti-republican proposal, an anti-Irish proposal, an antinational proposal.  There is not a single core value that the old party of the small print Irish republic ever stood for that is not contradicted by that document, and I would advise the people to read it very carefully, to watch very carefully in terms of what exactly is being proposed.</P>
    <P>Who would benefit from privatisation? The certain winners are the people who are involved in fees and commissions. They will certainly benefit because whether it is sold at a low price or a high price they are certain winners.  There will be certain gain for those involved in floating the shares, the fee percentage people, one might call them.  There will be certain gains for the people in the peripheral areas of flotation, not only mainline stockbrokers but people involved in the whole question of launches.  People who will make gains will continue in business after the flotation. There are often considerable transactions in relation to these shares, thereby generating the percentage again and again. Those with knowledge, money and confidence, people with surpluses, in other words those with a capacity to speculate, will be able to subscribe for the shares. Some of those people who are issued with shares will certainly make a profit on them.  It is interesting that in one flotation in Britain people were encouraged to borrow from the credit institutions to buy shares.  That happened in the case of the BP company.  People borrowed because they thought they were in for a kill, rather like the case of British Telecom.  They borrowed from financial institutions who were massive investors in relation to some of these flotations.  Once the shares were sold, they were open to institutional manipulation.  That is what happened in Britain and one need only look at the <Col N="330" /><i>Financial Times</i> about twice a year to see that.</P>
    <P>There will be benefits for Irish Life's private shareholders, to which one Deputy referred to earlier.  If the company is worth £500 million, these shares are worth £1,000 each.  It is very interesting that some of the holders of the private shares include a number of stockbrokers. There are three members of one stockbroking family who own, between them, 1,740 shares, worth £1.74 million. The largest single shareholder is a pension fund, with 4.6 per cent of the shares.</P>
    <P>A case can be made for a capital restructuring of Irish Life.  If the company are as wonderful as the Minister and backbenchers have described them, why does the State not invest in them and facilitate their borrowings?  If the company have a built-up fund of £400 million to which they have access and which has enabled them to make their acquisitions in the United States, why is there such a rush with this legislation?  That is like saying I have £100 in my pocket but I cannot buy a calf until I have £200.</P>
    <P>The other important question about Irish Life is, apart from the general ignorant view that anything private is superior to anything public, which is a primitive jungle-economics view, there is no evidence to suggest that Irish Life are being inhibited in an absolute way by their present regulations from expansion abroad.  You can say this is the view of the managing director or the board, but that is not a sufficient answer.  The distinguished committee of which Deputy Roche was a member and in which he made such a wonderful case against privatisation, were not able to get answers as to the valuation of the company, why they were restricted and so on.</P>
    <P>In relation to the removal of Irish Life from an Irish investment ethos, it is true, as other Deputies have pointed out, that Irish Life control between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of the shares in most of the major listed companies on the Dublin Stock Exchange.  Many of these are held on behalf of policyholders and pension fund members whose money is managed by Irish Life.  Those who were asked to <Col N="331" /> choose between different life assurance companies chose an Irish company with an Irish investment portfolio.  I know several such people and I know they have written to the Mr. K, as I will call him, who is involved in Irish Life.  They sent copies of those letters to me.  They said when they were asked to choose between Royal Liver and Irish Life, they chose Irish Life for very definite reasons, and said they would appreciate it if their money was left there.  I do not know what reply they got but perhaps we will find out some time.</P>
    <P>The main objective has been to get the best possible financial return.  There must be a time to buy and sell shares.  Irish Life have been an important anchor in the Irish economy.  Reference was made already &mdash; and I support these references &mdash; to the time when the Irish-owned Roadstone Limited and the British Readymix company were battling for control of Irish Cement Limited.  At that time the use by Irish Life of their block of shares was particularly significant.  Irish Life supported the Roadstone bid and facilitated their success.  Equally Irish Life's 11 per cent share in the Irish Distillers dispute was very significant.  Does the Minister believe this kind of role is not as important as facilitating some senior members of Irish Life in going on an acquisition trail so that they can inject into themselves a sense of Smurfititis, feel heady and talk about big sums?  These people have no right to do that with the public's money.  The policyholders have not given a mandate for that.  No political mandate has been given for the sale of this company or for any other semi-State company.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the golden share is realistic.  I cannot see how it can guarantee that the current role of Irish Life in the economy will be retained.  I have already dealt with what I called the <i>Evening Herald</i> blackmail headline that to sell Irish Life would enable taxes to be cut by 10 per cent.  That is an assumption that the people are fools.  As I have said, <Col N="332" /> I do not believe that headline was accidental, considering the stable it comes from and the owner of that stable.</P>
    <P>In relation to the restructuring that could take place, when one reflects on the changes of policy that took place from 1972 onwards, it is very interesting that the arguments of 1972 are now effectively being turned on their head.  The pressure then was for a form of enhanced benefit for policyholders.  As I have said, the capital of the company could be restructured without any of the State shares being sold off to the private sector.  I would like to ask the Minister a simple question.  How did he arrive at the figure for suitable State ownership?  Why was it not 64, 54 or 44 per cent?  What is magic about the figure?  The House is entitled to an answer.  If I do not get an answer in this House I might take out a policy with Irish Life, go to the meeting of policyholders and get an answer there.</P>
    <P>The question of expansion of the company has been dealt with and in this regard I do not disagree with the Minister or with anybody who has spoken on this side.  The company have been a success and have been able to expand.  They have made significant acquisitions, even abroad, and are poised for further acquisitions. It all comes down to the fact that they are in a position to make further acquisitions now or they may, in a strangulated form, be ripe for acquisition themselves.  This legislation will make Irish Life a target for acquisition within a very short number of years rather than enabling them to go on their own acquisition trail.  There is no doubt about that. The candidates are already lining up.  I can think of one large French insurance company, whom I will not facilitate by mentioning their name, who have been looking at the company.  They have many advantages including their United States link.  They could straddle an insurance market in both the United States and Europe.  There are many possibilities open to them and the diversity of their activities make them an attractive acquisition. They will be acquired rather than they doing the acquiring.</P>
    <P>We are now involved in a fundamental <Col N="333" /> contradiction.  This legislation is being adduced as something which will enable and facilitate Irish Life to go on expanding, acquiring and creating new jobs when in fact it is making the company vulnerable for acquisition.  Where is the evidence that the State's selling its shareholding will facilitate the expansion of the company, least of all facilitate employment through investment?  The company may require fresh share capital to carry out planned expansion.  The argument in the Minister's speech is that there is no incentive to shareholders to put up extra cash because the locked and limited return is simply too small, the shareholders being entitled to 2 per cent of any surplus distributed while policyholders get 98 per cent.  There is nothing in this legislation that solves the problem of taking benefits from policyholders to facilitate shareholders, including new shareholders.  All capital restructuring can do is readjust the share-out of the surplus and the disposal of reserves between shareholder and policyholder.</P>
    <P>There are at present 65,000 policyholders, 35,000 of whom have their interests represented by British actuaries. The whole restructuring scheme will have to get the permission of the Irish courts.  No evidence is offered of any consultation with policyholders regarding the effective revision of their contract, entered into in good faith.  If you take out a policy you are entitled to as many guarantees on your side as they have in relation to your payments.  It is a very simple contract.  We cannot legislate away the contractual rights of policyholders. There is also the question of the reserves and so on.</P>
    <P>When one strips away all the rhetoric, a possible case for capital restructuring is being used as a screen for a privatisation case that has no substance.  The Minister's speech deals with the real agenda which is the privatising of this company, and then moves on to the privatising of other companies with its strong, borrowed ideological thrust.  The Minister's speech did not take the case for capital restructuring and set it apart; rather it <Col N="334" /> tried to hide behind that case to make a proposal for privatisation.</P>
    <P>One of the speakers from the principal Opposition party used the phrase &ldquo;I would hope that&rdquo;.  That was rather like sending up a prayer after letting the horse out the door &mdash;&ldquo;I would hope that my horse would not be mistreated&rdquo;.  It would remind one of Patrick Kavanagh's poems &mdash;&ldquo;I would hope that you will not kick my dog, but he has to go out&rdquo;.  That is the kind of opposition there is to the sale of something which the public own.</P>
    <P>Let me finish by making a summary comment.  This Bill is about privatising Irish Life.  Capital restructuring is a screen, a mask to hide the Bill's purpose. The Government elected by the Dáil, which in turn is elected by the people, are in temporary charge of a company and are the 90 per cent nominated shareholder of an asset owned by the public worth perhaps over £700 million.  Where is their mandate to dispose of that public asset into the realm of the private?  It is very interesting.  Equally the internal restructuring of the company can be achieved without the sale of the majority stake to the private sector.  No argument in reply to that has been put forward.  No one has justified the magic figure of 34 per cent.  Why not 64 per cent?  Why not say 54 per cent plus the pension funding of 10 per cent?  Let us have a little riddleme-ree about the figures.  Where has this figure come from?  Who are the 15 per cent people?  Why can they not combine? How will the golden share intervene between different combinations of groups?  There is no answer.  The Minister will be standing there with his golden share defending the Irish ethos.  It is rubbish. He is going to sell it off in chunks.</P>
    <P>There is also the strategic niche sector position of Irish Life.  It has been acknowledged on all sides that it is a successful company which even in a changed format would enjoy a ranked position on the Irish Stock Exchange.  Its own portfolio of investments represents some of the major players on the Irish Stock Exchange.  Why imperil that relationship by giving away people's shareholding? <Col N="335" /> How will the Minister with the golden share enable Irish Life through its purchases to play the same role as in the case of Irish Cement and Irish Distillers? People are entitled to answers to these questions.  There is no point in coming back with something thoroughly deceitful and saying all that is intended is a new structuring of the company.</P>
    <P>Public representatives should be able to answer the questions of their constituents. Any of us could be asked why we own something in July worth £700 million which in the autumn we will not own, while some of our neighbours will own it.  The public should be putting such questions.  I showed the text of the Bill to a man of 80 in Galway, an old Republican, and he asked why the people are not outside the gates like they were for Jack Charlton in a rage about the stealing of something from them which was built up in conscious opposition to foreign insurance companies at a time when the private sector had failed.  He asked why the people are allowing this to be stolen from them and I had no answer.  I said they are more excited about football than about the future of their country.  I can only hope that it changes.  People ask why there is not a sense of outrage at the anti-national, anti-Irish, anti-Republican nature of what is happening A greedy few have to be facilitated through the taking of something which is not the property of any Minister of any Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I have spoken again and again about the rights of policyholders, decent people choosing to be Irish in relation to investing the little money they have.  How are they to be replied to?  Suppose they are not interested in the country; what changes in the level of guarantees in relation to their future can be accepted? Why should they be accepted?  What consultation has there been with policyholders? Can this confidence be retained in the new structures?</P>
    <P>I spoke to a retired insurance man last night who was one of those who used to sell insurance.  The old phrase is that there is no one with endurance like the <Col N="336" /> man who sells insurance.  He was around at the time when the private companies collapsed and the new company which later became Irish Life was brought into being.  If you were going from door to door asking people to invest in Holdco and Newco you would have a fine chance of gathering fivepences and tenpences. While it may be a simple point, the fact is the faith of many small, decent people in their own company, the people's company, is abused, mocked and derided by the legislation.  The are now being told that it did not matter tuppence that they had a sense of respect for their country and for an Irish company that would create jobs in Ireland.  It is very interesting that the main political party are leading this charge to sell what they do not own but what the people own.  None of the technical questions I referred to, from the question of valuation to the question of flotation has been addressed, good, bad or indifferent in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister and I believe he is acting in good faith when he says he has confidence in the company's future. Deputy Nolan was under the mistaken impression that those of us who speak like this did not have confidence in the company's future.  The fact is that we have even greater confidence in the company's future than Deputy Nolan and others.  We believe the company have a future without being privatised.</P>
    <P>The arguments being put forward by the people who hold senior positions on the board of Irish Life are rather like the man saying, &ldquo;Please do not hold me back, you must let me on now&rdquo;.  It is just that, a lot of bluster and bluff.  I have already made the point that Irish Life have significant reserves and no case has been made for the time scale for the shortfalls for the capital investment they propose. Could somebody come into the Dáil and say, &ldquo;The following is a list of desirable capital investments by Irish Life, which they have not been able to make because of capital shortfalls&rdquo;?  The fact is that they have not gone near approaching, not to speak of exhausting, their existing capital reserves, which are available for investment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> The company need not be damaged. They are not a drain on current revenue. Why take something that was successful, and take the yield from the once-off sale? If the capital realised by the sale was fired into current income, one could say that this is a good thing for a particular year. As I have said, I have exempted the Minister from such facile thinking and it is only repeated by one or two people in the House who rely on the <i>Evening Herald</i> as their main source of economic theory.  The fact is that there is not a case for this but the tendency slipped into the Minister's speech when he referred to the yield as a capital gain.  How is it a capital gain in any sense?  Perhaps I am being over simple, but when I studied economics I understood that you could own an asset and then you sold it and you then did not own it, but if in fact you had sold it at a higher price then what you had bought it for, that was a capital gain.  That is not what is happening here.  We are talking about an accumulated asset that is supported by a certain level of reserves, to which there is a contested ownership between shareholders and policyholders. How can you say you are going to the market not knowing what you are going to ask for the asset and that you will allow the market to decide on the value of the shares?  Are you going to describe what you eventually get a capital gain?  That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>It is possible to acquire further investment capital in Irish Life by different forms of flotation through the private sector and through other institutional forms of investment which would not involve the sale of a significant part of the State holding to the private market. I may expand on what I mean by this in a moment.  A person who might want to give Irish Life a return, admittedly at a lower rate then if the shares were sold, could negotiate with pension funds and institutional funds to release shares to them which, in turn, could release capital which could be spent on investments.  I agree that something needs to be done about the question of the return to the shareholders.  One cannot speak in the long term, over a ten, 15 or 20 year period <Col N="338" /> of a company with a wonderful record such as Irish Life, having such a low return to shareholders.  I agree that is a problem but it is not the same problem as saying that you have to give the Minister the right to dispose of his shares in order to solve the problem.  No convincing case has been made for that.  One does not have to be and ideologue of either side to understand that.  It simply does not make economic sense.  If a member of a board came out with an argument that to solve one problem you must nibble at another problem, nobody would believe that, and correctly so.</P>
    <P>In many ways the Minister has made a strongly ideological statement during his Second Stage speech.  I believe this legislation will be disastrous for the company, for the economy, for workers within Irish Life and for those involved in the secondary activities facilitated by Irish Life's investment.  In addition, in many cases, even if one believed in selling &mdash; my colleague Deputy Taylor said this morning that we in the Labour Party had no reason to believe a case has been made for selling even a single share which the State owns &mdash; and even if one believed in shifting the State's shareholding, it is absolutely outrageous that not only has no case been made for the distinction between the State majority holding and the State minority holding, which is elementary in considering this argument, but a figure has been &ldquo;cooked up&rdquo;&mdash; and I use the phrase advisedly &mdash; of 34 per cent at one stage in the debate, but it may change and no attempt has been made to justify this figure.  There is no justification for it in terms of the future potential of the company.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity, and it has not been taken in this legislation, to write in the rights of employee ownership and pension fund participation.  It is very interesting, for example, that in the new pension legislation there is provision for representatives of the employees to be represented on trustee boards.  In view of the strategic model of Irish Life and their exemplary role in the Irish economy, it would be very interesting to allocate a minimum proportion of voting shares to <Col N="339" /> the Irish Life Pension Fund and to speak about a proportion of shares being allocated by a mechanism to the staff.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the proposed changes in Irish Life are not those that will strengthen the confidence of policyholders. They will not guarantee the controlling interest of the taxpayers and will not enhance or protect the participation rights of the staff and will not give Irish Life the flexibility to raise further capital from the public and private sectors, whether domestic or foreign.  They will seriously affect Irish Life as a prime target for take-over by institutions outside the country rather than enhancing their capacity to diversify in the international investment field.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will oppose any attempt to pass the Committee Stage of the Bill in a rush this session.  We have already listed dozens of questions, apart altogether from the major political ones, of a responsible technical and financial kind which deserved answers and which will involve amendment.  In addition, I have an obligation on Second Stage to say that these are borrowed ideas, failed ideas.  Neo-Thatcherism is in decline in Britain and has been rejected by the British people while at the same time these ideas are being trotted out here.  What kind of colonisation is it that people have to be afflicted by taking on the rejected ideas of the coloniser next door all the time?</P>
    <P>It is outrageous to think that at a time when there is a possibility that there will be an appeal to national self-respect that what was patiently built up, innovatively changed and a success should have, as the only mark against it, the State owned shares in it.  Many people on the Left frequently say that these arguments are about being pro-State and anti-State. They are not; they are about the use of the State.  The State is being used in this legislation as an instrument, to take the ownership of something from the public and give it to the private sector.  It is not a question of a person being neutral about the State.  That is why the Minister's Second Stage speech is riddled with a <Col N="340" /> series of abuses against the notion of the State, people pouring out their suppressed poison against the State.  As I have said, bits of it are the venom they got from our neighbouring island &mdash; anti-State, there is no need for the State, etc. It is poisonous hate for the thing which often employed them, that educated them for next to nothing and built up the economy.</P>
    <P>If Irish Life were among the companies which get about £1.2 billion, a few million short of what we spend in education, every year from the public sector to get the ailing cow of the Irish private sector up on its legs and be available for a drop of milk, I wonder if they would be taken over in this way.  There is a belief that there is something modern, clever, technical and wonderful about the notion of privatising something.  It is the concept of the use of the State to socialise the costs of production &mdash; to shift to the State the cost of training, of exporting, of subsidies, etc.  The other arbiture is to use the State over which one has temporary control to remove obstacles and enable the private sector to have what was in the realm of the public.  This is what is taking place.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that a division will take place at the end of the Second Stage debate.  This legislation will be opposed by the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and the Independent Deputies for the very simple reason that not only is it a hysterical and ideological attack by the Right on a successful trading company, nationally and internationally, but it is also profoundly not in the national interest.  It is also profoundly, and I use the word carefully, immoral legislation. It makes a mockery of this House to say that we can have a democratic consultation about what is in effect changing the ownership of a company from every single citizen to a select group of people who will be able to buy at a reduced valuation and then speculate with abandon. It is a profoundly immoral system which can facilitate such practices.  It is the inherent immorality of the Right wing vision in Irish politics, the suppressed greed of it and the naked anti-solidarity <Col N="341" /> view of it, that says you can take and go on taking.  It was the public realm and the State that facilitated the appearance of all of us here.</P>
    <P>Why should there be such a stripping away of any basis of solidarity with our nation, our people, our workers and the people who rely on our investment?  Do we so hate ourselves that it would be an unrelievable blemish on Irish Life for the State to be the majority shareholder in it?  This is why the debate about the disabilities which are imposed by State involvement reveal such a great insecurity and an absence of what used to be called in the Gaeltacht féin-mheas. Where did all this come from?  How accountable are the people who have introduced these treasonable, anti-Irish, anti-national and anti-republic notions into the country?  This Bill is anti-Irish, anti-national and immoral and this is why the parties of the Left will be very proud to vote against it and, one would hope, after others have seen what the Bill is about, help to defeat it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened for the last hour and a half to the contribution of my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins. While I would agree with some of the points he made, I would disagree with most of what he said.  I agree that the Minister's presentation of the legislation before us is very poor.  I also agree that it is important for him to immediately issue some form of publication, perhaps a White Paper, outlining for policyholders the position in relation to Irish Life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental disagreement I have with Deputy Higgins is that, with respect, he spoke a load of poppycock when he said that the Government were selling an asset belonging to the Irish people to fat cats who will gain from the unfortunate peasantry on this island.  The reality is that while the State technically owns 90 <Col N="342" /> per cent of Irish Life it gets practically nothing from them &mdash; it got £440,000 last year from a company worth £4.5 billion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins is shocked to think that the main Opposition party are facilitating the Government in seeing this terrible act being perpetrated on the Irish people.  I want to point out to the Deputy that the Fine Gael Party are the only party in this House, perhaps with the exception of the Progressive Democrats, who have any sort of mandate to speak about the privatisation of Irish Life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall on that occasion that the Labour Party opposed what we were proposing and the main Government party, Fianna Fáil, castigated the Fine Gael Party for even attempting to think of selling off the &ldquo;State silver.&rdquo;  We on this side of the House have a mandate to speak about this issue because we are convinced that what we said then and what we are supporting now is right for every Irish man, woman and child.  The reality is that by selling Irish Life we will not be giving away the State silver, rather we will be providing the Irish taxpayer who is funding a debt of £25 billion with an opportunity of reducing the servicing of it by anything up to £25 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Irish taxpayer would be better off with £25 million less per annum to pay in servicing our national debt than what we are getting at present from Irish Life, £440,000 per annum.  In terms of simple economics it is a better deal for everyone of us in this House, our wives and children, friends and relatives and the people we represent outside this House to sell off Irish Life.  In addition to the State getting approximately £250 million for their 56 per cent shareholding in Irish Life and the effect this will have in the reduction of our national debt, it <Col N="343" /> will provide us with an opportunity of having £25 million less to pay out to foreign banks.  I should like to point out to the people who say that we are selling out to capitalists that this country is owned, at present, by foreign banks and foreign institutions.</P>
    <P>Every opportunity we get to reduce the burden and the outflow of money from this country should be taken.  Irish Life are not in the ownership of the Irish people in the real sense of the word. Irish Life are owned by a relatively small number of &ldquo;with profits&rdquo; policyholders with Irish Life.  Those with non-profit policies, like the 50 pence per week policy, do not have a share in Irish Life. The same applies to pure life assurance contracts and the life assurance attaching to pension funds.  Who benefits from Irish Life?  The main recipients of the profits of Irish Life go to people who invest large sums of money in single premium bonds and unit linked contracts.  We are not selling off the State silver by agreeing to accept this Bill on Second stage.  That is a ridiculous argument.</P>
    <P>In addition to getting £250 million when the sale goes through, the State will participate in the annual profits produced by Irish Life because it will own 34 per cent of Irish Life.  The Minister said that, under the present corporate arrangements profits are largely locked in and cannot be distributed to shareholders. That is a fact.  This is a mutual company, it belongs to policyholders and not to the Irish people.  It is inaccurate to present your argument against this Bill on the basis that you are anti-privatisation because you are selling the State silver. This has nothing to do with selling the State silver.  If we had a debate about selling Telecom Éireann or another commercial State company we might have a different argument but the opposition to the sale of Irish Life is ill-informed. The Irish people will be better off if we can realise an asset worth £250 million for a 56 per cent shareholding than under the present regime of getting a miserly £440,000 in 1989 from a company worth £4.5 billion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> In 1992 Irish Life will be minuscule in the real world of investment institutions. In 1992 companies ten times the size of Irish Life will do business in this country and send money from it to different parts of Europe.  Unless we recognise that fact, prepare ourselves for it and allow Irish Life to become a large financial institution, we will not have a single life company capable of dealing in opposition to the multinational companies operating within Europe at present.  People talked here about a sense of nationalism as if those of us who support this legislation are traitors.  We are protecting the staff and the investors in Irish Life because we are facing up to reality.  This has nothing to do with ideology, the sale of Irish Life is a practical proposition that is good for the Irish people and policyholders.  It will also be good for the staff of Irish Life and the people in the future because it will reduce our national debt and our annual repayments by a minimum of £25 million. It will provide the Irish taxpayer and the ordinary citizen with an opportunity to participate by owning 36 per cent of something worthwhile instead of owning 90 per cent of something worthless.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to use this occasion to confuse the issue for the public.  It is also wrong to confuse the policyholders.  It is wrong for responsible politicians to present an uniformed argument.  It is not about selling the State silver and it was not about selling it in 1987 when we proposed the sale because we were facing reality.  Any company facing difficulties will look at ways and means of reducing them.  Ireland today faces enormous difficulties.</P>
    <P>I received a written reply to a parliamentary question I asked last week regarding the number of net new jobs created in manufacturing and in international financial services for the years 1987, 1988 and 1989. the number of jobs created amounted to just over 5,000, after all the grants and incentives; 235,000 people are still unemployed and there will be many more unemployed if we stick our heads in the sand in regard to issues like this and say that we cannot touch Irish Life.  If that is our attitude, <Col N="345" /> not alone will we strangle them, they will be out of business after 1992; they will not be big enough to face up to the cold winds of competition.  Of course they must have a good capital base and be able to get finance to develop and expand. Not only will they develop and expand in the interests of the existing policyholders, they will develop and expand so that Irish people can get jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in this institution. These are the practical problems which we face, not the ideological ones which are being created for political advantage. People should think again before opposing this very sensible move by the Government.  I am sorry that Fine Gael in Government did not get the opportunity of introducing a Bill in this regard. In 1987 we presented our arguments on television to the people in regard to Irish Life and the situation has not changed one iota.</P>
      <P>The history of commercial State companies has been very disappointing because of the continuous interference by Governments in their running.  Before we get into an ideological argument about selling the State silver, we should allow State companies to operate commercially. Traditionaly, we have not done that.  Ministers of all parties have interfered over the years.  Admittedy, there have been people on these boards who were not capable of making good decisions; our system of payment to top and middle management and the staff of these companies is antiquated and not comparable to what is available in the private sector.  Impositions have been put on these companies to provide a form of social service without being prepared to pay for it and then we expect them to behave commercially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a recent example of interference in a commercial decision, the sale of Cablelink.  The RTE Authority made a commercial decision that Cablelink should be sold to the highest bidder which, on this occasion, was an American company.  Telecom had put in a much <Col N="346" /> lower bid.  Once again the Minister interfered. He has now forced Telecom to purchase Cablelink at the escalated price the Americans were prepared to pay for it.  The reasons they were prepared to pay for it were different from the reasons Telecom should buy it.  They were looking to the future potential and what they could do that Telecom are not in a position to do.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer is left with Telecom having to borrow to pay the inflated price for Cablelink.  I estimate, and any financial institution will back me up, that the taxpayer will be asked to pay £4.5 million per annum in repayments for the purchase of Cablelink and the income is £1.2 million per annum.  To satisfy the decision of a Minister who interferes in a commercial decision, the taxpayer is left with picking up the bill for £3.3 million minimum.</P>

      <P>No, listen carefully to my argument.  The argument I am putting forward in relation to Irish Life is totally different from the argument one should look at when talking about commercial State companies.  Irish Life are not a commercial State company in the real sense.  The Government are not getting revenue from Irish Life, neither is the Irish taxpayer.  There are a few bits and pieces I would question, but we are talking about the general principle as distinct from the technicalities, which is to allow the setting up of two new companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish citizen is better off in this deal by selling Irish Life.  We reduce our national debt and our annual repayments. We participate in bigger profits that are not locked in as they are at present, and this heart bleeding for the unfortunate people because they are losing the State silver is not realistic.  With regard to the policyholders, there is an <Col N="347" /> obligation to see to it that anybody who has entered into a contract with Irish Life should not suffer in any way by this proposal.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I was sitting peacefully here having put away my notes thinking I was not going to speak.  In the minute or two left me it is almost impossible to put any &ldquo;shape or make&rdquo; into this.  I had intended saying that only a little over a week ago we were discussing Fóir Teoranta here and we had many complaints about help given to and money lost in companies.  I suppose one could say Irish Life are a precursor of Fóir Teoranta but a very successful one and a great company.  I will skip everything I had planned to say except that, while I enjoy listening to Deputy Michael Higgins, he went on for a long time.  This Dáil needs reform and one of the reforms it needs is in regard to the length of Second Stage speeches.  In the long run, no matter how much you protest you are not going to repeat yourself, it is difficult to go much longer than half an hour without repeating yourself.  However, I want to join with him, Deputy Michael Noonan and others who have asked how in the name of goodness we came up with two names, &ldquo;Holdco&rdquo; and &ldquo;Newco&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="348" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed.  To take the last point made by Deputy Browne &ldquo;Holdco&rdquo; and &ldquo;Newco&rdquo; are terms used in everyday commercial life as representing holding companies and new companies.  Nothing in the Bill compels Irish Life to keep &ldquo;Newco&rdquo; or &ldquo;Holdco&rdquo;.  Naturally they will keep the good commercial name of Irish Life some way or other in their new companies.  Put no more emphasis on it than that.  It is an everyday working term whether you are dealing with business or what we are dealing with here.</P>
      <P>Let me be clear on what we are doing in this Bill.  We are attempting to remove the constraints on Irish Life and to allow them to develop.  We are doing this in a way which protects the rights of policyholders and employees of the company and we are putting in place some basic safeguards to ensure that the company can develop as an Irish based financial services industry.</P>
      <P>There is no question of a quick sale of a lack of consideration of the company's future.  Irish Life are a particular case and we should be pragmatic.  That is the Government's approach.  What we all wish to see is the continued success of Irish Life and the Government firmly believes that the restructuring and flotation is the best way to achieve this.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal now with various points that were raised.  Deputy Noonan called for a White Paper on the Irish Life issue and for greater public information on the plans for the year ahead.  I have listened carefully to the arguments he put forward but on consideration I do not see that this course is necessary.  The issues have been examined by an Oireachtas Joint Committee.  The Government have stated their intentions clearly on several occasions.  I have answered repeated questions in the House on this subject.  I have explained the position to the unions involved and have had discussions with the ICTU.  This Bill provides the further opportunity for debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the coming months the policyholders will be fully advised on the aspects of the restructuring as it concerns <Col N="349" /> them.  The restructuring will be put before the courts.  I take the Deputy's point that the courts, of course, will have to decide.  I am not going to try the court case here and it would not be proper for me to do so.  The advice I have is that the proposed restructuring scheme will be consistent with the precedents and there are enough independent &ldquo;referees&rdquo; as it were &mdash; the insurance supervisors, the independent actuary, Irish Life's own actuary &mdash; to see to the fairness of the matter.  Given the involvement of the courts, the technical and confidential nature of aspects of the flotation, the information already available and the opportunity provided by the debate here tonight, I do not see what could be added by a White Paper.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me, I will respond in some detail to the requests for information.</P>
    <P>The golden share provision was referred to by several speakers and doubts raised as to its effectiveness and validity, in particular as regards EC provisions. Let me clear up the position.  The share is of indefinite duration.  I sought to assure concerns by undertaking that it would not be redeemed in the first five years after the flotation.  Deputy Rabbitte and others suggested that unless specific provison was made for it it could be discarded the week after flotation takes place.  I put on the record of the House that it is of indefinite duration.  I sought to assure concerns that it would not be redeemed inside the first five years; no more than that.  This strengthens the position of the golden share.  It does not mean, as Deputies have sought to portray, that it will last only five years.  In general terms, the golden share will protect Irish Life from unwelcome takeover and allow the company to retain their Irish ethos and local base.  It will do this by preventing private shareholders, either individually or in concert, from acquiring more than 15 per cent of the total share capital.  The directors will be required to monitor shareholdings and will be given powers to ensure that the 15 per cent limit is enforced.  If the 15 per cent limit appears to have been exceeded <Col N="350" /> the directors will be required to enforce the limit.  This 15 per cent was arrived at in consultation with Irish Life and took account of the trade union view.  Fifteen per cent is the norm in the UK, for example.</P>
    <P>We have examined the golden share carefully from an EC viewpoint.  The advice available to me is that the arrangement does not contradict EC rules.  It will not, in itself, discriminate between Irish and non-Irish shareholders.  Leaving aside the golden share, there will, in practical terms, be a large Irish holding which will reinforce the golden share.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a draft EC Directive on takeover bids.  I am advised that this Directive does not make a golden share arrangement impossible. The draft Directive in question deals with situations where a takeover bid is launched once a certain level of shareholding &mdash; one-third &mdash; has or may be reached.  The golden share, however, will limit private shareholdings to 15 per cent and, I am advised, is unaffected by the proposed Directive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan raised the question of the focus and manner of the flotation of the shares.  No firm decisions have been taken in this matter nor would it be prudent in advance of a flotation to disclose one's full &ldquo;battle plan&rdquo;, as it were, for the sale.</P>
    <P>I envisage, however, a broadly-based flotation aimed at institutional investors and the ordinary investor.  There will be a foreign element, but the preferred route will be to maximise the proceeds from domestic sources.  The flotation will be in Dublin and in London.</P>
    <P>Consideration will also be given to strategic share placings with financial services firms who can assist Irish Life in developing their business at domestic and international levels.  The trade unions have expressed an interest in an employee share involvement in the flotation and I intend to examine that possibility bearing in mind what was said here in this House. As for tax-efficient ways for employee share schemes, I believe that such arrangements already exist in tax law generally.  No plans have so far been <Col N="351" /> made for a policyholder involvement, but the House will realise that all these matters will be the subject of detailed advice for the expert financial advisers whom I will be appointing to guide me in the sale. The position is that tenders were sent out in the normal way.  Various firms, both foreign and Irish have tendered to the Department of Finance.  They are being considered there at the moment and in due course the results will be announced.</P>
    <P>Deputies also referred to the capacity of the Irish market to handle the flotation. Given the flow of investment funds, the Irish market can cope.  Indeed, funds which might otherwise be invested in foreign equities will, I am sure, be kept here to invest in the flotation.  Deputy Rabbitte's fears on this issue may prove groundless.  At the beginning of this year because of the lack of investment opportunities for Irish pension funds and investment funds money flowed out of this country and contributed to one of the interest rate increases we had in the latter part of last year.</P>
    <P>It was also put to me that this Bill does not require the Minister to retain a specified shareholding in the Irish Life Holding Company.  I do not see this as necessary and it would be an unusual restriction on the Minister's rights as a shareholder in the company.  Such a restriction does not exist at the moment in the case of the State's holding in Irish Life itself.  It is the intention to retain a large shareholding in the restructured company.  There are no plans to alter this position but the Government must retain the discretion to exercise their rights in the public interest in relation to their shareholding in the company.</P>
    <P>I was taken to task somewhat for not giving an explicit assessment of the valuation of the company and that no sensible shareholder would sell shares without knowing their value.  I have, of course, taken expert financial advice on what the value might be on flotation but it would be most imprudent to discuss that here. Indeed, the one sure way for the financial speculators to profit would be if I were to say now what this expert advice revealed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> I was asked about details of the actuarial scheme for safeguarding the policy-holder's interests.  I can give a broad outline of the basis of the scheme, but I want to assure the House that, under the Insurance Acts, a full and detailed outline of the scheme together with a report on the scheme by the actuary to Irish Life will be published in due course.  Details will be given to policyholders.</P>
    <P>The scheme put forward by Irish Life envisages the creation of a special sub-fund, or reserve, of assets for the with-profits policyholders.  The sub-fund will provide the with-profits policyholders with a share of the profits on their portion of the business at least as favourable as that which could be expected if the existing arrangements for distribution of profits continued in being.  The equity of this arrangement will be subject to court approval.  It is Irish Life who will be seeking court approval, not I, so it is up to them to carry through the court aspects. Deputy Taylor said that the transfer of business will be made by ministerial orders.  In fact the transfer order referred to in the Bill will be a court order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked how the proceeds of the flotation will be used and sought an assurance that they will not be used for current budget purposes.  I can assure Deputy Noonan that the proceeds of sale will be used in an appropriate way to help ease the burden of the National Debt and, therefore, of debt-servicing costs.</P>
    <P>There was also the question of the use of the terms &ldquo;Holdco&rdquo; and &ldquo;Newco&rdquo;, and I have already dealt with that.  In fact the Bill refers to the &ldquo;holding company&rdquo; and the &ldquo;new company&rdquo; and the advice I have is that this does not preclude the use of more appropriate names for these companies when the restructuring is being done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor raised the question of whether Irish Life needs the capital to expand, in view of the ability it has shown to grow to its existing size.  In my opening remarks I made it clear that it is the future which we must be concerned about and that access to capital is essential.  The consultants described it as essential to <Col N="353" /> any viable competitive strategy for the company and that there must be access to all the range of equity and debt capital, not just specific or restricted types instanced by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The company can fund its expansion from internal resources at present.  What is important is access to capital and not short-term capital needs.  Furthermore, the company realistically can only plan new expansion now if it has the certainty that access to equity capital will be available as required.  It is a matter for the company, however, to formulate its capital needs.  In floating the company we will be removing a barrier to fulfilling those needs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor also raised several issues on specific sections of the Bill.  We can go into some of these on Committee Stage and tease them out there.  He also referred to the relief from stamp duty on the transfer.  A similar provision applies to transfers of banks under the Central Bank Act, 1971.  In the case of companies, generally there are provisions in the Finance Act, 1965 to exempt bona fide group reconstructions from stamp duty.  Irish Life would probably qualify under these exemptions but the specific legislative provision puts the matter beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>I was also asked where the provision exists in the Bill for minority shareholders to exchange their shares for shares in the holding company.  The draftsman advises that this is not necessary.  The minority shareholders have these rights as shareholders already.  In my case, however, it is necessary for the Oireachtas to confer the legal power on me.  The actual share exchange means that I will exchange my 90 per cent for 90 per cent of the shares in the holding company whose shareholding will be a mirror image of the existing shareholding in Irish Life.</P>
    <P>Irish Life will transfer its business, including its subsidiaries, to Newco.  The position of the subsidiairies is not affected by the transfer other than their change of ownership from Irish Life to Newco.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to the Programme for Government which states <Col N="354" /> that any changes in the ownership structure of particular companies will only take place if it is in the public interest and in the best interests of the company and its employees and following consultation with the social partners.</P>
    <P>I think I outlined in some detail in my opening remarks the long and careful consideration given to the issue of Irish Life, the consultation with the unions, with the company and the open manner in which we proceeded.  I cannot accept any claims of bad faith on the Government's part.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to expansion abroad by Irish Life and suggested that it should expand into non-core business here.  This is one reason the restructuring and flotation is to be desired.  It is necessary for Irish Life to become an Irish-based international financial services company and in this way enhance their market and employment opportuinities both here and abroad.  The Deputy referred to the US.  That is only one market.  The aim is to expand in all relevant markets and a restructuring and flotation will aid this.  The ability to bring in new capital and new partners, especially in the context of 1992, can only be seen as a welcome and necessary development.  This facility will be severely constrained if there remains a State holding of 90 per cent.  The Deputy remarked on the UK experience.  We are proceeding on a pragmatic basis and the parallels with the UK are not entirely applicable.  The aim of the flotation will be to achieve a proper price for the State shares and to enhance the future of the company.  As to the value of the company, this has been the subject of expert advice and I have already dealt with that question.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to senior management.  If anything, we should express our appreciation of what they have done to build up this company.  I am sure all Deputies would subscribe to that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan raised a few questions in relation to aspects of various premiums and other aspects of insurance which are not relevant to this but are indeed the responsibility of the Minister for Industry <Col N="355" /> and Commerce.  The Deputy also referred to other areas which on his behalf I will refer to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett, in referring to the economic aspects, more or less repeated and approved of what I had to say when introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to respond to all the questions raised by Deputy Michael Higgins in his contribution, which lasted an hour and a half, but in response to his question who will be appointed as financial advisers I can tell him that this matter will be dealt with in the normal way by the Department and the successful people will be announced in due course. He also made reference to Holdco and Newco, companies I have already dealt with.  In response to his question why we opted for the figure of 34 per cent and not some other figure I can tell him that advice was received from the consultants in this regard.  They advised us on the best approach to adopt in trying to attract strategic investors while retaining a substantial stake in State ownership at the same time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also asked what is going to happen to the reserves.  In response, let me point out that they will continue to form part of the assets of the company.  The rights of shareholders and policyholders in this regard will be addressed by the courts who will have to be satisfied that the with-profits policyholders are getting a fair deal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also asked who gave me the right to transfer the funds of the policyholders from one company to another.  The procedure under the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, provides for the transfer of life assurance business <Col N="356" /> from one assurer to another.  This matter will also be dealt with by the courts, as I indicated in my opening remarks, when the policyholders will be fully consulted.  I have no doubt that the courts will uphold their rights in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the Irish Life holdings in various large companies quoted on the Stock Exchange.  These investments have been made on behalf of the policyholders.  There is nothing sinister about this and I have no doubt that this will continue to be the case when the business has been transferred.  Other Deputies indicated what may go wrong with Irish Life but I fail to understand what they are getting at as Irish Life is supervised in the same way as every other company.  Indeed, it is the strongest company around.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins also stated that this legislation will have disastrous consequences for Irish Life and its staff.  I regret that he said this and I do not know what he is getting at as all we are trying to do is ensure a better future for the company, its staff and policyholders. There is no doubt a big question mark would hang over the company and many other companies in this line of business in 1992 if no action is taken now to ensure a better future for them.  Even though Deputies have expressed doubts about this, I have no doubt that they will have a better future.  We have to decide which side we are on.  The Labour Party and The Workers' Party have stated what their policies are and I have outlined now what the view of the Government is.  Deputy Noonan put the view of Fine Gael on the line.  That is what democracy is all about and this House will decide on the issue tonight.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - French Farmers Irish Lamb Blockade.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank you, Sir, for having given me this opportunity to raise this vital matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I will endeavour not to take the full ten minutes in order to expedite business.</P>
      <P>On Sunday last three lorry loads of Irish lamb were blockaded at the ports of Le Havre and Cherbourg.  Many of our farmers have turned to sheep production in recent years in order to supplement losses incurred in other areas, particularly with regard to milk quota cutbacks, super-levies and problems encountered in relation to cereal production.  I might add that 90 per cent of our exports of lamb are to France.  Therefore it is vital that there be no harassment of our exporters on the part of French farmers.</P>
      <P>Within a couple of weeks this will have been the second time that a beef container will have been attacked with all of the beef destroyed.  I appreciate the problems French farmers are encountering in regard to their incomes, particularly within the sheep industry.  But rather than blame us and prevent the importation of our traditional exports to France they should look instead to their imports of more than 250,000 tonnes of lamb, the bulk of which is comprised of New Zealand sheepmeat, into the Community. The Community itself is self-sufficient to the extent of 85 per cent in this market.  Twenty per cent of Community imports come mainly from New Zealand, causing a 5 per cent glut in our market, because of the derogation allowed, particularly to New Zealand.  Our colleagues in Britain &mdash; because of the drop in sterling &mdash; enjoy an extra bonus by way of their exports to France while they themselves enjoy cheaper imports of New Zealand beef.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about New Zealand imports here &mdash; for the second year running their frozen lamb has been allowed in &mdash; while they enjoy a hitherto unheard of export market of frozen meat here of 540 tonnes this year, affecting our home consumption.  This meat is being bought mainly by the supermarkets who are not obliged to state clearly that it is New Zealand lamb they have an offer.  They are not obliged to state that it is frozen New Zealand lamb that is being imported as against Irish fresh meat.  In this way they are destroying the potential of their clientele within the communities which they purport so widely, by advertisement, to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned that the particular type of imports of New Zealand lamb which has aggravated the French and our markets has been comprised of prime cuts; it is not the whole carcase that is being imported, which is what must be done if we are to be competitive.  For example, gigots or neck of lamb is not used but rather prime cuts in order to compete against our farmers in this area. Some identification procedure should be compulsory in all EC countries, stating <Col N="361" /> clearly that these are foodstuffs from other countries.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned at the attitude of the French.  Indeed, many people outside this House would be concerned that, through our embassy, we have not brought the matter sufficiently to the attention of the French authorities on numerous occasions.  The French have highlighted their position when, in regard to the Tour de France, they brought about a detour the other day.  They also blockaded our trucks going into Le Havre and Cherbourg.  This is particularly worrying at a time when the price of Irish lamb has never been as low in the marketplace.  Indeed, I might add that the benefit to farmers would be even lower had it not been increased by our Minister for Agriculture and Food during our Presidency of the EC this year &mdash; when he got an extra £3 per head for lamb.</P>
    <P>Our Department of Agriculture must now be seen to protest publicly to the French authorities in regard to this matter and also take the matter up directly with our ambassador in Paris and the French ambassador here.  Indeed, I would recommend that they seriously consider &mdash; because of the crisis obtaining in Europe in the sheep industry &mdash; a suspension of all imports into the Community for a period, or devise a better price support mechanism for Irish and other Community-produced lamb.  I warn the Minister that this will continue to be a problem while we allow greater imports than consumption within the Community overall.  This arrangement formed part of the ridiculous GATT and 1976 agreements under which New Zealand and Australia were allowed exceptional latitude because of their former Commonwealth status.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State to give the House an assurance that there will be no continued threat to our exports of lamb.  Any perceived threat at present will merely cause panic in the market, bringing the price of lamb even lower than that obtaining at present.  I should also like to see the Minister advance a case for the consumption of more lamb <Col N="362" /> in this country while the present low price obtains.  I would ask the Minister to recommend to the European Community the idea of a temporary suspension of importation of all New Zealand products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to reply to the motion put down by Deputy Davern regarding the blockade by French farmers of Irish lorries containing lamb.</P>
      <P>The interruption or interference with exported Irish produce is viewed by the Government with great concern.  All steps necessary to rectify such a situation and to protect our exports were taken immediately.  In this particular case four lorries &mdash; three of Irish origin containing lamb, pigmeat and beef and one of British origin containing New Zealand lamb, were stopped in Cherbourg in what was an indiscriminate and illegal action by French farmers.  The action by the farmers was apparently designed to exert pressure on the French Agriculture Minister given the current difficult market situation in France which is resulting in low prices for produce.  The action was not specifically directed at sheep produce of Irish origin.  In fact it is our understanding that the protest was directed at the New Zealand lamb contained in the British lorry.  While all the Irish lorries were eventually allowed through, the British lorry with the New Zealand lamb had to return to Britian.  The Irish lorries involved were not interfered with and the produce does not appear to have been affected as a result of the delay involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the protest occurred the Department of Agriculture and Food contacted the Irish embassy in Paris who contacted the authorities in Cherbourg.  We have been assured by them that everything will be done to ensure the Irish traders can go about their legitimate business.  Some weeks ago a protest by French farmers involving sheepmeat from Ireland occurred.  The Irish ambassador and the agriculture attache protested to the French Authorities arising out of which the Ambassador subsequently received a written assurance from the French <Col N="363" /> Interior Minister which stated that all measures would be taken to ensure that Irish traders are not inconvenienced in any way.</P>
    <P>The Department will, of course, be keeping the situation under review and will take appropriate action as circumstances require.  In fact the current difficult market situation in the sheepmeat sector both in Ireland and France was raised by the French Minister and myself at the last Council meeting on 25-26 June.  The Commission is fully aware of the problems being encountered by producers and it is intended to monitor the situation closely.</P>
    <P>The current difficulty market situation is due to a number of factors, including the advantage to British lamb exports to the French market caused by the drop in the value of sterling <i>vis-á-vis</i> the French franc, the lower level of clawback on British lamb exports and increased slaughterings both here and in British leading to increased supplies on the market.  The cumulative export slaughtering figure for Ireland for this year to the week ending 16 June is up 31 per cent in 1989 with the figure for May showing a 43 per cent increase on the same month last year.</P>
    <P>Imports from New Zealand are governed by a Voluntary Restraint Agreement. This agreement provides for close monitoring of import prices to ensure that agreed benchmark levels are respected.  In 1989, 30 tonnes of New Zealand lamb were imported into the Irish market out of a total produce here of 58,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The 1990 ewe premium will help to compensate Irish producers for income loss sustained this year.  Indeed in 1990, producers will receive a once-off additional payment arising from changes in payment procedures.  The estimated total benefit of the ewe premium to Irish producers in 1990 will amount to some £130 million as compared to a normal annual figure of £70-£80 million.  Headage payments will also amount to £14 million so sheep farmers this year will be compensated to the tune of £140 million.  In <Col N="364" /> addition, as part of the EC prices package, an additional payment of about £3.40 per ewe will be paid from 1991 onwards for all eligible ewes to beneficiaries in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>These substantial payments will be of considerable assistance to producers especially in the context of cash flow problems as a result of the current difficult market situation.</P>
    <P>The Common Organisation of the Market for the sheepmeat sector provides for private storage did arrangements. Monthly tenders have been in operation since the beginning of this year for those regions of the Community including Ireland where prices fall below the 70 per cent benchmark level.  The private storage arrangements provide a safety mechanism for the sector.</P>
    <P>Again I want to thank Deputy Davern for bringing this matter to the attention of the House and to assure him that the Department of Agriculture and Food have been in contact with the French authorities and have received assurances that we will be able to export our sheep and lamb products to France without intimidation and without interference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and to thank the Minister for Justice for coming in at this late hour to hear it.</P>
      <P>The recent report, financed by the Combat Poverty Agency, on the financial circumstances of wives and children who are parties to marital breakdown, called &ldquo;Financial Consequences of Marital Breakdown&rdquo; is long overdue.  It is devastating evidence that we are only seeing the tip of a very grim iceberg of poverty among women and children, and the findings require a positive political response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study, which traced the situation of 1,100 wives who sought maintenance orders from their husbands, paints an unedifying picture of Irish errant husbands as being among the worst kind of <Col N="365" /> scoundrel, and it illustrates how our laws and court system allow them to walk away from their obligations to their family.</P>
    <P>The system which has developed through our Courts is humiliating and absolutely demeaning on a wife whose sole income comes from a husband's salary, and who is deemed ineligible for any State funding until she has pursued her claim for maintenance against her husband through the courts.</P>
    <P>The results of the study, some of which are that in over 80 per cent of the cases husbands were paying less that £60 per week towards the maintenance of their wives and children, that 60 per cent of the awards were for less than the lowest Social Welfare payments, which were in the region of £33, that only 13 per cent of live maintenance orders were fully paid up and 77 per cent were more than six months in arrears.  One statistic shows that in 407 live orders payable through the District Court Clerk, 28 per cent were without a payment ever, 49 per cent were more than six months in arrears, 10 per cent in arrears for less than six months and only 13 per cent were fully paid up.</P>
    <P>These daunting statistics are clear evidence that the system for dealing with applications for maintenance orders is not working.  I question the point of initiating legislation and putting laws in place if in fact they have such a poor record.</P>
    <P>I would like to commend the Combat Poverty Agency for commissioning the report and also Mr. Peter Ward of the law faculty in Cork for doing such a good job of it.  It is the first time we have had clear facts of what is happening in the grim underworld of our family courts and to the many powerless women who are in need and, time and again, seek redress at the clinics of the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>In 1974 in a paperback I wrote entitled <i>Irish Marriage, How Are You</i> I outlined the situation of these women and their children and the deprivation they suffer. I am sorry to say that, reading this report, nothing has changed in 16 years except that the numbers have increased.</P>
    <P>In reality what happens to such <Col N="366" /> women?  First, they take out a summons under the 1976 Act.  They go for a court hearing which is in private.  In most cases they will be representing themselves while the husbands will have solicitors who know the law, the judges, and all the dodges which will reduce the man's liability.  There may be adjournments of the case.  Eventually there will be a court order for a specific amount.  In many instances this is paid through a court clerk, and a wife then has to make weekly trips to him to collect her money.  If her husband defaults and goes into arrears she has to go back to the court and seek an attachment of earnings order.  The report in question showed that this attachment of earnings order doubled the chances of compliance with a maintenance order, but at 25 per cent of the whole study, it is still very inadequate.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, in a hearing for an attachment procedure the court will consider what is called the protected earnings rate, one which the court considers it would be improper to go below in respect of the husband.  Nowhere is a protected minimum income considered for the needs of the wife and children.  It is a constant battle for the separated wife, and the onus is on her all the time to discover her husband's whereabouts even if this means the humiliation of telling the world, her husband's workmates, his friends and neighbours that he has deserted her.  The onus is on her to know how much he earns.  What, is all this for if at the end all she gets is a maintenance order for around £33 per week, and even that is uncertain.  The system at the moment is so bad that simple measures to change it will not do.  We need radical measures such as one which was proposed recently in the United Kingdom and which they are going to put into effect.  That is that all maintenance payments awarded by the courts be deducted right away from the father's pay.</P>
    <P>Second, I would suggest the establishment of a central collection procedure, which is recommended in the report, to oversee all maintenance payments and be responsible for taking action on arrears and defaults.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> Third, I would propose &mdash; and this is something that is in the pipeline &mdash; that wives of unemployed and self-employed men should have a right of maintenance from the Department of Social Welfare with that Department pursuing the husband to claw back all or part of the maintenance support.</P>
    <P>I know that under the new lone parent proposals which are to come into effect in October, reclaiming maintenance will be possible.  I wonder about the whole procedure for the administration of this scheme.  In answer to Question No. 3 on the Order Paper today the Minister for Social Welfare gave what was not an entirely satisfactory answer to a question about the powers his Department will have under the Social Welfare Act, 1989, to effect clawbacks from liable spouses. In his reply he said that a detailed report on the application of the new liable relatives provision has been prepared by his Department and the administrative arrangements are being worked out at present with a view to the new provisions coming into force next October and that further legislative changes are to be considered in consultation with officials of the Department of Justice which would involve more effective provision being made for the enforcement of court orders in relation to the contributions due by liable relatives.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency report refers to these powers in the context of the Social Welfare Act, 1989.  It states on page 23:</P>
    <P>The 1989 Act does not confer any powers on the Department of Social Welfare or the health boards to institute enforcement proceedings on behalf of the wife.  The burden of pursuing the husband through the courts in the case of default on maintenance orders for small amounts remains with the wife.  Even in the cases where the wife has not secured a maintenance order and the Department or health board has applied to the District Court for a contribution order against the husband, it is not clear how such an <Col N="368" /> order can be enforced.  Neither the health board nor the Department of Social Welfare are given power to seek orders under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940 or the attachment of earnings orders.</P>
    <P>It seems there is not a great deal of clarification as to what is needed in terms of legislation and what powers the Minister for Social Welfare has.  I would like to think that this report is something that could be built upon.  I hope we can find a realistic solution to the problems of the wives and children, which are so clearly pointed out in this report.</P>
    <P>I would like an assurance that the scheme to be introduced in October will not end up like the dental scheme for the spouses of insured workers which was ill-thought out and ill-prepared.  I hope all the consultations will be completed and the necessary legislation in place to enable the smooth operation of the scheme.  We should take note of what the report states in this regard.  This is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare, but I would also like an assurance from the Minister for Justice who is here tonight that there will be a practical response from his Department and that they will not sit back in the face of the daunting findings of this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency report deals with two issues &mdash; the legal provisions for the maintenance of spouses and children and the general issue of poverty in the case of separated spouses, mainly wives. This is a matter which, of course, concerns the social welfare code.  The report indeed confirms the experience in other countries, which have a similar modern code to ours relating to family maintenance, that long term reliance on State support is an inevitable consequence for many couples who separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present law in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, introduced a fundamental change in maintenance law because until 1976 the law had not imposed a generally enforceable obligation on spouses to <Col N="369" /> maintain each other and their children. The Act provides that both spouses &mdash; not just the husband as heretofore &mdash; have this duty and the court, deciding maintenance, is directed to have particular regard to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the spouses and children and the financial needs and other responsibilities of the spouses.</P>
    <P>Under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the court &mdash; it will usually be the Circuit Court &mdash; has, on granting a decree of judicial separation, wider range of powers available to it to order financial provision and security for a spouse and dependent children. The court is empowered to order maintenance, as well as secured maintenance, which could continue after the death of the debtor spouse; to order lump sums; to order the transfer of property, including the family home, and to order that a spouse may occupy the family home for life.  However, the effect of marriage breakdown was put into perspective by the Supreme Court when it set down the broad principles governing the award of maintenance.  It said: &ldquo;The court... must first have regard to the somewhat pathetic fact that upon the separation of a husband and wife, and particularly a husband and wife with children, it is inevitable that all the parties will suffer a significant diminution in the overall standard of living.  The necessity for two separate residences to be provided for makes this an inescapable consequence of the separation...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As regards enforcement of maintenance orders, the 1976 Act introduced a new system by way of attachment of earnings.  The report found in relation to a sample number of maintenance orders, that an attachment of earnings order doubled the chances of compliance with a maintenance order.  It concludes that attachment is a more successful method of enforcement than arrest and committal under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1940.  This procedure together with the powers of the court to order seizure of the debtor's goods or his possible imprisonment if, although able to pay the <Col N="370" /> maintenance due, he wilfully refuses to do so, constitute the main enforcement procedures available to the courts.</P>
    <P>The report says that despite these provisions there is still a high default rate, although it cannot pinpoint the main reason why.  However it emerges from the report that the highest success rate for maintenance orders applies in the category of better paid maintenance debtors. This would seem to suggest that often the most likely reason for default will be the inability of the husband to pay.  In any event the result is that a large majority of wives who are granted maintenance orders cannot be assured of either an adequate or a secure income. This is also the experience in other countries.  The separation of the spouses exposes them and their children to the risk of poverty and this inevitably raises the question of income support for those families.</P>
    <P>The experience where a spouse has moved or deserted to another country can present further problems.  When Ireland assumed the Presidency of the European Community, I put forward a draft convention, aimed at simplifying the procedures for the enforcement of maintenance payments throughout the Community.  The main feature is the establishment of central authorities in each member state who, in co-operation with each other, will assist with both incoming and outgoing maintenance orders, with documentation, in ascertaining the whereabouts of debtors or their assets, and in taking appropriate action to bring about the recognition and enforcement of foreign maintenance judgments.  The draft convention, which was agreed by member states on 13 June last, also imposes on member states an obligation to take the necessary administrative and legal measures, including the provision of effective enforcement measures, to enable the central authorities to fulfil their functions under the convention.  I will be looking at our enforcement procedures in the context of that obligation in due course.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in the report to <Col N="371" /> which I would like to make specific reference. Paragraph 4.3 refers to the application of legal aid, in cases involving the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  The report suggests that because the powers of the Circuit Court to make maintenance orders under the 1989 Act are now more wide-ranging than those of the District Court under the 1976 Act, women who are legally aided under the provisions of the scheme of civil aid and advice may be at a disadvantage. This arises, the report contends, because they may be obliged by the terms of their legal aid certificate to process their case for maintenance in the District Court rather than in the Circuit Court.  This is incorrect.  The particular provision in the scheme has never been <Col N="372" /> interpreted by the Legal Aid Board so as to restrict an applicant's access to a more effective remedy available in a higher court.  I am aware that the board have taken up the matter with the Combat Poverty Agency with a view to having the matter clarified.</P>
    <P>The uncertainty of payment of family maintenance despite a court order to pay is a matter of concern in this country as well as in other countries.  The report is useful in highlighting the fact here and it increases our understanding of the problems involved.  The findings in the report will be taken into account in the context of our further examination of these matters.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.50 a.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 July 1990.</P>

      <P>There are a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance <Col N="114" /> with housing costs.  Under the social welfare code there are provisions in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist householders in difficulties with either rent or mortgage repayments. There is also a special allowance scheme for tenants who were affected by the decontrol of rents in 1982.</P>
      <P>Other schemes which assist with housing costs include the differential rent schemes for tenants in local authority housing and mortgage interest tax relief for owner-occupiers.</P>
      <P>The commission on social welfare recognised the difficulties involved and recommended housing benefit as a long-term, rather than an immediate, objective. The commission recommended that priority should be given to increasing social welfare rates generally.  In recent years very substantial increases in social welfare payments, particularly for those on the lowest rates, have been introduced.</P>
      <P>The integration of all existing arrangements into a single housing benefit scheme would be very complex and would have wide-ranging financial and other implications.  There are no plans at present for the introduction of such a scheme.</P>

      <P>Applicants for old age pension who have capital are assessed with a notional income from the capital.</P>
      <P>The formula for assessing the means in this case was originally provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  The formula in current use, which was introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 1979, is set out in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  It provides for disregarding the first £200 of capital calculating the next £375 at 5 per cent and the balance at 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>In addition in 1975 provision was made for adding, where the means assessed from capital amount to at least £1 per week, an additional £1 a week to the weekly means.</P>
      <P>Under the old age pension scheme there is an overall means disregard under which a person can have means from all sources of up to £6 a week and still qualify for the maximum pension.  In the case of a married couple this would be £12 per week.  This means that, under existing arrangements, a married couple could have joint capital of over £5,900 and still qualify for maximum pension.  They could have joint capital of almost £58,000 and still qualify for a reduced pension.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for making and amending rent schemes for local authority dwellings was devolved to local authorities in August 1986.  Local authorities were required by the Minister for the Environment to ensure that rent schemes adopted by them were based on certain broad principles.  One of these was that the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required <Col N="120" /> from low income households.  It is a further requirement that provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases, where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
      <P>Applicants for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme towards rent are required to meet the first £3.20 of the rent themselves.  In determining the amount of supplement to be paid, the general practice of the health boards is to leave the client with an income, after payment of rent, equivalent to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate appropriate to his family circumstances, less £3.20.</P>
      <P>The health boards do not normally pay rent supplements to persons paying differential rents as it is open to the local authorities to invoke hardship clauses under the differential rent schemes so as to reduce the rents charged.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, any person, subject to certain specific exclusions, whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of his dependants, is entitled to an allowance. This can take the form of a weekly payment or a special payment to meet a particular need.  An emigrant's spouse who is in financial difficulties could apply for an allowance under this scheme.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna 36 agus 37 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Tá sé mar aidhm ag Scéim na Cóiríochta Saoire de chuid mo Roinn-se an chóiríocht sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú agus a fhairsingiú do chuairteoirí a bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus is deontas forlíontach, anuas ar dheontas ó Bhord Fáilte Éireann, a íoctar faoin scéim.</P>
      <P>Nuair a d'fhógair Bord Fáilte an &ldquo;Reconstruction and Development Scheme&rdquo; i mí Dheireadh Fómhair 1985, leag siad béim ar leith ar chuairteoirí ó thíortha eile a mhealladh agus dúirt go gcaithfeadh iarratasóirí ar dheontais faoin scéim plean a fheidhmiú, a bheadh inghlactha do Bhord Fáilte, chun cur leis an turasóireacht iasachta.  I bhfianaise sin, chinn an tAire ag an am nach mbeadh deontais fhorlíontacha iníoctha d'iarratasóirí a fuair deontais faoin scéim áirithe sin de chuid Bhord Fáilte toisc nach raibh aidhmeanna na scéime (cur leis an turasóireacht iasachta) ag teacht le cuspóirí scéim mo Roinne-se (cóiríocht do thurasóirí le suim acu sa Ghaeilge). Ní miste a lua gur polasaí é seo lena raibh glactha ag an Aire roinnt blianta roimhe sin freisin nuair a bhí béim ar an turasóireacht iasachta i scéim eile de chuid Bhord Fáilte.  I bhfianaise an pholasaí sin, cuireadh in iúl do na daoine éagsúla a luaitear sna ceisteanna nach mbeadh deontais fhorlíontacha le fáil acu faoi scéim mo Roinne-se.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Socraíodh níos déanaí, áfach, mar bheart eisceachtúil tar éis moladh a fháil ón Ombudsman, go mba chóir deontas a íoc le duine de na hiarratasóirí.  Sá chás sin, ní raibh sé mínithe don iarratasóir nach mbeadh cúnamh ar fáil dó agus d'éiligh sé go ndeachaigh sé ar aghaidh leis <Col N="123" /> an obair tar éis dó cead a fháil ó Bhord Fáilte ar an tuiscint go mbeadh cúnamh ar fáil dó ó mo Roinn se freisin.  Íocadh deontas £6,600 leis an iarratasóir sin ar 16 Nollaig 1988.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an iarratasóir a luaitear sa dara cheist mar dhuine ar diúltaíodh deontas dó faoi scéim mo Roinne-se, cuireadh an cinneadh in iúl dó ar an 30 Eanáir 1986 agus níor ceadaíodh deontas Bhord Fáilte dó go dtí 21 Feabhra 1986. Is léir, mar sin, go bhfuil súinsí an cháis sin difriúil ar fad, os rud é go raibh cinneadh an Aire ar eolas ag an iarratasóir roimh dó cinneadh a fháil ó Bhord Fáilte, leo siúd a bhaineann leis an gcás thuasluaite.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as the insurance supervisory authority, my primary and statutory duty is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements.  Therefore, I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their under-writing experience.  There is no legal obligation on any insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote in any manner or at any particular premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the company to which the Deputy refers has by far the largest share of the motor cycle market with over <Col N="131" /> 90 per cent of motor cycle risks on its books.  However, I would point out that this position has developed over the years primarily because of the reluctance of other companies to give such cover. Therefore, it is not a question of that company seeking a monopoly on the market but rather that it is the only company prepared to do a large volume of business in this area.</P>
    <P>As with other types of insurance cover the cost of motor cycle insurance is directly related to the number and cost of claims.  The losses which insurers have incurred on their motor business in the recent past have been well documented with losses for 1989 expected to exceed £100 million.  The position in the motor cycle sector is even more difficult.  Available statistics show an extremely high accident rate for motor cyclists.  Moreover, a significant factor in the cost of motor cycle insurance is the age of the insured.  Insurance rates for motor cyclists under 25 are substantially higher than the corresponding rates for more mature policyholders &mdash; reflecting the greater risk levels involved.  The fact is that motor cyclists have been statistically proven to have a high accident rate and, therefore, to cause claims.  The cost of these claims can only be met by insurers if a realistic premium is forthcoming to adequately cover the risk involved.</P>

These rates are adjusted regularly in accordance with budgetary increases.</P>
      <P>In the case of farmers, means for unemployment assistance purposes are assessed under specific provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.  This legislation provides that the yearly value of any advantage accruing to the claimant from the use of property &mdash; other than property personally used and enjoyed by the claimant, such as a dwelling &mdash; is assessable as means.</P>
      <P>The yearly advantage is usually calculated on the actual income from the farm, less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income, in the 12 months preceding the date of the investigation.  Allowance is made for any exceptional factors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.  The term &ldquo;subversive prisoner&rdquo; is not sufficiently precise to enable detail of the type requested in these questions to be compiled with precision and in any event the work required for an exercise of this nature would involve the expenditure of prison officer and departmental staff time to an extent that could not be warranted.</P>

      <P>The attached tabular statement shows the number of persons for whom extradition warrants were received from Northern Ireland and Britain in the period since 1978.  Warrants for the return of persons to Northern Ireland and Britain originate, of course, from the relevant police force &mdash; not the British Government.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Garda authorities that it can happen that warrants are received in respect of an individual in more than one year or that warrants received in one year are withdrawn and renewed in later years.  The figures include one entry in respect of such individuals relating to the date of the original warrant.  I am advised too, that the figures provided do not distinguish between persons sought for the purpose of standing trial and those sought to serve a sentence on foot of a pre-existing conviction.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that an anomaly exists in this area.  While the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 prevents a spouse from disposing of the family home by sale, mortgage, re-mortgage etc. without the prior written consent of the other spouse it also empowers the court to dispense with the need for that spouse's consent on the ground either that the refusal to consent in unreasonable or that that spouse is in desertion.  The Act in addition empowers the court to give its consent on behalf of a spouse where, for example, that spouse cannot be found.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions attaching to the amenities/recreational facilities grants scheme, 1990 are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> 1.  The aim of the scheme is to assist in the carrying out of projects of an amenity, recreational, leisure or environmental improvement <Col N="146" /> nature, other than projects which are primarily of a commercial nature.</P>
    <P>2.  Grants will be allocated on the understanding that the project is not being grant assisted by any other Government Department.</P>
    <P>3.  A grant allocation will be made on the understanding that a local contribution of at least 30 per cent will be made towards the cost of the project.  Satisfactory evidence of the availability of the local contribution must be produced.  The cost of the project can be taken to include the value of work done by voluntary labour for the purpose of calculating the 30 per cent contribution, e.g., if the total cost is £50,000 including voluntary labour valued at £5,000, a local cash contribution of £10,000 will be sufficient in order to qualify for a grant of up to 70 per cent (£35,000).</P>
    <P>4.  A grant will not normally exceed £50,000 in any individual case.</P>
    <P>5.  Grants will be available only in respect of actual costs borne by the applicant organisation. The value of work done by voluntary labour or under training schemes cannot be reckoned for grant-aid except for the purpose of calculating the minimum 30 per cent contribution, condition No. 3.  For example, if the total cost is £50,000 of which voluntary labour, or the training scheme element, forms £25,000, the maximum grant allowable is £25,000, the sum actually spent, not £35,000, 70 per cent of total cost.</P>
    <P>6.  Reasonable progress towards the commencement of work on an approved project must be in evidence within three months from the date of allocation of a grant.  In the absence of such progress, the Minister, having given notice of his intention to do so, may cancel the grant allocation.</P>
    <P>All projects or phases of projects must be completed by such dates as may be specified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>7.  A grant allocation will be conditional on:</P>
    <P> (a)  in the case of a project being carried out by a body other than a local authority, the detailed planning and execution of the work being subject to the general approval of the authority and the authority being satisfied that the project sponsors have a substantive beneficial interest in the site;</P>
    <P>(b)  the local authority being satisfied that the balance of the cost of the project is, or can be made, available;</P>
    <P>(c)  the submission to the Department of the Environment by the local authority of a certificate that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the project, when completed, will be of public utility and will be available for public or community use as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>&mdash;there will be adequate arrangements for managements and maintenance and for meeting running costs, if any. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> 8.  It will be a matter for the local authority to ensure that cost estimates are accurate; no additional grants under this scheme will be made in respect of any cost overruns arising for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>9.  Grant payments will be made directly to the local authority on behalf of the bodies involved on receipt of the appropriate expenditure-recoupment certificate from the local authority.</P>
    <P>10.  Grant payments with in all cases be made in arrears on receipt of certificates of expenditure. Claims for payment may be made as the need arises.</P>
    <P>11.  Payment of grants exceeding £500 from State or local authority sources is conditional on the payees producing satisfactory evidence that their tax affairs are in order.  This applies to voluntary bodies as well as to individuals and companies.  Where it is proposed to carry out work by contract, tax clearance procedures relating to the contractor must be complied with before the contract is signed.  Advice in these matters is available from the local authority responsible for supervising the grant-assisted project and should be sought so as to avoid difficulties and delays in payment of the grant. Further information in regard to implementation of this condition is given in the Appendix.</P>
    <P>12.  Projects receiving grants of £10,000 and upwards from lottery funds will be expected to display an acknowledgement that the project has been aided by the national lottery.  The local authority, in conjunction with the National Lottery Company, will provide further advice on this aspect.</P>
    <P>13.  Grant allocations are made strictly on the understanding that the project will be completed without further grant aid under this scheme.</P>
    <P>14.  A fact sheet, available from the local authority, giving particulars of the project, must be supplied with each application for a grant. </P>
    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX</P>
    <P>Further information on tax clearance procedures (see condition No. 1)</P>
    <P> 1.  Payments greater than £500 and up to £10,000: The grant beneficiary will be required to give the following information to the local authority:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the tax district dealing with his tax affairs,</P>
    <P>&mdash;his tax reference number, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;indicate that, to the best of his knowledge, his tax affairs are in order.  </P>
    <P>It will then be a matter for the local authority to check that this information is correct in a proportion of the cases, 10 per cent, before recommending payment of the grant to the Department.  This checking can be done with the appropriate tax district office or the Claims and <Col N="148" /> Residence Branch of the Revenue Commissioners, as appropriate</P>
    <P>2.  Payments exceeding £10,000: The normal tax clearance procedures for public sector contracts will operate except for bodies which have been granted the status of a charitable organisation by the Revenue Commisioners.  If granted this status, the procedure set out above for payment of grants up to £10,000 applies.  In all other cases, the grant beneficiary for payments exceeding £10,000 will be required to produce a current tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners before payment of the grant can be recommended to the Department.</P>
    <P>3.  Payments where a contractor is involved: Where a contractor is engaged by the grant beneficiary for work exceeding £500 such contractor must have a current C2 certificate or a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners before the local authority can recommend payment of the grant to the Department. This requirement is in addition to the requirements set out at paragraphs one and two above.</P>
    <P>4.  Charitable Status: Bodies wishing to apply for charitable status for tax purposes should contact the Charities Section, Claims and Residence Branch, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Dublin Castle, Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>5.  Submission of claims for payment: Local authorities need not append copies of tax certificate etc. when submitting claims on the standard form for recoupment of grants under the scheme. </P>

      <P>Roscommon County Council are at present carrying out an in-depth study of alternative routes for the proposed Curlews by-pass scheme and are in the process of engaging independent consultants to prepare an environmental impact statement on these alternatives. When the statement is complete, it will be presented to Roscommon and Sligo County Councils for consideration before a final decision is made regarding the alignment.  Pending this decision, the question of land acquisition, compulsory or by agreement, is premature.</P>
      <P>Pending the EC Commission's decision on the operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructure it is not proposed to indicate the phasing and funding of major road improvement schemes in the period tO 1993.</P>

      <P>In order to ensure that emergency and urgent cases can be dealt with promptly, patients' positions on the waiting list are kept under review and are subject to change.  The precise length of time spent on the waiting list for admission depends on the urgency of each individual case. There are 801 cases on the waiting list for admission for ENT surgery at Temple Street hospital and 373 on the waiting list in Beaumont hospital.  It is estimated that in 1990 1,800 ENT procedures will be carried out in Temple Street hospital and 2,400 in Beaumont hospital.</P>

Earlier this year I allocated £1 million for the development of additional services.  As a result, an extra 91 residential places, 184 day places and 66 outreach places are being provided to meet immediate priority needs.  The full year costs of these additional services, which is £1.5 million, will be provided in 1991.</P>
      <P>I have asked the eight health boards to prepare multi-annual plans in consultation with the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees.  These plans will be targeted over the next five years and will form the basis for the preparation of a national programme, to be implemented in accordance with the resources made available to me for this purpose.</P>

In order to ensure that emergency and urgent cases can be dealt with promptly, patients' positions on the waiting list are kept under review and are subject to change.

      <P>Capital Airlines is a UK licensed airline authorised by the UK authorities under the terms of the Irel-and-UK Air Services Agreement to operate scheduled services on three routes <Col N="168" /> between the UK and Ireland, viz Luton-Dublin, Leeds/Bradford-Dublin and Belfast-Dublin.  I understand from the UK authorities that a receiver was appointed last week to the airline's parent company, Brown Group International, and that the airline have suspended their operations.</P>
      <P>As the matter is in the hands of the receiver, it is not clear at this stage whether the airline will resume operations.</P>
