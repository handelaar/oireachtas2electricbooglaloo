      <P>While I do not want to hold up the business of the House, I must protest at the use of the guillotine with regard to the motion on the local elections order which is being taken at the very last minute; we are given just a few hours tonight to debate an issue of such importance &mdash; and most of all, with regard to the Finance Bill.  We had the budget in January yet the Finance Bill is being rushed through at the very last minute.  I must protest at the manner in which this is being done and at the Government's delay in introducing this Bill, probably the most important Bill of the year.  I am not calling a vote on the matter because I know it has to be dealt with now in this manner, but I am protesting at the manner in which the Government have held up this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann confirms the following Order:</P>
      <P>Local Elections (Specification of Local Election Year) Order, 1990, </P>
      <P>a copy of which Order was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 30th day of April, 1990. </P>
      <P>The purpose of this order is to postpone for one year the local elections which would otherwise fall to be held in June of this year.  The statutory provision for altering the period for holding local elections is contained in section 2 of the Local Elections Act, 1973.  This section provides that where the Minister is satisfied that local elections should be postponed he may, by order, provide that the elections shall be held in a year specified in the order.  Such an order shall not come into effect unless and until a copy thereof has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order has been confirmed by resolution of each House.</P>
      <P>The instrument which this House is now being asked to confirm was made for one specific and very important reason, to facilitate an urgent and thorough review of the local government system so that a programme of local government reform and reorganisation can be implemented as soon as possible.  Deputies will be aware of the statement issued by me a few weeks ago in which I outlined the aims, format and timescale of this review.  I will be dealing with these aspects in more detail presently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, however, I want to put it as emphatically as possible to the House that it would be utterly pointless to proceed with local elections at the very time when a major review of the structures and system of local government is being undertaken.  Common sense alone would suggest the folly of electing some 1,600 councillors for a further five year term to old structures which are about to be <Col N="1553" /> subjected to a fundamental and comprehensive overhaul.</P>
    <P>The issue, therefore, which this motion brings before the House for decision &mdash; and the only real issue &mdash; is to proceed now with the reform and reorganisation of local government.  What do I need to say about local government reform? There is little to be said that has not been said many times already.  If talk alone could achieve results, the local government system would have been reorganised several times over during the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>Everyone seems to be aware of the need for reorganisation, for the introduction of change, but very little has happened. It is a matter which, to one extent or another, has been on the agenda of successive Governments.  At times it has taken centre stage, but more usually it has been sidelined as energy was devoted to other urgent and pressing issues.  Yet it has stubbornly refused to go away. The need for fundamental overhaul has remained and the local government issue remains.</P>
    <P>In an endeavour to tackle the problem once and for all, the Government had proposed to establish an Oireachtas committee &mdash; an all-party commiteee &mdash; to examine and report on the whole question of local government reorganisation. There was much merit in this proposal. It was a means of seeking a general consensus about the way forward for local government, to plot the changes necessary for improvement and to establish a general basis as to the measures necessary. Unfortunately, not all political parties were willing to contribute to the proposed committee.  In this context I would like to place on record that this approach was proposed by this Government to achieve a consensus and was rejected by those who are regularly to the fore in proclaiming the advantages of operating a parliamentary committee system.</P>
    <P>With effective rejection of the proposed Oireachtas committee the Government had two options.  Firstly, it could, as so often happened in the past, have <Col N="1554" /> backed away from the problem, abandoned the reorganisation question and allowed the local government system to drift on without the changes necessary to face into the future.  The alternative was take action now &mdash; action that was so often avoided in the past &mdash; to strengthen our system of local government.  We have chosen the latter course.  It is for this reason that local elections due this year are being postponed &mdash; to allow for necessary changes to be made so that the electorate are fully aware of the reorganised system, its role, responsibilities, functions, structures and potential, and so that elections can be held on this basis.</P>
    <P>I would like to reflect briefly on our existing local authority system.  There is no denying that in many ways it has served us well.  It has ensured that such basic services as water and sanitation are now enjoyed by almost every home, that an adequate road network has extended throughout the State, that housing has been provided for those in need, that recreational and amenity facilities &mdash; swimming pools, sports centres, parks, libraries, picnic sites and so on &mdash; are available and that there is capacity to respond effectively to fire and other emergencies.  In general the supporting infrastructure to underpin viable economic growth is in place; action is taken to ensure that our environment is protected and that development proceeds on a properly planned basis.  This gives an idea of the scope and range of local government activity.</P>
    <P>Yet all of these efforts have had to take place in the context of an antiquated system.  Local authorities have had to face the problems of the modern era from within a framework which in many ways remains as it was originally established over a century ago and which had its origins in 19th century British legislation. The structures which are still in place today were established by Acts of 1840, 1854, 1878 and 1898 &mdash; an age when roads were the preserve of the horse and the idea of democratic government was still regarded as a new-fangled and slightly dangerous motion.  There is a clear need to consider how these structures are <Col N="1555" /> adapted to the demands of today.  There is a clear need to ensure that the system can respond to modern needs and concerns and that the taxpayer obtains the best value for his or her investment in local government for the very sizeable share of public expenditures that local authorities put through their hands.</P>
    <P>I could dwell at length on the particular needs of the Dublin area.  Its sheer size, scale and the pace of development, the need for meaningful interaction with local communities, the need to enhance the sense of identity between communities and local government and the necessity to plan and operate services on an effective basis all point to the need for special arrangements to take account of these realities.</P>
    <P>The last three decades in particular have seen a social transformation in Ireland.  Changes such as urbanisation, population growth and dispersal, new economic factors, the move towards a car based society with new travel patterns, new recreational needs and increased public expectations that a local government system should impact on areas outside its traditional local authority domain and be free to take the required initiatives are developments that more and more point to the need for change.  No system, public sector or private sector, can hope to remain forever unchanged.  If it does it will eventually wither and die.  It must be free to grow and develop.</P>
    <P>There must be a new emphasis on dealing with problems, not to be hidebound by out of date procedures or frozen by institutional inertia.  The system must be flexible.  It must be capable of facilitating and supporting community and private enterprise and of undertaking action in its own right where this is needed for the benefit of its area.</P>
    <P>The Government's aim is, first and foremost, to strengthen local democracy in Ireland.  Modern communications and technology have greatly increased the opportunities for a move in this direction and the legislative framework should leave the way clear for local authorities to become progressively more involved. <Col N="1556" /> Side by side with this there is a need for a review of central controls and a removal of unnecessary procedures.</P>
    <P>The powers available to local authorities will be looked at as will the question of reserved-managerial functions and the implications of &ldquo;section 4&rdquo; for the planning system.  Much of the existing general legislation relating to local government is inflexible, antiquated and outdated and in need of consolidation and reform.  Authorities must be freed from unnecessary constraints, made free to operate efficiently and effectively and internal procedures must support this. The system itself must not be an obstacle to progress.</P>
    <P>Radical changes here will not happen overnight but we must begin a move to improve the existing situation.  People who talk in broad generalisations must face up to the real problems and examine each service and its possibility for better integration.</P>
    <P>The cost implications and the individual service requirements cannot be ignored.  It is only in such a manner that we can move forward.  Change along these lines is a major undertaking involving several Government Departments and many other public agencies.  Legislation is obviously required.  We will not be able to deal simultaneously with all the issues to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>We propose, however, to deal with the immediate issues now and to map out our plan for the future and the arrangements to see through reforms which of necessity will take time to implement.  Unlike what has happened in the past these are not mere pious aspirations.  The Government have established a mechanism to see through the reform programme.  A special Government committee have been set up to come up with proposals and have been asked to report by 30 September 1990.  A committee of experts have also been established to assist in this task.  The intention is that the necessary legislation will be brought forward this year and enacted by the end of February 1991.  Any subsequent legislation which is required to cover related matters beyond the more immediate elements and any <Col N="1557" /> other administrative arrangements which may be required, will follow closely.</P>
    <P>In setting out the immediate issues to be tackled by the special Government committee, the main emphasis must be on getting the structures and functions settled, but the committee are also being asked to make recommendations on the criteria on which the contribution from central funds to local authorities should be made on a statutory basis.  It is appropriate that this question of funding should now be examined in conjunction with the question of structures and functions. While I cannot, and certainly have no desire to pre-empt in any way the special committee's consideration of the issues involved, it may well be that any recommendations they may make in relation to structures and functions could, of themselves, have direct consequences for the distribution of the central contribution. It is patently desirable that the special committee should address that issue.  But quite apart from that, there have been developments in relation to local finances in recent years which, of themselves, require that special attention should now be given to this aspect.</P>
    <P>I have implemented a number of significant reforms in relation to local finance over the past three years.  The most significant of these perhaps was the introduction of straightforward capital grants to replace the outmoded and bureaucratic loans and subsidies system.  This reform alone eliminated circular transfers of large sums between the Exchequer and local authorities and has produced a more streamlined financial arrangement both for central administration and for the local authorities.  The merits of this change have been widely recognised.  I am happy to say, too, that almost all statutory demands and extraneous financial burdens which bedevilled the efforts of local authorities to improve their own financial control and management over the years have now been eliminated.  This streamlining process continued this year with the termination, which I announced recently, of local authority financial responsibility for the <Col N="1558" /> provision and maintenance of courthouses. The net effect on local finances is that local authorities will be recouped the cost of this work by the Department of Justice.  This particular reform had long been sought by many local authorities over a long period.</P>
    <P>Each of these reforms has been widely welcomed for its own sake.  This is readily understandable when it is considered that each represented a direct financial burden on local authorities and related to services over which they had little real local control.  The cumulative effect, however, has been to alter various aspects of the central-local financial &ldquo;equation&rdquo;, if I may so describe it.  It is timely that these aspects should be specially considered now.</P>
    <P>What is now under way, therefore, is a programme supported by Government for the reform and reorganisation of local government which should see a system which is more meaningful and relevant to the public, which will meet the needs of local communities, which will give an efficient service in operating major expenditure programmes and which will maximise the return to the taxpayer for his investment.  It is a system which will operate within a new legislative framework with the freedom to develop, which is alive and innovative with a substantial change in the scope of its activity and with an increased relevance for people going about their daily lives.</P>
    <P>If the present order is confirmed by both Houses, the next local elections will fall due in June 1991.  In accordance with the provisions of the Local Elections Act, 1973, the present members of local authorities will continue to hold office until the new elections are held.  The 1973 Act also contains consequential arrangements in relation to the appointment of school attendance committees and the meetings of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is a single Member of this House who is not convinced of the urgent need for local government reform.  The announcement of the Government intention has been well received inside and outside the <Col N="1559" /> House.  I would ask you to remember in the final analysis that what is at issue here is not just the confirmation of a statutory instrument.  It is an opportunity for this House to demonstrate its commitment to local government and to provide a clear mandate to the reform and reorganisation which we all know to be essential.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, commend the order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons the Minister gave for the postponement of the local elections sound credible at face value until you examine the background to them.  The Minister said that the election should be postponed for a year because he has finally recognised the need and urgency of local government reform.</P>
      <P>There is the suggestion that major &mdash; if not astounding &mdash; developments will take place within our democratic system during the next 12 months and that commonsense will dictate that all Members of this House should be on all fours with the Minister in supporting the postponement. It was very interesting to analyse the nature of the statement which the Minister made in the House today because he, perhaps unwittingly, admitted that the major and comprehensive reform of local government which we all recognise as essential will not come into place in time for the elections of June 1991.  The Minister as much as admits that in the course of his remarks &mdash; having listed changes recognised as necessary &mdash; when he said:</P>
      <P>Change along these lines is a major undertaking involving several Government Departments and many other public agencies.  Legislation is obviously required.  We will not be able to deal simultaneously with all of the issues to which I have referred.  We propose, however, to deal with the immediate issues now and to map out our plan for the future and the arrangements to see through reforms which of necessity will take time to implement. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me quite clear that, in that <Col N="1560" /> passage, the Minister is admitting that if there are any reforms by way of legislation relating to local Government brought before this House this side of June 1991 they will be of the cosmetic variety only, that there is little or no prospect of any substantial reform.  That appears to be the position and the Minister admits that to be the position.  If that is the position there is no rational basis for postponing the local elections that should be held this year.  Indeed the only reason this Government are postponing those elections is that Fianna Fáil councillors around the country are frightened of facing the electorate to take responsibility for the false promises made by them in the local elections of 1985; also because this Government, contrary to what the Minister has said consistently since becoming Minister in 1987, have undermined local democracy, deprived local authorities of functions they should exercise, or have constrained their finances to such an extent that they have been unable to exercise the functions conferred on them by statute.</P>
    <P>It is very curious, at a time when the Taoiseach is parading around Europe as the President of the European Communities, lauding the new found democracies in Eastern Europe, encouraging the electoral process not merely through the formation of governments within Eastern European countries but also in the context of local elections, that this harbinger of democracy, the man who supports <i>perestroika</i> on behalf of the European Communities in Eastern Europe, apparently does not have the same enthusiasm for elections on our shores.</P>
    <P>Many, if not all, of the Members on this side of the House in all of the parties represented &mdash; I would hope including Independent Deputies &mdash; believe that the reason given for the postponement of these elections has absolutely no credibility whatsoever.  I say that in the context of the record of this Government.  To hear the Minister speak one would think that suddenly around January or February of this year, one night, lying in the bath contemplating his kneecaps, he <Col N="1561" /> discovered that we needed local government reform.  One would almost forget that this Minister has been Minister for the Environment in excess of three years. In fact one might well forget that in the Fianna Fáil document &ldquo;<i>Power Back to the People</i>&rdquo;&mdash; there is a fabulous phrase &mdash;&ldquo;<i>The Fianna Fáil Alternative, Local Elections 1985</i>&rdquo; promises were made about local government reform.  Page 7 of that powerful document entitled <i>Power Back to the People</i>, powerful in everything but implementation, reads, and I quote under the heading &ldquo;A New Role for the Local Authorities&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that the Local Authorities have the potential, if properly directed, to make a major impact on the problems facing the country. We propose: That Local Authorities assume the role of local enterprise agencies, initiating development, linking the operations of state agencies in their areas and stimulating construction, thus helping to tackle the unemployment problem: Greater devolution of functions to Local Authorities: Reform of Local Authority finances involving the abolition of compulsory water and service charges. </P>
    <P>What happened to that throughout the length and breadth of the country?  What happened to that in Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Wicklow, Wexford and everywhere else where Fianna Fáil councillors are supporting local charges?  One might well ask what else did Fianna Fáil commit themselves to?  The same document proposed:</P>
    <P>...Extension of second-tier local government District Councils, based on re-drawn electoral areas with major towns as focal points and with special provisions for Gaeltacht Electoral areas. </P>
    <P>Then there is decentralisation of Government Departments as part of regional development where it said:</P>
    <P>That the trend towards extended control by the County Manager system must be reversed by strengthening the <Col N="1562" /> power of the locally-elected representatives who reflect the wishes of the people. </P>
    <P>Is not it strange that this document produced by Deputy Molloy, the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on the Environment, has not seen any of its proposals implemented within the three years of this Minister's political stay in the Department of the Environment?  Is it not curious that the radical and astounding mould breaking proposals for the reform of local government that the present Minister for Energy, as chief bottle washer of the Progressive Democrats on this issue has been peddling publicly for the past few weeks, happily coincides with the promises he wrote up for the Fianna Fáil Party for the local elections of 1985?  Now we are going to have district councils, less power in the managerial system; we are going to have decentralisation.  Here is a mould breaker, a man who peddled a policy in 1985 for Fianna Fáil pretending, in 1990 that it is something new and mould breaking for the Progressive Democrats.  Page 9 of that document is headed &ldquo;Structural Reform&rdquo; and states:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will introduce a major programme of reform which will radically strengthen the local government system.  Fianna Fáil believes that democracy itself is greatly strengthened where there is a system of government that recognises the value of local participation in the administration of the wide variety of affairs that affect peoples lives.  Fianna Fáil supports the view that strong multi-purpose local authorities with directly elected membership present the most efficient, economic and democratic means of providing public services.  Fianna Fáil will retain the existing County Council and County Boroughs as the main unit of local government and will introduce new local representation in all areas throughout the country.  These smaller units will consist of rural urban District Councils with representations based on a district rather than on towns, as at present. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> Which member of the Progressive Democrats was saying that again last weekend? The same document continues:</P>
    <P>In Government, we will review the boundaries of each electoral area and adjustments will be made where necessary to facilitate the establishment of the new District Councils. </P>
    <P>How many district councils has the Minister for the Environment established in Dublin since 1987?  How many has he established elsewhere?  We are told in this document:</P>
    <P>In Dublin, District Councils will be established in each electoral area. </P>
    <P>Where are these multiple district councils we were promised?  In addition we are told:</P>
    <P>Special consideration will be given to the Gaeltacht electoral areas to facilitate the establishment of Gaeltacht District Councils.  Membership of all government bodies will be by direct election. </P>
    <P>It is very difficult to take seriously what the Minister is now saying.  No doubt the Minister will protest and say: &ldquo;Ah, well in 1985 I was not in Government.&rdquo; In 1985 some initial changes were effected in the local government system in Dublin and this Minister never followed through to ensure their effectiveness.  In Dublin county at present, instead of there being a 78-member county council, there could be three separate local authorities operating in a coherent way making a genuine contribution to local democracy and to their communities.  At present the 78 members of Dublin County Council have to manage as best they can in an overcrowded council chamber conducting business in a way that any junior business executive would regard as a monstrosity in taking simple business decisions, whatever about taking decisions that affect the whole of Dublin County.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil did not leave it at that.  We did not hear of local electoral reform in 1985 and then the matter went to sleep. We had a general election in 1987.  Lest <Col N="1564" /> it be forgotten that the Minister when appointed to Government, may have forgotten what was said in 1985 we should remind him of what was said in 1987, on page 41 of the Fianna Fáil General Election Manifesto under the heading &ldquo;Regional Policy&rdquo; and I quote:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that local areas can be given a more direct and creative role in contributing towards national recovery.  We will resume the implementation of our decentralisation programme with a decentralisation of sections of Government Departments to centres outside the Dublin region.  Such a policy will not only reduce regional imbalance in public sector employment but will also help to reduce the pressures on the Dublin region.  We will promote the preparation of integrated development programmes in the regions for which EC funding will be available.  We will encourage the regions to prepare feasibility studies for the regional programmes to ensure the maximum benefit from national and Community funding.  In accordance with our local election document <i>Power Back to the People</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this document had not been forgotten in 1987 when we were again looking for power for the people&mdash;</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will undertake a comprehensive reorganisation of local government structure.  This will include, in addition to the existing county councils and county boroughs, the creation of smaller units based on the district rather than on the town as at present. </P>
    <P>Lo and behold, the promises made by Deputy Molloy were carried over by Fianna Fáil at a time when Deputy Molloy was a member of another party, and they formed part of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  The document went on to state:</P>
    <P>In the Dublin region, new district councils will be established within the existing four council areas.  Voluntary </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> bodies and community councils will be given representation on district council sub-committees. </P>
    <P>If we have to adopt a step by step approach and if all the necessary reforms cannot be implemented before June next year, why could a number of the steps in relation to Dublin not have been made during the past three years and why did we not put into place the separate authorities which should have operated in Dublin, the three authorities which would have come out of Dublin County Council, with Dublin Corporation continuing in being?</P>
    <P>Why could simple legislation not have been drafted and put through this House to enable voluntary bodies and community councils be represented on district council sub-committees?  I could draft such legislation, if required, in the space of an evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Deputy not do this when in Government in 1985 and 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I assume the Minister's officials could do the same.  At least we introduced some reforms in 1985 prior to the local government elections which is more than can be said for the current ministerial incumbent.  The document goes on to state that special consideration will be given to Gaeltacht electoral areas.  If half of what was promised had been implemented would there not have been outstanding change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil went on to say in that document that there was a need for a more creative role for local authorities in the promotion of local enterprise.  I am not going to take up the time of the House unduly by reading all of the promises made in 1985 and 1987, none of which have been implemented, but what is contained in those documents mirrors what is being said by Deputy Molloy, the Minister for Energy, who it appears sees himself as the alternative senior Minister for the Environment.  This quite clearly indicates that there is not a scintilla of new thinking by the Government on what <Col N="1566" /> local government reform is necessary.  It is also clear that nothing has been done during the past three years apart from the appointment of a committee of seven experts.  We are grateful to Deputy Molloy for publishing the names of the experts over the weekend, at least a day and a half before the Minister for the Environment got round, through his very efficient public relations officer, to releasing the names.  One wonders whether Deputy Molloy handpicked the seven appointees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Over the weekend the Minister for Energy was able to tell us the names of the happy members of this committee, despite the fact that Deputy Gilmore and I failed to elicit those names by way of parliamentary questions only a few days earlier.  I suppose we should be grateful to the Minister, Deputy Molloy, for forcing the names into the public arena.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are that committee of seven experts being asked to do?  They are being asked to produce &mdash; hey presto, like magic &mdash; by next September a plan for the reform of local government for a Government who have no idea of what type of reform is necessary.  I have already predicted in the House that there is no prospect of the comprehensive reform of local government which is required taking place or no prospect of legislation coming before this House to enable local elections to go ahead in 1991. I have no doubt that something of a cosmetic nature may be produced or perhaps this time next year the Minister will return to the House with another order <Col N="1567" /> seeking to postpone the local elections for another year and to tell us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about the complexity of the proposals being considered and the problems being encountered by the parliamentary draftsman in drafting the legislation, in dealing with the technical aspects of it and in coping with the demands being made by what no doubt will be decribed as a dynamic Government with all sorts of legislative ideas. Perhaps we will be told that there is not sufficient parliamentary time in the Dáil to pass the legislation before the end of June or we may get a brief cosmetic Bill which the Minister will rush through; and, taking his heart in his hands, the Minister might dare give the Bill its initial reading in the Seanad if sufficient Fianna Fáil members of the Seanad can be found to allow it to sucessfully pass through the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Everything that has been produced and published by the Minister's party and what he has failed to do indicates that there is absolutely no prospect of local government reform of any substance being implemented within the timespan he talks of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The language used by the Minister this evening is reminiscent of the language used in the 1985 and 1987 election documents. Indeed I suspect the Minister in preparing his speech may have dipped into those documents for the odd idea. There is absolutely no prospect of any new proposals of substance being implemented, but it is also difficult to take seriously the Minister's protests that he believes local authorities should have greater autonomy and wider functions. Not only has the Minister done nothing about implementing the programme of reform promised in the two election documents I have referred to during the course of his three years in office but he has also by his very actions undermined local democracy.  There are many examples one could give to show this but I will limit myself to five examples, and <Col N="1568" /> no doubt other Members of this House will produce other examples.</P>
    <P>First, shortly after assuming office the Government abolished the regional development organisations at a time when greater regional input into policy development was being insisted upon by the European Commission.  This was contrary and at variance with the promises made in the election manifestoes I have referred to.  The Government engaged in a cosmetic, consultative process prior to seeking Structural Funds from the European Community and deprived local communities throughout the length and breadth of the country of the opportunity to make a meaningful and influential contribution to the plans submitted to Brussels. Curiously, the Government appointed consultants to make recommendations for the operational programme for the Dublin region.  Those consultants who were appointed with the public money have yet to produce a final report on what the European Community operational programme should be.  When they do, there is no guarantee that the report will be published and the only way Members of this House know what is contained in the interim report is that large chunks of it were leaked to the national media.</P>
    <P>The Government failed to implement the recommendations of the Dáil committee on lottery funding that the allocation of moneys for recreational and amenity purposes should be made by local authorities.  Instead the Minister for the Environment has reserved to himself the right to make lottery allocations based on party political preferences.</P>
    <P>There is an issue worth saying a little more about.  The Minister applied that local authorities should have greater autonomy in relation to recreational and amenity grants.  We had a great deal of brouhaha in this House some 18 months ago at the manner in which lottery funds were disbursed by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  Indeed, the Minister for the Environment himself was subjected to substantial political attack from Members of the House.  In the vanguard of that attack who would we find but <Col N="1569" /> Deputy Harney, who is now the Junior Minister in the Department of the Environment, and Deputy O'Malley, now Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Following the bringing forward of a Bill by the Progressive Democrats to change the way lottery funding would be allocated, an all party committee was formed on which Deputy Harney, the current Junior Minister at the Department of the Environment, represented the Progressive Democrats.  That committee said that recreational and amenity grants through lottery funds should be allocated by the local authorities.  It said quite explicitly that the Minister for the Environment should not determine what grants are given to individual organisations or groups in local regional areas and that, when it came to allocating money, a block sum should be provided as appropriate to each of the local authorities who themselves should then determine what projects should obtain funding.</P>
    <P>It is quite instructive to look at what was said in this House about this issue.  If the Minister is truly serious about giving greater autonomy to local authorities it was open to the Government, without legislation, to have allocated block grants through lottery funding to the individual local authorities this year.  The Minister for the Environment this year has £6.5 million to allocate.  In the Official Report of 26 April 1990, columns 2599 to 2603, we are told that the Minister, having invited local authorities to submit possible proposals to him for lottery funding had 3,968 projects submitted to him the total cost of which comes to £163,073,000.  The Minister, therefore, has to sift through 4,000 projects costing in excess of £160 million to determine the allocation of £6.5 million.  The Minister was not able to say what criteria would be applied in allocating the funds.  He could not say whether particular projects in particular counties would do a bit better than others.  Would it depend on which projects his backbenchers recommend to him?  None of us knows the answer to that.  The Minister, however, could have avoided this farcical approach <Col N="1570" /> to lottery money which lays the Minister open, when he finally makes allocations, to allegations of making them on the basis of political preference.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be straying far from the measure before the House.  I have allowed him some latitude in the matter but he must appreciate that it is a separate and very distinct matter from the measure before us which deals with the statutory provision for altering the period for the holding of a local election.  I want the Deputy to stay with the subject before us.</P>

      <P>I will conclude on this issue in a couple of minutes.  The Minister specifically referred to giving additional powers or to giving autonomy to local authorities with regard to amenity and recreational grants.  That got a great deal of support from various Members of this House.  It is worth referring to one or two brief quotations because, if the Government are serious about reforming local government, one would have expected some initial act of good faith, some start to have been made this year on the lottery issue.  In the Official Report of 8 November 1988 at column 2120 Deputy Harney said:</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have engaged in the most despicable exercise in gombeen politics ever seen in this country in the way they have handled the allocations from the national lottery.  The behaviour of this Government is seriously jeopardising the future of the lottery itself. </P>
      <P>The same Deputy said at column 2122:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another weakness in the present legislation establishing the national lottery is that it allows members of the Government of the day total discretion as to how and to whom the lottery proceeds are allocated.  This is very unsatisfactory and has allowed Fianna Fáil to continue to engage in the old style &ldquo;stroke politics&rdquo;, and we see that all over the country Ministers and TDs promising and delivering &ldquo;grants from the national lottery&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil have <Col N="1571" /> politicised and upset many worthwhile community, sporting and voluntary organisations.  The whole merit of the lottery fund is being perverted by this cynical party political exercise as they seek to buy votes.</P>
    <P>The lottery is widely supported by many people throughout this country, including people of all political persuasions and those of none.  It is not appropriate that this money should ever be allocated on a party political basis and it is only by establishing an independent board of trustees that it can be placed above party politics.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the groups who have already benefited from the national lottery's proceeds.  In the main these groups are involved in very worthwhile community activity but they have been forced to exploit the present allocation system in order to get a much needed grant.  It is wrong that voluntary and independent organisations are placed in this position. Everyone's application should be decided on the basis of the merits of the case and not on any other basis. </P>
    <P>How are these decisions to be made this year?  Why could local authorities not have been allowed to make decisions based on the merits of the case?  Deputy Harney later on says&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is to do with the Minister stating that he believed that local authorities should have greater autonomy in the making of grants in the recreational and amenity area.  I am specifically dealing with that and I referred to the fact that in the area of lottery funding the Minister had an opportunity to implement that as the Oireachtas Joint Committee proposed and he has not done so.  I will, in two moments, be finished with that issue.</P>

      <P>It is of relevance in the context of the credibility of the case the Minister makes that he is an enthusiastic supporter of greater autonomy for local authorities and local decision making.  The point I am trying to make is that the Minister's record is the antithesis of such a commitment.  I want to refer to one further quote from Deputy Harney, as she then was, which should be on the record of this House.  I will then be moving on to deal with other matters that are pertinent.  At column 2124 of the Official Report, on 8 November 1988, Deputy Harney said:</P>
      <P>Another weakness with the existing legislation is that there are no clearly laid down criteria for the allocation of the money.  For many of the grants there is not even an application form. </P>
      <P>I suppose this year there has been an advance.  We got an application form.</P>
      <P>The criteria required for being grant-aided need to be clearly and publicly specified and all groups making an application need to know in advance the basis on which their application will be considered. </P>
      <P>She says, and on this I will conclude, because I could bore the House with endless references:</P>
      <P>It would be good to think that the members of the Government could put their constituency considerations aside and make decisions in the national interest.  That, however, does not seem to me to be possible for members of the Government. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Minister tells us he wants meaningful local government.  Why does this Minister for the Environment and his Junior Minister, Deputy Harney, not give the local authorities the autonomy that is needed to ensure the proper allocation <Col N="1573" /> of lottery funds on a meaningful basis?  Why does the Minister continue to centralise this function and retain it as a function to be exercised at his sole discretion on the basis of unknown and unpublished criteria?</P>

      <P>I will be very concise. Deputy Quill may have 15 minutes of my time.</P>
      <P>When I last spoke on this debate I was making the point that under this Bill, if enacted, the Director of Public Prosecutions would have power to appeal sentences. I was querying whether this would, to some extent, dilute the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the performance of his duties as required under the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974.  Section 2 (5) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, requires that &ldquo;The Director shall be independent in the performance of his functions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He may decide, contrary to the perceived public opinion if this extra power were to be granted, not to proceed with an appeal on the grounds as outlined by the prosecutor in the case.  On the basis that this extra power being given to him is not being exercised in that particular case, his independent decision may, in <Col N="1574" /> fact, heighten public controversy.  The point is that in the independent performance of his duties as Director of Public Prosecutions, cases will arise whereby this power, if granted now, might raise an expectation that the power of appeal as envisaged under this Bill will be exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The publicity which such cases attract would, in fact, have the effect of anticipating a certain course of action by the Director of Public Prosecutions which may not on the facts of the case be warranted.  This would have the unintended effect of undermining public confidence.</P>
    <P>It should also be pointed out that the Director of Public Prosecutions does not give reasons for the decisions he takes. The rule about not giving reasons for decisions &mdash; for example, the decision not to prosecute &mdash; has existed since the foundation of the State and has been followed by successive Attorneys General, and by Directors of Public Prosecution since the office was created in 1974.  If there were to be a departure by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the exericse of this power, if granted to him under this Bill, there would have to be compelling reasons for it.  If such a prospect were entertained, it would be necessary to provide that the publication of reasons would be absolutely privileged. There is also the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions is the prosecutor in the cases in question.  His office is both the contestant and the protagonist in the cases concerned so the decision to appeal the leniency of sentence or, as I suggested earlier, his decision not to appeal, would be a decision of his alone without consultation with anybody else who is not as directly involved in the case concerned but who would have to have a certain legal competence in these matters.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that the comparable United Kingdom legislation gives leave to appeal to the Attorney General and not to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The resolution of that problem may well lie in section 2 (6) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, which provides that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> The Attorney General and the Director shall consult together from time to time in relation to matters pertaining to the functions of the Director. </P>
    <P>The provisions of section 2 (6) are sufficiently wide to include consultations between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General regarding the Director of Public Prosecutions' decisions.  I understand that the Director of Public Prosecutions does not see this provision as any diminution of the statutory independence which he is required to exercise under the legislation. The independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions should be distinguished from his accountability.  Independence means that he cannot be told what to do in any particular case.  The consultation envisaged in section 2 (6) of the 1974 Act does not involve any interference with that independence. Such a mechanism, if incorporated in the legislation, might provide the mechanism required for the types of cases envisaged in the Bill proposed by Deputy J. O'Keeffe.  These are cases where the public can be satisified that the decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions are not beyond scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in looking at sentencing policy will be able to examine it in its widest context so that a set of comprehensive reforms in this area could be recommended which might ensure a more efficient and uniform administration of justice in this jurisdiction. I hope that part of this review of sentencing policy will encompass a major reassessment of the system of prosecuting offences.  I believe that some of the concern over consistency, or the lack of it, arises from evidence that the prosecution of cases is handled unevenly in different areas.  I believe that the judges in the main apply similar principles and guidelines in the exercise of their duties and powers in sentencing offenders guilty of serious crime.  I hope the Law Reform Commission will be able to report relatively quickly, and more importantly, <Col N="1576" /> that we will have a Bill published dealing with this area soon thereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The issues raised in this Bill are very central to Progressive Democrat policy.  Indeed, our policy document on crime, compiled well before this Private Members' Bill was circulated, states quite specifically:</P>
      <P>The State in a case should be given the general right of appeal against acquittal and lenient sentences.  Such a right is currently and quite rightly available to the defence.  Its absence on behalf of the State has caused serious and understandable disquiet. </P>
      <P>However, it is our belief that the changes required here are so fundamental and the issues so complex, especially in a country with a written Constitution like ours, that the advice and expertise of the law Reform Commission must be fully sought before proceeding any further with the proposed legislation.  This was our position from the start.  It was always our intention that a matter of this nature ought to be referred to the Law Reform Commission before final debate in this House.</P>
      <P>I fully concede that this Bill is well intentioned.  I wish to pay fulsome tribute to Deputy O'Keeffe and his party for the work they have put into drafting this Bill. I further acknowledge the frustration that results for the sponsors of a Bill like this when action appears to be unduly delayed.  It is for this reason that I have sought assurances from the Minister that no undue delay will take place and that the necessary resources will be put at the disposal of the Law Reform Commission to enable them to carry out this work, and the work required of them, as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know from experience that the process of updating the law has proved too much for successive Governments in the past because even when policy objectives have been agreed, the resources necessary for the highly technical draftsmanship involved have been lacking in all too many cases.  It is therefore, essential to make additional resources available to the Law Reform Commission as <Col N="1577" /> a matter of urgency to enable them to carry out the work that they will be required to do as a result of this Bill having been brought before this House.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission is the body that has the expertise to cast our clearly formulated objectives and aspirations in correct legislative form, but they cannot do the work in the timescale necessary unless they are given adequate resources.  It is the task of the Minister to ensure that, as of now, those resources are made available.</P>
    <P>Our system of criminal justice in all its elements is now the subject of severe on-going public scrutiny, public scrutiny on a level never before experienced in human history.  It is of crucial importance therefore that at all times and in all cases justice is not alone done but is seen to be done.  This is the key to retaining public confidence in the rule of law and in the institutions of State.  Where it is perceived that too lenient a sentence is handed out there is justifiable public outcry followed by intense media coverage and confidence in our system is consequently and inevitably eroded.</P>
    <P>This has happened in a number of notable cases in the recent past, particularly in cases involving rape and sexual assault on women.  This may be due mainly to cultural conditioning where certain echelons of the Judiciary are impervious to the development of modern thinking in relation to women's rights.  In this respect the recipe for rectification may very well lie in the provision of more retraining and refresher type courses for members of the Judiciary.  We live in such rapidly changing times that no public servant, whatever the rank or status, can be immune to the need to keep abreast of developing norms and values.  I am happy to say that even the Church is moving, and has moved significantly, in that direction this very day.</P>
    <P>Disparity in the severity of sentences for similar routine type offences is one that causes on-going concern.  It has happened in the past that, for example, an offence that warranted a year long sentence in one area could be the subject <Col N="1578" /> of a suspended sentence in another and certain district justices would have a good or a bad name, depending on the side of the pitch from which you are viewing the game.  This is an issue that must be tackled without delay.  It is not unknown within the system that certain clever solicitors, on behalf of their clients, can either delay or bring forward a case to coincide with a particular judge being on the bench.  In that way disparity in sentencing policy on behalf of certain people sitting in the bench can be exploited and the law manipulated.  That means that our courts become courts of law and not courts of justice.  People who can afford to employ solicitors who are adept at doing this sort of thing can come out well, others can finish up getting the rough and raw end of what is called justice. That is another issue that has to be looked at in the context of reform or of investigation of sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>This debate has put a new and sharp focus on the whole question of sentences. Unquestionably there is an urgent need for a total overhaul of our sentencing policy.  The clear signals coming out from our prisons these past weeks is that our prison system is on the brink of collapse. Clearly there is an overwhelming need to develop alternatives to prison sentences as a matter of enormous urgency.  A number of alternatives to prison are working well in other countries.  Such alternatives must be explored and exploited here at once.  Community service orders, payment of fines by instalment and electronic tagging are all possible options.</P>
    <P>One lesson to be learned from recent disturbances in prisons is that one of the biggest problems within the system is overcrowding.  We are sending far too many people to prison.  Our prison buildings are not capable of accommodating all of these.  A number of people who are currently in prison could very well serve their sentences in other ways elsewhere.  This is a matter on which we cannot afford to drag our heels.  It is significant, for example, that in 1989, <Col N="1579" /> 1,000 people were in prison for non-payment of fines.  There must be a more cost-effective way to deal with that type of crime.  I just pick this out as one example and to say that it is a matter that has to be considered urgently.  Otherwise we will have very serious problems on our hands.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, Deputy O'Keeffe is to be highly commended for the work he has put into drafting this Bill. The principle of what he advocates is essentially right and very much in accordance with what my own party would advocate.  However, a number of points are of concern to me and have to be looked at, particularly in the context of consideration by the Law Reform Commission. It is essential that a time limit be put on an appeal.  If an appeal is granted it is essential that a time be set beyond which the appeal could not be lodged and that that time be clearly specified in the Bill.  A fault in the Bill as it is drafted is that there is no reference whatsoever to time.</P>
    <P>It is also crucial, if an appeal mechanism is to be effective, that legal aid be made available where appropriate. Otherwise the proposed appeal mechanism would be very limited in its application. Perhaps in cases where an appeal would be most appropriate, that appeal could not be lodged due to the lack of legal aid.  It is crucially important that provision be made for legal aid within the context of the Bill.  We have been very remiss in this House as regards making adequate provision for the Legal Aid Board.  If this Bill is to become a reality we will have to put our money where our mouth is.  We must make adequate provision for legal aid and ensure that the appeal mechanism is not denied to anybody where it is deemed to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General should have the power of referral is one that has plagued my mind for the last number of days.  As a lay person I sought advice from a number of people who are eminent in their own <Col N="1580" /> field and the difference of opinion was quite interesting.  The arguments for and against each person were very strong and cogent and in the end I was much more confused than I was at the start.  That convinced me that this matter must be referred to the Law Reform Commission or some such independent body.  It is of crucial importance that we get that part of the legislation right from the start.  I would not take it upon myself to say whether the person to refer a case ought to be the Director of Public Prosecutions because, in my books, the arguments for and against are equally strong and the scales are equally balanced.  Therefore, the matter must be referred to the Law Reform Commission or other independent body for clarification.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats strongly support the text of this Bill.  We are very much in sympathy with what it proposes. We think the time is right for such legislation and that there must not be any undue delay.  Unquestionably, we cannot afford any further diminution in respect for the rule of law.  The Minister has clearly indicated that it is his intention to refer the matter as quickly as possible and to act on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission as soon as possible after they become available.  I accept his bona fides in that respect.  I have one urgent request, which I make now on the Floor of the House, and which I intend to make through any other forum available to me, that is, that resources be made available to the Law Reform Commission to enable them to give priority to this issue so that action can be taken sooner rather than later.  It is in everybody's interest that that be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven minutes.  I welcome the contribution of Deputy Quill so far as she and her party recognise the <Col N="1581" /> need for this kind of legislation.  All of us know that this area of law is one that gives rise to concern and to a lack of confidence in our whole system, not only of law, but of justice.  In some instances there has been considerable outrage at the sentences handed down.  I deplore sensationalism particularly in regard to cases dealing with sexual abuse and rape but there have been times when the sentences handed down have been so difficult to understand and accept, considering the gravity of the case concerned, that people in the media and others have been led to highlight them.</P>
      <P>Some Members on the opposite side of the House have indicated, or have almost alleged, that that type of concern is more or less media hype.  I do not think so.  It is a correct reflection of the concern felt by people when some outrageous decisions are made and which do not, when all the dimensions are taken into consideration, go in any way to making people understand or accept sentencing policy.  We should not insult the intelligence of our ordinary citizens by suggesting that when sentences which do not appear to go anywhere near fitting the crime are handed down, in some way it is our ignorance of the law, our exclusion from the court and the fact that we did not hear all or every detail which leads us to question the adequacy of the sentences.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Quill will agree with me regarding some of the sensational and titillating detail given particularly in cases dealing with sexual abuse and rape when every line and every detail is highlighted publicly.  Therefore, it is all the more surprising and shocking that when we are acquainted with the details of some cases we can still be outraged at the sentences handed down.  It is an insult to suggest that either the media or ordinary citizens are in any kind of witch hunt when this happens.  They are reflecting what the people feel should emerge from the courts and that is a sense of fair play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the cases reported to rape crisis centres throughout the country only a small minority end up in court.  This can be attributed to the way such cases are <Col N="1582" /> dealt with in court.  It is an aspect that I trust will be dealt with during the course of the rape Bill.  The sentences handed down, not only in cases of rape but in other cases of violence against women may be, as Deputy Quill suggests, a reflection of the status of women in Ireland, of the acceptance of violence against women in our society.  In some recent cases we have been given even more cause to be angry when suspended sentences have been handed down in cases of child sexual abuse.  I am not engaged in a witch hunt.  I do not want to have anyone hanged or flogged but in fairness to society and in fairness to the life and sometimes the damaged life of young people, the seriousness of the crime is not reflected in the sentence. Something which is even more serious for the perpetrator of such crimes is that in receiving suspended sentences they are not being put in the way of the treatment they need and which they would get if sent to prison.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that legislation could lead to double jeopardy on behalf of an accused.  All I can say is that double jeopardy is much more prevalent in the treatment of victims in courts than in the treatment of the accused.  The victim is more at risk of having her case reflected in a derisory and insulting sentence than is the defendant. The Minister said that the vast majority of the decisions made in our courts are just and fair.  That is not good enough. All decisions should be just and fair in so far as is humanly possible.  We should not have had so many cases giving rise to disquiet both on the part of legislators and of the ordinary citizen.  Indeed, it was this disquiet that led to the urgency of legislation of this nature.</P>
    <P>Regret must be recorded here that this actual concern and, at times lack of justice, was so reflected in our society that, four years ago, the Law Reform Commission were asked to look at this area. Like every other Member of this House I pay tribute to the work, dedication and commitment of the staff and members of the Law Reform Commission.  If legislation which is of the utmost concern to <Col N="1583" /> people in regard to justice is not to be delayed we must provide the Law Reform Commission with the resources necessary to bring forward recommendations expeditiously, effectively and efficiently.  If we fail to do that we are merely making scapegoats of the commission for our delay in bringing in legislation that is overdue.</P>
    <P>Since I came into this House I have not yet encountered one single item of legislation that has not been long overdue. Let us fund the Law Reform Commission to enable them to make the recommendations we are asking for in many areas.  A tremendous number of obstacles have been put against the line, tenor and thrust of this legislation.  These are uncalled for and are delaying further the processes that need to be put in motion.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and other Members who spoke on this side of the House said if amendments were needed, if areas or dimensions needed to be looked at, that could be done in the ordinary Stages of the Bill, such as Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret that this Bill is not being accepted by all Members of the House.  One of the most basic rights in any country, civilisation or state, is the right to safety and freedom of movement, protection and a feeling of security not just on one's home but going to or from one's place of work or recreation.  Sad to say, today there are a number of &ldquo;no-go&rdquo; areas for many people &mdash; the elderly, women and, in some cases, everybody. We as legislators must take that into consideration. We should be working overtime to ensure that we bring in legislation that will allow people not just to believe they are protected under the law but that they are protected in reality.  Nothing is more eroding of the law and people's feeling of protection within it than inconsistent or lenient sentences that lead to public outrage &mdash; and we have had many of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has brought up issues like the concept of double jeopardy which he said should be at least looked at.  Of course it does not need to be looked at, <Col N="1584" /> relating as it does to acquittal when there is no risk or danger in bringing in this legislation.  He said that judges may be expected to take into account a wide variety of factors before deciding on a sentence, including the nature and circumstances of the offences, public good and so on, and that the proposals in the Bill would add a new dimension which must at least be looked at.</P>
    <P>It would be insulting in the extreme for us to suggest that in bringing in legislation to strengthen, to support and to bring consistency and guidelines into judges' sentencing, we would seek to lumber them in some way or to add to their work load.  This legislation is designed to be of tremendous help not just to the due process of law but to the judges processing it.  Not just from the point of view of the ordinary citizen but from their own point of view the Judiciary must be seen not to be undermined by the behaviour or attitudes of some of their members.</P>
    <P>As far back as December 1984 NESC issued a very fine report and their recommendations are as relevant and urgent today as they were when first published. The report entitled, <i>The Criminal Justice System</i>&mdash;<i>Policy and Performance</i>, starts off by saying that consistent and fair treatment of cases can be subsumed under the concept of due process of law which includes three criteria of fairness: (1) openness in decision-making, (2) a right to be heard in one's own defence and (3) impartiality by those who make decisions.  Those three points are fundamental to this legislation.</P>
    <P>In regard to openness in decision making, we must be open.  We must not feel anything is a closed shop or that we are impinging on the rights of judges or anybody else if we insist that there be a right of appeal where a sentence would seem to warrant an appeal.  Regarding a right to be heard in one's own defence, a person's right of appeal should be ensured.  In the legal system there should be a right of appeal such as the legislation is providing regarding inconsistent or too lenient sentencing.  In regard to impartiality by those who make the decision, nobody is suggesting that the judge may <Col N="1585" /> be subjective or partial.  Judges are always at great pains to make sure that they are not seen to be partial.</P>
    <P>The NESC report looks at how our system works, and a large part of it is given to sentencing.  It says that very little is known about sentencing policies practised by the Judiciary and that the degree to which sentencing policy may vary by judge, and even by offence, can discredit the courts.  It goes on to refer to sentencing policies in other countries, such as the US and to a lesser extent the UK, which have led to the introduction of consistency of sentencing.  For instance, in the US judges who impose sentences outside the guidelines laid down and accepted by the peer group of judges are asked to indicate their reasons for departing from this precedent.  We have not moved to that stage yet, and I know that in certain States of the US judges come together out of concern for an extraordinary sentence, either too lenient or too harsh, and as a peer group can demand and get an appeal.</P>
    <P>In this legislation Deputy O'Keeffe is attempting to bring in the same kind of mechanism, defence, fall back.  We are dealing with human beings and human behaviour which can never be perfect, and we have to make sure we have some kind of appeal so that when it seems the system is not working perfectly, we know there is a chance of it being reviewed and justice being seen to be done.</P>
    <P>Very little is known about sentencing policies in this country and usually only extraordinary sentences attract the headlines and public awareness.  We do not know enough about sentencing policy. We need data reviewed and reviewable and publicly accountable regarding policies and records of sentencing, and that is one reason we are in this limbo today.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for his help.  The Bill seeks to improve the due process of law and to guide our judges in regard to sentencing. In fairness to the judges, it is imperative that we introduce sentencing guidelines they can follow.  They should understand that their sentences can be subject to review on appeal.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of information on how our courts operate and that is extraordinary. In such circumstances we cannot say that we have an open legal system. The need for openness was stressed in the NESC report and we should follow that up.</P>
      <P>People like the Director of Public Prosecutions have called for a training scheme for our judges.  In a complex matter like dealing with criminals, particularly in view of the increase in crime, it is important that our judges be properly trained. That is important if the law is to operate properly.  In France, for example, people soon after they qualify undergo training in all aspects of the law with a view to taking on the position of judge.  I accept that our laws are not the answer to all our problems and that there is a need to build up support services so that our courts will not have to deal with so many cases.  I am sure the Minister will agree that we could have a lengthy debate on the importance of back-up services for our courts.  We cannot allow the courts or the law to be undermined to the extent that people will not have any confidence in them.  People should not be afraid to go to court on the basis that they will not get a fair trial.  They should be made aware that if a case goes against them they have a right to appeal to a higher court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal practitioners are aware that some judges have their own peculiarities. Some have described the system as Russian roulette and say that the sentence for a crime depends on the judge one appears before.  That is not acceptable, least of all to the judges.  The Bill is <Col N="1587" /> overdue and I am sure that it will be welcomed by the judges.  Those who are afraid to take a case to the courts should have confidence in our courts and the appeals system.  They should feel confident that the State will support them and that, where necessary, sentences will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>Their ethos is that there is no evil in the world, that everybody is on the same wavelength and should be allowed do what they like.  It is their view that wrongdoers are basically misunderstood and that society should analyse them and their actions rather than punish them for their crimes.  The catalogue of crime here is frightening and murder occurs frequently.  Just three weeks ago a 73 year-old man in my town was beaten to death by a group of youths. That was a dastardly crime and three of the gardaí who found that man's body got sick at the sight of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hour after a victim is buried the crime is forgotten.  Rape and sex crimes are steadily increasing due to a lack of deterrents.  Rape is rampant and only a small proportion of rape offences are <Col N="1588" /> reported.  Last week we read the horrifying story of a 78 year-old woman being raped in north County Dublin.  To borrow a phrase from the colourful repertoire of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to describe what I would do with the guilty person, I would hang the beast by the &ldquo;balubas&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Chair used that phrase on a previous occasion. Larceny is taking place on a grand scale and tourists are robbed on a regular basis. The bottom line was reached recently when the Welsh soccer team lost their money and valuables when they were playing an international match in the fashionable Ballsbridge area.  Discipline has been abandoned with a large percentage of teachers retiring early due to stress and tension.  They are worn out trying to cope with youths reared on a diet of TV and videos depicting savage and violent crime and sex offences.  Our people are crying out for law and order. In our country armed robbery is now common place.</P>
      <P>Recently we learned that politicians are proposing to remove the death penalty. They have asked the Garda to protect lives and property and they want that penalty for the murder of members of the force removed.  The recent plea by the GRA in Tralee to retain the death penalty has as much chance of being heard by politicians as I have of being elected Governor of Alabama.</P>
      <P>Side by side with this situation we have the spectacle of unbelievable sentences being handed down by the courts.  The ordinary man in the street cannot understand why the perpetrators of sexual assault, rape and interfering with 11 year old children do not get a long jail sentence. He cannot understand why the murderers of Timothy Kidman &mdash; cruelly murdered for a few rabbits &mdash; can result in a &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; verdict on a manslaughter charge in respect of the two people concerned.  I also fail to understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> The man in the street cannot understand how drunken drivers can roam the roads producing the highest percentage of deaths and injuries in Europe without any realistic punishment being imposed. Hit and run cases regularly fill the columns of the evening newspapers.  The Fine Gael proposal to allow the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; a most mysterious office &mdash; to appeal verdicts to the Court of Criminal Appeal is the most practical one I have heard since I came into this House eight years ago.</P>
    <P>The necessity of introducing a mandatory sentence for all serious crimes should be recognised and immediately implemented by the Government.  If crime is to be defeated radical and realistic measures must be promoted but unless radical change is effected that will not happen.  Ireland, in the early years of the next century, will be a criminals' paradise because of appeasement policies in relation to terrorists who commit foul crimes against humanity in the name of mother Ireland, by do-gooders and fools in Government and in the Dáil.  The courts will reap the whirlwind of this foolish policy of appeasement.</P>
    <P>The recent statement by Mr. Jim Ferry of the Garda Representative Body that the Garda are hampered and handcuffed by the law is a barometer of the concern which gardaí feel about the state of law and order.  A recent survey conducted by Voteline in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on whether people supported the death penalty resulted in 800 people in one night telephoning the newspaper; 83 per cent supported the retention of the death penalty. Why is that cry from the heart of the nation ignored by politicians who assume they know better on this issue than the ordinary people?</P>
    <P>Until the Dáil lays down clear guidelines to the Judiciary we will continue to have crazy sentences which do not fit the crime.  Until politicians face up to their duty to protect society the weak and the vulnerable will suffer, criminals will continue to rule the roost and we will have further spectacles of criminals who have transgressed against society climbing on to the roof of Mountjoy Jail and giving <Col N="1590" /> the two fingered salute to the rest of the country by demanding their &ldquo;rights&rdquo;.  The rights of people to be protected from crime and criminals is the question which all politicians must answer.  The Government, in accepting this much needed proposal, can start this necessary process.</P>
    <P>The proposal to allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal is a most practical, long awaited and realistic method of dealing with the inadequate sentencing of courts.  I will not knock the legal profession &mdash; I wish I was a member of it &mdash; but the ordinary person fails to understand the ridiculous sentences handed down by the courts.  I cannot understand how people are more concerned with technicalities and points of law than with apportioning sentencing as a result of a guilty verdict by ordinary people even if they do not have any knowledge of the law.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years there have been inexplicable decisions on cases in our courts.  I will not go through them but I should like to draw attention to the rising graph of crime.  The Government &mdash; irrespective of who is in power &mdash; must face reality and realise that most criminals in our jails are recidivists, people who have been in twice, three times or &mdash; in some cases &mdash; maybe six times. These people are engaged in a war against the rest of society.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Deputy McGahon did not use the violence perpetrated on him by the bookies on various occasions.  Indeed, even in that regard, there have been some extraordinary decisions in regard to bets <Col N="1591" /> made which were not honoured on many occasions by bookies.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of people have never been in a courthouse in their lives.  I have only been in court twice, once when my car was stolen and I felt more like the criminal than the person who had offended against me who was smiling although he had stolen and wrecked my car.  The other occasion I appeared in court was as a character witness for someone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not the greatest lover of the legal profession although I am not being personal about anybody in the House who is legally qualified, such as Deputy Andrews.  However, there is a common perception among the public that all this is a game played by the prosecution and defence.  It is a dangerous perception because people in many walks of life are losing confidence in our system of justice.  I have had experience of children of an offending father in a sexual case coming to me telling me that they want him locked away for far longer than the sentence of three years imposed for having abused four or five of his children. It is an experience which will affect them for a far longer period than he will serve. How can we expect people in that situation to have confidence in the system?  As Deputy Barnes said, the system of justice has stopped many people from making a complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a recent case when a young child was sexually abused in a village but the family did not proceed with the case because the child would have to give evidence. She was only five years of age and the family did not want to subject her to this in case she would be further scarred. They felt that perhaps she was too young to remember the offence.  There have been cases in which daughters have had the courage to go to court in the first place to give evidence against their natural father and who have been shocked and horrified to see him getting a sentence of <Col N="1592" /> three years.  That father committed one of the most heinous crimes of a sexual nature, he had responsibility for those children who trusted him.  It is ridiculous to give a sentence of three years to someone who has abused his daughter regularly over the years.</P>
    <P>It frightens me to hear some of the older members of that family, such as uncles, talk about that case in the vein: &ldquo;wait until he comes out; we will deal with him then&rdquo;.  That type of attitude frightens me because they perceive the Judiciary as not having done their job.  In my opinion, in no circumstances could a judge justify that decision.  In another court case in this city some years ago a young girl from my constituency was found guilty of the manslaughter of her husband.  She was 19 years of age, had got married, had a baby, only to find that her husband was homosexual and left her.  He then returned in an endeavour to have the child brought to his home, with his new boyfriend, to be reared by them.  Just imagine the shock to that young country girl, who had come from a mountainous region, who had never encountered that type of behaviour before.  The basic and overriding concern of all mothers would be for the protection of their child or children.  The excuse advanced for the severity of sentence in her case was that previously the jury had produced an unsatisfactory verdict for the judge in another case in Dundrum &mdash; about a shooting from a motorbike or something else &mdash; when the judge was not happy with their decision, leading to him making an example of this young girl and her husband.  That clearly demonstrated a total lack of consistency of sentencing as far as the system is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not looking forward to a recurrence of the Paris Revolution here with the public crying out &ldquo;hang him&rdquo;, when the judge must act immediately and have the criminal hanged.  I am concerned at the inconsistency of sentencing in all of our courts from the very bottom to the top, the public perception of which is confused and understandable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> I have been in court once only when my car was stolen.  In that case the offender, a young lad, did not turn up in court, got a three months suspended sentence and was fined £25 expenses, whereas I had to pay £2,000 for the repair of my car.  I was asked by the judge had I locked my car; I could not swear that I had locked it, but was treated to a lecture from him to the effect that I should have ensured that my car was locked.  Nonetheless it was my car, whether locked or not.  I felt more like a criminal in that court than the offender who had not even seen fit to turn up.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on his introduction of this Bill, thereby highlighting the inconsistencies obtaining in our system.  Nonetheless much more thought must be given to the whole matter and much more money made available for the implementation of appropriate legislation.  For example, with regard to free legal aid the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will have to be allocated more staff.  Indeed a time limit must be set for this objective so that if any defendant is not happy on the day of sentencing they can have the matter rectified within 28 days rather than have to await public perception and endure a whole series of articles being written by interest groups to ensure that justice is clearly seen to be done.</P>
    <P>We must all thank Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for highlighting this issue.  The other people who are becoming very disillusioned with the present system are the members of the Garda Síochána.  They apprehend people, bring them into court and discover that, perhaps for some small technical reason, or the mood of the judge on the day, there is a derisory sentence or punishment meted out or the case is dismissed altogether.  It is my belief that that is leading to much malaise on the part of the Garda Síochána, particularly when they see a hardened criminal walk out of court, put his tongue out at them, thumb his nose at them or whatever when one's reaction is to give summary justice on the spot.  However that is not to be recommended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> I am particularly concerned at the heinous crimes perpetrated recently such as the sexual abuse of women, young children, old people and the more and more numerous attacks on old people who are being brutalised and, in some cases, sexually abused.  The fact that many of the perpetrators of such crimes are freed within a short period horrifies me.  I read recently of a number of cases in Britain where the perpetrators of sexual crimes, on release, committed the same crime within a short period; one recently after serving 21 years for savage attacks on people who committed three similar savage offences within three days of being released.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Law Reform Commission will deal with this matter of inconsistency of sentencing as a priority, above all other matters, bringing their knowledge and wisdom to bear on the subject.  We must ensure at all times that the public do not lose confidence in the courts, because I believe that is happening.</P>
    <P>Again I compliment Deputy O'Keeffe on the introduction of this Bill but hope that a proper Bill will be brought forward to cover all aspects of this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank my long-standing parliamentary friend for having allowed me part of his time to speak on this Bill.  While not a paragon of perfection myself in parliamentary or other terms, I was fascinated to hear Deputy McGahon, a <Col N="1595" /> Deputy for whom I have great regard, range beyond the provisions of the Bill before us for almost the entirety of his contribution.  Like Deputy McGahon I have been guilty of that in the past and no doubt will be in the future, so my remarks are not meant as a criticism of him.  In any parliamentary democracy there is place for all types of views.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy McGahon with great attention.  I would be concerned about his &ldquo;hang 'em and flog 'em&rdquo; attitude. I am not certain that that is the type of attitude appropriate to the administration of justice on the one hand or the administration of the law on the other. That is not in any way to suggest that Deputy McGahon was not entitled to make the type of remarks he made; of course he is.  I want to place on record that I would not necessarily agree with the thrust of all his sentiments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the death penalty I see very little reason for maintaining on the Statute Book a law that is not implemented.  The death penalty has not been carried out here for many years. For many reasons, I believe the death penalty should be removed from the Statute Book.  The death penalty itself is a crime committed by the institutions of State against a criminal and obviously is based on the old biblical expression of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Equally, I am not certain that that is a good principle to apply in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Garda's attitude to it as, to be fair to them, they have, since the foundation of the State, served this nation very well.  I have been and always will be supportive of them and recognise that effectively they are in the front line in protecting society, as witnessed by the manner in which they dealt with an attempted bank robbery in County Wexford in the recent past.  I applaud them for the manner in which they dealt with that bunch of gangsters who may have been attempting to commit a crime in the pursuit of some perverse philosophy which they would describe as republican.  I would not go <Col N="1596" /> along with the scribes who in their reportage on the capture of these criminals almost made it look like a crime on the part of the Garda.  Who fired the first shot appears to be the kernel of the stories on that piece of heroism on the part of the Garda, and I reject this.  The Garda are entitled to go in and deal with the issue as they see it based on their own judgment and expertise and should be applauded for what they did on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I was critical of Deputy McGahon for going outside the range of the Bill, and I am falling into the very same trap.  The Bill before us seeks to amend the law relating to criminal procedures so as to provide for the review of sentences.  What this means in plain English is that lenient sentences ought to be reviewed.  In the recent past in connection with some other issues about which I am concerned I came across the Official Report of the debate in the British House of Commons of Tuesday, 26 February 1988 which includes a heading &ldquo;Standing Committee H of the Criminal Justice Bill (Lords)&rdquo;. It was published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office in London at the price of £3.70.  I commend Deputy O'Keeffe and any other Deputy in Opposition in this House &mdash; this should also apply to some of us on the Government back benches &mdash; who go to the trouble of bringing Bills of this nature before the House.  I sometimes fault Governments for not accepting Bills of this nature, well intentioned as they are.  It is an unfortunate fault of the democratic process that it does not work both ways, in that what is put up by the Opposition is knocked down by the Government and <i>vice versa.</i> Perhaps if our democracy was based on consensus we would achieve far more in this House.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt Deputy O'Keeffe will respond to me and respond critically if I am wrong but from my perusal of the parliamentary debates in the British House of Commons it appears that this Bill is lifted from the Criminal Justice Act in England.  I do not use the word &ldquo;lifted&rdquo; in any derisory way but it appears that it is partially, if not entirely, copied <Col N="1597" /> from that legislation.  Again, that is not a bad thing in itself but I would suggest to Deputy O'Keeffe, well intentioned as he was in bringing forward this legislation, that what is good for English law &mdash; and I do not refer to the law in the United Kingdom as there are two different streams of law, English law and Scottish law &mdash; is not necessarily good for Irish law.</P>
    <P>That leads me on to the central question on the Bill itself, that is the question of leniency in sentencing.  I would suggest to Deputy O'Keeffe and to those who support him that what is at issue is not so much leniency as consistency and an evenhanded application of sentences. That is one of the problems which concerns the people at this time.  Deputy Davern and others have adverted to the fact that the Law Reform Commission are presently engaged in a review of sentencing. I understand from a number of speeches made during this debate that this exercise was commended to the Law Reform Commission by a Government which Deputy O'Keeffe supported. Again, that is a very hopeful development. The Law Reform Commission have repeatedly produced excellent reports but the problem is that these reports continue to gather dust in whatever Department or Departments have the responsibility to implement them.  I note that the Minister, towards the end of his speech, in response to Deputy O'Keeffe, indicated that when the Law Reform Commission complete their review he will act expeditiously on the report.  As I said, the public are concerned about the evenhanded application of sentences and consistency in sentencing.</P>
    <P>I should point out that I am faced with a conflict of interests and would like to declare it.  I have been a practising barrister for almost 30 years.  I am a civil lawyer and do not work in the criminal courts.  As I say, I have an interest in the law and would like to put this on the record in advance of any support I might give to remarks made either inside or outside the House about the Bar or the <Col N="1598" /> legal profession generally.  I will deal with that matter shortly.</P>
    <P>In how many cases have over-lenient sentences been handed down during the past 12 months to two years?  I think the House will find that such cases are few and far between and not of great significance. The Minister, as did Deputy McGahon, referred to that tragic case where the jury acquitted one of the individuals of murder but, again, this decision was reached by a jury of ordinary lay people, gnáth-dhaoine, yet it gave rise to dissatisfaction.  That is the kind of lenient application of sentences that gets the headlines and brings sentencing into disrepute in the public mind.  In this instance the conclusion was not deliberated upon by a judge but rather by a group of 12 lay people who are part of the jury system.  The court cannot be faulted for that decision.  It did, however, give rise to a considerable amount of public concern and it is that type of publicity which affects the public mind in the context of the harshness or leniency of sentencing.  The logic seems to be to introduce a Bill that in some way allows an appeal against the leniency of a sentence if, in the final analysis, the court system can find it in its heart to do this, but the Martin committee might deal with that.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the principle of double jeopardy.  While I agree that the question itself relates to acquittal questions generally, nevertheless a person could face an appeal against the sentence.  I am not certain it is a good thing that a person might have to face the possibility of his sentence being appealed against.  It would appear to me to be a bad principle in law that a prosecution, dissatisfied with the sentence, could seek to have it further increased.</P>
    <P>Well intentioned as Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill is, we should be careful about interfering with the due process of law.  We have an independent Judiciary and Article 35 of the Constitution says that it is to be independent in the exercise of its judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  In that regard there has been much criticism of recent <Col N="1599" /> decisions of the Supreme Court but that debate is for another day.  I have already said well in advance of anything that might have been said about it, that I believe that the 1987 Extradition Act should be given a chance before we engage in seeking loopholes in it.</P>
    <P>Those people who are critical of the Supreme Court in the exercise of its functions should be careful about that point and also about the suggestion made in the recent past that in some way Ireland, and the South in particular, has become a haven for terrorists.  These are issues which I will deal with on another occasion but we should be careful on the one hand about what we say about the Supreme Court which has an independent function and, on the other hand, about screaming that Ireland is becoming a haven for terrorists. It is nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which my constituency colleague mentioned, that is, the training of judges.  There is no need to train judges here.  We are a nation of only 3.5 million people and whilst there is a rising crime rate, nevertheless crime remains the same.  There is a great training ground for the legal profession both in the arena of which Deputy O'Keeffe has long been a respected practitioner and in that in which I practise, the Bar.  It is undoubtedly a privilege for me to be a member of the Bar.  My own view is that they have come in for unnecessary and harsh criticism in the recent past.  In that regard, anyone who wishes to dismantle the Bar can do so without my co-operation.</P>
    <P>I will certainly be keeping a close eye on the Restricted Trade Practices Report which is upcoming and will be published in the not too distant future, but its contents appear to be leaking gradually to the public and may be to the disadvantage of the Bar.  As a practising barrister with a dual role I would be loath to interfere with an institution which has served this State well.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking Deputy O'Keeffe for giving me the opportunity to speak on this no doubt important proposal. <Col N="1600" /> I want to assure him that, while I do not condemn it, I do not feel I can support it in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the unique things about this major legislation has been the degree of unanimity in relation to its basic thrust.  If one sifts through the sentiments from the other side of the House one will see that there is a basic agreement with the points being put by Deputy O'Keeffe and other Members in its support.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davern, by quoting case histories, implied that this measure was long overdue.  Deputy O'Keeffe was quite specific.  He was not talking about giving the Director of Public Prosecutions the right to appeal every case.  It is not the intention that the Director of Public Prosecutions would have the right to refer trivial cases to another judge.  Deputy O'Keeffe was talking about grave matters where there seemed to be serious errors of judgment.  It was refreshing to hear Deputy Davern agree with him and cite the understandable despondency of gardaí who, having gone through the process of arraigning and charging people are then subjected to the devastating psychological blow of having something thrown out of court for what do not seem like good grounds.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister would listen to Deputies like Deputies Davern and Andrews.  Deputy Andrews said quite clearly that referring the matter to the Law Reform Commission is not an appropriate way to deal with this problem. They are a worthy body of men and women, learned and experienced and have produced long and voluminous reports which unfortunately, clutter the shelves of the Law Library, gather dust and are not acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been misjudgments and there will continue to be, but thankfully not many.  One misjudgment, however, is sufficient to make us insist that this measure suggested by Deputy O'Keeffe be looked at.  We are fortunate in that we have an excellent Judiciary.  They are independent and impartial and constitutionally guaranteed as such.  To err <Col N="1601" /> is human, however.  To set people up in God-like fashion with what amounts to infallibility as to their decisions does scant justice to the recognition that people err and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the courts is to dispense justice.  There have been wrong decisions and we are daily treated to examples of how the law works effectively.  We are also occasionally treated to elaborate illustrations of how the law does not work as it was intended.  One can imagine the physical and psychological scars this can leave on a victim.  One can imagine how a person feels who has been subjected to physical and psychological violence, who has been doubly sinned against, when the offender walks free from the court because of the manner in which the case had been presented, or because of the failure of counsel to make some salient point of law in court, or because of what could be termed a misjudgment on the part of the judge.  All that Deputy O'Keeffe is asking is that in cases of grave matter, the Director of Public Prosecutions, having evaluated the facts of the case, would have the right to refer the matter to a colleague of the judge in question.  Having listened to some of the remarks of Members on the other side of the House I am convinced that some people are more concerned with the veneer and ego of the Judiciary than with the victim's right to natural justice.</P>

However, I was making the point that not only has the Minister in the three years or more he has been in office done nothing to implement the promised programme of local government reform which his party put to the electorate in both 1985 and 1987 but, by his actions, he has undermined local democracy &mdash; I referred to the abolition of the regional development organisations and the cosmetic consultative process that went on with regard to EC Structural Fund programmes and the Government's failure to implement the recommendations of the Dáil committee on lottery funding &mdash; that amenity and recreational grants be allocated by local authorities and not by the Minister for the Environment.</P>

    <P>There are two other areas that clearly illustrate that the Minister is not merely uninterested in reforming local government but is to some extent contemptuous of local government.  Progress is being made in the provision of the Dublin ring-road, but it will take some years before that road will be complete on both the southern and northern cross routes.  An extraordinary thing happened last year, the Minister sought tenders for the tolling of portions of the ring road.  That may not appear to be of particular relevance to this debate, but it is relevant because that is a reserved function of local authorities, to determine the imposition of tolls on roads.  In this instance, the local authority is Dublin County Council. Under the relevant legislation which was enacted by the Oireachtas in 1979, a toll cannot be imposed except by the local authority.  If these roads were to be tolled, the correct legal approach should have been that Dublin County Council would consider whether a toll would be implemented.  If the council opposed tolling, that would be the end of the matter. If the council favoured tolling, at that stage it should have been Dublin County <Col N="1603" /> Council who should have put it out to tender and Dublin County Council should have been the body entering into draft agreements with a view to providing a toll system.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that in no circumstances should we ever toll roads.  I think it is appropriate in some circumstances where we require private funding, but is inappropriate in others. Certainly until very recently this was not a proposal to apply to the Dublin ring road.  However, instead of allowing a local authority to exercise one of their few independent statutory functions and make a decision in principle as to what should happen with the major ring route around Dublin city and county, the Minister has arrogated to himself the function of imposing a toll on the Dublin ring road.  Behind the backs of the elected members of Dublin County Council, the Minister has decided that a toll will be applicable to the road and in effect has surreptitiously introduced what can best be described as a toll tax.  That is not consistent with the ministerial statements of commitment to local democracy.  In the context of lottery funding, the Minister on foot of a recommendation made by this House and without the enactment of legislation, could have conferred on a local authority power to allocate moneys.  In the context of tolling the Dublin ring route, the Minister is ignoring existing legislation which states that such matters are the reserved function of the local authority and in a sense he is arrogating the function to himself and more extraordinarily instructing the officials of the local authority to construct toll booths on sections of the road that have not yet been completed without the matter having been considered by the elected members of Dublin County Council.  That is not consistent with the Minister's commitment to local democracy.</P>
    <P>My final example &mdash; there are many others but I am sure other Members of this House will give such examples &mdash; is the whole area of local authority housing. In his speech, the Minister pats himself <Col N="1604" /> on the back for the way in which he has dealt with the funding of local authorities. Implicit in everything he said is that something good is happening in funding local authorities.  The reality, as everyone knows, is that local authorities have been substantially starved of funds but, most dramatically, they have been prevented from carrying out their housing functions due to the failure of the Government to allocate sufficient funds for the building of local authority houses.  As a result, by the end of this year there will be 25,000 people on the local authority housing waiting list countrywide.  There will be fewer than 100 houses built throughout the country by the local authorities.  At present there are in excess of 5,000 people on local authority housing lists in Dublin and only 60 new council houses will be built in the Dublin city and county area in 1990.  The elected representatives of every local authority have been demanding additional funding &mdash; indeed members of his own party, for example in Clare County Council, have passed resolutions to this effect &mdash; and this has been ignored by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Panic stricken Fianna Fáil councillors all around the country who are unable to fulfil the promises made are pleading, even by public resolution, with the Minister to provide them with the funds and have prevailed on the Minister to postpone the local elections.  The lack of adequate funding for housing is one of the reasons, which the Minister did not refer to in his speech, the elections are being postponed.  These issues are very relevant to the reason that this order is before this House as opposed to the presentation the Minister made which suggests that there is some incredible new urgency and commitment on the part of the Government, which has ignored local government reform for three years, to introduce such reform.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a proposal that there should be a committee of this House to look at the whole area of local government reform.  He said that some Members of this House were not agreeable to the formation of such a committee. Again, the Minister was only giving part of the story.  He was being somewhat brief in explaining the reality of the situation.  What the Minister did not tell this House &mdash; and I presume he was referring to the Fine Gael Party &mdash; is that the Fine Gael Party were quite happy to participate in a Dáil committee to look at local government reform on condition that an additional committee would be established to deal with the area of national and local taxes, so that the means of funding local authorities in the future in a coherent way could be comprehensively examined, so that independent funding arrangements could be considered that would not result in an overall increase in the tax take but which would obviously result in a lesser amount of tax being taken by way of national taxation and some moneys being identified to be diverted to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister and his party apparently wanted to put together a committee that would consider local government structures and financing, they wanted local government financing to be considered in isolation and not in the context of an overall package.  Of course, the <Col N="1606" /> reason for that was the promise made by Fianna Fáil in 1985 to abolish local charges, a promise they did not keep. What the Minister wanted was to establish a committee not to seriously consider the proper funding of local authorities or their structures but to shield Fianna Fáil from public anger for promoting the additional taxes they were intent on promoting until the poll tax debacle across the water made them realise they would not get away with it.  What the Minister wanted was a political insurance policy, a committee that would talk of the need for local authorities to have independent funding, and then blame the Opposition parties for any additional taxation measures that were implemented while taking no responsibility for ensuring a consequent reduction in national taxation.</P>
    <P>You cannot properly reform local government without ensuring local government has proper independent funding and discretion in the raising of funding.  You cannot provide for additional local taxes without giving a guarantee that there would be a consequent reduction in the national tax take because people are overtaxed already.  The Government were not willing to approach this matter in a comprehensive way.  They wanted the committee to be a convenient political vehicle to take them off a political hook on which they impaled themselves and on which Deputy Molloy, the current Minister for Energy, impaled himself in the local government policy document produced in 1985.  It is very difficult to take seriously this Minister shedding crocodile tears about the nonformation of this committee.  The Minister knows he was caught out and that is why the committee was not formed.  The bona fides of the Government in establishing such a committee would have been a great deal strengthened if, in other areas, they had not illustrated a total lack of willingness to formulate Dáil and Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>Only a few short weeks ago the Government voted in unison against the formation of a foreign affairs committee. Only a few short weeks ago when the <Col N="1607" /> Government voted against the Environment Protection Agency Bill they also voted against the establishment of a Oireachtas Joint Committee on the environment. The Government will not even agree, despite the major problems in this area, to an Oireachtas committee to consider the reform of extradition laws.  They have not yet established the committee on crime, lawlessness and vandalism despite the Taoiseach promising it.  I do not believe any Member of this House or the general public should take seriously the Minister being critical of Opposition parties for not participating in a committee which was designed to provide him with a political umbrella to protect him from the lash of the electorate in local government elections for the non-fulfilment of 1985 promises.  If all those committees, or even some of them, had been established, perhaps members of the Opposition would have regarded the Minister's proposal with a good deal more credibility than is the case.</P>
    <P>I regret that the local elections will be postponed.  The political representation on local authorities throughout the country no longer reflects the views of the local communities they represent.  Many people are appalled at the failure of Fianna Fáil controlled local authorities to implement the many false promises made in the 1985 local elections.  In Dublin there is considerable public opposition to the many scandalous planning decisions railroaded through Dublin County Council by a Fianna Fáil majority, undermining the County Dublin development plan.  Indeed, in Dublin County Council we still have the curious anomaly of having a junior Minister of a Government who wants to reform local authorities &mdash; I speak of Deputy Harney, Minister of State at the Department of the Environment &mdash; who will not resign as a member of Dublin County Council and does not attend meetings of the council. That is making a mockery of the operation of Dublin County Council.  This is from a mould-breaking party that do not believe Ministers should be members of <Col N="1608" /> Government and local authorities simultaneously. This particular mould breaker in the Department of the Environment seems to find it politically impossible to extricate herself from membership of Dublin County Council.  Of course, here non-presence in the council facilitates the Fianna Fáil majority group in putting through material contraventions which undermine the County Dublin development plan, the vast majority of which has absolutely no real planning merit.  That is a strange piece of mould breaking.</P>
    <P>The general electorate are entitled to have local government elections this year.  I have given a number of reasons local authorities no longer reflect the political views of the people they represent. I have given a series of reasons I believe if we had local elections this year there would be a substantial reduction in the Fianna Fáil membership on local authorities and, of course, that is the Minister's fear.  I have absolutely no doubt that following the local elections Fine Gael would form the majority group in a large number of local authorities currently controlled by Fianna Fáil or in which Fianna Fáil are currently the majority grouping.</P>
    <P>Another reason &mdash; and the Minister is aware of it &mdash; his colleagues on local authorities would not do well in local elections is the increasing public anger at the substantial increase in mortgage interest rates, the Government's failure to confront the issue and fully restore the mortgage interest relief.  I will say no more about that because the Ceann Comhairle rightly wants to confine this debate, but that is a very substantial issue at the doors.  People are asking why their mortgages have increased to such an extent in the last 12 months and why the mortgage interest relief has not been fully restored.  The Minister in the House this evening, who gave the reason for reducing interest relief as the decrease in interest rates in 1988, will not now restore it to its previous rate.  Of course there is another issue about which people are confused.  They look incredulously at the public bickering between the Government parties about extradition, the <Col N="1609" /> abdication of political responsibility and the failure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The electorate are entitled to an opportunity, through the ballot box in local elections, to express their views on these issues.  Fine Gael believe the local elections should be held this year to coincide with the presidential election and we have tabled a Bill to this effect.  From the informal soundings I have had, I know that Bill has the support of Members of the various Opposition parties.  I would now ask the Minister to reconsider this matter on his own admission this evening that the many reforms required in local government cannot be put in place before June 1991.  I suspect, as I said previously, that the Minister will postpone the elections until June 1992 and I would ask him to change his mind. He has shown on other legislation &mdash; such as the Planning Bill &mdash; that he is willing to be flexible when something is seriously wrong.  The Minister got it wrong.  The local and Presidential elections should be held simultaneously next autumn, and they can if, instead of passing this motion this evening, the Government would lend their support to the Private Members' Bill published by Fine Gael ten days ago. That would be a real exercise in local democracy.  At a time when we are encouraging democracy in Eastern Europe we would be allowing people to exercise their democratic right to ballot if the Presidential and local elections coincided.  This would also ensure that there would not be an unnecessary waste of public money by holding two elections within an eight month period.  The Government's denial of support for the Fine Gael Bill and their bringing before this House the order we are debating this <Col N="1610" /> evening is a further illustration of their contempt for local democracy.</P>

      <P>I am mindful of your last comment that we are in a limited debate. I am anxious that as many Members as possible should have an opportunity to express their views on this most important subject.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words in the name of the Labour Party, saddened though I am that the subject matter is the denial of the democratic right of the people to voice an opinion good, bad or indifferent, on the performance of local authorities throughout the length and breadth of the land.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to say that the way we are being asked to make a decision is anti-democratic.  It was my intention to table an amendment to this motion to enable the House to arrive at a rational decision on this matter but, unfortunately, it is not possible to amend the Minister's proposition.  Therefore, the question before the House is simply whether the Dáil will accept or reject the Minister's motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only choice open to us is a ludicrous one.  I would have found it acceptable and sensible if we were to discuss postponing the local elections until later in the year so that we could have the local and Presidential elections together.  That would be a cogent and rational case for a postponement of the June date.  The <Col N="1611" /> Minister would have had a reasonable case to make to the House, and could have expected reasonable support from the Opposition benches, to save money and allow the people to exercise their democratic right in two elections on the same day.  Under the archaic way this House does business, that was simply not possible.</P>
    <P>Apparently, it is not possible for us to have the Presidential election and the local elections on the same day without amending legislation.  That amending legislation is not necessarily complex, and certainly there appears to be a consensus that this side of the House would facilitate the Government in enacting it should they wish to do so.  Unfortunately, the Government have rejected that offer and have not taken on board the necessity to allow people to express their democratic will on local administration and the presidency at the same time.  The people have long been denied the facility and the right to voice an opinion both in relation to the Presidency and the local authorities which govern local affairs in towns, cities and counties.</P>
    <P>Tonight each member must vote to have the local elections in a month's time or in 13 months time, with no opportunity to consider a more rational and thought-out approach.  Against that background the Labour Party will vote against confirmation of the Ministerial order at the conclusion of this debate.  We will do so because we are convinced that the only reason this order is before us is that the two parties in Government are afraid to face the electorate, are afraid to face up to the needs of local authorities in a meaningful or proper way.</P>
    <P>No doubt, during the course of this debate there will be a great deal of talk from the Government benches about the need for local government reform.  In fact the Minister in his opening contribution dealt at some length with that urgent need.  We have heard it all before and no amount of huffing and puffing from that side of the House will convince me that this Government are acting out of anything other than a spirit of cowardice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> The issue of local democracy and local reform is trotted out here when we are within sight of a local election.  As soon as that danger seems to have passed, we can forget and coveniently shelve the issue until the next time the people come close to having the right to express a democratic view.  This is from the same Government, from the same Taoiseach who in his capacity as President of the European Council has been glorying in the outbreak of democracy in Eastern Europe.  He has been extracting as much mileage as he can &mdash; fair play to him &mdash; from the promises to support the processes of democracy in the Eastern bloc as they try to scramble towards a democratic procedure which will enable them to have a view on how their municipalities, regions and nations are governed.</P>
    <P>Democracy, apparently, is a wonderful notion, a marvellous view for the Taoiseach to embrace, and for this Coalition Administration to embrace, as long as it is happening 2,000 miles away.  Surely this Government can see that there is an unanswerable case for holding the local elections this year.  It is now five years since the local elections were last held. The people have an inalienable right to pass judgment on the way their local authorities have been treating them and have been running their affairs in those five years.  That right is now being taken away from them at the stroke of a ministerial pen and the people who are being disenfranchised will not forget that.</P>
    <P>I listened with a wry smile to the Minister's contribution when he said that the structures which are in place today were established by Acts of 1840, 1854, 1878 and 1898, an age when roads were the preserve of the horse and the idea of democratic government was still regarded as a new-fangled and slightly dangerous notion.  There are some on the Government benches who still regard democracy as a slightly dangerous notion which cannot be thrust upon the people of Ireland, so they run scared from the fact that they might be asked to give an opinion on Fianna Fáil performance in local government to the backdrop of a <Col N="1613" /> litany of broken promises from their local government manifesto of 1985.</P>
    <P>The right to vote in local elections is being taken away not for one year but for two years.  I challenge the Minister or any Government speaker tonight to give the House a categoric assurance that we will not be here again in one year's time debating another ministerial order. Will one Government contributor state categorically that the local elections will be held in June 1991?  I do not believe we will get such assurance.  Already it is possible to predict the excuses that will be trotted out in 12 months' time, that the process of reform will not have gone as planned, that difficulties have arisen, or the legislation now being recommended is taking longer to prepare than had originally been expected, or, perhaps, it will then be necessary to look at the local government boundaries.  Whatever the excuse, nobody ought to be fooled.</P>
    <P>The only decision this Government have made about local elections is that they must be postponed for as long as is legally possible in order to save Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats the embarrassment of a hammering at the polls, to save the skins of hundreds of Fianna Fáil councillors and to give the Progressive Democrats some chance of halting their slide into oblivion.  No doubt there will be a great deal of high sounding talk here tonight about the process of reform.  We have had some comment on that already, about the expert group who have now been appointed to help plan and map out that intricate, complex and involved process.  An expert group is all very well, and these are highly skilled, talented, experienced individuals with a wealth of local government experience between them and I have no doubt they will produce a report that will make very interesting reading.  The Minister himself might even read it before he puts it on a shelf to gather dust with all the others.</P>
    <P>I want to comment briefly on the Government's original proposal and that of the Minister to establish an Oireachtas all party committee.  I found a good deal <Col N="1614" /> of merit in that proposal and, despite Deputy Shatter's comments, I understand only one party in this House refused to participate in that committee.  A great deal of good work could have been done on a consensus basis.  The committee system is a good one and we should try as far as practicable to divorce the conflict that exists in this House and try to reach a consensus on issues that are difficult and complex, such as local government reform, that have been addressed inadequately by several Administrations over many years.  I regret that that initiative did not bear fruit, that we are not sitting around a table on an all party basis.  Even if the committee were to break down after six months, the experiment would have been worth trying.  Had we been successful, as we were on other issues, it would have been a real mould-breaking experience where other thorny, difficult and important issues could have been addressed in a constructive way by all party committees of this House; but that was not to be.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael decided that was a political risk they were not prepared to take and, for whatever reasons, they decided they would put down conditions that would make it impossible for it to work.  That opportunity was missed; I regret that. It would have been an interesting experiment.  The alternative being adopted by the Government is far less desirable.  Now we will have a report that will emanate substantially from the parties in Government and the input from those of us on the Opposition benches who have a passionate, genuine interest in the issue of local government will be denied its full impact.</P>
    <P>I would have been interested if the Minister's group of experts had come from a wider spectrum.  It would have been interesting had he included a local authority tenant or, better still, somebody from a local authority waiting list. How much more insight would we get into the value of the local authority service if we were in a position to hear from someone who suffers from water shortages, old people who have seen <Col N="1615" /> their library service decimated or people who have been put at risk of fire because of the chronic understaffing of the fire services.  It is good to see that the Minister is awake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>If only the Minister would listen to some contributions from this side of the House.  Is the Minister telling us there is no understaffing in the fire service, that there is no housing list, that there are no chronic shortages and that nobody suffers because the library service is cut?  Is that what he is saying?  If that is what he believes he is living in an ivory tower, as the vast majority of the people believe.  I hoped he had retained some semblance of a link with reality, but apparently even that has slipped from him.</P>
      <P>If the Government and this Minister were prepared to listen to people who have developed expertise as a result of suffering and hardship in their local areas they would get a different message &mdash; that reform of local government is all very well, that it is a great idea, high faluting as it is, but the first thing people need is a restoration of basic, reasonable levels of existing services.  The Minister has presided over the decimation of local democracy.  He has squeezed every local authority for every last shilling, and services people took for granted over generations have been disappearing under his stewardship.  It is about time he realised that and took responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read with a wry smile the Minister's contribution here tonight.  He talked about our existing local authority system which has ensured that an adequate road network was extended throughout the State.  Does he really believe that?  He said housing has been provided for those in need.  Does he not know the housing crisis he is presiding over?  Does he not know that at this moment in my home town of Wexford there are 194 applicants for housing, that, for the first time in the three years, he has been allocating <Col N="1616" /> money to build houses &mdash; 20 for the 194 applicants this year &mdash; we have not moved from our 1987 priority list?</P>
    <P>It is very comforting for the Minister to feel content about this, but people on the waiting list in Wexford and every other town and county are not so smug or content.  The Minister might refer to his Minister of State who received a deputation on that matter in recent weeks and gave us some hope that he might find some resources to redress the terrible hardship suffered by those people.  They are cold statistics that I can read out, but the reality underlying those cold statistics is that people are living in grotty, filthy, insanitary habitation, in flats up three, four and five flights of stairs, trying to raise children without proper sanitation or water supply.  That is the reality that underscores the figures I have just given.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about our wonderful road system.  Does he not know that in my county alone the county engineer has estimated it will take £8 million to bring the county road system up to any semblence of reasonableness?  Last year at the estimates' meeting the county manager was genuinely floating the notion of abandoning some of our county roads and erecting notices to the effect, &ldquo;motorists travel on this road at their own risk; it has been abandoned by Wexford County Council&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister clued in to the realities of local government and the crises that face ordinary people in their everyday lives.  No matter where one looks our local authority services are in a state of crisis and nowhere is the crisis more obvious than in regard to housing. Increasingly, this is the core of family poverty and it will remain a fundamental problem as long as we have a Government who do not recognise the need for including a provision for public housing. The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, who are present, have presided over a housing allocation in next year's Estimate which is basically a fraud. The allocation to local authorities of £6 million by the State will enable them to build between 250 and 300 dwellings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> It has been said that local authorities can build up to £45 million worth of local authority houses next year provided they raise the money themselves.  How is it proposed to do that?  Local authorities can raise that money by selling off the housing stock they own to sitting tenants. The Minister, in his great gesture to deal with the real needs of those who do not have houses, proposes to allow local authorities to spend their own money. My response to that is, big deal.  On average each local authority house sold will yield between £12,000 and £15,000, and a lot less in rural areas.  In Dublin, for instance, it will cost Dublin Corporation £50,000 to replace that house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an indication of the degree of the Minister's care and response to the real needs of people.  That will not be lost upon them.  It copperfastens the reason we are debating this motion.  The cynicism that underscores the motion, the cynicism that led to the presentation of a fraudulent document to the people in the 1985 local elections, and later in the 1987 general election, will rebound on the Government when they face the electorate again. They cannot hide for ever.</P>
      <P>The real scandal in this is that the Government are hoping that these problems will go away.  They are hoping that emigration will solve the problem.  Waiting lists would not be as long if young couples did what the Minister wants them to do, leave the country.  Fianna Fáil wait and hope that the rest of this social problem will be driven away but there are hundreds of families living in overcrowded conditions and losing hope day by day of ever getting decent accommodation.</P>
      <P>Side by side with the housing problem is the increasing ghettoisation of many urban areas.  In parts of our major cities there is 75 per cent unemployment and we are aware of the social implications of that.  One of the main reasons that tenants in those areas who have jobs have moved away is that they are tired of trying to cope with bad planning, lack of amenities, crime and other evils that go hand in hand with deprivation and the collapse of community spirit.  In the sixties housing was a major political issue and it will be again in the nineties.  The Minister for the Environment, the Minister of State and their respective political parties, will share the blame for that between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that many local authorities have been forced to increase rents for existing tenants by between 5 and 10 per cent this year.  That increase is considerably more than the rate of inflation.  Rent increases of that magnitude are totally unjustified in the first place because they exceed the rate of inflation and, secondly, because the differential rent scheme is supposed to <Col N="1619" /> reflect income levels.  This means few, if any, local authority tenants will have benefited by income increases of 10 per cent last year.  Those increases bear out what the Labour Party said in the debate on the budget &mdash; that by the time the social welfare increases announced in the budget reached the people they were intended for their value would already have disappeared.  The latest imposition on people who are poor will in no way be deflected by the social welfare increases offered by the Government.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it seems that the Government regard local authorities as little more than a vehicle for their own particular petty politics.  One example is the way the Government have treated local authorities in the context of the national lottery. The last speaker, Deputy Shatter, dealt with that issue at some length and I do not intend to repeat his argument. The argument put in place by the Coalition Government to try to persuade the public that there was now an element of accountability in the mangement of the national lottery moneys has been exposed as a sham whenever one looks at the role local authorities &mdash; I am a member of two &mdash; are asked to play in this context.  All around the country local authorities, who are supposed to have processed applications for lottery grants under the amenities schemes, are parcelling them up and sending them to the Minister for the Environment without any attempt at making recommendations or prioritising the applications.</P>
    <P>In this way more than £160 million worth of applications have been sent to Dublin where they will have to compete, one against another, for the Minister's attention.  Almost £5 million worth of applications have been sent by Dublin County Council and at least the same amount will be sent by Dublin Corporation. Applications from every corner of the country will compete for £6.5 million worth of lottery money.  People's expectations have been built up and, worse than that, a sham has been created that local authorities have some input <Col N="1620" /> into the system.  Local authorities will be there to give the rejects the bad news but the Minister is allowed to give successful applicants the good news.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Deputy to indicate how he can relate his contribution to the order to postpone the local elections.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to make a case against the Minister's contention that the local elections be deferred.  I do not think they should be postponed and I am trying to make a cogent case in that regard.  I am trying to elaborate on the reasons for the people having an opportunity to express a view on existing local structures and personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason no effort is being made by local authorities to give priority to the applications made by the Minister is simply that they do not perceive themselves as having any function in the matter.  That is the long and the short of it.  I have talked about housing, roads and the lottery and they all point to the real crisis.  If the Minister doubts there is a crisis he should talk to Fianna Fáil members of the local authority on which I sit or indeed to members of any other local authority because the crisis is not <Col N="1621" /> confined to any county or borough council. It exists everywhere.</P>
    <P>The Government have talked about long term reform but the truth is that there is now a crisis in local authorities and it will get worse each year as local authorities are increasingly squeezed. We all know that reform is necessary, that there is an unanswerable case for it, particularly for the sort of reform that devolves power downwards.  My personal instinct is to start from the premise that everything should devolve to the lowest level, that one should have to make a case for keeping it central.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's record over the past 13 years in regard to local government has been shameful.  They began the process of running down local authorities with their 1977 manifesto.  They fought against the reform which Deputy Kavanagh introduced as Minister for the Environment. They have consistently belittled the role of local authorities, planning development, the role of the control of the physical planning process and have fought tooth and nail against the depoliticisation of the planning process brought about by Deputy Spring when he was Minister for the Environment.  There is little reason to hope that the Government will ever commit themselves to meaningful reform.  The only true value of promises about reform is to enable Fianna Fáil and their allies to run away from the electorate as far as they can. However, last year in the general election the fraud which they had perpetrated on the people was recognised.  No matter how fast the Minister, Deputy Flynn, and his friends run, the electorate will eventually catch up with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The postponement of the local elections has been coming for some time.  On 20 September last I stated publicly it was my belief that the local elections &mdash; which were due to be held in June 1990 &mdash; would be postponed.  My remarks were dismissed by Government sources and when I sought to raise the issue at Question Time in the Dáil the <Col N="1622" /> Minister and the Minister of State dismissed any suggestion that the local elections would be postponed.</P>
      <P>It was perfectly clear to anybody that the Government's intention from the very beginning was to postpone the 1990 local elections.  That intention was signalled in the Programme for Government which talked about the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on local government reform which would report within 12 months.  Even if the committee had been established last July when the Government were formed they would still not have reported before the local elections were due to take place and, therefore, the scene was already set for their postponement.</P>
      <P>In any event it has taken nine months for the Government to finally declare they will not establish the joint committee. I do not accept that the reason for not establishing an Oireachtas committee was the refusal of the Fine Gael Party to participate in it.  The Government at the very least were half-hearted about their intention to establish an Oireachtas committee on local government reform although I regret the fact that Fine Gael decided not to participate in it.  By doing so they have abdicated their Opposition role and have made a very serious mistake because they have now allowed a situation to develop whereby the discussion of local government reform &mdash; such as it will be &mdash; will take place in private between a select group of Government Ministers and a special committee. Fine Gael have missed an opportunity of having the issue of local government reform debated in the open. They could have presented the Government with an ideal opportunity of coming in here with a <i>fait accompli</i> on new local government structures and functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> about this debate.  Six years ago the House heard virtually the same debate.  In 1984 the then Government decided to postpone local elections and their imaginative reason for doing so was remarkably similar to that advanced tonight.  Indeed the speeches made then in support of the motion to postpone local elections bear <Col N="1623" /> a very striking resemblance to the sentiments contained in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>It is worth reflecting on what happened since 1984.  Prior to the 1985 local elections we got a very badly thought out, cobbled together reorganisation of local government, mainly for the Dublin area, establishing four new councils in Dublin. Elections were held on that basis and, since then, it died.  Legislation was not introduced to give effect to the reason for local government elections being postponed in 1984.  A number of questions must be asked in that regard.  Deputy Shatter asked half the questions, relating to the period of time between February 1987 to date.  He wanted to know why the Fianna Fáil Government from February 1987 to June 1989 did not legislate for local government reform or why, even since the last general election, no steps were taken to introduce reform in local government.</P>
    <P>The other question which must be asked is why the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition between 1985 &mdash; when the local elections were held &mdash; and February 1987 when the Government went out of office, did not legislate for local government reform.  Why, for example, has it taken almost a year to bring forward a committee to examine the question of local government reform?  Very simply the answer is that local government reform is not viewed at all as a political priority. Rather it is something that is hauled out when there are local elections looming in order to justify their postponement.  It has happened twice within a period of six years &mdash; two different Governments on two different occasions have postponed local elections with the promise that there will be a reform of local government.</P>
    <P>The reality is that local elections are being postponed for political reasons. First, Fianna Fáil councillors throughout the country are still champing at the bit over the Fianna Fáil Coalition with the Progressive Democrats.  They have to be thrown a bone to demonstrate that the dog is still wagging the tail.  Second, Fianna Fáil secured control of a number <Col N="1624" /> of councils at the 1985 local elections &mdash; when there was, at that time, a swing against the Government &mdash; on the promise that they would abolish water charges, a promise they have not kept. They are now holding on desperately to power in those local councils and are fearful that the electorate will wreak their vengeance on them because of their failure to implement those promises.</P>
    <P>Third, there is the matter of the rezoning of land.  Many local authorities are still in the process of reviewing their development plans.  Fianna Fáil majority councils, in order to re-zone land, need to retain control of those councils.  The holding of local elections in 1990 and the removal from power of Fianna Fáil councils would disturb that objective. Therefore, as Fianna Fáil see it, there is a necessity to postpone local elections long enough to enable the completion of the review of development plans and the re-zoning of land that will take place in that process, indeed the transforming into millionaires of people who, in some cases, may be supporters of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Where do the Progressive Democrats fit into this picture?  They have said publicly they are in favour of holding local elections although they have said so somewhat tongue in cheek.  Any observer of last weekend's conference would have to accept that the game plan so far as the Progressive Democrats are concerned is to allow themselves more time to rebuild their organisation.  Clearly the holding of local elections in 1990 would be too early from their point of view.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems that the reasons for the postponement of local elections have very little to do with the need to reform local government but rather a very great deal to do with political considerations. However, since the Minister has stated that it is his intention to reform local government and this is why local elections have been postponed, we need to examine that contention somewhat further.  The question of the reform of local government has been in the air for a very long time.  It is 20 years since the Government White Paper on the reform of local government was published.  The <Col N="1625" /> present Minister has come into the House and told us that the reform of local government has really been talked about since the foundation of the State, that legislation enacted in the 19th century, 100 years old, has been toyed with at different times, that the issue of local government reform first raised publicly by a Government in the early seventies, which Governments have approached and pulled back from with varying degrees of enthusiasm since then, suddenly will be achieved between now and the end of February 1991.  Quite frankly I do not believe that timescale is feasible.</P>
    <P>There have been many reasons for the non-implementation of reform of local government.  One is that the reform of local government is extremely complex. There are many interests in the local government area that must be consulted. There are elected members, the General Council of County Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities in Ireland, LAMA, of course now the Fianna Fáil councillors organisation; there are the local authority managers, the various trade unions representing local authority personnel at different levels.  There are wider community interests, the Association of Combined Residents Association, an Taisce, many interests who would inevitably have to be consulted if real reform of local government is to be achieved.  The Minister knows very well, for example, when talking about the restructuring of local authorities, that if for no other reason, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to which the Government are committed, commits them to having discussions with the trade unions about its consequences for local authority staff.  He knows very well that if he does not do so the prospects of achieving local government reform are quite remote. When replying I would like to hear from him, in practical terms, as to how he proposes carrying out the extensive range of consultations inevitably necessary with different interests in local government in order to have legislation not just before but through this House by the end of February 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is the question of boundaries, a complex issue.  In the 92 years since the 1898 Local Government Act, for example, urban boundaries have been altered on five occasions only. Now apparently the extensive alteration of local authority boundaries will all be done within the space of a few months. There is also the question of functions which has to be addressed, the thorny question of section 4 <i>vis-à-vis</i> the planning process and the question of finance. There is the question of re-organisation which might inevitably involve relocation of offices, the establishment of new town-halls and so on.  All of those areas will have to be addressed if there is to be real re-organisation of local government.  I find it very difficult to believe that all of that will be achieved within the very limited timescale the Minister has set himself.  Of course, it is possible he may attempt to do so.  But if he attempts to do so and we find ourselves here next autumn with a Bill to reform local government, it will not be one which will deal with the re-organisation of local government in a comprehensive way; rather it will have been hurried and ultimately will not work.  I believe that such an attempt to re-organise local government would fail, just as did the attempt in 1984.</P>
      <P>In any event, even if there is a genuine intent on the part of the Government to reform local government, there would be no need to postpone local elections in order to do so.  First, the postponement of local elections is a denial of democracy, a denial of people's rights to pass judgment on local representatives elected in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one thing the public seek more than local government reform probably it is a change of some of their local representatives elected in 1985.  It would have been possible to have held <Col N="1627" /> local elections this year.  It would even have been possible for the Minister to have introduced a brief amendment of the 1973 Local Elections Act which could have provided that the local elections to be held in 1990 would be for a period of time up to the putting in place of re-organised local government structures. That would have carried the added advantage of the Minister having available to him the opinions of recently elected members of local authorities, members with a new mandate, not a five-year-old one, who might have some input into the way in which local government should be re-organised.  It would be far more democratic to hold the local elections this year and get on with the business of reforming local government in a rational way over a period of years which is what it is likely to take.  I have put down an amendment to the Government motion which you will probably want to deal with later, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, which calls for the local elections to be held&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect you to break the news so soon.  In the nature of things the Government motion before us will be passed and the local elections will be postponed; for how long remains to be seen but I share the concerns expressed by Deputy Shatter and Deputy Howlin that next year it is likely there will be a further motion seeking to further postpone the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to address the question of the reform of local government.  Having regard to the fact that the Minister has offered this as his reason for postponing the local elections there are a few comments I would like to make about it. First, no one doubts the need for local government reform.  The present system is borrowed from the 19th century.  For example, town commissioners were appointed under an Act which is now 140 years old, with the main legislation going <Col N="1628" /> back to 1898.  Local government structures take no account of the changes which have occurred during the past century, in particular the fundamental change from a predominantly rural society to a predominantly urban one.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the last urban district councils to be established, in Athy and Naas, were established on April Fool's Day, 1900.  Since we gained independence the legislation put in place on local government has, if anything, made the system of local government more undemocratic.  The 1940 County Management Act and the 1955 City and County Management (Amendment) Act effectively transfer power to appointed officials rather than to elected members. In 1978, domestic rates were abolished and the commitment given to local authorities that the rates support grant would be equal to the amount that would have been collected by the local authorities in rates was not fulfilled.  The 1983 Financial Provisions Act further eroded the powers of local authorities.</P>
    <P>In addition, there has been a gradual erosion and centralisation of powers in the local government-Environment area. Local authorities can do little or nothing without first getting the express approval of the Department of the Environment. Despite all the rhetoric about the need to restore life to local government, it is remarkable that all the legislation the Minister has brought before the House requires local authorities to get the express approval of the Department of the Environment in carrying out their functions.</P>
    <P>The general public have expressed their discontent with the situation and it is interesting to note that the turn-out at local elections is little more than 50 per cent.  It is also interesting to note that the turn-out is lower the bigger and more remote the authority.  For example, the turn-out for the election of town commissioners is higher than it is for the election of Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council.  As a result, we have the most centralised system of local government anywhere in Europe.  What passes for local government in this country is <Col N="1629" /> out of date, unrepresentative, bureaucratically controlled, is tied to the Department of the Environment and is inefficient in the delivery of services.  The staffs of local authorities are demoralised and the general public are alienated from local authorities while reform is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The question is, what kind of reform are we going to get.  I would like the Minister when replying to state what terms of reference have been given both to the Government committee and the special committee of experts set up under that committee.  Will the interests involved have the right to make submissions to these committees?  What consideration will be given to these submissions?</P>
    <P>Will hearings be held to get the opinions of various interests within the local government area and what consultations will take place with the elected members of local authorities, the organisations representing the elected members of local authorities, the unions representing local government staffs and organisations representing consumers?</P>
    <P>What we need is a radically new approach to the idea of local democracy. Altering a few boundaries here and there and tampering with functions and finances is not enough.  We are living in a time when democracy is the issue of the day and people everywhere are demanding the right to exercise control over their own lives and environment.  What passes for local government in Ireland hardly fits the bill.  The election turn-out of little over 50 per cent, the alienation of and hostility towards local authorities hardly show that there is a great deal of confidence in the present system of local government.  It is not enough to think only in terms of representative structures as people increasingly want to be involved and participate in government. Therefore, when the question of reform of local government is being considered, there needs to be a shift towards a more participative form of democracy in which people can be directly and democratically involved in the protection of their environment, the making of planning <Col N="1630" /> decisions, and the management of housing estates and local facilities.</P>
    <P>We need to elevate local democracy in this country to a point at which it will not only be concerned about potholes and sewers but also about every other service provided by the public and private sectors. We need a new approach to local democracy with people having power and a sense of control over their own lives. While it is quite clear the Government have no intention of holding the local elections in conjunction with the Presidential election, there is one thing they could do in conjunction with the Presidential election and that is they could address the omission in the Constitution which makes no reference to local government or local democracy.  The confidence of Members of this House, members of local authorities and the general public in the Government's commitment to the concept of local democracy and local government would be strengthened if an amendment to the Constitution was advanced at the time of the Presidential election which would guarantee local government and the principle of local democracy under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Our form of representation in local government is one of the worst in Europe.  I am glad that Dr. T.J. Barrington is to be appointed to the committee of experts as he has done a great deal of work in comparing our system of local government with those in other European countries.  For example, he has pointed out that there are far more tiers of local government in other European countries, ranging from regional government to county and district local government right down to municipal or parish local government.  He has further pointed out that there are far more councils and indeed councillors in other European countries and he makes the point that while we are one of the biggest spenders among the member states of the OECD, along with the Scandinavian countries, we are among the lowest spenders when it comes to the proportion of gross domestic product spent at local level.  Let <Col N="1631" /> me quote from something Dr. Barrington said at a recent seminar:</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe have published a table of the proportion of GDP spent by local authorities in 16 of their member states in 1981.  The four at the top of the table are Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Holland, in that order. And the four at the bottom?  Why, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece, in that order.  When we recall that in 1981 Portugal, Spain, and Greece were barely recovering from the crushing of all democracy in their countries, the ranking of Ireland, 13th of 16, is not very distinguished.</P>
    <P>Another test is the opportunities available to citizens to take part in the process of government via popular election.  This depends, apart from the national parliament, on the number of elective bodies at the regional and local levels.  We have in the Republic 115 elective bodies as against about 300 each in Denmark and Sweden, some 450 in Norway and 750 in the Netherlands. In other small countries, Austria has 9 Lander and some 2,300 local authorities; Switzerland has 26 cantons and half cantons and about 3,400 local authorities.  Of the larger countries France has 22 regions, 95 home departments, 325 sub-departments or arron-dissements, 3,075 cantons and over 36,000 communes.  These elect something like half a million councillors.  In West Germany there are 11 Lander, over 300 counties and their equivalents, and more than 8,400 geme-inden, or municipalities. </P>
    <P>In fact we compare very poorly.</P>

For example, Leitrim County Council have 22 council seats for 27,000 people giving a ratio of 1:1,200 whereas Dublin Corporation have 52 seats for over half a million people giving a ratio of 1 to almost 10,000.  When we consider that county councillors elect members of the Seanad it is clear that a voter in Leitrim is eight times as powerful as a voter in Dublin city when it comes to Seanad elections.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not going to say anything about the state of the Seanad but Deputies can draw their own conclusions. The problem is not by any means confined to Leitrim because there are somewhat similar ratios in Longford and Carlow and, admittedly, a bit higher in Laois, Cavan and Roscommon.  Quite clearly in all of those areas the degree of representation of people locally is far deeper than it is in the large urban areas. I am not arguing that there should be a reduction in representation in those areas but there is a need to increase the amount of representation in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a need to examine the boundaries of urban councils.  Twenty six out of the 49 urban councils at present <Col N="1633" /> need to have their boundaries revised.  In some cases there are far greater numbers of people living in the urban catchment areas who are not entitled to vote in urban council elections than the number of people who are entitled to vote.  For example, in Navan there are about 3,500 people who are entitled to vote in the urban council elections but nearly three times that, over 8,000 people, are outside the electoral area in Navan and who are not entitled to vote for their own urban councils.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is a need for regional structures and it is a great pity that the regional development organisations were abolished.  If there are to be regional structures established it is important that those regional bodies be directly elected because otherwise what we will get are appointed bodies which will very often reflect almost totally the view of the majority party rather than that of a wide cross-section of opinion.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area there is a particular need to address the question of new councils. The type of councils that were proposed after the 1984 postponement of the local elections were not workable.  If one went out into the street and asked somebody what part of Dublin they came from one would meet very few people who would say Fingal or Belgard or even Rathdown.  Apart altogether from the way in which the boundaries were struck, the idea of setting up Fingal county bears about as much relevance to the real needs of local government in Dublin as talking about removing the seat of Government to the Hill of Tara.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to conclude by saying that there is a need to establish in Dublin new authorities which are based on the communities in which people live. Let me give an example.  The new area of Shankill in my constituency has a population of about 10,000 people and if it were a town in some other county it would very probably have its own local authority.  There are other examples like that.  Tallaght is a very obvious one, a very large urban area which does not have its own local authority.  There is a need to establish local authorities in Dublin which are based on the communities with which people identify.</P>
      <P>There is a need also to take a more imaginative approach to the functions of local government, to broaden out the functions away from the traditional ones that have been performed by local authorities, to give local authorities a real role over the delivery of all services in their local area.  The Minister's speech was quite remarkable.  He devoted a few paragraphs to financing but it was remarkable that he made no reference to water charges &mdash; which he promised to abolish &mdash; or to property tax, which he proposed to introduce, or so we were told.  The Minister needs to tell us quite clearly what the Government's intentions are in regard to financing local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past ten years local authorities have found themselves fleeced of money. The promises that the loss of income from rates would be made up by the rate support grants have not been kept.  In fact, most local authorities&mdash; even Dublin County Council &mdash; receive only £6 out of every £10 they would have collected if they were still levying rates.  There is a <Col N="1635" /> need to clarify the Government's intentions in regard to financing local authorities and there is specifically a need for the Minister to tell us the Government's position on the abolition of water charges, which was promised by the Government in the 1985 local election which promise was repeated in the 1987 general election but has not yet been delivered. There needs to be a specific statement as to where we stand on water charges. Have the Government changed their position or do they intend to abolish them in the context of the reforms they propose to introduce?</P>
    <P>All the talk of local government reform will be sheer rhetoric unless there is a genuine intention on the part of the Minister and his Department to let go of local government, to stop making local government a prisoner of the Department of the Environment and to stop requiring local authorities to return to the Department of the Environment for sanction on every action they want to take, very often finding themselves frustrated by the inevitable delays when the Department do not respond to their requests.  I could give many examples &mdash; the distribution of national lottery funds, schemes of letting priorities for local authority tenants, the detail of road works, a whole range of functions which local authorities should be free to carry out without having the Department check every detail, crossing every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and dotting every &ldquo;i&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I will be happy to share my time with Deputy Dempsey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the Progressive Democrats to agree to the postponement of <Col N="1636" /> the local elections was based on a clear determination that the postponement was necessary in order to facilitate a major overhaul of the present system of flawed local government.  After securing the inclusion of a commitment to the establishment of an all party committee on the reform of local government in the <i>Programme for Government,</i> we were optimistic that such reform could have taken place without any need to postpone elections.  Unfortunately, Fine Gael's refusal to participate in this committee ensured that the opportunity was lost. The Progressive Democrats were left with a clear choice of missing an opportunity for major reform &mdash; holding the elections with the present inadequate structures or agreeing to the postponement of the elections in order to facilitate a major overhaul of local government and the establishment of new structures with greater and more relevant powers.</P>
    <P>The demand for such reform is unanswerable.  For years the system of Government in this country has become more and more centralised and bureaucratic and consequently less efficient and representative.  Almost uniquely among the countries of Europe, we have constantly rejected the movement towards subsidiarity and the devolution of powers to the greatest possible degree.  I believe we have paid dearly for this; not only have we deprived our communities and regions of their proper role in governing and administering their areas, but we have created a virtual Frankenstein in central administration which has lost out on all fronts both in its ability to develop and plan nationally and in its ability to respond to the needs of local communities.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are committed to reversing this trend and are convinced that a Government subcommittee, together with the advisory committee backed up by independent experts, is the best way of achieving this. The Government's recent announcement of their plans for major reforms demonstrates the seriousness with which this will be tackled.  Not only have we set <Col N="1637" /> down very clear and tight guidelines by which progress can be measured but the committee have been given a wide brief to ensure they have the ability to succeed in their task.  Most important, however, is the appointment to the Cabinet subcommittee of an independent group of experts selected because of their particular knowledge and experience who will work closely and advise the Government on the reforms necessary.  I might add that as a female Member of this House I am particularly pleased that 43 per cent of the membership of that committee are female.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats fully recognise the value of local participation in the planning and administration of a range of affairs that affect daily lives of ordinary citizens.  A strong system of local government with directly elected and accountable members is essential to ensuring the most efficient and democratic provision of a whole range of services to the community.  The committee which the Government have formed will deal with all areas relevant to the reform of the present system, finance, structures, functions and other issues such as the general powers of local authorities, the reserved managerial functions and operation of aspects of the planning acts and the section 4 procedure.  All of these areas are of great importance and the success of this reform will depend to a large measure on the recommendations to emerge in relation to finance and administration.</P>
    <P>The Government committee have been asked to make recommendations on the criteria necessary for the allocation on a statutory basis of the funds from central to local government.  This is a proposal to radically alter the present method of financing local authorities. Instead of depending on an arbitrary decision made each year there will be a new system whereby Exchequer revenue collected nationally will in future be shared between central and local government on a statutory basis.  This will be <Col N="1638" /> determined in the case of each local authority on the basis of a formula to be drawn up by a committee of independent experts, which will take all relevant factors into account to ensure that the allocations are fair and adequate.  This formula can be reviewed every four years to allow for adjustments and so forth.</P>
    <P>The present almost <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements for the financing of local authorities are a major factor in their inability to effectively make forward plans for their budgets and needs.  The committee of experts will be asked to examine the present arrangements in every Government Department with a view to advising which functions and services could best be devolved to the new bodies at county or district level.  There are a range of possibilities, including road grants, housing grants, environmental improvement schemes and so on, and the possibilities of giving the new bodies a role in the delivery of essential services like primary education, local health and so on must also be considered.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that the present structures of local government should be three tiered with regional, county and district authorities. The key reforms in this regard should be at regional and district level.  The present system of county councils and county borough councils would remain largely unchanged in terms of their unit size with adjustments for population changes and urban growth only, particularly in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>There is major scope for rationalisation of the present number of regional authorities which have sprung up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis over the years and which often have overlapping responsibilities and boundaries.  Equally at district level dealing with towns of approximately 1,000 people, we believe that the new structure should be put in place to provide the most localised level for the delivery of services to each community.  In Dublin and other larger cities this would require special arrangements but it would be a major <Col N="1639" /> step forward for towns throughout the country.  In particular, in the greater Dublin area there is a need for one overall authority with new sub-authorities at regional level for towns like Tallaght, Clondalkin and so on.</P>
    <P>For years the need to reform local government has received the ritualistic support of virtually every shade of opinion in this country and House, but nothing has ever happened.  This cannot continue and reform of local government can wait no longer.  I have no doubt but that this reform will be widely received by most members of the community but particularly by local authority members.  I might add that most local authority members I have met believe that reform of the structures is far more significant than whether personality A or personality Y represents a local area in a particular local authority.  I might add, as somebody who has spent a lot of time with many members of local authorities, that the decision to postpone the local elections has been widely received by members of the main Opposition party.  Only this afternoon a very prominent member of that party urged me to consider postponing them for a further year.  That person thought it would be crazy to hold them in 1991.  Members should stop being hypocritical, taking one view in public and in this House while taking a different view when they go into the bar or the corridors of Leinster House.  The decision made by the Government to postpone the elections to allow for major reform is, I believe, widely supported, particularly by communities around the country who favour more devolved powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last point made by the Minister, she hit the nail on the head.  Certainly in my experience with local authority members throughout the country, they welcome the postponement of the local elections because they see no point in electing <Col N="1640" /> people to the structures that exist and with the functions that councils have at the moment.  I have no hesitation in saying I welcome the decision to defer the local elections not because of any fear of elections but because of the fear that if the review does not take place there will be a collapse of local democracy.  The erosion of powers in the past 20 years has led to a lack of respect for local government and its institutions which would eventually lead to a lack of trust and faith in the councils and consequently in the whole system and in democracy.  If that lack of trust builds up it will seep through the whole political system with very serious consequences not just for the local government system but for all forms of government and democracy.</P>
      <P>The failure of the local government system, as perceived by the general public, to be responsive to local needs could lead eventually to anarchy.  There have been signs of this already in the huge growth in the number of pressure groups springing up around the country in relation to various local issues.  That growth in pressure groups and the attempt to pervert decisions made by local authorities and elected representatives is a sign of a lack of trust in the system as it exists at present.  That is something that has to be addressed and I am glad it is now being addressed by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's contribution did little to restore anybody's faith in local government.  His speech was very long and hence many of us now have to cut short our contributions.  It did not contain one useful or original idea in relation to improved structures for local government. He shed a lot of crocodile tears about the lack of progress in local government reform since 1987.  He said he could produce a Bill in five minutes to implement the previous Government's proposals.  Why then, when he was in power for two years after the proposals were put forward and produced in a document called <i>Local Government Reform</i><Col N="1641" /> and later contained in the famous document <i>Building on Reality,</i> did he not produce a Bill in those two years?  Deputy Shatter has been three years in Opposition and we all know he is capable of producing Bills and motions.  Therefore, why did he not succeed in having a Bill proposed from his side of the House in the past three years?  He is shedding crocodile tears about the system of local government.</P>
    <P>The previous Government put in place a proposed structure for Dublin of which Deputy Shatter was very critical. The Government had not the courage to fully implement the proposals they put in place.  His comments have to be seen in the context of the Fine Gael attitude to the committee that was proposed on local government reform.  In the past three to five years Fine Gael supported proposals to take power from local authorities at various levels.  They supported proposals to take power from VECs, to abolish health boards and to set up a variety of national bodies to undertake local authority functions.  They have not at any stage put forward positive proposals to restore powers or give extra functions to local government.  Therefore, Deputy Shatter's rambling on various issues during the course of his lengthy contribution has to be seen for what it was, a lot of hypocrisy and cant.</P>
    <P>The major problem facing us at present is that the system of local government is neither local nor government.  It is not local in the sense that decisions are made at national level in many cases and it is not government because all that is happening is that local authorities are administering national schemes under circulars from the Department.  The Department keep strict control over all aspects of local authority work.  One of the major bones of contention in the area of local authorities is the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> that has been mentioned here.  To my mind, that stifles all local initiative.  Everybody at local authority level is afraid to take any real initiative and everybody looks <Col N="1642" /> over his shoulder, whether it be the manager or the members.  The threat of the surcharge always looms large when particular proposals are put forward.  That doctrine is a very effective way of controlling local government but is something that should be removed.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I welcome very much the initiative taken by the Minister in undertaking a review with a view to reforming local government.  The basic principle that should underline that review should be one of decentralisation, that is, that all services should be provided at local level where possible.  Local government would then be a management of local affairs by local councils. If that principle were adopted we could see a three-tier or a four-tier system emerging from the review.  Irrespective of what structure emerges, this principle must be the one on which the whole review package is structured.  Any system of local government must be responsive to local needs; it must be accessible, effective, efficient and economic; it must be seen to be an instrument for development and change and a force in fostering community identity and awareness; it must be acceptable to the public and representative of the local community and, finally, it must be large enough and have sufficient resources to carry out the tasks allocated to it.  If the principle of decentralisation is upheld in the review, effective and real reform will take place which should lead to wider responsibilities for local authorities and the handing down of powers and finances.</P>
    <P>Local people cannot understand, and it is hard to explain, the fact that decisions are made in Dublin as to where a school, sewerage works and so on should be sited in Kerry, Meath or elsewhere.  Decisions of a local nature should be taken locally. One area which stands out and has been referred to at various times is the group water schemes, where local communities decide that they will provide a public water supply for themselves.  There is a two tier inspection system, first to the <Col N="1643" /> local authority and then to the Department of the Environment, back to the local authority and finally to the local group two or three times before a decision is made.  The payments come from central funds rather than from local government.</P>
    <P>This principle would make government more accessible to the people, and would be government by the people, for the people.  If that was the case citizens would participate more fully in the system and would identify more with it.  Local authorities would act in a more positive way to enhance the social, economic, cultural and environmental aspects affecting the local people.  The principle would also mean that the demand for more representative structures would be met.</P>
    <P>Every speaker so far referred to representative structures and representative councils.  To be representative a council does not need to be any larger but, by involving local communities in one of the tiers of local government in an advisory capacity, the system would be more representative.  That could be done simply by changing the system of election to local authorities, to the PR system where people are elected to single seat constituencies.  That would localise the election process and people would identify more closely with their local public representative and vice versa.  This could be very effective in making the system more representative than is perceived by the public at present.</P>
    <P>The local authority system should be able to recognise the diversity of needs from locality to locality.  It should be sufficiently flexible to meet these needs and to cope with them.  In addition to the overall principle or philosophy which I have mentioned about subsidiarity there are a number of other principles which should be clearly in the minds of those involved in the review.  If possible the system should be more democratic and all the basic units of local authorities should be elected; it should be more <Col N="1644" /> efficient and less central control would help in that process.  There should be constitutional recognition of local government.  The method and the approaches of local authorities should be more flexible and the relationship between local and central government should be more flexible.  Local authorities should be capable of changing the boundaries on their own very quickly.</P>
    <P>Regarding structures, the system of a basic unit of a county is so inbred at this stage that even though it is large by European standards I doubt if it could reasonably be changed.  There should be changes in structures and there should at least be a regional tier and either one or two tiers at subcommittee level.  If there is to be a regional tier &mdash; our experience with regional health boards is not a happy one &mdash; there is likely to be stern resistance unless those bodies have a clear majority of public representatives who are seen to be in control.  These bodies would need to be advised by experts in various fields. Essentially the whole question of public accountability and having elected representatives on those bodies who make decisions is one from which we cannot move.  If we are to have a regional structure that is how we should have it.</P>
    <P>In view of the agreement reached earlier I will bring my contribution to a close. I believe very strongly that reform is needed, that we must delay the local elections because there is no point appointing people to bodies that are defunct and almost powerless at this stage.  I have no hesitation in supporting the motion.</P>

      <P>When he was appointed Minister for the Environment he said he was going to put his heart and soul into that Department and, above all, that he was going to respect the people who sent him there &mdash; the western people &mdash; who love local democracy.  When the Minister came to office he suddenly realised he had many tasks on his hands, one of which was to reduce spending in the Department of the Environment and he set about doing that.  He did away with things which were sacred to the west, for example, county development teams which were valuable to the west and did not cost too much; they gathered information that would be required by industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister's kind of county development team is still there. That is the point I am coming to.  I have discovered that the Minister has become Tadhg an dá thaobh.  The Minister was going to reform local government and do all those wonderful things.  Deputy Dempsey accused Deputy Shatter of shedding crocodile tears but he said nothing about the years between 1985 <Col N="1646" /> and 1987.  I am ashamed of those years and as a councillor I am ashamed of the years from 1987 to 1990.  In that time the Department of the Environment wiped out what used to be a very respected position, a local authority member.  It is now a disgrace to be a member of a local authority.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister had good intentions but as other speakers said we have heard ritualistic reform proposals from successive governments.  As councillors we have lost public respect.  Whether Deputy Gilmore likes it, I do not like a pothole outside my door and sometimes there are myriads of them.  What about all those other people who have myriads of potholes and flooded ditches during the year?  Local authorities are run down and are in an absolute shambles.  There would have been full realisation of the degree of shambles if the elections were held this year.  The Minister must have the heart of a western man and must still have the ambition to reform local government but, despite all the pious platitudes and beautiful speeches here today when everybody was sincere and wanted local authority this and local authority that, he still has to go back to the Department of Finance and ask the reason for this or that.  I am a little puzzled as to where we stand with these committees and commissions.  I would like the Minister when winding up to explain this independent commission or committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not understand that at all.  In reforming local government in this sprint, as it were, and as he has been directed to do by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Energy, the Minister might have had something to say if the elections were going ahead.  The devastation of people in the last couple of years with the savage cutbacks has led even councillors to <Col N="1647" /> object.  We might ask who are the councillors who are objecting?  They are Fianna Fáil councillors and they are not particularly concerned about coalition with the Progressive Democrats, they are concerned about the lack of funds in local authorities.  When the Minister went to Athlone and met all the Fianna Fáil councillors they told him what they thought of him.</P>

      <P>The Minister then thought he would take the right road and he announced the 72p a mile allowance to keep them quiet.  With expenses increasing from 54p to 72p per mile, the councillors should be pleased.  They are badly off anyway but the increase in their expenses will not fill potholes or provide any extra sewerage facilities in my constituency this year.  It will not provide any of the local services that are needed.  It will do nothing about housing.  I am not going to go into that aspect.  If the elections were to be held this year the Minister's colleagues would be decimated. Unless the situation improves it will be very difficult to get people to go forward for election next year or the year after.  I will read from the Clare County Council agenda for yesterday.  This is a motion put down by the Chairman of the Fianna Fáil Clare County Council.  I must call them that because they are dominated by Fianna Fáil and have a Fianna Fáil Chairman, Councillor Tony Killeen, and a fine chairman he is.  The motion was that the council consider the implications for its functions and responsibilities of the very disappointing allocation for storm repair, the State's failure to honour its obligation for rates on State property and the £300,000 loss to the housing capital programme, and take appropriate action. That chairman is saying down along the line that if the Fianna Fáil councillors wish to disband their county council they are going to do so in order to show this <Col N="1648" /> Minister and Government that what they have done to local authority and local government will at least finish membership and participation by their own party members.</P>
      <P>We were talking about Fingal a few minutes ago.  When it comes to Dublin County Council Deputy Lawlor will not be heard very much either.  In fact he is seeking to have the Minister meet a deputation to discuss the tolls imposed recently on the new road, when Dublin County Council were ignored. That is another reflection on the council membership.  The Minister took that action because, when his colleagues in Kildare County Council were faced with the prospect of having to toll the road from Naas to Newbridge, they funked it. The Minister was not going to have the same ignominy trotted out to him at Dublin County Council.  Why should he? No, he decided to make an order to toll the road for Dublin County Council and maybe if they write a nice letter to the Taoiseach he might see those boys afterwards.</P>

They were down in Tramore celebrating one of the last meetings of the combined health authorities or whatever they call themselves before the demise of the health boards.  However, that is getting away from the local elections.</P>
      <P>Former Governments and the Minister himself historically should have looked at this area.  In 1961 we had local authority elections but then there were two postponements to 1967.  This is in modern times.  From 1967 there was a postponement to 1974.  Fianna Fáil did it and Fine Gael did it, too.  From 1974 to 1979 the former Taoiseach Jack Lynch was in office when at least there were elections in 1979.  He was thrown out afterwards but at least he was honest enough and held the election.  In 1985, after six years, we held local elections again.  When I was given the opportunity at my party meeting I voted for holding the 1984 election. I am sorry to this day that we did not hold it then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main arguments in local authorities is about funding.  The principal means of funding was implemented by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Dick Spring, who brought in local charges.  Now we have inequity where the capital city pays no charges and all the rest of us pay them.  In the Minister's constituency there is 90 per cent payment of charges.  Yet the Minister is asking Mayo people to subsidise the people of Dublin by allowing them not to pay <Col N="1650" /> charges.  If we argued out the financing of local government we would have to see at least that water charges as a progressive tax and that the people of Dublin are as entitled to pay them as are the people of Mayo or Clare, or else let us do away with them altogether.  The Minister has a choice but he is Tadhg an dá thaobh. The Dublin crowd are lovely.  If the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, were to hear that the Minister was to introduce water charges for Dublin it would be a sorry day for the Minister.  He would be gone.</P>

      <P>Deputies Dempsey and Harney talk about financial reform and what they are going to do in the great new era for local government.  Just look at what is happening in the UK. Mrs. Thatcher brought in a poll tax and everybody celebrated her political demise.  Even Mrs. Thatcher in all her might and glory could not deliver a system of financing local authorities. Who is going to suggest that there are geniuses on the other side of the House in that Fianna Fáil-PD Coalition who will be able to introduce a proper property tax to finance local authorties?  They will, like hell; they will run before it and everybody knows that.  The last chance the Minister had to make his mark in regard to local government reform was lost the day he tabled the motion before us.  I am sorry he was forced to adopt that position.  I regret that the Fianna Fáil councillors in County Clare saw fit to press hard to organise what they called the Fianna Fáil Councillors Association in an effort to postpone local government elections. The Minister has made a bad mistake. Fine Gael, when they postponed the local government elections, found how bad their mistake was to their cost.  They paid for that decision and Fianna Fáil and the <Col N="1651" /> Progressive Democrats will pay for their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and, time permitting, I should like permission to share my time with my colleague, Deputy John Browne.  I endorse Deputy Shatter's amendment which was forcefully supported by Deputy Carey. We are critical of the Government for not proceeding with the local government elections in tandem with the Presidential election.  In my view that would have made economic, and possibly political, sense.  A decision was reached before last June to hold two elections but neither of them worked out in accordance with the political designs of the sponsors.  It is my belief that the guise of postponing the local elections in order to bring about reform will be seen for what it is, a device to escape the wrath of the electorate.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the potholes in County Mayo may not be on the same scale as the dipping tubs around the Border in County Cavan but there has been a considerable reduction in the standard of county roads in our county.  It has been noted that the level of grant made available in 1982, when County Mayo on average benefited to the tune of more than £6 million for national primary roads, has been considerably reduced. Last year we received £1.2 million for the construction of a by-pass of the Minister's own town, Castlebar.  That is the total of aid given to a county like Mayo which is badly in need of additional national primary roadways to bring our level of infrastructure to that of the east of the country and on a par with other regions in the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that when the Minister was appointed in 1983 we were building in County Mayo more than 200 houses per annum but this year, thanks to the Minister, we have received sanction for the erection of 31 houses.  Major water schemes, such as the Lough Mask water scheme, have virtually ground to a halt <Col N="1652" /> as have the sanitary services schemes in the county.  The Minister abolished the house improvement grant scheme.  One would have thought it should have been possible to retain some of the elements of the essential repairs grant scheme and the disabled persons reconstruction scheme.  The conditions and strictures applying to house grant schemes are so stringent that by the time approval is granted the applicant has passed on to a better life.</P>
    <P>We consider this order to be a device to escape the wrath of the electorate.  The members of the special subcommittee established by the Cabinet may appear to have all the qualifications to consider what is required to bring democracy to local authority level but one must have reservations about the terms of reference of that body.  Those terms of reference state that the aim is to devolve additional functions to local authorities.  The use of the word &ldquo;functions&rdquo; sounds a cautionary note.  There was no mention of powers. We were told that those additional functions would be devolved &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;. That phrase is another cute bureaucratic ploy.  It means the additional functions will be devolved where the Minister and the civil servants deem fit.</P>
    <P>Local authorities cannot be reformed unless we look at the whole question of financing them.  We must take the reforms and financial considerations together.  It does not make sense to carry out reforms without taking into consideration how we will pay for them.  The Minister told us there will be a radical change but he warned that will not happen overnight.  There seems to be some grim foreboding there.  The Minister seems to be introducing a note of lethargy in relation to the true intent behind this move.  The main thing is that the Government are shying away from the evil day of having to decide how to pay for the changes.</P>
    <P>The big banana skin that nobody will face is, what system of financing should <Col N="1653" /> be introduced to pay for the changes, if they are introduced.  Nobody will face that thorny problem.  Fine Gael were prepared to participate in a body that would consider local authority reform.  Parliamentarians are the people who should be involved in considering such reforms but a parliamentary committee should be established to consider the whole question of taxation.  As Deputy Howlin said, we sought a consensus on this issue because this matter should be above politics. It should be taken out of the whole sphere of politics and the only way we can do that is by way of setting up a committee to consider the question of taxation reform.  Only then will we be able to bring about the necessary structural reforms.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the rot started in 1978 when Fianna Fáil made one mad last grasp for power.  The infamous manifesto was introduced in that year.  In 1976, 40 per cent of the finance of local authorities came from central funds and the remaining 60 per cent was raised locally but in 1979, 65 per cent came from central funds and 35 per cent was raised locally.  Hence the crisis that we are asked to deal with today.  We are given a cake and told to slice it with a large knife in &ldquo;X&rdquo; number of directions.  It has become impossible for county managers and the members of local authorities to discharge their duties because of that.  They do not have any power.  We are talking about dead, empty shells and administrative structures which are basically discharging the orders of the Minister.  Every water and sewerage scheme must be submitted to the Custom House for approval.  Those schemes, no matter how small, must make their long laborious way from Mullingar to the Minister's Department for approval.  Every housing scheme must be placed on the Minister's desk before the nod of assent is given.  Is it any wonder that local authority members show very little interest in seeking re-election?</P>
    <P>Local authorities over the years have been stripped of so much power that they <Col N="1654" /> are almost totally controlled by officials. Councils are often maligned for what some consider to be an over-use of section 4 but in my view the use of that section is an indication of frustration by local authority members.  It is one of the few weapons they have left.  Indeed, it is worth recalling that, when the members of Meath County Council adopted a section 4 motion to resist the erection of the Radio Tara mast, the county manager overruled them.  There is no need to provide local authorities with independent financial allocations or finance-raising powers if they are not given meaningful powers.  We have the most centralised form of local government in the EC.  At a time when people are breaking away from a Stalinist centralised system in eastern Europe, this country clings manfully to it.</P>
    <P>The basic thesis of democracy in Europe is that power devolves from the grassroots up and that is how democracy should operate.  Only powers that cannot be handled at local level should be given to central Government but the core principle here seems to be that everything radiates from the centre out.  We pay lip-service to decentralisation by moving a few hundred civil servants to Ballina, to the Department of Social Welfare office in Sligo or to the Department of Agriculture and Food in Cavan but we have not had any meaningful decentralisation. At the end of the day &mdash; I hope I am proved wrong &mdash; the body set up by the Minister will not discharge the remit given to them.</P>
    <P>In France, in every village and local authority area, the local mayor is given real power.  There is a sense of belonging, a sense of community and responsibility as a result of the power sharing at local level.  Unfortunately, that is not the case here.  The body which the Minister intends to set up will not meet the demands placed on it.  The last day of their deliberations will be worse than the first because, as a result of the <Col N="1655" /> parsimonious allocation to local authorities, the potholes will be bigger, there will be fewer houses, the problems will be greater and there will be less local democracy.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tá mé an-bhuíoch den Teachta Higgins gur thug sé an seans dom labhairt ar an mBille seo.  Democracy should be defended at all costs; indeed it should never be abused.  If our Constitution gives a choice to the people to elect councillors every five years the Government should not decide to play God and tinker with it.  Perhaps, under the Constitution, they are entitled to extend the period in which elections are held but it makes a mockery of county councils and is wrong from the point of view of people who may be very dissatisfied with their elected councillors whom they consider to be wolves in sheep's clothing.  Anybody who had the misfortune of going through the last local elections will clearly remember the kind of playacting that went on in regard to local charges.  Candidates promised that they would do away with local charges if they were elected and used loud-speakers to get their message across.  Having been duly elected, not alone did they vote for local charges but they voted to increase them on two or three occasions since. Some of these irresponsible people hold high positions in county councils and it is time that they faced the firing squad &mdash; I am speaking metaphorically &mdash; and let the people decide.  It is time that they answered for their irresponsible actions in the past.</P>
      <P>These people should not be allowed to continue the charade that they are genuinely concerned for the welfare of their constituents.  It is a sham and should not be tolerated.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Real changes are needed and Dublin is a good example of special need which <Col N="1658" /> has been recognised in the various contributions from the Minister so far.  There are one million people in the city, and a very fragmented system of local government is operating, although it is an improvement on what was there before. Deputy Gilmore referred to the committee system which was supposed to be a local authority system within Dublin County Council, now the second biggest elected assembly in the State, its membership exceeding that of the Seanad.  The structure proposed by the outgoing Government would have cost well in excess of £6 million, if not £12 million in overheads&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;another trebling of the bureaucratic costings of local government. I fail to see how my constituents would benefit from another £12 million on staff and other overhead costs.  The Minister was quite right in contending that that proposed reform would not have been effective or have improved local democracy in Dublin city or county.</P>
      <P>Alongside the need for reform I would suggest that the Minister consider undertaking some cost/benefit analysis of the reform being considered by the Cabinet sub-committee and independent group. Like myself, Deputies Shatter and Gilmore are members of a local authority representing over 500,000 people.  There have been substantial staff reductions in that local authority.  Yet, the services and facilities being provided are as good if not better than ever.  There is a shortage of funds for capital works.  There has certainly been no falling off in the services provided in our public parks, by way of refuse collection, public lighting, water and sanitary services; all of those services are being effectively provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever shortcomings there may be they are on the capital side. <Col N="1659" /> I pointed out to the manager of Dublin County Council that probably we forego some millions of pounds annually because we do not impose a local charge. Now that the Minister for Finance is initiating real tax reform, hopefully by the end of this Government's term in office PAYE earners in County Dublin will have been given well deserved relief from their heavy burden of taxation.  If there is a specific spending programme initiated by members of local authorities, then the moneys raised by the imposition of such charges can be spent on their local communities. It would also mean that local TDs could seek a mandate to impose such charges.  There is no point in our collecting funds for central bureaucratic overheads.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that in rural areas over many years local charges were an accepted method of raising funds but charges were not acceptable in Dublin. Therefore, there was great hostility to the imposition of such charges at a time, particularly in my constituency, when unemployment and other conditions militated against such imposition. Indeed, Deputy Gilmore and his colleagues on the ground made great political play of the fact that we might have to consider imposing such local charges. I was proud of the role Dublin county councillors played in ensuring that the people of County Dublin did not have to carry that charge on top of their already burdensome taxation load.  We refused to impose that charge.  We re-wrote the estimates and the manager had to accept that democratic decision.  Indeed Deputy Gilmore's party supported that decision and were pleased to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of areas of massive development and growth in County Dublin which receive regular mention; people are puzzled by the lack of decisions in reviewing our efforts and plans to accommodate their substantial population and some areas are in need of urgent reform.  In my constitutency, Dublin Corporation are maintaining <Col N="1660" /> houses, collecting rents, owning a substantial land bank on which are accommodated itinerants' horses, rubbish and much other material the cause of grave irritation to local residents, in particular former inner city dwellers housed in the county as part of an urgent housing programme supported by all sides of this House over the past 20 years.  We are dealing now with much duplication of local government administration, of management and so on which needs to be eliminated urgently.  It would be my hope that the proposed local government reform will deal adequately with those issues.</P>
    <P>I urge all parties in and outside this House to advance pragmatic, comprehensive proposals for reform of local government.  We will have to defend the decisions of our colleagues in Cabinet on the adequacy of such reform.  If it does take another year to do so, so be it. Various parties have deferred local elections. Hopefully we will have deferred such local elections, not as Deputy Gilmore said that each time local elections are due local government reform becomes the topic of the day and is advanced as the reason for their postponement, but in the interests of implementing real reform.  Let us ensure that the team of experts appointed are used to their full potential so that real reform is put before the House.  Even if, as the Minister said in the course of his remarks, all of that reform cannot be embodied in legislation, if the proper path is charted then we will have done the people a good service in postponing these local elections for one year.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister would like to hear all of our views before <Col N="1661" /> replying.  In commenting here we should be honest.  I do not know of any member of any party who would not like to have elections postponed; that is a fact of life. That being said, in presenting our personal views we may not always represent the views of the electorate or of aspiring members of local authorities.  For that reason it would be important that the Minister would avail of the earliest opportunity to hold such elections.</P>
      <P>Like some of his predecessors he has decided to postpone the local elections and has given the same reason, that is in order to reform local government.  Bearing in mind the deadline specified by the Minister for the report of the special subcommittee, I do not believe effective reform will be possible particularly with regard to funding of local authorities. This is the kernel of the problem.  It would take much political courage on the part of any Government to devise a system of local authority funding that would have the respect and support of all parties at local government level.  I do not believe the present Minister has such political courage.  Certainly he did not display such courage in the past when presented with golden opportunities.  There have been continuous cutbacks and restrictions of local authority funding since I was elected in 1977, perhaps even before the Minister himself was elected to a local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;since when our powers and finances have dwindled steadily.  For example, the funding of health services has been removed from us especially at community care level.  It is my belief that no other structure could satisfactorily replace the local authority structure in that respect.  Also, other powers vested in us originally under the provisions of the local authorities Acts have been removed.  I appeal to the Minister not to remove our remaining powers because, if he does, he will have to face the wrath of <Col N="1662" /> every councillor, of whatever party.  I must stress that, as members of local authorities, we will use those powers prudently provided we are allocated the necessary finance.  Any local authority represented by TDs in whatever part of the country will bear witness to the fact that its members have always acted responsibly provided they had the necessary finances allocated to them.</P>
      <P>In this respect I am enormously pleased with the performance of my party because at one time we were building up to 7,000 houses annually which figure is now down to a matter of hundreds although the same need remains.  I warn the Minister not to allow himself be fooled by the present Minister for Energy &mdash; who decided he would abolish local authorities at urban district level &mdash; into allowing that to happen.  The Minister for Energy, who was then the Minister in charge of local government, suggested that the local authorities should be abolished. I appeal to the Minister for the Environment tonight not to let this happen, as one gets closest to the electorate at urban district council level.  The Minister should respond favourably to demands for an extension of boundaries. To his credit, this occurred in Clonmel and I hope it will also happen in Cashel and other areas.  It is only when we give the people more power that we will see results.  Perhaps the Minister has the courage to do this but I have my doubts. This motion would allow the Minister to postpone the elections for one year but I will not be surprised if the Minister looks for another deferral as he has given the committee far too much to do within a short period.  What conclusions can they come to by September?  In my opinion they will not be able to decide on anything.</P>

      <P>The Government are making a grave political mistake in postponing the local elections.  The fact is that, from the point of view of Fianna Fail, they would do far better if the local elections were held this year than they <Col N="1663" /> would if they are postponed until next year.  For any Government, self-preservation is probably the first law. In this case Fianna Fáil are making a serious mistake which is going to work to the disadvantage of the Minister.  I regret this as I have great personal feelings for the man in question.</P>
      <P>It is also fair to say that the reform of local government is linked with major tax reform.  The Government have to choose between a local system of rates, income tax, purchase tax or something along the lines of the poll tax being introduced in Britain, or a mixture of all four.  Any decision in this area is inherently politically dangerous.  For a Government to postpone such a decision until the latter part of their term of office is inherently foolish.  If a Government want to engage in local government reform the time to do so is the first six months of their electoral mandate.  To do so in the second half of their mandate, as the Government clearly intend doing, is to behave in a politically foolish fashion which is not something I would normally ascribe to the Minister, but evidently he is prepared to allow himself to be forced into this. Why he is being forced to seek this postponement is beyond me but it is an act of folly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the country, apart from the interests of the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party, we are making a mistake here tonight.  There is a need to reform local government but the only time a Government should reform local government is during their first year in office.  The Government are in their first year of office and they should be doing this and not postponing the elections so that they can talk about doing it.  As we know, the Government have been in office for eight or nine months and it was well within their capacity to have come to conclusions on local government reform within that period if they had wanted to. As Deputy Shatter has pointed out, more eloquently than I ever could, the Fianna <Col N="1664" /> Fáil component of Government sketched out, in considerable detail in their local elections manifesto and in their general election manifesto of 1987, a scheme for the reorganisation of local authorities.</P>

      <P>There was not one decent contribution or word about reform. <Col N="1665" /> There was the occasional throw-away remark along with the usual demands one expects to be made in a debate on the Estimates for more money for local authorities as well as the usual bleating about their support for local authorities.  There were also references to everything except, of course, the subject matter we were supposed to be discussing.</P>
      <P>It is well worth putting on the record that on six occasions in the past parties other than Fianna Fáil postponed local elections.  The two most recent postponements were sought by Fine Gael and Labour in 1973 and 1984.  The practice was started in 1923 by Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>

      <P>It is well worth remarking on those postponements of 1973 and 1984 which were sought by Fine Gael and Labour Coalitions and which amounted to their efforts at local government reform.  It is very hard to see how one could take the Opposition seriously on this matter given those postponements. The last Fine Gael and Labour Coalition Government decided in 1984 that they were not going to allow the local elections to take place because they wanted to carry out a review of the organisation of local government.  They published at that time a glossy policy statement entitled the <i>Reform of Local Government.</i> Fine Gael subsequently promised that there would be major structural and functional reforms and recommended the setting up of statutory boundary commissions to review urban boundaries and a new type of authority to replace town commissioners.</P>

That was the statement issued in 1984 by Fine Gael but, of course, none of the commitments was implemented. In fact the proposals contained in the policy statement never saw the light of day.  This then is the record of the main Opposition party on the reorganisation of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They went on to suggest that there should be three new county councils and two district councils in each new county along with six in the city, making a total of 12.  A metropolitan council and a coordinating body for the three new councils in the city were proposed, a grand total of 16 new authorities.  Those are Fine Gael figures.  What was done? Nothing, except to increase the membership from 36 to 78 and what followed might best be described as an exercise in illusion by Fine Gael.  The three counties <Col N="1667" /> of Belgard, Fingal &mdash; which Deputy Gilmore is not aware of &mdash; and Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown were conjured up for the local elections, for that purpose only, having had a shadowy existence as electoral counties, something never heard of in Irish legislation until then.  If there was ever a more half baked scheme for electing people from counties which never existed and still do not, that was it.</P>

      <P>The spiral of debt and deficits that existed in local authorities in <Col N="1672" /> 1987 does not exist now.  This is why it is now possible to consider reform, and certainly the preferred choice was to have every party in the House participating. That was the offer that was made.</P>

      <P>One does not wish to be critical of Deputy Bruton because I know him well, but this can be said.  Deputy Bruton came into this House over a number of years and asked for reform of this House as well as local authority reform.  He asked that committees would play a substantial role in that reform. We genuinely expected that the offer being made for that party to participate in that select committee would have been taken on board and it is a great disappointment that it was not.  Now that that has been thrown aside Fine Gael think they are at liberty to sling mud around and to make all kinds of protestations about their interest.</P>

      <P>We are well used to that treatment from that side of the House. However, I must say that we are determined to carry on with or without the support of the Fine Gael Party.  We will be bringing forward the reform package, putting it to the House, and it will be for the Oireachtas to decide whether it is in the best interests of the country.</P>
