      <asker>Mr. Spring</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the reason he was accompanied to the recent CSCE meeting in Paris by representatives of the social partners.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The French Government, who hosted the Summit, made specific provision for Heads of State or Government to be accompanied by representatives of important interests and sectors in their societies.  It was against this background, and the wider implications to the work of the Summit, which also covered economic and social considerations, that I issued my invitation to the representatives of the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, can the Taoiseach say whether he had discussions with the persons who accompanied him to the CSCE meeting beforehand in relation to all aspects of the agenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not fully but we carried on a running dialogue throughout <Col N="762" /> the course of the meeting which, after all, went on for three days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach select the people who travelled with him or did the various representative groups nominate their representatives?  Is the Taoiseach now telling the House that no discussions took place with the representatives of the social partners in relation to issues such as European security or defence, or other topics related to those matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not discuss those matters in advance with the social partners.  I saw the participation of the social partners as more specifically directed to the economic and social aspects of the conference which did represent a fairly considerable proportion of the work of the Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that significant progress on economic and social matters was made at the Summit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think so.  Of course, a lot of preliminary work had been done at the Bonn conference in the economic area and at the Copenhagen meeting on human rights aspects.  I think the general view would be that the Summit in Paris did take the whole process further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach tell the House what specific role was played by the people he brought with him to the Summit?  For example, were they consulted by him in relation to aspects of the negotiations that were taking place, or did they participate in any other way in the three days' events?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They participated as observers.  All participating countries were encouraged to broaden their delegations in view of the importance of the Summit and the range of matters which were up for discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Qid>2</Qid>
      <asker>Mr. J. Bruton</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any plans to meet the new British Prime Minister, John Major, MP; and if he will outline the subjects he proposes to discuss with him.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Plans for any such meeting would be announced, in accordance with established practice, simultaneously in Dublin and London close to the time of the meeting.  In my message of congratulations to the new British Prime Minister I indicated that I looked forward in particular to meeting him at the European Council in Rome later this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it would be desirable that there be a special meeting between himself and the new British Prime Minister with a view to ensuring that the Prime Minister uses his powers to give renewed emphasis to the Brooke talks, particularly in view of the commitment in Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to agreement on a procedure for devolution <Col N="764" /> of authority to an administration within Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it would be desirable that I should have a meeting with the new British Premier as soon as possible.  I am sure we will be able to meet in Rome. But I am sure the Deputy will also appreciate that the new Prime Minister coming into office, in the circumstances in which he did, will have many pressures on him at this stage.  Therefore, I would not particularly press for an urgent meeting with him but I would hope that a major meeting can be arranged before too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I recollect that the Taoiseach had an aversion to anybody who had &ldquo;major&rdquo; in their name recently but realise he was referring to a body in this country at that time.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that, in view of the persistent suggestions that the current Brooke talks are in difficulty, there is a need for him to take a special initiative with a view to having these talks proceed more rapidly, and that an initiative from him to seek a special meeting with the British Prime Minister would underline his Government's commitment and that of all the parties in this House to making a success of the current round of Brooke talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not seriously think that is necessary at this stage.  The Secretary of State, Mr. Peter Brooke, has been left in charge by the British Prime Minister.  That represents a little more confidence in the Secretary of State and in the initiative which he is conducting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I bring in Deputy Garland?  He has been offering for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>To use the expression Deputy Bruton used, a special initiative is now needed, will the Taoiseach ask Mr. Major when he sees him in Rome if anything can be done to have the Birmingham Six released before Christmas? <Col N="765" /> Will he consider that as very high in his priorities when he sees Mr. Major?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is really no need to do that.  Our position in regard to the Birmingham Six is constantly reiterated to the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press the Taoiseach unduly on this, but can I ask him to agree that if there is any indication that the Brooke talks are about to break down or run into the sand, he will revise his view in the light of that and seek a special meeting with the British Prime Minister with a view to doing everything in his power to make a success of these talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We already are doing everything in our power to make a success of the talks and we will continue to do so.  As I have said, we are being very flexible and progressive in our approach. I did not really say to the House that there is any ground for belief that there is imminent danger of breakdown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  3, 4, 5 agus 6 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Aithníonn an Rialtas go bhfuil tionchar mór ag an teilifís ar shaol an lae inniu agus go bhféadfadh an-tionchar a bheith ag seirbhís oiriúnach lán-Ghaeilge ar athbheochan agus caomhnú na Gaeilge laistigh agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá na moltaí go léir atá déanta faoin ábhar á scrúdú go fóill agus déanfar cinneadh críochnaitheach, a chuirfidh na riachtainais go léir san áireamh, a luaithe is féidir.</P>
      <P>Níl aon bhunús leis na scéalta atá foilsithe le déanaí a thugann le fios go bhfuil coiste nua bunaithe.</P>
      <P>Fuair an Taoiseach dhá iarratas ón bhFeachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse (litir dar dáta 2 Aibreán 1990 agus litir chiorclach (gan dáta) a fuarthas i mí Iúil 1990) ag lorg cruinnithe chun an cheist a phlé ach ní raibh ar a chumas bualadh le toscaireacht ón bhfeachtas.  Fuair mé féin trí iarratas ar chruinnithe (6 Meitheamh 1990, an litir chiorclach a luaigh mé thuas agus 7 Meán Fómhair 1990) agus cuireadh admhálacha ar gach ceann acu.  Os rud é go bhfuil na moltaí go léir atá déanta faoin ábhar, ar a n-áirítear cur-faoibhráid cuimsitheach ón bhFeachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse, á scrúdú go fóill, ní dóigh liom gur gá bualadh leo go foirmiúil ag an bpointe seo chun na tuairimí agus moltaí atá sonraithe acu go soiléir i scríbhinn a fháil athuair ó bhéal.</P>
      <P>Bhuail mé go neamhfhoirmiúil ó thráth go céile le daoine a bhfuil baint acu leis an bhfeachtas agus tuigim a ndearcadh faoin ábhar seo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil an cheist scríofa i mBéarla os rud é gur chuir mé, i dtús báire, faoi bhráid an Aire Cumarsáide é agus gur aistríodh ón Aire sin é.  Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire Stáit.  Cé go ndeireann sé nach bhfuil coiste bunaithe, an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas coiste a bhunú amach anseo, agus, go háirithe, an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas saghas Údarás Teilifíse Gaeilge a chur ar bun. An dara ceist a ba mhaith liom a chur ar an Aire Stáit ná an bhfuil sé beartaithe ag an Rialtas seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil ar Network 2 chun dhá uair a chloig d'ábhar i nGaeilge a sholáthar.  An é sin an rud atá ar intinn ag an Rialtas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar an chéad cheist, maidir leis an choiste, níl sé ar intinn againn i láthair na huaire coiste a bhunú. Maidir le hÚdarás, is ceist é sin nach féidir freagra a thabhairt air go fóill, mar braitheann sé ar an chineál seirbhíse, agus an gá reachtaíocht a chur tríd an Dáil.  Más gá ceann a bhunú, beidh muid sásta é sin a dhéanamh.  Maidir leis an cheist faoi Network 2, braitheann sé sin ar an chinneadh a ghlacfaidh an Rialtas. Tá roghanna éagsúla ann, ach braitheann siad ar an chinneadh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé cinnte go raibh an tAire Stáit ag labhairt ar son Aire na Gaeltachta féin nuair a dúirt sé nach bhfuil aon choiste curtha ar bun, nó le bunú maidir le tuarascáil a chur ar fáil faoi theilifís na Gaeltachta.  Dhá cheist a ba mhaith liom a chur ar an Aire Stáit. Uimhir a haon, cén uair atá sé ag súil go mbeidh beart cinnte á dhéanamh maidir le seirbhís teilifíse Gaeltachta.  Bhí sé seo geallta dúinn roimh an samhradh, taréis an tsamhraidh, roimh an Nollag &mdash; cén uair a bheidh sé ag teacht?  An mbeidh sé ann an bhliain seo chugainn?  Dúirt an tAire Stáit é féin in agallamh ar Raidió na Gaeltachta go bhfuil roghanna áirithe ag an Rialtas.  An bhféadfadh sé forbairt a dhéanamh air sin?  Cad iad na roghanna atá á mbeartú?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Mar a dúirt mé, níl sé ar intinn againn coiste a bhunú i láthair <Col N="768" /> na huaire.  Maidir leis an dara ceist, go luath san athbhliain.  Ó thaobh na roghanna éagsúla de, tá a fhios againn go léir na roghanna éagsúla atá ann: uimhir a haon, an <i>status quo</i> bheith ann agus gan rud ar bith a dhéanamh; uimhir a dó, úsáid a bhaint as na cainéil atá ansin faoi láthair agus, ar ndóigh, teilifís na Gaeltachta é féin.  Sin na roghanna éagsúla go ginearálta, ach ní féidir liom níos mó ná sin a rá ag an bpointe seo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>An bhfuil sé intuigthe as an fhreagra atá tugtha ag an Aire Stáit nach bhfuil aon bharúil fós ag an Rialtas i bhfábhar theilifís Ghaeilge nó teilifís na Gaeltachta?  Ag dul ar aghaidh ó sin, an bhfuil dáta dearfa socraithe chun cruinniú a bheith ag an Roinn leis an bhFeachtas Náisiúnta Teilifíse, a chuir litreacha chuig an Taoiseach agus chuig an Aire Stáit? An cheist deiridh, an bhfuil suim airgid áirithe sna Meastacháin chun an rogha a nglacfar leis a chur i gcrích?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Mar gheall ar an chéad cheist, mar a dúirt mé sa fhreagra, ní dóigh liom gur gá bualadh leo ag an bpointe seo.  Más gá, beidh mé breáshásta sin a dhéanamh.  Mar is eol don Teachta bhuail mé le go leor de na comhaltaí éagsúla atá ar choiste an fheachtais náisiúnta, agus tá a fhios agam an dearcadh atá acu.  Maidir leis an cheist faoin tsuim airgid, is dóigh liom gur ceist é sin don Aire Cumarsáide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>San agallamh a rinne an tAire Stáit ar Raidió na Gaeltachta ar 12 Deireadh Fómhair i mbliana, dúirt sé, i measc a lán nithe suimiúla eile, nach raibh deis aige na tuairimí éagsúla agus na roghanna éagsúla a phlé leis an Taoiseach, Aire na Gaeltachta, os rud é go raibh go leor fadhbanna práinneacha ag an Taoiseach.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Bím ag plé na gceisteanna seo go minic leis an Taoiseach.  Fiú amháin ar maidin, cé go raibh sé faoi bhrú, bhí am ag an Taoiseach casadh liom chun an cheist seo a phlé.  Bíonn <Col N="769" /> cruinnithe rialta againn agus ba mhaith liom a rá go ginearálta go bhfuil sé mar pholasaí againn seirbhís a chur ar fáil, ní amháin don Ghaeltacht, ach freisin do phobal na Gaeilge go léir.  Mar a dúirt mé leis an Teachta McGinley, tá sé ar intinn againn cinneadh a ghlacadh go luath san athbhliain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Os rud é go bhfuil sé andeacair freagra cruinn a tharraingt ón Aire Stáit, nach bhfuil sé fíor nach mbeidh an Rialtas ag cur teilifís na Gaeltachta ar bun ar chor ar bith, agus gurb é atá i gceist ag an Rialtas anois ná seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a chur ar bun trí RTÉ.  Anois, an mbeidh Bille le tabhairt isteach aige sa Dáil faoi sin, agus cén uair a bheidh muid in ann an Bille sin a fheiceáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in late 1989 to invite proposals from major consortia for the design, financing, construction and operation of the National Indoor Sports Centre.  The necessary planning stages are being undertaken by the Custom House Docks Development Authority, who are my Department's development agent for the project.  It is now expected that construction work will commence during 1991-92.</P>
      <P>The Custom House Docks Development Authority have either acquired or agreed terms for approximately 65 per cent of the interests in the site and negotiations are ongoing for the acquisition of the remainder of the site.  A total of £248,000 has been paid to date to consultants employed on the project.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to indicate the amount of money spent to date on land acquisitions in view of the need for confidentiality in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  Is there any foundation in the report in the <i>Irish Press</i> today that the Government will shelve the idea of the indoor stadium?  I would like to know also why the owner of the remainder of the land was not approached regarding the sale of that land, especially over the <Col N="772" /> past three months, despite the speculation. Is there any urgency about acquiring the extra land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to assure the Deputy that there is no foundation in any press report which suggests that the national stadium is not proceeding. Today I will be issuing the second stage brief to the four selected consortia and this will mark the most exciting step forward in Irish sport.  Through a joint venture between the State and the private sector we will have one of the finest indoor stadia in Europe.  It is interesting to note that the four consortia are made up of the top four companies in the world involved in facility provision including the top German, British, French and American companies in a joint venture with Irish companies.  It is also significant that in addition to the £35 million which the Government have approved we anticipate that as much as £25 million and perhaps even more will be provided by the private sector as a contribution towards the development of the stadium.</P>
      <P>The stadium will be managed by one of the top facility management companies in the world.  It is interesting to note that the four recognised top facility management companies in the world are bidding to manage the Irish indoor national stadium. When one considers the experience in other countries in regard to the provision of stadia, we are very lucky that the Irish taxpayer is getting most unbelievable value for money in getting a facility valued probably at £60 million or more for a mere £3 million per year index linked up to a total value of £35 million.  I want to quash completely the suggestions that are being made.  Because there are continuing suggestions, it is only right, that I should point to the determination of the Minister for Education and the Taoiseach, both sporting people, to ensure adherence to the need for cost effectiveness in public expenditure in regard to this project, while being so supportive of such a significant development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the land acquisition, approaches were made to the landowners <Col N="773" /> in question and every effort is being made to acquire the necessary land by agreement. Even though we had a compulsory purchase order approved, I am still anxious to reach agreement in this respect.  If we do not, a judicial review by the High Court of the compulsory purchase order is expected to be held in early 1991 and a judgment given. Assuming there is no appeal to the Supreme Court, the Custom House Docks Authority can take possession of the site at that stage.  If it is appealed to the Supreme Court a judgment would be expected by about June 1991 in which case we would then take possession of the site.</P>

If that is not possible, we are determined to acquire the land through compulsory purchase order.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the difficulties being created in ordinary primary schools as a result of her integration policy which has resulted in many schools attempting to cope with pupils who have serious disabilities without any additional resources being made available to the school; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of the education provision for children with disabilities, including the implications of integration and resource needs, has been <Col N="774" /> considered by the Primary Education Review Body.  The report of this body will be available to me in the very near future.  At that stage I will consider the various recommendations made.  I should mention that in 1984 and 1987, and more recently during the Irish Presidency of the European Community, Education Ministers adopted conclusions and a resolution in favour of the integration of children with disabilities into the ordinary academic system in all appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>Of course there are two sets of needs and two schools of thought on the whole integration process.  There are those for whom, sadly, there will always be a need for special schools and classes, either on their own or in primary schools.  Their disadvantage is so severe that those are the best arrangements.  More and more there are other needs to be met, the needs of those whose parents feel, and indeed assessments prove, could benefit by being in a special class in a primary school or in classes where they are integrated for some of the curriculum such as arts and crafts or physical education and receive special tuition in other subjects on the curriculum.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of debate it is as well for us to recognise that there are two schools of thought on the matter.  There are those who will always need special care and that is sad but the State is always committed to them.  There is also now the growing realisation that children with slight, disadvantages will benefit by the integration process.  I am glad to see Deputy Deenihan on the Front Bench and I hope that remains the position.</P>

      <P>The Minister in signing the EC document on integration I am sure was giving the Government's commitment towards the integration into our school system of children with a handicap. However, where this integration is <Col N="775" /> already taking place, the schools in question have been given no extra provisions, either financial, staffing or, indeed, medical, to adapt their schools to suit children with a handicap.  I will give one example.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has given a global example which I am not able to address.  I repeat my commitment, and that of the Government, to the provision of resources for children with learning disabilities or those who need to be in special schools or be part of the process of integration.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind &mdash; I accept he must have when he speaks with such feeling on the matter &mdash; I would be very glad if he would bring it to my attention.  I will certainly arrange to have it considered.  There is a strong need for the integration process to be resourced properly if it is to succeed. I am very aware of that and I am paying particular attention to it.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the fact that (1) mounting confusion is being experienced by teachers throughout the country with regard to assessment procedures for the new junior certificate, (2) sample papers have not yet issued, (3) almost half of the new programmes have been completed in schools and (4) a considerable amount of the confusion is as a result of the lateness of her decision on assessment, she is determined to go ahead with her proposals in 1992.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention that <Col N="776" /> assessment procedures for the junior certificate in 1992 will include a written paper and, where appropriate, examinations in oral, aural and practical skills. I further intend that the oral and practical elements of the assessment should be carried out in the schools and that the percentage of marks allocated in respect of those elements be of the order of 25 per cent.  There will, of course, be a system of monitoring these marks on a national basis to ensure a standardisation of results. It will be necessary also to provide in-service training for teachers on assessment techniques and procedures.</P>
      <P>In the light of the importance and extent of assessment in oral, aural and practical skills, the written element of the examination should not be over-emphasised. The draft written sample papers submitted by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were examined in my Department in this context. I should say, too, that I found the draft papers to be very long and detailed and I felt that they would be intimidating in some instances for students at this level.</P>
      <P>I asked the council to redraft the sample papers in view of the considerations outlined above.  My understanding is that the course committees of the council are at present undertaking this task and that the revised draft sample papers will be available early in January. I am confident that the assessment procedures which I propose for the junior certificate will be put in place for 1992 given the co-operation and goodwill of those involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we started consideration of this assessment procedure I have met many bodies to hear their points of view.  The first step was the issuing of the NCCA consultative document to many groups seeking their submissions which they furnished to me.  On the basis of them I commenced a process of consultation.  I have met with the various parents' groups, teachers' unions and management, a process which is continuing. A measure of agreement with many of the partners in the education process has been reached and further meetings have <Col N="777" /> been arranged for the next two to three weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply and the fact that she agrees with what our leader, Deputy John Bruton, said with regard to assessment. She has come around to his way of thinking. When will the in-service training courses take place?  Last May the Minister promised the TUI and the ASTI that she would allocate three days to in-service training for 1990-91 on the content and methods of teaching new programmes. She also recently promised a one day in-service course on school-based assessment.  When will these courses take place?</P>

      <P>He has been out-manoeuvred. I heard he was very cross last week, but we will leave that aside. With regard to the Deputy's question about in-service courses, the commitment given to the teachers' unions was that two to three days per academic year would be allocated to in-service training. Because the sample papers will not be available until early January, the in-service course which should have been held this term &mdash; we made massive efforts to include it in this term &mdash; would not be of any use to the teachers because they need sample question papers for the in-service training.  The training will be based on them.  We have planned definitively, and have written to the teachers' unions on the matter, that two days will be allocated to in-service training next term, one in January-February and one in March.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the quota for teachers in schools generally is currently under discussion with the social partners, in the context of ongoing negotiations for the programme for economic and social development.  Indeed, as we speak they are in consultation about these matters <Col N="781" /> and, therefore, it would be incorrect of me to pre-empt those negotiations.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that we have the highest pupil-teacher ratio in our primary and secondary schools of any country in Europe, will the Minister give this matter priority to ensure that the pupil-teacher ratio is reduced?  Will she provide the necessary resources to ensure the employment of extra staff?</P>

      <P>Let me be quite clear and explicit.  The pupil-teacher ratio came down last September, restoring it to the level at which the Government of which the Deputy's party were a partner had left it.  The talks in which we are now engaged concern bringing down the pupil-teacher ratio at primary and post-primary level.  I could not possibly give a commitment in the House regarding a matter under discussion at present between the social partners.  Of course, I have a strong commitment to improving the education service in general and I have given much thought to the question raised here by Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Deenihan.

      <P>I am aware of the situation in relation to St. Finbarr's national school, Cabra West, Dublin, 7, and have under consideration a report from my Department's professional advisers in relation to the condition of the roof and the windows.  I am considering the question of whether a capital grant for improvements could be approved under the Rules for National Schools having regard to the small enrolments at the school.  However, the situation regarding grant-aid to a building where a large number of classrooms are not required for national school purposes poses difficulties.</P>
      <P>I will communicate a decision to the school authorities at the earliest possible date and will advise the Deputy at that point as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the very gloomy and neglected exterior of the school is not conducive to attracting children to it and that this is one of the main factors which accounts for the small enrolments in the school, to which the Minister referred?  If the Minister's Department continue to neglect the school, inevitably this decrease in numbers will be accelerated. In view of that, will the Minister expedite a decision in regard to the necessary work and grant for same?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is accepted that the appearance of the school creates a difficulty in regard to school enrolments but other factors must also be taken into account.  The dilemma for the Department is that significant capital cannot be made available for a school which is only partially in use.  While we accept that significant efforts have been made by the school authorities to bring about <Col N="783" /> improvements, we are carefully examining their request at present.  The Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, has taken a very keen interest in the school and is most anxious that the Department will make progress in regard to improvements.  However, given the need for careful cost control in expenditure, there are many factors in this respect which will have to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the national school element in the building is housed on the ground floor and that the condition of the windows is worse at ground floor level than at any other?  If the Minister's difficulty is that the entire school is not used as a school, will he issue the necessary grant to do the required work on the ground floor windows, at the very least?  Does the Minister accept the very admirable contribution made by the local community in developing the remaining classrooms in the school for use as a pre-school and for very necessary youth activities, should be matched by at least a gesture from his Department?</P>

      <P>I am aware of specific concerns in relation to the ageing profile of university academic staff.  However, I <Col N="784" /> am happy that this problem is now being addressed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government decision to provide funding to the universities to facilitate a substantial increase in student intake commencing in the 1990-91 academic year. The increase in the resources of the colleges from the increased Exchequer grant and extra student fees will enable them to recruit additional academic staff.  That has already commenced.</P>
      <P>In addition, special funding is being provided for targeted developments in science and technology and this will facilitate the recruitment of further academic staff over and above those resulting from the increased intake.</P>
      <P>These developments will obviously impact positively on the age profile of academic staff in the universities.  Of course the age of the people whom the universities recruit and appoint under these measures will be their business. However, on the law of averages, when there is extra recruitment it is usually younger people who are appointed.</P>

      <P>I accept that new blood is admirable in any institution but there is also great strength in wisdom which sometimes comes with years.  I do not know the numbers of people who have come into the institutions following the initiative because we are awaiting information from the Higher Education Authority in that regard.  However, over the three years in the Government programme for increased funding, there will be a considerable number of extra staff, including the research and technology area.

    <P>At this meeting the Department gave assurances that grants would be available for the replacement or restoration where possible of old furniture.  I understand that the Deputy's question favoured the retention of the old furniture and that you assume that if this is retained children's backs will be straighter and stronger.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 254 and 294 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>per capita</i> grant to secondary schools was increased from £140 to £150 per pupil in 1990 and for primary schools from £26.50 to £28.</P>
      <P>The question of the funding of schools for certain specific purposes is also under consideration in the context of negotiations between the social partners on a new programme for economic and social development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are at present having <Col N="788" /> a study undertaken by outside consultants on unit costs at primary and post-primary levels.  The findings of this study will enable my Department to consider in depth the appropriate level of funding necessary for the day-to-day running of schools.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, apart from a school salary of £400 per teacher in secondary schools, the salaries of teachers are paid in full by my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition to those grants, other grants have been apportioned to second level &mdash; last year, this year and next year &mdash; £1 million provided for the junior certificate; there are technology grants of £5,000 per school, totalling £300,000; there is a capital grant for science equipment, the vocational preparation and training grant of £125 per pupil in secondary schools which amounts to £330,000, and the vocational schools get a grant for equipment in addition to the normal non-pay allocation.  In relation to the new leaving certificate, there is about £2 million for equipment, construction engineering and technical engineering; there are grants for choirs, orchestras, psychological testing, and teaching through Irish and there are various other grants.</P>

      <P>I have read the ASTI survey.  We have a survey under way at present.  The increase we gave was <Col N="789" /> greater than that granted in any of the four years the Deputy's party were in office.  One could never have enough money for education.  It is as simple as that.  Every penny is well spent.  We are doing our best in difficult circumstances. The matter will be addressed, and is currently being addressed, in the talks.  We are doing a unit cost study because we want to see how best to spend the money available in various areas of second level education.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 259 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 6 February 1986, on the proposal of the Government of the day, Dáil Éireann modified a finding by the public service arbitrator on a teachers' pay claim.  The effect of the modification was to provide for phasing of the payment of the finding <Col N="790" /> in accordance with the terms of the then draft proposals for a public service pay agreement.  As a result of this phasing and taking account of certain compensatory payments to teachers, the teacher unions claim that a further £75 million is due to them.</P>
    <P>The settlement terms of the dispute in 1986 acknowledged the teachers' right to pursue the matter further but also recognised the Government's position that payment of retrospection is not possible. The teachers' unions have requested a meeting with myself and the Minister for Finance to discuss this issue and we have agreed to meet them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that nothing happened since 1986, yet I recall, and the Minister will agree, that in 1987 she was saying she would enter into meaningful negotiations with the teachers' unions in relation to this £75 million.  Three years have elapsed since then and the Minister tells me she has not met the teachers' unions to specifically discuss this problem. Does she not think that three years is a long time?</P>

      <P>I am, however, involved in discussions with the main sporting organisations &mdash; the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU &mdash; on the feasibility of providing a national outdoor stadium by way of adaptation of an existing stadium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody accepts that there is a need in the country for a proper national outdoor stadium. Requirements of the international sporting bodies mean that within a few years we will have to provide for all-seat accommodation for various sports.  So far <Col N="793" /> as a timescale is concerned I am keen to progress discussions and agreement as quickly as possible but I am sure the Deputy, more than most, will be aware that delicate discussions must take place in an effort to get the three main sporting organisations to accept the principle of the need to utilise one stadium, the reason being that the construction costs of a 30,000 seater stand are of the order of £30 million plus and that, consequently, that stand must be filled on the maximum number of days each year.  We have had the initial discussions.  Proposals are under consideration and I want to assure the Deputy that the Government are committed to the provision of a modern outdoor stadium with a capacity of the order of 75,000 to 80,000 people and are committed to that provision as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>While the GAA have a rule in regard to the use of Croke Park by other organisations, our proposals to the GAA include the possibility of their examining this particular rule with a view to the designation of Croke Park as a national stadium and with a view to the improvement of Croke Park not only by the GAA but by the Government and the other sporting organisations also.  As a GAA man I should like to say to another that it is my sincere wish that the GAA would look forward in this respect and realise it would be crazy for them to expend £90 million on a very significant proposal for the development of Croke Park and then fill that stadium only on two occasions in each year.  We must have rationalisation.  The sporting organisations must look forward.  They all need money.  For us to contemplate the development of anything other than one stadium, which would be used for all the major games, which have large crowd <Col N="794" /> capacity requirements, would be very foolish expenditure and the Government are not prepared to be involved in such a process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly many proposals are being put forward in regard to green field sites and other things.  I am quite satisfied, and my advice to the Government is very strong, that there can be only one proposal which is both cost effective and sensible.  There is no point in providing another 50,000 seater stadium where we would then have three. We need one stadium catering for 80,000 people because our major problem is the difficulty of obtaining tickets for soccer internationals, rugby internationals and all-Ireland finals.  I am absolutely convinced there is only one way forward and in that respect I have made proposals to the three organisations.  Those discussions are at a delicate stage.  I hope the organisations will look forward and that they will accept that the Government are prepared to get involved provided we have rationalisation and cost effectiveness. If we get movement in this respect, and I am confident we will, we can provide a stadium in a very short time.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent survey by Patrick Clancy, <i>Who Goes to College</i>, and which was sponsored by the Higher Education Authority, indicates that the numbers entering university in both absolute terms and as a percentage of the relevant age cohort has increased in virtually all counties between 1980 and 1986.  While more up-to-date information is not available &mdash; but will be available shortly in the form of an interim report &mdash; there is every reason to believe that this trend has increased since 1986.</P>
      <P>In this context, if one looks at the relative ranking of counties by reference to rates of admission to higher education generally, i.e. including the non-university sector, there is no obvious bias in participation rates towards university or third level institution towns.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the higher education grants scheme addresses the problem of distance from college through the provision of higher rates of maintenance to those living away from home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if she is aware that my own home county of Wexford has the third worst level of participation in third level education? It is commonly perceived in Wexford that the reason for this is the absence of any third level provision within the county. Has she devised any mechanism to <Col N="796" /> counterbalance that?  I am thinking particularly of distance learning or satellite courses so that in counties of large population, such as Wexford, where there is not the capacity for a third level institution there could be a faculty or a satellite institute there, particularly now because of the development of advance communications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this proposal has been put forward not only in relation to Wexford.  I accept that Deputy Howlin is speaking in general terms while also talking about his own constituency.  Various proposals have been made to us regarding what one might call out-reach colleges, distance education and various other proposals.  Sometimes it is possible to take them on board, sometimes not. At present we have a submission from Castlebar dealing with the need for something of that nature and also from other counties.  Already in Cavan there is a further education service operated from the Athlone Regional Technical College. Edenderry has a similar type education service from another college.  Those submissions are looked at as they come in. I am aware that Deputy John Browne referred to this issue in a recent debate on vocational education committees.  If the Deputies wish to consider this further perhaps they would put forward a submission on behalf of their vocational education committee, that is, if they have not already done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure my colleagues will appreciate the plug from the Minister. Notwithstanding that, is it satisfactory for her to evaluate the submissions that arrive on her desk? Would she not consider at this stage formulating a national proposal to encompass not only County Wexford but all the counties which are disadvantaged by not having a third level facility within their county boundary?  Does the Minister agree that she has a responsibility not only to respond to submissions from various corners of the country but to actually evaluate the Clancy report and to put in place some sort of distance learning <Col N="797" /> mechanism to enable all the young adults to participate in third level education on an equal footing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>First, there cannot be a third level institution in every county &mdash; the country is far too small for that. Second, part of the excitement and the growing up process for young people being involved in third level education is that they are in a different county, they are, dare I say it, free from parental or domestic restraints of one kind or another and they are participating in the age old process of travelling to gain university education.  That has always been a feature, and remains a very attractive component, of third level education. These students are away from home for the first time, living with friends in flats or houses and making their own way in every sense of the word.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point that the more people who participate in third level education the better for the country. Great strides were made in the participation rates in this area during the eighties when both the Deputy's party and the Fianna Fáil Party were in Government.  I am glad of this.  This has been helped greatly by European funding for regional and vocational education committees.  While I accept that there is a need for more involvement and participation in third level education, I do not fully accept the Deputy's point that all young people of 17, 18 or 19 years want to stay in their own town or county. As I have said, an attractive component of third level education is the fact that young people travel and learn to stand on their own feet.</P>

As I said, the Government and I remain committed to greater participation rates in third level education.  We will look at whatever proposals are put forward but I repeat that it would not be possible to provide a third level facility in every county.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 33, 35, 53 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>My Department review the higher education grants scheme on an annual basis in the light of their experience of its operation and/or representations from individuals or public representatives.  I am aware of the difficulties facing some parents with children in third level education and this is a matter which is reviewed from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> The means test tables for the scheme are so framed as to give greater financial assistance to students from low income families.  I also wish to point out that despite the past few years of severe financial constraints, I have increased the income eligibility limits and rates of maintenance grant payable in line with the increase in the CPI.  I have also increased the fee grant in line with increases in tuition fee charges.  Moreover, I would also point out that the percentage of students receiving grant assistance in the 1989-90 academic year was over 50 per cent compared with under 47 per cent in 1986-87.  Therefore, there have been substantial improvements.</P>
    <P>In addition to these improvements I can assure the Deputies that it has been my objective to ensure that the higher education grants scheme is as equitable as possible.</P>
    <P>There is no uniform definition of what constitutes a mature student; various interpretations are given by the third level colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister said regarding improvements in the scheme, is she aware that an increasing number of students are deciding to attend regional colleges rather than university as was formerly the case? Obviously these students are deciding to attend regional colleges because the European Social Fund grant is not subject to a means test.  I understand that this practice is widespread.  The Minister should keep an eye on third-level education in general with a view to provisional planning for the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's first question about young people who are now deciding to attend regional and VEC colleges, I dare say the European Social Fund grant scheme is a contributory factor but another major factor is the very fine, relevant, third level courses being conducted there.  These colleges are linked more and more with great potential for employment and this is why young people are opting to attend them.</P>
      <P>With regard to whether mortgage repayments should be taken into account in assessing the reckonable income of a family, if one were to go down that path one would be going into a labyrinth of trouble.  In addition, it would be very expensive and we might not be able to give grants to as many young people as we do at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's final point about families who have two or more children attending third level education, as I said that issue is constantly looked at and the scheme is reviewed annually.  I would point out to Deputy Cotter and the other Deputies who put down questions &mdash; this is not connected with the <Col N="802" /> questions but it is as well to put it on record &mdash; that this year we were able to remove a long standing anomaly and reduce from four to two honours the eligibility requirement for the grant.  This has made an enormous difference and I will give the Deputy the numbers if he puts down a question.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest, namely, the motion passed last week by the United Nations Security Council authorising the United States and its allies in the Gulf to use military force against Iraq, and the appropriate response of Ireland to this motion in view of its implications for world peace and for Irish neutrality. Article 28.3.1º of the Constitution states quite clearly that war shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war, save with the assent of the Dáil.  Accordingly, I believe that a motion of the Dáil would be required before the Government could contemplate supporting the Security Council motion.  The deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait specified in the Security Council motion will occur in mid-January when the Dáil is likely to be in recess.  Accordingly, it is essential that the Dáil should now discuss the matter and I therefore urge you to agree to my request under Standing Order 30.</P>

Serious damage could be done to the reputation of this country if, subsequently, we changed the monopoly rules, with the Goodman Group no longer controlling 40 per cent of the meat business and the scheme of arrangement was based on the fact that he would retain control over 40 per cent.

      <P>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Pat McCartan.  Again, with your indulgence, amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 form an alternative composite proposal.  It is proposed therefore, with the agreement of the House, that for discussion purposes we take amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `rape' means the non-consensual penetration of the major orifices of the body of any person, male or female, including the vagina, anus and mouth, by the penis of another person, or of a person's vagina or anus by an inanimate object held or manipulated by any other person;&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is my second preference in terms of the ultimate definition we should have in our law at the end of this debate as to what is or is not rape.  This <Col N="935" /> is the definition I propose for inclusion in the definition section.  This, in fact, is the broader definition which was proposed by the Law Reform Commission in their report entitled &ldquo;Rape&rdquo;.  As I say, it is the broadest possible definition of the concept of rape which would fully reflect the attitude of our community, the people working with the victims of rape and of the victims themselves.  Finally, it would provide a gender neutral definition of the offence of rape.</P>
    <P>As I said, it would be my second preference but nonetheless it is no less objectionable. It has the support of the Law Reform Commission and is borrowed from their recommendations.  I will not press amendment No. 1 in the event of the proposal contained in section 4 of the Bill being improved in the way I have suggested through the acceptance of amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4.  It was my intention, mistakenly as I have now been advised by the Chair, to tease out section 4 somewhat better and then to fall back on amendment No. 1, if possible, but I accept fully that I cannot do this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I think the Deputy will accept that it has occurred on Committee Stage but not on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that. That was my intention but nonetheless we should take the opportunity on Report Stage, which is the final stage of our deliberations, to look again at the question of a proper definition of the concept of rape and the question of whether or not we should in this legislation adopt the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission which was that we should adopt a broader definition, gender neutral, which would reflect the common attitude that the definition is far broader than the old concept of penile penetration of the vagina and embraces multiple and nefarious concepts, manifestations and operations which are reflected in the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context one should appreciate the efforts the Minister made in meeting <Col N="936" /> the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on Committee Stage.  His amendments are now encapsulated in section 4.  In addition to the common law definition of rape, the Minister is bringing in a statutory concept of rape which includes penetration, however slight, of the anus or mouth by the penis and penetration, however slight, of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person.  The concepts omitted from the Minister's statutory definition include the concept of penetration of the anus by an object.  This is regrettable and the Minister has not explained why he has done that.  The definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; I am proposing clearly includes that.  The Minister did say repeatedly on Committee Stage, in proposing his amendment, that he was adopting the gender neutral definition.  There is a curious gap in that definition and I do not understand why.  Perhaps I might borrow from the Second Stage debate in this House to suggest that there is a certain line of thinking.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I quoted the Minister's remark in the area in which he felt he was borrowing his line of thinking. When I checked that with the actual printed text of what he had delivered I discovered that the more contentious portion was not read in the House.  If I was out of order in the House in so doing I apologise but all that was available to me on Committee Stage was the text circulated in the Chamber.  What was being argued therein was the notion that using an inanimate object was something so offensive to the best reason it would be &mdash; as was said in the text circulated &mdash; wrong in principle since, to give rise to the notion that it would be proper and consensual to use inanimate objects would give rise to the startling implications that such acts, if consensual, would be acceptable.  From that I then began to talk on Committee Stage about the whole range of opportunities and circumstances in which consenting adults, in the course of love-making, or engaging in sexual intercourse, would use and often rely upon inanimate objects.</P>
    <P>Since then I have had an opportunity <Col N="937" /> to discuss this very topic with many people, particularly those in the gay community. I am advised &mdash; particularly in the climate of AIDS and people's difficulties with regard to it &mdash; that reliance on inanimate objects, particularly among gay people is very much on the increase. This presents me with the problem that the more they are on the increase the more the opportunity arises that an act of rape can be inflicted on someone, using an inanimate object, through the anus. That is not provided for in the definition the Minister is promoting by way of his amendments.  I hope it is a major oversight. It may emanate from this thinking that there was on the other side, the flip of it, no possibility that one could ever introduce the element of consent where an inanimate object was involved.  Of course that is ridiculous.  I acknowledged that the Minister, Dr. Woods, when he delivered the text on behalf of the Minister for Justice, who was unavoidably detained elsewhere, did not repeat that statement; somebody had realised that it was not a proposition one could stand over.  While the text has been corrected I am worried that the thinking remains in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Unless we can make progress on section 4 I believe that the wider definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; should be the one to be adopted and included in the Bill.  For that reason I will be urging it on the Minister and the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern, and that of the Government, in this Bill is to maximise the protection afforded women by the criminal law and minimise the trauma suffered by victims of such crimes.  During our discussions on this Bill one of the most controversial issues to arise was whether the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; should be applied to certain types of serious sexual assault.  This is a matter to which I gave close personal attention.  I met with a variety of interest groups and people to listen to what they had to say on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new section 4 which I put forward &mdash; and which has been accepted by this House &mdash; now applies the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; to <Col N="938" /> certain types of sexual assault.  It might be no harm if I read into the record exactly what it says:</P>
    <P>(1)  In this act &ldquo;rape under section 4&rdquo; means a sexual assault that includes&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis, or</P>
    <P>(b)  penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person. </P>
    <P>(2)  A person guilty of rape under section 4 shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.</P>
    <P>(3)  Rape under section 4 shall be a felony. </P>
    <P>On the one hand, it meets the argument put forward that the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; has to be applied to such offences to provide the psychological reassurance and sense of vindication necessary for the victim and, at the same time, avoids any interference with the existing, well established, definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.  This approach meets the concerns of all sides and has been generally welcomed.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan in his amendment advocates a radically different approach. In effect he seeks to abolish the traditional definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; and to delete the definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; under section 4 inserted on Committee Stage.  In its place he proposes a new definition.  I have to oppose this amendment.  Even ignoring the technical flaws associated with his amendment I am opposed in principle to this approach.  All the arguments advanced for applying the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; to these sexual assaults have now been met. I see nothing to be gained by the abolition of the existing definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Deputy must be aware that there are many people in the legal profession, and in other walks of life, who are strongly opposed to any interference at all with the traditional definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.  The arguments for not interfering with the existing definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; are set out at some length in the Official Report of the debate on this Bill in this House and in the Seanad as well <Col N="939" /> as being included in the dissenting recommendations of the President of the Law Reform Commission and his colleague, Mr. O'Leary, in the Commission's report on rape.  I see no purpose in going over the ground again.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the offence of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; in section 4 is not gender neutral, I might say that men and women have different sexual organs; that is a fact and we cannot change that fact. However, subject to that constraint, this offence is gender neutral &mdash; a man or woman can be charged and convicted of rape under section 4; a man or woman could be the victim of rape under the provisions of the same section.  Clearly that makes the offence gender neutral, which has been one of Deputy McCartan's concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a measure of the Minister's intent to have this Bill passed at the earliest possible opportunity that we are taking Report Stage so soon after completion of Committee Stage.  Indeed, it would be my hope that the Bill could be passed by this House at the earliest possible opportunity and reach Aras an Uachtaráin at the earliest opportunity. Indeed it would be fitting that this Bill would be the first Act to bear the signature of President Mary Robinson having regard to her tremendous interest in this area of the law over her long and distinguished career.</P>
      <P>It would be a pity were we to divide on Report Stage on the issue of the extension of the definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.  Clearly section 4, and the new concept of statutory rape introduced by the Minister, is far and away more acceptable than that included in the original Bill in the Seanad and in the version printed after the election of 1989.  The Minister has gone a very long way to meeting what was proposed by the Law Reform Commission and of the many interested parties who expressed concern in the matter in the course of the passage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan indicated that he <Col N="940" /> might perhaps be amenable to withdrawing his amendment No. 1 were he to get some form of commitment in regard to his amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4.  I understand that, for technical reasons, it is impossible to discuss amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 at this stage.  If I interpret Deputy McCartan correctly, he places considerable significance on the consensual or the non-consensual aspect.  I wonder if it is necessary to remind the House that &ldquo;rape&rdquo; under the provisions of section 4 means a sexual assault that includes subsections (a) and (b), in that there must be an assault.  If there is an assault by one person perpetrated on another, than surely the question of consent by definition, is included?  I contend it is impossible to have an assault, by definition, to which a person consents to that being inflicted upon himself or herself.  Either it is an assault or it is not an assault.  That could well cover the question of consent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that it is not his intention to accept the amendment. At the end of the day it would be a pity if we were to divide on the matter.  We have come a long way towards perfecting the legislation and I hope consideration will be given to withdrawing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not seen his way to accept the proposition contained in the amendment.  It is not radically different, as he suggests. There is not a substantial or radical departure.  It is merely building on the common law definition that is there.  It does not basically change the notion of rape, of a gross attack upon the person of an individual.  The traditional definition of rape we talked about on Committee Stage has been built on in legislation as recently as 1981.  Therefore, I do not accept the view.  However, my more particular interest is contained in the subsequent amendments, that perhaps we can move towards and talk a little more about.  I hope I can enlighten Deputy Flanagan at that stage about the concept of assault with consent, a concept well known to our law and particularly <Col N="941" /> pertinent to this area.  I withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 11, before &ldquo;penetration&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;non-consensual&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>These amendments deal with the new section the Minister has included about statutory rape, as it no doubt will in time come to be known.  We are moving away from the absolute definition proposed by the Law Reform Commission and we are now concentrating on the Minister's approach which is different.  Nonetheless, it is an advance on what was there previously.</P>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that &ldquo;rape&rdquo; be defined in section 4 to include the following: &ldquo;(a) penetration, (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis, or (b) penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person.&rdquo;  In amendments Nos. 2 and 3 I am seeking to include the word &ldquo;non-consensual&rdquo;.  The Bill would then read &ldquo;(a) non-consensual penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis, or (b) non-consensual penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason is, first, the Law Reform Commission include the word &ldquo;non-consensual&rdquo; in their definition of what should <Col N="942" /> be rape and it is important now, where we are moving into a gender neutral definition, where we are dealing with consenting males engaging in whatever form of sexual pleasure they seek to make with each other, that we have a clear and concise reference in the law.  In short, offences exist in our law, even though consent might be present.</P>
    <P>This is dealt with very succinctly in the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper on child sexual abuse.  A chapter on offences and the present law deals with (a) non-consensual offences generally, rape, buggery and the like involving females being classical examples and (b) consensual offences generally.  They say that, notwithstanding the fact that consent may have been given and that there has been no threat or intimidation, the following sexual acts are criminal: (1) incest, (2) buggery, (3) gross indecency with a male (4) carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 17 years and (5) any physical contact of a sexual nature with a person, male or female, under the age of 15 years which could constitute an indecent assault were there no consent. They say the offences of buggery and gross indecency can be committed by both parties once they are over the age of seven years.  Incest can be committed by both parties once the female is aged 17 years or over.  Consensual sexual activity between females over the age of 15 years is not criminal, and so it should be. However, as is clearly indicated there, if their activity included buggery with an object they may be in difficulty, but certainly consensual activity between males of one buggering the other or of one acting in what could otherwise be described as gross indecency, in other words, engaging in overt sexual activity, can amount to offences under our law even if consent is there.</P>
    <P>Acts of penetration of the anus or the mouth by the penis can amount to buggery &mdash; in fact, they do.  There is no other way of describing them.  Even if consent is there, they are still offences.  We have to recognise that adults can bugger each other if they want to and it should not be an offence.  They can do that with the <Col N="943" /> penis and, in my view, with an inanimate object if they consent, and it should not be an offence but under the Minister's definition it will be.  Here we come back to the difficulties of the consent notion mentioned in the Minister's Second Stage speech &mdash; that there are things in sexual activity between male adults that simply are so unthinkable that consent as an issue can never arise.  However, since the Law Reform Commission clearly laid down that there are sexual activities that can, even with consent, still amount to an assault, it is important that when defining what we want to constitute rape from here on in, we are clear about this issue of consent.  The Law Reform Commission use the word in their definition and recommend that we use it, and it is important that we make it clear that when we are talking about the penetration of the anus or mouth we are talking about it in a non-consensual context, and the same applies with regard to the use of any inanimate object.  I hope the inclusion of the word in the definition will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Borrowing a line from Deputy Flanagan and a point made on Committee Stage, if this is not an issue then we are at no difficulty.  We are in no way taking from what the Minister intended.  If I am told &mdash; and I am prepared to listen &mdash; that the issue of consent does not arise, that it is not necessary, that we are dealing with assault and we do not need the word &ldquo;consensual&rdquo;, then I say including it does not take from the provision and will clarify the matter from my point of view and that of the many people who are concerned about this new concept of the statutory definition the Minister has included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard Deputy McCartan refer to the term &ldquo;non-consensual&rdquo; and his desire to put it into the legislation.  We discussed this earlier on Committee Stage.  &ldquo;Rape&rdquo; under section 4 refers to only non-consensual acts.  It does not purport to affect in any way consensual acts.  The specific acts referred to in section 4 (1) (a) and (b) constitute <Col N="944" /> an offence under the section only if they are done as part of a sexual assault. Deputy Flanagan made that point.  It is made quite clear in the first line of the section which provides that rape under section 4 &ldquo;means a sexual assault that includes &mdash;&rdquo; and it lists the acts in question. If the acts in question are not a sexual assault, then they fall outside the scope of this section.  If consent is given to these acts then obviously there is no sexual assault as such.  To insert the term &ldquo;non-consensual&rdquo; would lead to an absurd situation where we would have a non-consensual sexual assault, implying there is some form of consensual sexual assault.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept these two amendments.  The suggestion is that we would have a non-consensual sexual assault implying that there is a form of consensual sexual assault.  Assault is what we are talking about.  I am not prepared to accept them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy McCartan said. Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 highlight Deputy McCartan's concern that there should be no misinterpretation. In putting the case for including &ldquo;non-consensual&rdquo; Deputy McCartan quotes from the report of the Law Reform Commission where the example of child sexual assault is given as an example where even a consenting sexual activity could be legally interpreted as sexual assault.  I also take Deputy McCartan's point that with the increasing availability and acceptability of sex aids to obviate or remove the threat of the transfer of HIV virus, there could be an interpretation of assault as defined by Deputy McCartan.  As we are trying to have the most comprehensive Bill possible with the least amount of misinterpretation, I would also contend that the inclusion of &ldquo;non-consensual&rdquo; would strengthen that and remove the anomalies and ambiguities that could arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that we have not decriminalised homosexuality, other interpretations are possible.  I take the Minister's point that in ordinary language and in everyday interpretation there would be no need for <Col N="945" /> this and that an assault is an assault and would certainly have to be non-consensual. The insertion of the words &ldquo;non-consensual&rdquo; would remove the danger of ambiguities or misinterpretations.  What Deputy McCartan is putting forward is reasonable and is a copperfastening of what the Minister is trying to do regarding this whole section.</P>

      <P>What I have to say is in the nature of a question to the Minister. If one of the partners to a consensual arrangement is HIV positive and that information is withheld from the other partner who subsequently is found to be HIV positive, would that be considered to be an offence?  Perhaps Deputy McCartan was trying to include this type of situation in the legislation.  If the information was known to both partners it would not be a consensual arrangement. Perhaps it would then be a case that could be included in this section.  Perhaps the Minister would clear that point up for us?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am gravely disappointed with the Minister's response because I believe he is mistaken and he is being wrongly advised.  To put it as basically as I can, when the traditional definition of rape was formulated it was as follows, and I am quoting from Archbold, the definitive document on criminal law: &ldquo;Rape is the unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman without her consent by force, fear, or fraud.&rdquo;  The words &ldquo;without her consent&rdquo; were in there and that was because it was acknowledged that <Col N="946" /> there can be occasions when men and women have intercourse and consent to it and that it is a crime when the woman does not consent.  It is important in the definition of rape that there be no consent.</P>
      <P>When it came to dealing with acts between men, the Legislature in 1884 and in 1861 considered that the notion of buggery was completely alien to man; it was referred to as the abominable crime and so the issue of consent did not arise. The same would apply to acts of gross indecency, of men engaging in sexual activity and for that reason again the issue of consent did not arise with the result that when the Law Reform Commission came to review the issues it did so in the succinct way that I read to the Minister from the report: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the fact that consent may have been given and there has been no threat or intimidation, the following sexual acts are criminal.&rdquo;  In other words, there is such a thing in our law as consensual sexual assault.  If there is not, am I being told that the Law Reform Commission is wrong?  As I understand the law, it is an offence to commit buggery; it is an offence to engage in gross indecency with another male, and the fact that there is consent does not vitiate that situation. Those are still two offences, that much we are agreed on.  Consequently those amount to sexual assaults, sexual offences.  If I am being told that the use of the word &ldquo;assault&rdquo; by definition means absolutely non-consensual, I am sorry to have to disagree and if the Minister is adopting that position he is wrong.  The issue of consent is a live issue in the context of some of the acts that have been mentioned.  I cannot put the argument any further than that.  I believe that the Bill, if left in this way, will be very worrying for people who thought we were dealing with the matter in progression. In fact we are going right back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 13, after &ldquo;vagina&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or anus&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Here I am proposing that the anus be included in paragraph (b).  I will have to wait to hear the Minister's reason for excluding it before I can make any serious argument, but it seems obvious that it should be included.  The proposition is that sexual assault by way of penetration of the anus, mouth or, by common law, vagina, by the penis is rape under paragraph (a), and that is eminently sensible. Why then is the provision not extended to deal with inanimate objects held or manipulated by another person?  Why is the anus excluded?  As I said, when talking about the gender neutral proposition rape on men can only be effected through the anus.  Why then do we not include the anus in the section?  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The crime of rape is viewed by all as a particular heinous crime and it attracts a special type of odium. Women want serious sexual assaults to be termed rape so that such assaults will attract the same odium as the traditional definition of the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.  One of my major concerns from the outset has been that we do not dilute or devalue the special significance that is attached to <Col N="948" /> the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo;, and clearly that would happen if every indecent assault, no matter how minor, was termed rape. Therefore in drafting the new section 4 of this Bill care was taken that it would only include serious sexual assaults that would be comparable to rape in gravity and nature.</P>
      <P>In each of the cases covered by section 4 we have either penetration of the body by a sexual organ or penetration of a sexual organ by an object.  This is a logical as well as a practical definition in that the offence always entails something which is clearly sexual penetration.  The acts which are covered by the definition of rape are penetration of the mouth by the penis, penetration of the vagina by an object and penetration of the anus by the penis.  If we are to stray outside this definition I fear we could spend an eternity discussing what should or should not go into the definition.</P>
      <P>I have been asked why not include penetration of the anus by an object?  The answer is simple.  Penetration of the anus by an object does not involve a sexual organ.  Such penetration is not intrinsically sexual.  Indeed, depending on the circumstances it might not even constitute an indecent assault under existing law.  Although if it did, under the Bill it could be charged as sexual assault or aggravated sexual assault as the case may be.  If it is a non-sexual assault it could be charged as common assault or perhaps in the more serious case assault causing bodily harm.  Indeed in the most serious case &mdash; assault with intent to cause grievious bodily harm &mdash; the maximum penalty is life imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not denying that certain persons may, as has been mentioned by Deputy McCartan, obtain sexual gratification by way of the insertion of objects into the anus, nor am I saying that you would never have a sexual assault involving penetration of the anus by an object.  I am just making the point that it is not an intrinsically sexual act.  For this reason it is distinguishable from penetration involving a sexual organ which clearly always has a sexual connotation.  Rape is an important term.  It must not be devalued <Col N="949" /> and it must be easily distinguishable from other offences.  I am satisfied that the new section as it now stands in the Bill meets these criteria.  To include penetration of the anus by an object would only serve to weaken the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights on sexual violence. Their recommendation was that the term rape should include oral sexual intercourse, anal sexual intercourse and the use of objects to violate the vagina.  I have now done this in section 4 of the Bill.  The report did not recommend that it should include penetration of the anus by an object.  The Rape Crisis Centre in their written submission to the joint Oireachtas committee did not seek its inclusion either.  While I accept the good intentions of Deputy McCartan in putting forward the amendment, I feel strongly that the Bill should not be extended in the manner in which he proposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's argument, but throughout the debate on this Bill there was a consensus that an assault of the nature that we are discussing is not fundamentally or necessarily a sexual one but rather one of hatred, dominance and violence.  I agree with the Minister that when we began to debate this Bill our thoughts were directed mainly towards women as victims of rape.  Tragically today it is mainly women who are the victims of rape.</P>
      <P>In attempting to introduce compassion into the Bill and to outline the seriousness of the attacks that are intrinsic to this Bill we are very aware, as I know the Minister is, of the depth of violence, certainly the physical injury that could be inflicted on people by the kinds of penetration we are talking about but also the deep psychological and emotional trauma suffered by the victim of such attacks.  While I agree with the Minister that the last thing we want to do is remove the seriousness of this crime, I am led to believe that penetration of the anus of either gender by an inanimate object carries the same violation as what we are talking about and which is encompassed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> This side of the House welcomes the fact that the Minister has extended the definition of rape to allow us to load that kind of violent action with the stigma and seriousness it deserves by terming it as rape.  I put it very strongly to the Minister that the penetration of the anus of either man or woman by an inanimate object, involving the violence and thinking of rape which an assault of this kind would have should be included in the definition because it would have the same after effects on a victim as the other terrible penetrations.</P>
    <P>All Members are trying to ensure that somebody who carries out such a dreadful, violent assault will be subject to the full rigours of the law and the stigma of rape.  Someone who would attack and violate the anus with an inanimate object, possibly causing great damage, pain and emotional and psychological damage, might not be seen in the same context and would not have the crime of rape ascribed to them.  I put it to the Minister that the type of injury and violence involved in such an attack would be very much within that strong, serious interpretation which the Minister has allowed and which this side of the House support. I would not like to think that such an attack would not come within the rigours of the law, the stigma and the seriousness of what we consider to be rape within this Bill.  I see it as at least on the same level and the inclusion of the word &ldquo;anus&rdquo; would strengthen the Bill.</P>

      <P>I also support this amendment.  I have listened carefully to the debate and have gone through the report of the Law Reform Commission. I do not understand why we are making heavy weather of this.  I should like to see this amendment included in the Bill, it will probably come up in the other House and it would be a pity if we cannot proceed on the harmonious lines which have pertained in the debate up to now.  The recommendation in the report of the Law Reform Commission is very clear.  It says &ldquo;non-consensual sexual penetration of the vagina, anus and mouth of a person by the penis of another person &mdash; or of <Col N="951" /> the vagina or anus of a person &mdash; by an inanimate object held or manipulated by another person... and that, in this form, the crime should be capable of being committed against men and women&rdquo;.  That is very clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggests that, by taking on board this concept, we are in some way diluting or taking away from the significance of the act of rape.  In fact, we are doing what the Law Reform Commission argued we should be doing in changing and legislating for change in this area and indeed generally in regard to the law.  They said at page 23 of their report that in the case of the proposed alterations it is suggested that the benefits which will result are (1) bringing the definition of crime into line with society's current view of what constitutes rape and (2) offering some degree of psychological reassurance to the victims by describing the experience to which they have been subjected to as rape.  Those are the two objectives which were put forward as underlining why the law might be changed, advanced and developed.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has, somewhat ingeniously, found the common thread in relation to the definition of the sexual organ.  It is a very narrow definition in regard to the reasons for the anus being included when we are dealing with the penile penetration and excluded in dealing with an inanimate object penetration.  Put another way, I understand and believe that, for many gay men, their anus is their vagina.  If we are trying to address the degree to which we can give psychological reassurance to victims, we should bear that in mind and recognise the hurt that a man can feel by being violated by an inanimate object through the anus and whether we are addressing his needs in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about gender neutral definition, where the offence can be committed by a man or a woman, on a man or a woman, and it is in that context I am arguing.  I do not suggest that we have to stay here for eternity, this is just <Col N="952" /> a small addition to what has already been proposed.  I say it does not involve any great debate because the Law Reform Commission succinctly recommended it. It is an amendment which has been taken on board by other jurisdictions.  I am looking at the consultative paper and I see that the State of Victoria in Australia has the definition in its penal code.  It is one of many countries in the common law world which has adopted this definition and that is why I advocated that the rape of any of the body orifices by either the penis or the inanimate object should be included.  It is concise and precise, it reflects the objectives of the Law Reform Commission and it also reflects the view in the community as to what constitutes rape.  If one talks to a man or woman who has had his or her anus defiled by an inanimate object, it is clear that it is as grossly offensive to that person whether the object is a penis or inanimate object. There is no difference.  The hurt and the sense of grievous invasion of the body is rape for the person subjected to it.  We were not seeking to dilute or take away from the significance of the concept of rape, we were responding to what people in the know said should be in the definition of rape.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1A) All such applications for leave of the judge under subsection (1) shall be made at the commencement of the trial, in the absence of the jury, and shall require the person making the application to call such evidence and lay such facts and arguments before the judge to justify the making of the application.  Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the trial judge from acceding to an application during the trial in special circumstances decided by the judge.'.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> This raises an issue dealt with on Committee Stage and I included it because it was one of the things which the Minister indicated he would reflect on before Report Stage.  I have altered the amendment, having regard to a point made by Deputy Flanagan and the Minister, about the exclusivity of my original amendment in which I suggested that all applications for leave to delve into the victim's previous sexual history must be made only at the commencement of the trial once the case is in the hands of the jury.  I have now added the proviso that nothing in the subsection will prevent the trial judge from acceding to an application during the trial in special circumstances decided by the trial judge but that, in the first principle and approach the application should be made to the judge at the commencement of the trial so that the lines of battle are drawn, that the victim has the opportunity to realise the extent to which he or she will be cross-questioned and the extent to which he or she may be subjected to inquiry into previous sexual history.  It is a fair proposition that was recommended by the Law Reform Commission, one the Minister should take on board, with the proviso that if, in the course of any trial, something untoward should emerge, a judge would need to have the discretion to say that he will entertain an application for leave to delve into previous sexual history.  However, in 99 per cent of cases the defence is aware if the issue of previous sexual history can be pertinent and might be an issue in the trial.  Even insisting that it is taken at the beginning is not imposing an undue restriction on the defence.  If the defence thinks it is an issue that can arise, they can make their application and then choose to use it or not.  The proviso is there, should something untoward emerge.  It is a sensible proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy McCartan said, we discussed this matter on Committee Stage and I recognise that the Deputy has altered his amendment to make it less absolute and less open to criticism on constitutional grounds.  Nevertheless, I still oppose the amendment on the <Col N="954" /> grounds that it would not be of any practical benefit.  When the Bill was drawn up, consideration was given to including a provision where an application under section 23 of the 1981 Act to adduce evidence or cross-examine the complainant about her sexual experience would have to be made at the outset of the trial, unless special leave to do otherwise was granted by the trial judge.</P>
      <P>However, the Attorney General was strongly opposed to the proposal and I agree with him on this issue.  The Attorney General pointed out that it was not practical to determine such an application in advance of the trial and thought it would be inevitable that the trial judge would adjourn his decision to the appropriate stage in the trial and that it would encourage the defence to make such an application in every case just to keep their options open.  Even if the judge decided against the application at the outset, matters could unfold which would force him to reconsider the application during the trial.  Even ignoring the practical difficulties, there seems to be no benefit of any significance to the complainant in forcing the defence to make such an application at the outset of the trial.</P>
      <P>There is no question of the defence springing a trap on the complainant, which was one of the worries expressed by Deputy Fennell when this was debated last time.  If the defence wish to raise any matter relating to the sexual experience of the complainant, they have to follow the formal procedures laid down.  They would first have to approach the trial judge and indicate that they wished to make an application in the absence of the jury.  The jury would not be told what the application related to and the jury, along with the press and any other persons not party to the proceedings would then be cleared from the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that stage, the defence would formally make their application and would have to satisfy the judge that the adducing of such evidence was justified because it might reasonably convince the jury of the defendant's innocence.  The prosecution could argue against the <Col N="955" /> granting of the application.  After the judge has made his decision the jury will be recalled and the trial will continue.  If he decided to grant the application the defence can then and only then adduce evidence about the complainant's sexual experience and only in respect of the matters allowed by the judge.  There is no question of springing a trap, which was the concern of Deputies.  There was concern that a trap would be sprung in the presence of the jury in relation to the previous sexual experience of the complainant. That cannot happen under these proceedings, so I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to recommendations for this part of the trial procedure there was tremendous debate, not least among members of the Judiciary, particularly those who attended the day long seminar organised by the Law Reform Commission.  While I accept the safeguards outlined by the Minister, this was always considered to be a vulnerable area where the victim was at risk.  On hearing about the behaviour in court and subsequent suffering of victims in court, the Women's Rights Committee recommended very strongly that on no occasion should the past sexual history of a victim be gone into during a court case.  Adducing such evidence caused great trauma and it was always used as part of the defence strategy. There were no bones made about this at that seminar by the Judiciary who normally defend rape cases.  We realised that this was a black spot where the victim needed the greatest possible protection. After discussion we accepted that it could be contrary to natural justice if the recommendation of the Women's Rights Committee was completely accepted and that, on occasion, it would lead to an injustice against the alleged rapist if such evidence was not allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People pushing for this amendment accepted that they would not want to write into the legislation a denial of natural justice for anybody.  However, one of the problems we are faced with is that <Col N="956" /> while it was accepted that at the discretion of the judge past sexual history of a complainant might be taken as part of the court evidence under the criminal law as it stands the past sexual history of the defendant could never be brought into court.  There were instances outlined where, in fact, there was a record of past sexual offences with regard to a defendant which could not be revealed in the court.  We felt that there was a certain imbalance there where the complainant seeking justice would have past sexual history used against her while the shield could never be lowered with regard to the past sexual history, indeed offences, of the defendant.  We had a debate in relation to the natural justice of that.</P>
    <P>One of the important recommendations with regard to this dilemma was put forward by certain members of the bench who practise in this area.  They made the point that it is very important that any such application would have to be made before the trial.  They felt that allowing the application to be made during the trial, even if the jury were asked to leave, would prejudice the claimant's case.  When the jury were asked to leave, even if the application was not granted, they would know or surmise that they were being asked to leave so that the complainant's past sexual history could be examined, and this would raise a suspicion in the minds of the jury.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan's amendment is reasonable and goes along the lines of trying to prevent the type of scenario we are trying to remove, and to leave the procedures as non-judgemental and as fair as possible to the victim.  Deputy McCartan, by including the last sentence in his proposed amendment which states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the trial judge from acceding to an application during the trial in special circumstances decided by the judge. </P>
    <P>This is leaving every possibility open and is in no way attempting to interfere with any particular court case if and when the need arises.  The fact that this may be called upon, the fact that the matter has <Col N="957" /> not been decided beforehand and that the jury has been asked to leave implants a certain bias, even at a subliminal level, in the jury which could be negative towards the complainant and would replace the injury already done by a more subtle one.  I would like the Minister to consider that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there is no practical benefit to be obtained from the amendment.  I disagree with him on that and urge him to reconsider this matter.  The objective of the whole emphasis in this area of the law is to try to make the experience of the court somewhat humane and to enable the victim to be more at ease going into the witness box.  In the past it has been recognised that the time in the witness box can often be more harrowing and troublesome for a victim than the original rape. Some of the things that used to happen were that the victim would go in and would not know at what stage questions would be fired at her about previous sexual relationships, not only with the defendant but with other people.  That issue was addressed in the 1981 Act in some respects.  In time it was formalised into the making of application by leave of the judge only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is huge practical benefit to be obtained with the issue being determined at the outset of a trial so that the victim can be told, in those circumstances that she can now go into the witness box knowing that no improper questions, will be asked, no improper probing or no muck-throwing will be engaged in by the defence in regard to her own personal sexual history.  That would be vastly reassuring knowledge for any witness to have going into the witness box.  If, on the other hand, they are told they have failed in their application, and there is this residual right to come back to the judge should anything happen, the victim can be advised that on the basis of the information or the grounds laid out by the defence at the outset that they have very little to go on and that she has little or no worry that at any stage they will succeed during the trial to raise the issue <Col N="958" /> of previous personal sexual history. There are huge practical benefits to be obtained.</P>
    <P>The other practical benefit &mdash; and in advance of her going into the witness box &mdash; is that the victim is available to be advised, to be consulted with, to be cajoled, to be reassured, to be befriended or to have the availability of a lawyer. Once she goes into the witness box and is sworn and has to step down while an application is being made for leave to the judge, at that stage she is in the hands of the court and cannot be approached, cannot be talked to, or in any way addressed with regard to the trial, the issues or her testimony.  She is beyond reach and cannot be put at ease or reassured, even though an application is being made, not to be afraid, that she has nothing to be worried about, she has the strength of right on her side, and simply has to answer the questions.  That is a practical reality and is the difference between an application being made at the beginning of the trial and the application being made while the witness has been sworn in and is in the hands of the court. Once under oath she cannot be approached; apparently the Minister is not aware of that.</P>
    <P>The other practical point has been highlighted by Deputy Barnes, that is where the jury are asked to leave in the midst of a flow of evidence where it is quite clear that the defence intend to get into something murky, shady or something questionable about the witness victim in the witness box.  Even though the defendant may fail in the application the question has been raised and the jury will have possibly that doubt in mind. Clinically, it is a far cleaner, far safer and far better approach to make the application at the outset.  In 99 per cent of the time the defence know whether they have the basis to pursue this type of issue at the outset of the trial and they are put at no disadvantage whatever by being asked to lay their cards on the table and make their application to the court and the judge at the beginning of the trial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> I am disappointed the Minister has not looked more closely at the practical benefits that can accrue from the application being made at the outset and to recognise that it could help substantially to make life a little easier for someone who is an innocent person, someone who has been grievously injured and is simply coming to court to tell a story and who should be able to do so with the greatest possible ease.  I urge the Minister to reconsider it even at this late stage.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 7 to 15 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>14.  &mdash;Section 8 of the Principal Act is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (2):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  If a person charged with a rape offence applies in that behalf to a judge of the High Court before the commencement of the trial or to the judge at the trial, the judge shall direct that subsection (1) shall not apply to the person in relation to the charge:</P>
      <P>Provided that, if it appears to the judge that, if the direction were given, the publication of any matter in pursuance of the direction might enable members of the public to identify a person as the complainant in relation to the charge, the judge shall not give the direction unless he is satisfied that a direction could properly be given in relation to that person in pursuance of section 7.&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> (b)  by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (7):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(8)  If, at any time after a person is charged with a rape offence, the Director of Public Prosecutions applies in that behalf to a judge of the High Court, the judge, if he is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so, shall direct that subsection (1) shall not apply to such matter relating to the person charged with the offence as is specified in the direction.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of both amendments is to ensure greater protection for the anonymity of the complainant in the case of sexual assault offences.  Section 8 of the 1981 Act deals with the anonymity of the accused and sets out the circumstances where the identity of the accused can be published or broadcast. In this Bill, in section 5 we are abolishing the marital exemption in relation to rape. Clearly, in a case of marital rape, revealing the identity of the accused is likely to also reveal the identity of his wife.  There may be other circumstances where revealing the identity of the accused may also reveal the identity of the complainant. We must be careful then to ensure that revealing the identity of the accused will not inadvertently reveal the identity of the complainant.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (2) of the 1981 Act as it now stands, requires the court to lift the anonymity provisions for the accused if he makes an application for this to be done.  There is no discretion allowed. Once the accused applies under section 8 (2), the restrictions must be lifted even if it would reveal the identity of the complainant. The amendment now being put forward in my name will rectify this situation by ensuring that in future the judge must take into account the need to protect the anonymity of the complainant.  If lifting restrictions regarding the anonymity of the accused might reveal the identity of the complainant, then it can only be done under the new section 8 (2) <Col N="961" /> if it meets the requirements imposed by section 7 of the 1981 Act.</P>
    <P>Part (b) of the amendment to section 14 of the Bill is merely a re-statement of what is already there in section 14.  There is no substantive change.  It is purely a drafting matter.</P>
    <P>The second related amendment being inserted in section 17 of the Bill relates to section 7 (4) of the 1981 Act.  It arises from the fact that the anonymity of the accused does not last beyond conviction. While section 7 of the 1981 Act &mdash; as respects the anonymity of the complainant &mdash; clearly continues to apply even after an accused has been convicted, the reference to the acquittal only of the accused in section 7 (4) might give the impression that that provision has no application after a conviction.  By changing the phrase &ldquo;an acquittal of the accused person&rdquo; to &ldquo;the outcome of the trial&rdquo;, it is made clear that the protection afforded by section 7 to the complainant continues after the trial, regardless of whether the accused is acquitted or convicted.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;15.&mdash;In any proceedings under this Act or the Principal Act the Director of Public Prosecutions may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  act to ensure that all proposed witnesses, except gardaí and certain professional witnesses, would see a copy of their statements and would notify any alterations or additions to a named prosecuting lawyer,</P>
      <P>(b)  have a pre-trial consultation with all witnesses,</P>
      <P>(c)  make available a familiarisation course to the complainant on procedure and layout of the court.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had considerable discussion on this issue on Committee Stage and I hoped <Col N="962" /> the Minister would have come back, at this Stage, with an acceptable formula. The Minister took the view on Committee Stage that he would set up some form of negotiation procedure with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, to ensure that there would be a level of consultation available between the victim and the State prosecutors prior to a case being brought to court.  The Minister gave considerable thought to the question of the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>If we are going to tackle this very real problem, then it should be provided for in the legislation and not left to be dealt with through informal discussions, phone calls between offices at a later stage or on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The trauma a victim endures was commented on by Deputies from all sides and I think there is general agreement on this issue.  Only today we heard about the unfortunate predicament of a victim who felt unable to proceed with her evidence of an alleged rape simply because, she said, she was not up to it and did not want her children to become involved.  The trauma of this unfortunate victim was compounded by her being held by the court to be in contempt of court.  It is sad that in this day and age someone in her predicament should receive such a sanction from the courts.  Nevertheless, the law as it stands did not allow the court any room for manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>Our amendment, or an approach along the same lines, would ensure that today's misfortunate incident would not be repeated.  There would be a proper level of consultation between the legal officers of the State and the victim and there would be a familiarisation course for the victims of rape.  This was recommended by the all-party Dáil Committee on Women's Rights in the mid-eighties.  It is four years since that report was published and we need to address the lack of support, the present lack of comfort and the lack of counselling services for these victims.  It is important that the methods of comfort and counselling employed would be along the lines suggested in our amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> A victim should have the opportunity to go over the likely questions she will be asked in a witness box.  I venture that far because of the great personal trauma involved for a victim, realising that the State does not, strictly speaking, act on her behalf but on its own behalf.  The present system runs the risk of compounding the difficulties because of the absence of consultation and the absence of close relations between the victim and the State prosecuting team prior to and during a trial.</P>
    <P>I realise that there are difficulties &mdash; the Minister adverted to these &mdash; but, on balance, I believe it is important that we give statutory effect to a procedure rather than allow different officers of the law to take different views in different circumstances. That could give rise to even more serious difficulties.  I hope the Minister will accept our amendment.  In the event of his not accepting it, I hope he will put forward some more definite and precise proposals as to how we might address this problem.  If we allow the legislation to pass through the House without addressing this problem we will be leaving out something of very real importance to the unfortunate victims of these crimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate I gave an account to the House of the measures being implemented by the Director of Public Prosecutions to reduce the trauma and sense of alienation felt by some complainants in the case of rape trials.  This amendment very neatly summarises that account and proposes to enshrine it in legislation.</P>
      <P>I have no objections to the measures listed in the amendment but I see no need for them to be included in the Bill.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is already implementing these measures and this amendment will not spur him on to any greater efforts.  I have been assured by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that he does not require any specific legislative authority to implement these measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> It is my view that inserting this provision in the Bill would serve no useful purpose.  Indeed, it might call into question the ability of the Director of Public Prosecutions to implement these types of measures without specific statutory authority.  In the circumstances I must oppose the amendment but I want to assure the Deputies that the proposal put forward in their amendment will be put into effect.  I want to refer to what I would regard as a very important initiative in the provision of legal back-up for the victims of the horrendous crime of rape and the other crimes being dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As stated during the Committee Stage debate the question of separate legal aid for the complainant was examined by the Law Reform Commission and was strongly rejected.  The Government agreed with the views of the Law Reform Commission on this issue.  The Commission in their consultation paper, pointed out that it is already perfectly permissible for a woman who has been raped to consult a lawyer and to bring a lawyer with her, in the capacity of a friend, to the court during the hearing of the trial.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I agreed to look at whether the cost of a complainant employing a lawyer in this capacity could be met under the legal aid scheme.</P>
    <P>There is already a provision in the civil legal aid scheme under which legal advice may be given in connection with criminal proceedings where the matter arises out of the same circumstances that have already given rise to the grant of civil legal aid or advice.  In such a situation the board's solicitor would provide &ldquo;such additional services to the assisted person in respect of the criminal proceedings to the extent that a solicitor in private practice would do&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this provision has relevance in the context of this Bill.  It is likely that with the removal of the marital rape exemption more use will be made of paragraph 3.1.3 (1).  For instance, having received legal aid to obtain a barring order, a wife would be entitled to avail of this provision if she was a complainant <Col N="965" /> in a rape charge against her husband arising out of the same circumstances.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to make the necessary changes to apply paragraph 3.1.3 (1) of the scheme to victims of rape, rape under section 4 and aggravated sexual assault, married and unmarried whether these victims have already received legal services under the civil legal aid scheme.  In other words, I propose to extend the scheme so that the victims of these offences will be entitled to consult a legal aid solicitor and to be accompanied to the court by that solicitor during the trial.  That key issue concerns each Member of this House and groups outside the House who have been keenly interested in the crime of rape.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the trauma felt by the victim in the surroundings of the court and having to face the accused who would not have been seen by the victim since the crime was committed.  From now on the Director of Public Prosecutions will ensure that all proposed witnesses, except gardaí and certain professional witnesses, see a copy of the statements and will notify any alterations or additions to a named prosecuting lawyer.  There will be a pre-trial consultation with all witnesses and a familiarisation course will be available to the complainant on the procedure and layout of the court.  I am going further and extending the legal aid system to the victims of rape, rape under section 4 and aggravated sexual assault, married or unmarried, whether the victims have already received legal services under the civil legal aid scheme.  It will be a major step forward, giving reassurance, comfort and guidance to the victims of rape as they face the trauma of the trial.  It was requested by many concerned people and I have great pleasure in announcing it today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obviously heartened and pleased by this announcement which arises from a specific amendment of mine on Committee Stage.  I had sought to reintroduce it on Report Stage and to find a device to get around the <Col N="966" /> difficulty that my proposal would represent a charge on the Exchequer.  The Minister undertook on Committee Stage to look at this matter and could not have been any more responsive.  He has done exactly what the amendment asked.  A complainant giving evidence has the right to be legally advised independently of his or her position with regard to the law, the procedures and the likely conduct of the trial.  I had tried to write in a provision of the right of consultation, no more than that.  The Minister referred to difficulties regarding participation in the trial and I accepted those difficulties, recognising that there would be huge constitutional and procedural difficulties.  I tried to talk about the rights of consultation so that the solicitor retained would have some authority to be advised as to what was happening on the prosecution side, without playing an active role at the trial.</P>
      <P>The Minister might ask the law centres to monitor their progress and effectiveness in helping the victim in this area. If they experience difficulties, perhaps they should report back to him.  This should be done so that the very good idea behind this provision will not be set at nought and the lawyer will not be frozen out or cold-shouldered or not talked to by the gardaí or whoever might have primary responsibility for the investigation and prosecution.  He or she might seek to intervene on behalf of a client.  This provision will help substantially to give reassurance to the victim going to court. There will be an opportunity for the victim to talk to somebody in the calm of an office.  The type of reassurance and help that is given to these people by the Rape Crisis Centre and others will now be available in the technical, legal aspect. A trial represents a legal minefield for the victim.  I welcome the Minister's suggestion.  The solicitor assigned to the case will be able to see that the things suggested are being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that all these trials will be dealt with in the Central Criminal Court based in Dublin.  It is inevitable that it will be the law centres in Dublin, and perhaps that closest to the Four <Col N="967" /> Courts, which will be drawn upon to provide the service.  A brief will be passed over from a regional law centre in the provinces to the law centre on Ormond Quay.  The Minister might watch carefully to see that an undue burden is not placed on the staff there by this commission and might consider the allocation of resources to that centre.</P>

      <P>Extending to the victim the services of a lawyer and the free legal aid scheme removes one of the major defects in the Bill.  All of us had asked the Minister to look seriously at this matter on Committee Stage.  I welcome his decision, which will also be welcomed by the concerned organisations who made submissions to all of us.</P>
      <P>In cases such as gang rapes there could be three or six defendants, all legally represented, and the victim could be queried by the legal representative for each of them, while she had no legal assistance.  That was blatantly unfair. Without this provision the legislation would be much weaker.  I am glad the Minister has listened not only to us but to the representations made outside this House.  We should all thank him for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I welcome the Minister's announcement I want to address the amendment in my name and that of Deputies O'Keeffe, Fennell and Flanagan.  I welcome the arrangement made with the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure that the provisions of this amendment are carried out.  The reason we believe it might be useful and effective in the legislation is that we are aware of pressures on offices at times.  It is possible due to pressures on time or staff the complainant might be denied the opportunity of entering pre-trial consultations and familiarisation as proposed in the amendment.  The Minister has been assured that the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will provide such assistance.  If this is not to be included in the legislation I ask the Minister to monitor the position and ensure that the office of the Director of <Col N="968" /> Public Prosecutions makes us aware of any difficulties or obstacles being encountered in the consultations and in providing the support proposed in the amendment.  Such guidelines would be of help to the victim.</P>
      <P>I join with other Members in welcoming the Minister's announcement that he accepts that the complainant or victim should be entitled to legal representation, consultation and support. The Minister is aware that if such a recommendation was not accepted many women would not be in a position to pay for such support or consultation.  That would mean that there would be an inbuilt discrimination in the Bill which the Minister, and the rest of us, would abhor. By extending the scheme not alone has the Minister avoided this problem but he has given his imprimatur to the extension of support to the victim under the legal procedures.  I am aware &mdash; and the Minister has responded in a very positive way to this &mdash; that this was one of the most fundamental recommendations by the Rape Crisis Centre; based on their experience. They stressed the need for this support to ensure that the victims they counsel can process their complaints through the courts.</P>
      <P>Following Deputy Flanagan's reference to a case today I hope the Minister will ensure that never again will a victim find herself under such pressure in a court that not alone will she not go ahead with the case but will face the added pressure of facing contempt of court proceedings. I hope the Minister will ensure that never again will a complainant or victim be put under such pressure or face such an injustice.  The extension of the scheme is welcomed by the Rape Crisis Centre, the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and Deputies on this side of the House who see it as a fundamental support.  As a result the Bill has been strengthened considerably. I would like to think that arising out of this extension the victims of rape will have a sense of confidence in the procedures, something they were never in a position to experience up to now.</P>

The extension of this scheme, under the normal rules of eligibility which apply to the civil legal aid scheme, should lead us to a position where financial circumstances will never prevent a woman in the future getting the protection she is entitled to when she goes before a court as the complainant in a case involving this horrendous crime of rape.  I am pleased to be able to announce this extension.</P>

      <P>As our reasons for taking the amendment have been very effectively argued by my colleagues I do not intend to go over the same ground.  I have discussed with my colleagues the reaction of the Minister to our amendment and have to say that he has approached it in a reasonable way.  He has, to a large extent, taken on board the points made.  He has indicated that he will ensure that these views are passed on to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and has confirmed that the specific points raised in the debate will be taken on board by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In addition, he has extended the civil legal aid scheme to the victims of rape.  In those circumstances, and on the basis that the situation will continue to be monitored by the Minister, I and my colleagues have come to the conclusion that the Minister's approach should be given a chance.  We are prepared to give it that chance and withdraw the amendment.  We would also like to indicate to the Minister that if it does not work we will raise the issue in the House again.</P>

      <P>May I say before the Deputy proceeds that amendments Nos. 8 and 9 have, after careful consideration, been allowed while similar amendments were ruled out of order on Committee Stage.  As the definition of rape has been widened by way of Committee Stage amendment it has been decided to give the Deputy the benefit of the doubt in relation to these amendments. However, I must advise the Deputy that he should confine his contribution to his amendments as they relate specifically to the extended definition of rape in the context of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 9, column (4), to delete the entry opposite Reference Number 1, and substitute &ldquo;Sections 61 and 62.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to articulate on these amendments as they are vitally important. They present the Government with an opportunity to tidy up, if no more, the legislation generally in this area which <Col N="971" /> is now necessary, as the Chair correctly pointed out, arising out of the very good work the Minister did on Committee Stage in extending the definition of rape to include a gender neutral concept embracing an act against a man or woman by a man or woman.  It is important, therefore, that we do not overlook the fact that some of the laws in this area which date back as far as 1861 and 1885 will be somewhat inconsistent with the intentions of the Legislature in 1990 when the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I am referring in particular, as suggested in the Schedule, to section 11 of the 1885 Act which I suggest should be repealed.  That section provides as follows:</P>
    <P>Any male person who, in public or private, commits or is a party to the commission of or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of any act of gross indecency with another male person shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and on being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years with or without hard labour. </P>
    <P>Therefore, any male adult who engages in sexual activity with another male adult in private can under the provisions of section 11 of the 1885 Act be found guilty of an offence and sent to prison.  That basic concept is repeated in the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act which states in section 61, under the curious heading &mdash; I suppose it was not curious at the time &mdash;&ldquo;Unnatural Offences&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Whomsoever shall be convicted of the abominable crime of buggery committed either with mankind or with any animal shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be kept in penal servitude for life or for any term not less than ten years. </P>
    <P>Section 62 goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Whomsoever shall attempt to commit the said abominable crime or shall be guilty of an assault with intent <Col N="972" /> to commit the same or of any indecent assault upon any male person shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and on being convicted thereof shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be kept in penal servitude for any term not exceeding ten years and not less than three years or to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years with or without hard labour.</P>
    <P>Therefore, that Act insists that a minimum sentence of three years penal servitude, without the court having the discretion to suspend it or otherwise, should be handed down.</P>
    <P>Our laws at present provide, in those two sections I have quoted, that male sexual activity between consenting adults, in private or elsewhere, amounts to an offence.  I do not believe that is the intention of this House.  Certainly it is not the intention as reflected in the extended definition the Minister now provides as to what would constitute &ldquo;rape&rdquo; in the context.</P>
    <P>It is an amendment the Minister should take on board having regard to the judgment of the European Court in the Norris decision, which case was initiated in 1987 by way of investigation, and judgment delivered last year.  At the time I remember the then Tánaiste indicated that it was something the Government would actively investigate, the indication being that something would be done to meet the judgment.  Having spoken recently to Senator Norris I understand that there has been no progress made. Sadly, it would appear that the case may revert to the European Court for reexamination in the light of the inactivity on the part of our Government to meet that judgment.</P>
    <P>I contend that acceptance of the simple amendment I am advancing in the context of this Bill would put the matter at nought.  I contend it would take out of our law the criminalisation of offences of acts between consenting male adults.  It would then leave us in the position in which the provisions of section 4 will then be the regulatory ones; in that such acts &mdash; accepting the Minister's logic &mdash; if <Col N="973" /> amounting to assault will constitute &ldquo;rape&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill. Therefore, we would be providing for the non-consensual by the use of the word &ldquo;assault&rdquo;.  Then all others &mdash; the consensual, non-assault activities &mdash; will not and should not be offences.  That is what the European Court judgment has told us in the Norris case; that is our duty as signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>I am saying that, taking the benefit of the gender neutral definition provided by the Minister, we can now with safety &mdash; and universality of approach &mdash; delete those anachronisms from our legislative codes which are now out of date and which we are now told are by the European Court on Human Rights inappropriate within the context of our Constitution and the European Convention. It is very simple; it does not require the Minister to initiate finely attended legislation saying what should or should not be an offence.  I am asking the Minister to be courageous.  I accept that there may be the moral minority out there who will scream and say something about it.  The Minister should remember that, even within his short term in office, he has taken remarkable, momentous steps, such as the abolition, once and for all, of capital punishment in this country. We were told there would be an outcry about it but the Minister's courageous step did not lead to such an outcry.</P>
    <P>In the course of this Bill we have introduced earth-shattering amendments, such as, for the first time, the concept that a husband can rape his wife.  It has taken courage to do those things but the Minister has done them.  I am suggesting that here is another small, neat, concise way in which the Minister could respond to a judgment of the European Court, bring our laws into some repute and respond to the modern desires of our community, doing so in the knowledge that there are the protections to deal with the non-consensual area enshrined in section 4.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to accede to these amendments, to amend the Schedule, to refer to the deletion of the three <Col N="974" /> sections I have read &mdash; section 11 of the 1885 Act and sections 61 and 62 of the 1861 Act.  In so doing the Minister will have resolved the Norris dilemma, brought our laws in line with the European Convention and will have dealt quietly and courageously with what will be ultimately a very contentious and no doubt divisive debate that some Government at some stage will have to handle. Let us deal with it now quietly and courageously.</P>

      <P>This Bill is not an appropriate vehicle by which to tackle this question. In this Bill we are dealing with non-consensual acts often involving violence such as rape.  It is not intended to deal with sexual acts between consenting adults.  The issues raised by homosexual consensual acts are different and should be dealt with separately.  Furthermore, the amendments tabled make no effort to deal with a number of vital issues that would have to be addressed in this area. In particular, they do not address the question of the age of consent in respect of homosexual acts, the question of such acts taking place in public and questions relating to male prostitution.  I might point out that the amendment would not decriminalise buggery as the common law offence would remain unaffected.</P>
      <P>The report of the Law Reform Commission on Child Sexual Abuse, which is relevant in this area, was published at the end of September only and the commission's recommendations are now under consideration.  I will submit my proposals to Government in due course.</P>

As was stated, it does address a problem to which the Government have not addressed themselves in spite of the judgment of the European Court.  It is a matter that must be tackled before we fall into even further disrepute with the Court of Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> I wonder whether it would be too simple &mdash; at the literal stroke of a pen &mdash; to repeal sections 61 and 62 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861?  It would appear that it would be technically correct to include in the Schedule to this Bill a notice to the effect that those sections are hereby repealed.  However, I am not so sure that that would address the difficulties sufficiently.  In holding my powder I might seek further information from the Minister &mdash; notwithstanding the fact we are on Report Stage &mdash; in that the matter has been introduced and is timely and welcome.  I would ask the Minister to be somewhat more specific in reminding the House of the present position; when he hopes the Government will respond to the matter and the type of response he would envisage at this stage.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the principle of the amendment.  However, it may be something of an over-simplification at this time.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed on this amendment.  I would like to respond to what the Minister has said.  He talked about the problems which might arise if the amendment is accepted.  First, let me say that the amendment, if accepted, would take from our Statute Book three very outdated and offensive propositions which I gather from what the Minister and Deputy Flanagan said do not have the support of this House at this stage. Consequently it would be very useful simply to expunge them and put them aside.  What we put in their place obviously would be as a result of the recommendations of the child sexual abuse report, part of which I understand will be addressed in the Child Care Bill and part, maybe, in separate legislation once the Minister has made his recommendations.</P>
      <P>In the context of that report, the consultation paper has been available since August 1989 and recommends at page 204 very succinctly the deletion of the three sections I am proposing should be deleted.  The proposition is not a new one foisted on any of us.  It is being done of necessity, not because of anything done by way of legislation in the European Parliament or any other European country.  For the benefit of Deputy McGahon let me say that in a judgment the European Court has ruled that our laws are out of line with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, of which this country is a signatory. We are obliged by that convention to respond and to bring our laws into line with the judgment of the European Court on Human Rights.  That is where the Norris case came from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> The Minister said problems would be left: the age of consent, can be dealt with in new legislation, the offences of indecency come under the 1887 legislation dealing with exposure of the person in public; male prostitution is as much a problem as female prostitution, which is not dealt with under our law at this stage, although the provisions are there they are not acted upon because of other constitutional and practical difficulties the Director of Public Prosecutions has, and the problem of the common law offence still remains.  Here is an opportunity to put down a marker to indicate to those who are arguing for reform of the law in this area that there is a disposal there, a willingness on the part of Government to respond to judgments from abroad and from pressures within.  We have had the Law Reform Commission proposition before us since August 1989.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, to the extent that I can be heartened with what the Minister says, I am pleased that we have had the opportunity to ventilate our views in this matter.  I take it he has not closed the door on this matter, that it will be recommended to Government in due course and that we will have legislation here sooner rather than later so that we will not be embarrassed again at European level.  In those circumstances I withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>We have had a very constructive debate on this legislation.  I will bring it back to the Seanad with the amendments that have been made here in the House.  I am proud of this legislation in its present form which resulted from the major amendments that have been made in section 4.  The change made in relation to legal <Col N="978" /> representation for victims of rape and the major change in relation to rape within marriage that is included in this legislation, will be a major protection for women.  It is my hope that I will get an early date in the Seanad and that this legislation will be on the Statute Book by Christmas.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Members for their co-operation. I think it is significant that in legislation of this type which has the potential for division we have proceeded through Committee and Report Stages over three days without once dividing. That is the House working at its very best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what the Minister has said and welcome the passage of this legislation through this House and the way it was treated by all sides.  I pay tribute to the Minister for his openness in listening, accepting amendments, telling us why he felt some amendments could not be accepted and leaving himself open to bringing back the legislation on Report Stage.  Such a move is helpful, healthy and, as he said, an example of this House working at its best when legislation is treated at that level.  I believe that from that type of co-operation comes our best legislation.  When we started the Committee Stage we thought it would take much longer to debate this legislation but it gives us a feeling of great satisfaction to have put this Bill through so quickly.  This is an historic Bill.  The year 1981 was the last time we had reforming legislation dealing with rape. I was a member of the Council for the Status of Women at that stage and we put forward amendments which were not accepted.  It is timely and appropriate that the Minister should work towards having this comprehensive reforming Bill which, as Deputy McCartan said, will bring about remarkable and earth shattering changes not just in legislation but in attitudes and the Minister has achieved that through this legislation today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to think that we will beat the clock and that, before the tenth anniversary of the 1981 amending legislation, <Col N="979" /> the Minister will have this legislation through the Seanad by the end of 1990 so that we will have in place all the support systems the Minister has promised and which will be monitored.  Apart from the extent to which the Minister has worked towards producing fine legislation, one of the things we on this side of the House appreciate is his promise to allow the Bill to come back to this House if and when the situation warrants it.</P>
    <P>I look forward to other legislation referred to today.  The Minister has given commitments to introduce legislation which has a link to pornography.  We will discuss that with the Minister.  I would like to think the rest of the legislation he introduces will get as moderate, advanced and co-operative a passage as this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Barnes in congratulating the Minister on this very progressive legislation.  Not for the first time he has surprised many people with the breadth of the reforming legislation he has brought before this House in the last year.  We thank him for it.</P>
      <P>The major areas my party considered necessary to be included in a Bill like this have all been met.  In the broadening of the definition of rape, marital rape is no longer excluded, rape trials will be held in the Central Criminal Court and there will be legal representation for victims. These are all major advances in this area. The Minister has listened to the advice of groups and concerned individuals outside this House and to Members on these benches, as well as having his own priorities in this area.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Flanagan, I am delighted this Bill will go before our new President. I am sure she will welcome signing this progressive legislation.  While I have been moved to a different area of responsibility for my party, I am happy about the enactment of this important legislation.  Again I congratulate the Minister on what he has done.  Indeed, I would welcome any further legislation of a progressive nature that he might bring forward.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with the other Deputies in congratulating the Minister on this legislation.  It is remarkable that it is the second piece of reforming legislation in the area of rape law generally and its practice within the decade.  I do not think any other area of the law, criminal or otherwise, has received such attention, much needed attention.  It is a reflection of the good work of people campaigning and working in the field, particularly the rape crisis centres&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that has brought this legislation before us and brought it back to us in a real way.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable legislation in terms of the way we have amended fundamental principles of law, particularly with regard to the extension of the definition of rape and the ending of the marital exemption &mdash; from now on husbands deservedly should be, will be, prosecuted for rape. The proposition that someone of 14 years and under could not commit rape has been abolished; the insult to women represented by the need for corroboration of their testimony, some suggestion that they were unable to give evidence in their own right and on their own word, has been abolished, and this is to be welcomed. The procedure where from here on trials will now be dealt with by the Central Criminal Court reflects the attitude of this House and the community generally that rape is to be considered a serious and invidious crime.  We have also improved the area in the Bill with regard to the right of cross-examination, and protecting the anonymity of the accused.</P>
      <P>All that is to be welcomed.  Let us hope, however, that when this legislation is put into practice it will lead to the result all of us want, that we will have less of the heinous crime of rape and more of those who commit it behind bars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody in this House is united in their condemnation of the appalling crime of rape. While my views as to what should be <Col N="981" /> done with the perpetrators of rape might be considered as being a little extreme, certainly in this Assembly, I believe that my views would find a fair measure of support at street level, in the real world outside the Houses of Parliament.</P>
      <P>However, I do applaud the Minister for the changes he has brought in in this Bill.  There is the widening of the definition of rape, although for the life of me, I fail to see how a charge of marital rape can be proved; one would need an action replay that would not always be available in every boudoir.  However, the breaking of barring orders will obviously help to bring people to justice in that area.</P>
      <P>I would like to sound a warning bell about having to accept changes from Europe.  I believe that Europe offers a variation on a theme for sexual practices, some of which are absolutely mind-boggling and could never be accepted by the Irish people.  That is something we will have to grapple with in the years to come. I believe that most of the variations of the theme I spoke about are totally unacceptable to the masses of the Irish people, and I am gratified by the Minister's assurance that the outrageous proposal that is currently before the Dutch Parliament to reduce the age of sexual consent to 13 years will never be acceptable in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two questions I would like to ask the Minister.  Can he confirm that most sexual offenders in prison in this country are, indeed, recidivists, that is, people who have transgressed in a sexual way on two, three or more occasions? Can he define, in layman's terms, what a life sentence means?  Does it mean six and a half years?  Does it mean nine and a quarter years, or does it mean 45 years? I would also like to bring to the Minister's attention, although it has been brought very forcibly to his attention, a report in last Tuesday's <i>Irish Independent</i> of the appalling case that occurred in the Minister's own backyard in, I think, either Swords or Skerries where a young man twice raped a 78 year old semi-invalid and, the following night, attempted to do the same to two other people.  Can the <Col N="982" /> Minister give an assurance that the sentence that was handed down will mean what it says, 12 years?</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies to the questions raised by my colleague, I would like to congratulate him on two counts, first on effecting such a speedy passage for this legislation through the House in recent weeks and, second, on accepting and coming into the House with a number of amendments, 32 in all.  One only has to reflect on this legislation as against what was first introduced in the Seanad 18 months ago to realise that there have been fundamental changes for the better.  This legislation will provide a very strong deterrent against those in society who wish to engage in crime of a sexual nature.  It will provide a measure of support to the victims of crime.  This is something that has not been given the notoriety it should have got.  This Bill will provide that measure of support.  More than anything else, the passage of this legislation will allow men and women to feel that little bit safer that crimes of a heinous nature will not be perpetrated against them because this legislation will provide a strong deterrent.</P>
      <P>I sincerely congratulate the Minister. It has been an enjoyable few weeks on Committee and Report Stages teasing out the matters.  It was a measure of the debate that the House did not divide on any matter.  Certainly not much legislation passes through Committee Stage or Report Stage that can have that label attached to it and the Minister must be complimented in that regard.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Members for their very kind expressions in relation to the manner in which this Bill has passed through this House and the protections it will now provide particularly for women within our society, whether within or outside of marriage.  It should provide them with a protection that they have not had heretofore.  It will provide them with the psychological protection of the presence of a legal representative and assistance <Col N="983" /> in relation to familiarisation with court procedures.  It will provide different protections which it is only right and proper should be in our legislation.  I would like to thank the Members.</P>
      <P>I would like to acknowledge the work put in in the last number of weeks by the officials of my Department in relation to the number of amendments on Report Stage.  They have been quite superb, as they always have been, but they have been quite outstanding in this case.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to some of the points made by Deputy McGahon.  It is true that in sexual cases there is an unfortunate habit of repeating the offences.  I cannot tell the Deputy the exact percentages of those in prison but if the Deputy would like to put down a question I can get him the answer.  We are of course involved in treating those who want to be treated within prison.  We are trying to assist them and ensure that on their release we will not have a repeat of the offences.  Life imprisonment is normally around ten years.  It was eight years and has been increased to ten years on average.  Life means life but in practice it has been working out at about ten years. If anybody else wants to put questions to me we can deal with them at ordinary Question Time.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;on a date not later than 2 years from the passing of the Bill by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the Bill on Second Stage but I pointed out to the Minister that I would be making amendments to it.  I am firmly convinced that a certain time limit should be incorporated in this section.  As it stands, the Bill is rather open-ended.  The existing stipulation that commencement of the Act depends solely on the will of the Minister is too loose and I consider it inadequate.  I would ask the Minister to consider a period of two years which I consider to be reasonable.  There are other bodies who would be involved when the Bill becomes law such as harbour boards, local authorities, the Garda Síochána and others.  My first reaction was to oppose the section but if the Minister accepts this amendment which proposes two years as a reasonable timespan, I would be happy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled an amendment because I am fearful of the provision in the Bill which suggests that the Act will come into operation on such day or days for the different provisions.  There is a tendency to pass legislation in this House without making the subsequent orders.  Therefore, we end up with the time having been spent in the Houses of the Oireachtas and Bills being left on the shelf and not put into operation.  Fearful that a similar position would arise in relation to this very important legislation, I tabled an amendment to section 2 which proposes that it be enacted not later than one year from the passing of the Bill by the Oireachtas.  I do not believe there is <Col N="985" /> anything in the Bill that would prevent it being enacted within a year.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation and it is vital that we act as quickly as possible to prevent further pollution of the seas around our coastline.  It is equally important that not alone do we specifically set down a date on which the legislation would become law but that the Minister uses every opportunity outside the State to ensure that all other member states and other parties to the MARPOL Agreement have their legislation dealing with this matter implemented.  I tabled the amendment because of my fear that the legislation would not be implemented, because of the tradition where legislation has remained on the shelf and has not been implemented in the past, and because of the importance of the protection of our seas.</P>
      <P>We discussed in detail on Second Stage what is involved, and action needs to be taken.  It is not enough to say: &ldquo;We, the Irish Government have adhered to the MARPOL Agreement and have introduced a Bill which deals with Annex (v) of that Agreement&rdquo;.  It is not enough for Government Ministers to say that in speeches and at various meetings at EC and international level.  A date for the implementation of the legislation must be laid down and I propose that it be within a year of the date of the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party oppose this section, but I would be prepared to accept the amendment that the legislation be implemented at a minimum within a year.  This is a very important Bill which we will spend some time discussing and on which many people have worked. We have been told that if the Minister so wishes, the Bill will not be brought into law.  What is the point in our discussing such a Bill if it is not going to be brought into law?  It will be passed in this House and yet will not be brought into law if the Minister so wishes.  That makes a nonsense of legislation and of our position here in the House.  We will be going through various sections and suggesting amendments but what does it <Col N="986" /> matter at the end of the day if the Bill is going to lie there until the Minister, or whatever Minister in the future, does not feel like bringing it into law?  It is an insult to the House to put such a section at the beginning of a Bill.</P>
      <P>I have not seen this happen &mdash; possibly it did arise &mdash; in any Bill that I can recall but I have seen cases where sections or parts of sections were not brought into effect until the Minister said so.  I have never seen a provision at the start of a Bill which states that if the Minister so wishes, he will not bring this Bill into law.  Why is the Minister bringing the Bill before us?  Is it a cosmetic exercise?  We will discuss the Bill for some days and give the impression to the general public that we are bringing in a Bill about sea pollution, discharges into the sea and so on.  People will think the Minister is great to have brought in the Bill, but after it goes through all Stages and is passed it will not become law unless the Minister so wishes.  He can decide to bring it into law within a year, two years, five years or ten years.  If this section is left as it is, it means we have no power at all.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party favour the deletion of this section which states that the legislation shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister, by order, appoints, and different days may be appointed for different provisions.  We have no idea what a Minister &mdash; or civil servants who are probably making the decisions &mdash; will do in relation to bringing provisions into law on a day or time in the future.  Little bits here and there might be brought in at different times and it makes a nonsense of the Bill.  The section should be deleted but, if the Minister does not agree, at least there should be a time set when it must come in.  After going through the whole charade in this House of talking about sea pollution and discharges, and the wonderful things we will do as a result of the powers in this Bill, the Minister may decide at the end of the day not to implement such powers.  I ask the Minister to withdraw the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the purpose of the <Col N="987" /> amendments put down by Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan and Deputy Taylor-Quinn.  It is an earnest of their commitment to achieve a Bill in connection with sea pollution and the MARPOL Convention. The nature of the Bill is such that, like the MARPOL Convention, it lends itself to implementation of some parts ahead of others.  There is a great deal of technical detail &mdash; as Members who have studied the MARPOL Convention will know &mdash; associated with some of the annexes of the Convention and amendments can also be made to them.  The House should reflect on that.  Some regulations will take a longer time to implement than others and we do not want the implementation of some parts deferred or delayed pending the sorting out of some technical details on another part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to terminating the indiscriminate disposal of ships' waste in the marine environment as part of the environment action programme and, consequently, annex (v) on garbage is a top priority.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputy Mac Giolla is substituting for his spokesperson but I cannot understand his contribution.  He has been a Member of this House for some time and what he says he does not remember seeing before in Bills is quite common. For example, in the 1988 Act dealing with oil pollution of the sea, section 2 states that this Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister shall, by order, appoint and different days may be appointed for different provisions. The kind of &ldquo;scare&rdquo; position which Deputy Mac Giolla outlined of it not being implemented did not apply in that case, nor will it apply in the Bill.  I reject the amendment on the grounds I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification from the Minister because the only explanation he has given is that he is very anxious to bring in one particular annex of the Convention and that he does not want it to be delayed until all the other technical difficulties have been resolved. As has been done frequently, he can keep <Col N="988" /> that option for a particular area where there will be a technical difficulty, make it the exception where the Minister will have power, and leave the remainder in. The Minister said that there was no problem in regard to annex (v) so why not ensure that it is brought in immediately and that his power of preventing the operation of the Bill coming into effect be implemented in relation to the other sections in regard to which there are technical difficulties?  He should let us know what the technical difficulties are because this section gives him wide powers and his explanation does not hold water.  He may, by order, appoint different days for each section in the Bill and the different annexes and, when the Bill has gone through, he could, by order, implement annex (v).  The Minister's explanation is not valid, obviously he saw it somewhere else and decided to bring it in without any relevance to the provisions of the Bill.  Why can a part of the Bill not come into law on the day it is passed by this House?  If that is not the case, will the Minister correct me and let us know the sections in relation to which there are technical problems?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said on Second Stage that he proposed to give effect to the five annexes of the MARPOL Convention.  On that occasion I questioned the Minister because I thought it was highly unusual to introduce the five together.  Indeed, it was unrealistic. For instance, a ship would have to bring sewage and garbage ashore and dispose of it there.  I pointed out that some harbour authorities &mdash; such as Cork Harbour Authority &mdash; have no method of disposing of sewage from ships, or indeed from the city for that matter.  I said that two years was a realistic time to set for a harbour or local authority to put facilities in place given that the money would come from Central Funds.  Presumably, the authorities could then provide facilities for ships to discharge their sewage and garbage.  I did not pluck the two year period from the air, I know that most local authorities are starved of cash at present and could not possibly provide <Col N="989" /> any facilities from their own funding.  I expected that there would have to be discussions between the Department of the Marine and local authorities to put such facilities in place which would allow ships to dispose of their garbage and sewage.  I asked for the two year period because the Minister indicated he would put the five annexes in place without delay.  If he had indicated he intended introducing them on a phased basis I would have been happier but that is not the case.  I am a little nervous of giving the Minister a free hand to impose such legislation as he pleases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reaction to the amendment because it was put down in good faith and to help him.  There is a need for a sense of urgency within the Department and the relevant authorities, such as the various harbour boards around the country, to provide the type of facilities which are necessary.  The facilities about which we are talking are not magically sophisticated or beyond the bounds of putting into operation fairly fast because we are talking about very basic facilities which have already been provided in airports and there has not been any difficulty in regard to them.</P>
      <P>I do not see the problem.  It was evident from the Minister's Second Stage contribution that he is genuine in relation to annex (v), but there are things which need to be taken seriously.  Unless there is a time limit, urgent action will not be taken and the seas will continue to be polluted.  That is not good enough.  We are only too aware of the extent of pollution being caused and the lack of ministerial powers in relation to ships coming into our waters.  It is imperative to put an operational date on this Bill so that this vitally important legislation can be implemented at an early date.  It will not be good enough to put this through both Houses without having the ability and facility to put it into operation.  I hope the Minister recognises that that is why I have tabled my amendment.</P>

      <P>to make a provision for the prevention of pollution of the sea by oil and other substances; and to give effect to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships done at London on the 2nd day of November, 1973, as amended by the Protocol done at London on the 17th day of February, 1978; and to give effect to the Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Pollution by Substances other than Oil done at London on the 2nd day of November, 1973; and to provide for the repeal of the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts....</P>
      <P>It is because of the urgency of the matter that this Bill was constructed in this way. I have to ask the House to accept my word that I am anxious to put this on the Statute Book.  The more expeditiously and efficiently we do this, the sooner what is waiting since 1973 will be enshrined in our legislation and the sooner we will get on with the job of dealing with pollution.</P>
      <P>As mentioned already, Deputy Mac Giolla indicated that he never saw this in a Bill before.  It is quite a common part of a Bill, but it does not necessarily inhibit or delay the putting into effect of what we do in this House.  I am asking the House to accept <i>bona fide</i> that I want to have this legislation put through this House and the Seanad to become part of our law as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the personal commitment of the Minister this evening, but there could be a Cabinet reshuffle in the morning, or within the next week and while we know that the Minister has made a fair effort since he became Minister and while we appreciate his commitment, his successor might not have the same commitment or give the same priority to this and it could be left on the shelf.  That would be serious and that is why I am pressing this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister in reading out the Title illustrated that we are way behind other nations when it comes to pollution.  We are starting from a disadvantage.  Nevertheless, our waters are relatively pollution free.  By asking the Minister to consider a two year timescale we are not asking him to do something outlandish.  If the Minister cannot accept this amendment for a reason <Col N="992" /> which is beyond our knowledge at this time he could undertake to come back to the House at a later date.  I would like to see the two year timescale stitched into this Bill.  I gave serious thought to this amendment and taking into account the authorities that would be involved in the implementation of this legislation, the two years is a reasonable timescale.  I am sorry the Minister does not see it in that light although the Minister has credited us with the aim of getting this into law as fast as possible.</P>

      <P>Lest the House be under any illusion about it, the fact that I am not accepting the amendment is not an indication that it is my purpose to delay longer than two years.  I hope to have it in place before the two year period, but I do not want to be constrained by a fixed period.</P>

      <Col N="995" /> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is cinnte de thairbhe an Bille seo atá Pairtí na nOibrí ag moladh chun Airteagail 2 agus 3 a leasú go ndeanfaí ionsaithe mí-ionraice ar Phairtí na nOibrí taobh istigh agus lasmuigh den Dáil.  Ar an ábhar sin ba mhaith liom a shoiléiriú don Dáil, ach go háirithe don phobal i gcoitinne, cén seasamh fadthéarmach atá ag an Pairtí i dtaca le haontu na tíre.</P>
    <P>Tnúthaíonn Pairtí na nOibrí le haontas pobal an oileáin bhig seo.  Tá sin ráite againn an oiread sin uair go gcuireann sé ionadh orm go bhfuil aon duine in amhras faoi.  Ach de réir cosúláchta tá siad ann. Arís tá amhras ann faoin chineál aontais atá i gceist againne.  I ndiaidh na díospóireachta seo tá súil agam nach mbeidh amhras ar bith ann a thuilleadh i dtaobh na ceiste seo.  Ba mhaith linn poblacht daonfhlathach soisialach, tuatach, frith-sheicteach a chruthú ar an oileán seo.</P>
    <P>Aithnímid an fíor thraidisiún Poblacht-ánach a shíolraíos ó Tone, na hÉireannaigh Aontaithe agus a lucht leanúna, a chuir béim ar aontas an phobail agus a dhiúltaigh don easontas a bhí agus atá préamhaithe sna reiligiúin éagsúla.  Sin traidisiún Pairtí na nOibrí &mdash; aontas.  Ach ní féidir an t-aontas sin a bhaint amach &mdash; aontas an phobail nó aontas na tíre &mdash; mar a dúirt Teachta Dála Tomás Mac Giolla chomh fada siar le Bealtaine 1972 sa Charraig Mhór, Contae Thír Eoghain &mdash; le pléascadh agus dúnmharbhú nó trí chogadh seicteach a thosú sa Tuaisceart. Bhí sin fíor beagnach fiche bliain ó shin agus tá sé lán chomh fíor an lá atá inniú ann.  Ar an dóigh céanna, agus sin an fáth a bhfuil an Bille seo os ár gcomhair, ní bheidh aontas ar bith ann choíche muna dtagann sé go daonlathúil.  Agus caithfidh an Dáil seo aitheantas a thabhairt don fíric sin.</P>
    <P>Is iomdha uair le linn na fiche bliain atá caite gur cháin gach páirtí sa Dáil an feachtas dúnmharaithe sa Tuaisceart.  Bhí sin ceart.  Ach ní leor é.  Cén fáth?  Ní leor é de bharr an tuigbhéail is féidir leis na Sealadaigh agus a lucht tacaíochta sa <Col N="996" /> bhaile agus thar lear a bhaint as Airteagail 2 agus 3.  Bheadh sé bómánta nó bíthiúnta ag an Dáil seo gan sin a aíthint. Agus tá dualgas orainne go léir gan aon leithscéal a thabhairt dona dúnmharfóirí, ó thaobh ar bith, leanstan leis an scrios agus an ár sa Tuaisceart.  Sin má táimid i ndáiríre faoi aontas a chothú go daonlathúil. Tá fhios agam go maith go mbeidh Baill ag éirí in mo dhiadh ag rá nach sin an chiall cheart atá leis na hAirteagail seo.  Impím orthu machnamh bomaite agus a gcuid focal a thomhais sa dóigh nach gcuirfear oiread is órlach le feachtas nimhneach, dúnmharach na Sealadach. Nuair a deirim sin níl mé ag tagairt don &ldquo;chiall dleathach&rdquo; a bhaineas le hAirteagail 2 agus 3 ach don tuigbheail mórálta, polaiticiúil, mar a chítear dúinne é, agus, creidim, do mór fhurmhór phobail Thuaisceart Éireann.  Agus mar an t-aon pháirtí amháin sa Dáil atá eagraithe fríd an Tuaisceart, creidim gur chóir don Dáil éisteacht go cúramach leis an méid atá le rá agam fiú muna n-aontaítear go hiomlán leis.</P>
    <P>Dar le hAondachtóirí sa Tuaisceart, agus tá sé intuighte tar éis na mílte dúnmharaithe agus gortuithe ón Abercorn i mBeal Feirste go Inis Ceithlinn, go gcruthaíonn Airteagail 2 agus 3 &ldquo;spás poiblí&rdquo; do na Sealadaigh agus ar a bharr sin go gciallaíonn sin go dtugann an Stát seo tacaíocht mhorálta don fheachtas atá dírithe ina éadan.</P>
    <P>Aithníonn Páirtí na nOibrí (agus is é seo tuigbheáil na nAondachtóirí chomh maith), nuair a deir na Sealadaigh &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo; go gciallaíonn sin &ldquo;Protestants Out&rdquo; go háirithe, agus gach duine eile nach bhfuil sásta luí síos roimh na Sealadaigh agus glacadh lena gcreideamh fuilteach nimhneach náisiúnta atá siad ag brú ar mhuintir na tíre seo le fiche bliain.  Tá dualgas orainn an rosc catha gránna sin a dhiúltú go glan díreach agus go macánta.</P>
    <P>Sin é díreach an cheist atá romhainn: an bhfuilimid a dhul a leigint do na Sealadaigh an &ldquo;spás poiblí&rdquo; sin a choinneáil agus a leathnú nó an bhfuilimid a dhul a dhiúltú aon láidreacht, aon dóchas, aon tacaíocht a bhaint as Bhunreacht Stáit seo Phoblacht na hEireann.  Ba chóir go mbeadh sé ar gach Teachta Dála an cheist <Col N="997" /> sin a fhreagairt agus fios aige nó aici muna leasaimid an Bunreacht go nglacfaidh na Sealadaigh leis go bhfuil an Dáil seo taobh thiar dá bhfeachtas gránna.  Ní áibhéil ar bith é a rá go bhfuil súile na tíre in a iomláine orainn ag an phointe seo.</P>
    <P>Agus ní áibhéil ar bith é ach an oiread cúrsaí an Tuaiscirt a chur i gcomparáid leis an Ghearmáin díreach sul a dtáinig na Nazis chun cumhachta.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil Hitler Éireannach ar an taobh líne ag fanacht le na sheans; is é atá i gceist agam meon-aigne na bpáirtithe polaitíochta i dtaca leis an &ldquo;spás poiblí&rdquo; a luaigh mé cheana, agus cé chomh toilteanach agus atá siad a chinntiú nach mbeidh seilbh ag na Sealadaigh ar an spás sin a thuilleadh.  Ba é sin tragóid na Gearmáine sna triocaidí nuair a theip glan ar na páirtithe daonlathacha seasamh le chéile le chinntiú nach mbeadh todhchaí ar bith ag Nazism sa spás poiblí. Caithfimid foghluim ón stair sin.  Is é mo bharúil, a Cheann Comhairle, muna dtaispeánaimid do phobal na hÉireann anois go bhfuil na ceachtanna staire foghlaimthe go maith againn nach fiú dúinn bheith ag gol agus ag mairgneach nuair a tharlaíonn uafás eile sa Tuaisceart.  Caithfimid Airteagail 2 agus 3 a leasú.  Tá sé d'oibleagáid orainn seasamh leis na daonlathas.</P>
    <P>This is, without doubt, an historic occasion.  First, it is the first time for more than 50 years that the question of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution has been debated in the Dáil, and second, because potentially there are sufficient Deputies in this House convinced that they should be revised and amended.</P>
    <P>I know that these Articles provoke strong emotions both among those who want to see them changed and among those who would wish to see them stay as they are, and the experience in this House in the past decade has been that the question of constitutional change has always produced extremely heated exchanges.  That, in itself, should not be an excuse for dodging issues.  Regardless of our views on the outcome of previous referenda, the fact is that the process of debate helped us all to reach a clearer <Col N="998" /> understanding of each other's position and strengthened our democratic process. It is my earnest wish that the debate on our Bill should be conducted in a calm, rational and reasonable manner, free of rancour or bitterness.  The debate will be watched carefully, not just on both parts of this island but also in Britain and throughout Europe.  The manner in which the House conducts this debate over the next two weeks and the fate of the Bill thereafter, will be a fair measure of our maturity as a Parliament.</P>
    <P>Our purpose in tabling this Bill was not to embarrass either of the parties in Government, to drive a wedge between them or to bring about the collapse of this Administration.  If this Bill is passed I do not consider that it should be viewed as a defeat for the Government but rather as a victory for reason and reform.</P>
    <P>It is now 53 years since what is known as de Valera's constitution was debated by the Dáil and then approved by the people in a referendum.  The late Seán Lemass was quoted as saying that our Constitution should be changed every 25 years &ldquo;as our society develops into a modern State&rdquo;.  Even if there were peace in Northern Ireland and even if these Articles did not cause offence to so many people in Northern Ireland, there would still be, after more than 50 years, a case for reviewing them anyway.  But the continuing Provisional IRA murder campaign with the clear evidence that the existence of Articles 2 and 3 in their present form constitute an impediment to political progress in Northern Ireland, provide compelling reasons why the revision of these Articles can no longer be deferred.</P>
    <P>I believe the time is right.  I believe the public mood is right.  I believe Members of this House on all sides must face up to their responsibilities to give political leadership.  We must lead public opinion and not wait to follow it.</P>
    <P>Some people might feel it is ironic that the only party in this House which is itself organised on a 32-County basis and the only party which has elected representatives on both sides of the Border should be the one which is introducing legislation <Col N="999" /> to tackle Articles 2 and 3.  I do not consider it ironic at all.  The unity of our party and the all-Ireland nature of its organisation is based on the free will and consent of our members.  If unity of this island is to come about, it must be on the basis of the free will and consent of all its people.  There can be no other way.  I believe also that the fact that we are organised in both states gives our party a particular insight into the problems of Northern Ireland, a unique ability to view issues from both sides of the Border, and a special appreciation of the way in which Articles 2 and 3 are perceived in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Social and political conditions on both sides of the Border have changed dramatically since our Constitution was adopted.  The Constitution was drafted within 15 years of a bitter civil war, when the memory of what many people considered to be the betrayal by the Boundary Commission was still fresh.  It was the decade of the economic war, and Britain still occupied a number of ports in the Twenty-six Counties.  The Constitution was put before the people at a time when most people considered that Partition would be a temporary phenomenon, which would not last for more than a few decades at the most.</P>
    <P>De Valera's document was seen by many as a &ldquo;constitution-in-waiting&rdquo; for an all-Ireland state.  Those who drafted it could not have foreseen the way in which events on this island would evolve.  But we have the benefit of more than 50 years hindsight, and we should use that experience to enable us to redraft Articles 2 and 3 in a manner which would make them more acceptable to all of the people of this island.</P>
    <P>There was then and there has been since a number of voices which spoke out against Articles 2 and 3.  The Leader of Fine Gael at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, W.T. Cosgrave, described them quite accurately as &ldquo;make believe&rdquo;.  The then Secretary of the Department of Finance, J. J. McElligott, said of them that they were <Col N="1000" /> a fiction &ldquo;which will give offence to neighbouring countries with whom we are constantly protesting our desire to live on terms of friendship&rdquo;.  &ldquo;It is not clear&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether we are on safe ground in claiming sovereignty and jurisdiction over land recognised internationally, <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i>, as belonging to another country&rdquo;.  Mr. McElligott displayed considerable foresight when he expressed the view that &ldquo;these Articles will not contribute anything to effecting the unity of Ireland, but rather the reverse&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The 1967 All-Party Committee on the Constitution adopted what was for its time a remarkably progressive attitude. While they made no rcommendations with regard to Article 2, they recommended a total rewriting of Article 3, doing away with all the self-deception about &ldquo;re-integration of the national territory&rdquo; and the right of the Dáil to exercise jurisdiction over Northern Ireland. The wording they proposed for Article 3 was: &ldquo;The Irish nation hereby proclaims its firm will that its territory be united in harmony and brotherly affection between all Irishmen&rdquo;.  The committee included such distinguished Fianna Fáil politicians as the former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, George Colley, as well as the current Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, and the current Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy.  It is a great misfortune that the then Government did not act on the committee's recommendation.</P>
    <P>Credit must also be given to people like Deputy Jim Kemmy who for many years, along with people like Senator John A. Murphy, chipped away at the phoniness represented by Articles 2 and 3, and the courage of the Progressive Democrats has also to be acknowledged. In their draft constitution published in 1988, they proposed doing away with Article 2 and in regard to Article 3 recommended a wording similar to that proposed by the 1967 committee.</P>
    <P>An editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i>, published at the end of 1987, to mark the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution, spoke for a growing <Col N="1001" /> number of people when it said of Articles 2 and 3:</P>
    <P>It is a claim which is expressed in a dangerously simplistic idiom, in terms which are suggestive of a desire for conquest, subjugation indeed, and which can have no place in the dialogue which must come about with the Unionist majority in the North.  The concept of territorial occupation, of the Gall flying to the sea before the conquering might &mdash; military, social or cultural &mdash; of the Gael may well have had its place as part of a necessary political or cultural mythology in 1937. It has none today.  And it contradicts the declared desire of the great majority of people on this island for the achievement of unity by peaceful means alone.</P>
    <P>It is clear therefore that for a number of years there has been public opinion in favour of changing &mdash; in one way or another &mdash; Articles 2 and 3.  What has given the matter new urgency is the judgment of the Supreme Court in the McGimpsey case delivered on 1 March, which described the territorial claim in Articles 2 and 3 as a &ldquo;constitutional imperative&rdquo;.  Defenders of Articles 2 and 3 have tended to say &ldquo;well, they should not really be taken at face value, they do not really constitute a territorial claim over the North, they are really just an expression of the desire of people down here for unity.  They are only an aspiration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This theory has been blown out of the water by the Supreme Court judgment. What the court found was that Articles 2 and 3, as currently worded, constitute a claim of legal right over Northern Ireland and that not only have the Government a right to pursue this claim but were obliged to do so &mdash; irrespective of the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland. Writing in <i>The Irish Times</i>, following the judgment, the distinguished law lecturer, David Gwynn Morgan said that the significance of the judgment was that it meant that the Government lacked the capacity to renounce the <i>de jure</i> claim to Northern Ireland.  He also said: &ldquo;If these <Col N="1002" /> Articles are matters of law, then an Irish government is simply not legally competent to reach certain kinds of agreements with the unionist majority,&rdquo; adding that the net result is that the Government are rather constrained in any future bargaining with the Northern majority.</P>
    <P>In my view the Supreme Court judgment has provided the most compelling argument for not deferring any longer decisive action to amend these Articles.</P>
    <P>There is a number of reasons for changing Articles 2 and 3.  The most important is that in their present form they are an impediment on the path to peace on this island.  Many people in Northern Ireland, including Unionists, consider the present bald, territorial claim contained in these Articles to be arrogant and offensive.  In their present form the Articles assert the right of the people of the Republic of Ireland to impose their will on the citizens of Northern Ireland, without any reference to the democratic rights of these people.  These Articles are viewed by many people in Northern Ireland as a political pistol pointing at their heads. They lead to suspicion and distrust of this State among the Unionist community there.</P>
    <P>It is not just a handful of Unionist &ldquo;backwoodsmen&rdquo; who find these Articles offensive.  Progressive, modern, forwardlooking people like Christopher and Michael McGimpsey, who travel regularly to the Republic and who want friendly relations between all of the people of this island, have urged politicians in the South to stand up and be counted.  Serious Unionists, such as Ken Maginnis and Frank Millar have pointed to them as an obstacle to peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  The Presbyterian Synod last March, speaking for its members not just in the North but throughout the entire island, expressed a desire to see Articles 2 and 3 changed.</P>
    <P>We should try to see it from the point of view of Unionists.  Let us suppose the United Kingdom had a written constitution, and that it had in it an article which said that the national territory of <Col N="1003" /> the United Kingdom consisted of Great Britain and Ireland, its islands and territorial seas.  Let us suppose that it had a further article which said that pending the reintegration of this national territory, and without prejudice to the right of Westminster to pass laws for all of the island of Ireland, its laws would apply only to Britain and Northern Ireland. Just imagine the sense of offence, outrage and indignation that this would provoke in this State.  Let us suppose further that the Law Lords ruled that this was not just an aspiration but a &ldquo;constitutional imperative&rdquo;, how would we react?</P>
    <P>In bringing forward this Bill The Workers' Party do not claim to have any monopoly of political wisdom or ideas about ways of helping political progress in Northern Ireland.  After all, it was Seán Lemass who first put political realism about Northern Ireland on the political agenda in this State back in the sixties. He recognised, as had Parnell before him, that Irish nationalism had to come to terms with the fact that a million or so Ulster Protestants were deeply committed to their allegiance to Britain.  It was Lemass who took the important symbolic step of going to Stormont to meet the then Unionist Prime Minister, Terence O'Neill, in 1965.  It appeared to many at the time as the beginning of the end of the cold war between the two states that had lasted since partition.  Subsequently, as I pointed out earlier, he was a key figure in the 1967 Committee on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that the committee's recommendations proved too visionary for many Members of the Dáil and in particular of the Government party.  As the Northern Ireland state slid into chaos and violence more traditional voices drowned out those who were arguing for modernisation and rationality in our attitudes to Northern Ireland.  Now 23 years on, Stormont has gone, many significant reforms have been introduced although much remains to be done, the Unionist monolith has splintered, a new modernised and sophisticated nationalist party has emerged in the SDLP and we <Col N="1004" /> have had the Report of the New Ireland Forum and the Hillsborough Agreement. Such radical changes have had their pathological dimensions as well &mdash; the forces that are prepared to kill and maim to maintain a constituency for the traditional zero-sum ideologies of fundamentalist nationalism and &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; loyalism.</P>
    <P>Our progress is aimed at building on the undoubtedly positive things that have occurred in both states and which the recent Presidential election has symbolised in such a graphic way.  In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State, Peter Brooke, has got much further along the road to getting inter-party talks off the ground than many sceptics had thought possible.  We need to recognise and give some credit to all the political leaders involved in these talks.  In particular we should acknowledge the distance the leaders of the two main Unionist parties have come since their early response to the Hillsborough Agreement.  We in The Workers' Party have always argued that Unionist politics is more complex and divided than is often thought the case down here.  If political progress is to be made in Northern Ireland everything possible should be done to strengthen the forces of compromise and accommodation in the two communities up there.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement was an attempt to strengthen the forces of compromise and accommodation in Catholic politics and it succeeded to a degree in this.  It was also designed to sidestep the Unionist veto.  We feel that the economic effects of Thatcherism undercut the Agreement's aims to a substantial extent and that a much more thoroughgoing set of reforms in areas like the economy and security are necessary. Nevertheless we feel that as well as addressing the alienation of Catholics from the state in Northern Ireland responsible politicians down here need to address Unionist alienation and their fears about their future.</P>
    <P>These fears are not irrational or products of bigotry as far as the majority of Protestants are concerned.  In large part <Col N="1005" /> they are the products of the most sophisticated terrorist organisation operating in the world at the moment, the Provisional IRA.  Since the middle of the seventies the bulk of the victims of this organisation's campaign have been Ulster Protestants &mdash; ranging from the so-called &ldquo;legitimate targets&rdquo; to millworkers, electricians, Border farmers and their sons, and men, women and children who committed the crime of attending a Remembrance ceremony.</P>
    <P>Down here the true enormity of what the Provisionals have been doing and are continuing to do to Ulster Protestants only comes home with one of their horror spectaculars like Enniskillen.  We need to remember that the slow drip-drip of almost daily murders goes on and has gone on for two decades.  Given this and the generalised Protestant feeling that the Hillsborough Agreement has been imposed on them, the degree of flexibility that Unionist leaders are prepared to show is quite remarkable.  We need to acknowledge, strengthen and encourage that flexibility.  We need to demonstrate to the Unionists that our priority is the accommodation of diversity on this island and that we are under no &ldquo;constitutional imperative&rdquo; to pursue unification against their wishes.</P>
    <P>Just as we would expect them to accept and respect the legitimacy of Irish nationalist political and cultural aspirations, we in this State need to show that we respect their British political and cultural aspirations.  Our proposal aims to build on the revision of Irish nationalist aspirations which is implicit in the Report of the New Ireland Forum and in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  We need to end the double-think in our political culture on the North so clearly embodied in Articles 2 and 3.  We do not suggest that this would turn Unionists into Irish nationalists; that would be patronising and arrogant in itself and, anyway, that is not our purpose at all. What it would do is to remove one significant contribution to the siege mentality in the North.  It would greatly assist those, and they are a growing number, who are arguing for an end to the politics <Col N="1006" /> of siege and the beginning of a new politics based on an historic compromise between nationalism and unionism.</P>
    <P>There are those who argue that our proposal is a betrayal of the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland.  Are they seriously suggesting that the great majority of Catholics in Northern Ireland see the present Articles as a defence of their interests?  For 30 years, from 1937 to 1967, the values of de Valera's Constitution remained intact as did the system of Unionist one party rule in Northern Ireland.  In 1967 the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was formed.  Within two years it had produced more positive changes for Northern Ireland Catholics than decades of verbal republicanism and anti-partitionism from Southern politicians.  Rather than these Articles helping Northern Catholics they have been of a negative, destructive contradiction with the most rigid and unsavoury aspects of loyalism.  Successive Unionist Prime Ministers and subsequent Loyalist demagogues have made much of the aggressive claim on Northern Ireland embodied in our Constitution.  The Articles have only served to homogenise and consolidate Unionist opinion behind reactionary leaders.  The great majority in Northern Ireland, Protestant and Catholic, have an interest in undermining this negative confrontation between Nationalist rhetoric and Loyalist intransigence.</P>
    <P>Those who claim to speak for a Northern Catholic community, supposedly united in defence of Articles 2 and 3, ignore the evidence of surveys, for instance, the recent British Social Attitudes Survey, which showed that only a minority of Catholics in Northern Ireland saw Irish unity as a practical solution. Researchers from the centre for the study of conflict at the University of Ulster have just published a report on &ldquo;Violence and Communities&rdquo;, which includes a survey of political attitudes from which they concluded that &ldquo;there seemed to be little real demand for a break in the link with Britain&rdquo; among the Catholic population. The study shows that the primary objective of most Catholics in Northern <Col N="1007" /> Ireland is a share of political power and justice within the State rather than the high-faluting, bombastic, exaggerated perspectives of some politicians who seem to believe in some transcendent final solution to the Irish question.  To try to use Articles 2 and 3 as a bargaining counter to get Unionists involved in talks with the Southern Government &mdash; aimed at sliding them out of the United Kingdom &mdash; is simply unrealistic; it is a recipe for continued political stalemate in the North.</P>
    <P>We are not suggesting this as a way of placating Unionists and ignoring Nationalists.  We believe that the claim is undemocratic and poisons relations between Unionists and Nationalists throughout Ireland.  The Unionist case against these Articles is a just one.  It is only those steeped in the zero-sum polarities of northern communalism who see justice for Unionists on this issue as a betrayal of Nationalists.  The changes we recommend would represent an important step to political honesty about Northern Ireland down here and help to advance the incredibly complex and difficult process of political accommodation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Primarily, however, Articles 2 and 3 should be changed as I put it at our last Ard-Fheis &ldquo;as a matter of basic good neighbourliness and for the health of our own political system&rdquo;.  While the vast majority of people of the Republic unequivocally reject the Provisional IRA and their murderous activities, the Provos and their fellow travellers cite Articles 2 and 3 as part of their perverse mandate, and to justify their claim that they seek only to complete unfinished business.  Again nobody would suggest that if we pass the proposed amendments, the Provos would lay down their arms.  But changing Articles 2 and 3 in the way we suggest would clearly demonstrate that the people of the Republic are saying to the murder gangs: you have no mandate to operate in our names; you have no right to make war against the people of Northern Ireland or Britain.</P>
    <P>In this context it was significant that, <Col N="1008" /> when we published our Bill last week, the only public criticism of it came from the Provisionals.  Those who believe that the Provos attach no importance to Articles 2 and 3 should read the comments of the Vice-President of Sinn Féin, Mr. Pat Doherty, quoted in the <i>Irish News</i> of Friday last, 30 November.  Articles 2 and 3 he said:</P>
    <P>reflected the desire for a united and independent Ireland, the wish of the majority of the people of this country... </P>
    <P>This is the language which the Provos use to back up their claim of a mandate from the Irish people for their murderous activities.  By amending Articles 2 and 3 along the lines we suggest we will further undermine the Provos claim to a mandate.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the detail of our proposed amendments.  In relation to Article 2 we are proposing the inclusion of an extra sentence, which incorporates the sentiments of Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, viz:</P>
    <P>This shall not be held to mean that there will be any change in the status of Northern Ireland other than with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. </P>
    <P>This formula was suggested some months ago by the President, Mrs. Mary Robinson. I do not believe there will be any great controversy about this proposal. When the Dáil adopted the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985 it accepted this principle. When Fianna Fáil came into power in 1987 and agreed to operate the Anglo-Irish Agreement, they also accepted this principle.  The effect of incorporating it into Article 2 is to modify what the Supreme Court recently described as a constitutional imperative to pursue unity.</P>
    <P>The formula we are suggesting for Article 3 is somewhat similar to the proposal made by the All Party Committee on the Constitution which reported in 1967.  As recommended by the 1967 committee it drops the claim of a right by the Parliament of this State to exercise jurisdiction over the whole island.  Unlike <Col N="1009" /> the committee's recommendation which spoke of unity of the nation, our proposed new wording speaks about unity of the people of Ireland.  It proclaims the firm wish of the people of this State &ldquo;that the people of Ireland be united in peace, harmony and by consent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are putting forward these proposed amendments in the belief that they would be acceptable to the people of the Republic. We are not claiming any absolute infallibility in relation to the proposed wording.  If people have suggestions to make as to how it might be improved, we are quite prepared to consider them, provided they are consistent with the objectives I set out earlier.</P>
    <P>Only the most uncompromising, militant Nationalists now suggest that Articles 2 and 3 should not under any circumstances be changed.  But there are two principal arguments which I anticipate will be put forward against this Bill. One is that Articles 2 and 3 should only be revised as part of a total review of the Constitution.  The other is that the Articles should only be amended as part of an overall settlement to the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>My party's concerns about the 1937 Constitution are not limited to Articles 2 and 3.  There are many other areas we would like to see addressed.  There is, of course, the constitutional prohibition on divorce.  We are now one of the few countries which refuses to give those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down the opportunity to remarry. In the past few weeks there has been a groundswell of opinion &mdash; extending even into the heart of Fianna Fáil &mdash; in favour of looking again at that constitutional prohibition.  In time there will, I am certain, be a similar groundswell in favour of reviewing the unnecessary, divisive and sectarian amendment which was inserted in 1983.  There is the whole question of the guarantees in regard to private property which have been cited by successive Governments as a reason they cannot move to end the relic of mediaeval times &mdash; ground rents.  The Preamble is particularly out-dated and anachronistic. There are many other issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> I would like to see a totally new Constitution to guide this country into the 21st century.  I would like to see it done by consensus, but how long would that take?  Our record as a Parliament is not good.  Relatively non-controversial legislation, like the Children Bill, was first published in 1985 and is still not enacted.  How long would a new Constitution take &mdash; five years, ten years, 15 years?  I do not believe we can wait that long to address Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  The other shortcomings of our Constitution are not claimed by the Provisional IRA as part of their mandate for their terrorist crimes, are not providing an impediment to peace and progress in Northern Ireland; Articles 2 and 3 are.  Their impact is so damaging we cannot wait for a new Constitution to address them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach when questioned in the Dáil, has expressed the view that Articles 2 and 3 should only be addressed as part of an overall settlement of the Northern Ireland problem.  This is asking people of Northern Ireland to give the Irish Government a blank cheque.  It is asking the people of Northern Ireland to accept that a state which has no great record of any generosity towards the rights of minorities in its own midst will be generous towards them.  It also ignores the priority that if we do not now address Articles 2 and 3 then there may well be no settlement in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, &ldquo;new thinking&rdquo; has swept the world in the past few years, new thinking which has seen the end of the Cold War, de-escalation of the arms race and demolition of the Berlin Wall, to give but a few dramatic examples, but we cannot honestly applaud such developments internationally and yet ignore the necessity for a major re-examination of our own attitudes and traditions.  &ldquo;New thinking&rdquo; does not demand that to meet our traditional position.  Shouting old slogans for a united Ireland and surrender must be looked at in a new, cold light.  They have badly served the people of this island; indeed they have served them murderously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> We must remember that Northern Ireland is populated by real people, with real fears, hopes and expectations, which in most respects are no different from our own concerns about jobs, wages, health, education and a clean environment, but there is one significant difference apart from the differing political traditions. That difference is the daily fear of the death squads who roam the towns, cities and countryside, who callously murder, who regard compassion as a sign of weakness and describe it as &ldquo;bleeding heart liberalism&rdquo;, and who regard compromise as treachery.  They are driven by their own heroic self-image and believe they are fulfilling the &ldquo;historic destiny&rdquo; of the Irish people.  We can strike a mortal blow against this philosophy of death by tackling Articles 2 and 3, by questioning the political culture that underpins them.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting a statement made by our former President, Dr. Patrick Hillery, earlier this year when he was speaking at a function organised by the Economic and Social Research Institute. He said:</P>
    <P>There is never any dearth of people who are eager to advise caution, to postpone the initiation of change, to avoid breaking old moulds, to wait until this or that until finally the great enthusiasm which is there could be dead and what should have been today's initiative is deferred for another generation. </P>
    <P>We should not allow that to happen in this House over the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>New thinking has indeed swept the world and it would seem new thinking is not entirely alien to Deputy De Rossa.  In one sense we should accept that this proposal, coming as it does from The Workers' Party, is indicative of the kind of change we should all welcome in this country.  A little over 15 years ago the party who have put forward this proposal operated at a somewhat different level. Then Sinn Féin, that party were part of a movement that did not recognise <Col N="1012" /> political debate.  That party did not recognise that discussion, debate and logical exposition of the facts was the sole way forward in a civilised nation.  That party then had some difficulty in recognising this sovereign Parliament.  Indeed, it is worth while putting on the record that that party had some difficulty in recognising Bunreacht na hÉireann itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If a recent report in one of our more serious Sunday papers is to be believed, these views have not entirely been rejected by The Workers' Party or at least by associates of that party.  In Belfast it would seem, according to these reports, that they are not entirely weaned away from the idea that disputes can be settled by physical force.  Of course, these are not the first such allegations that have been associated with The Workers' Party or their associates.  One is mindful of revelations not too long back on an RTE programme which have never been convincingly rejected or rebutted by that party.  Without dwelling too long on this point, it strikes me that if the expressions of peace and logic which have of late emanated from The Workers' Party and their concern for the Constitution as expressed here tonight are to be taken at all seriously, then The Workers' Party contributors later in this debate might take the time to assure those of us who are truly concerned about peace and reconciliation that they will use their good offices with fellow-travellers in Belfast and elsewhere to ensure that those fellow-travellers at all times act peacefully and in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>I make these points not to hurl bards idly across this Chamber because I welcome the distance Deputy De Rossa's party have come.  It is very welcome and it is to be hoped other people in the North of this island in the not too distant future will traverse that same distance.</P>

      <P>We can continue the banter if the Deputies wish.  Not all that has been said has been accurate and certainly much that has been said has not been helpful.  The long term aspiration of any nationalist politician is a united Ireland.  We may occasionally differ on some aspects but in so far as any nationalist politician is concerned a united Ireland is our long term aim, Ireland as an island in which all traditions of this country can find expression by agreement in common accord and in peace.  Those who believe this can be achieved by violence are hindering progress along that road.  Those who propose specious solutions to intractable problems do not help progress either.  More importantly, the proposers of specious solutions to complex problems by snapping energy, deflecting the ongoing debate and giving the wrong signals to one side or the other of this complex issue can prolong the search for peace and reconciliation.</P>
      <P>The opening Articles of Bunreacht na hÉireann are by no means unique.  Similar Articles and similar expressions are to be found in other constitutions.  Indeed, it would be a very odd constitution that failed to indicate in some way the meaning of the nation.  The opening Articles of our Constitution report in writing in the basic law of this State an aspiration which has been nourished by nationalists for countless generations, that this island embraces the whole island of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most apposite and appropriate parallel is to be found &mdash; appropriate this week above all &mdash; in the German basic law of 1949, the constitution of the Federal Republic.  The opening phrases of that document provide that the entire German people are called upon to achieve in free self-determination the unity and freedom of Germany.  As has <Col N="1014" /> frequently been pointed out of late, the provision did not mean that the Federal Republic threatened in any way the rights of the people of the German Democratic Republic.  The aspiration, expressed in the form of a clear and unequivocal legal imperative, was never taken as the basis for any illegitimate use of force, nor was it ever proposed by the people of West Germany that they could use force on the basis of this aspiration against their brothers and sisters in East Germany. The claim was not used as the basis for attack on agreements that had been reached by East Germany and its neighbours on the thorny issue of borders. The claim in no way impeded progress towards the unity of the German people which has recently come about and which we all celebrate.  In other words, an exact parallel claim has none of the influence that was suggested here tonight by Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    <P>The real and only impediment to unity on this island over the past 45 years has been an intractable attachment to ideology on one side or the other.  In a sense there is a parallel here between ourselves and the Germans because there the only impediment in the past 45 years was an intractable attachment to an ideology. As it turns out, that ideology was until recently espoused by Deputy De Rossa's own party.  There is surely some irony here that the two issues which have contributed so much to the division of people both in Ireland and in Europe, the use of violence to settle disputes on the one hand and the espousal of an ideology as a panacea for all ills, could until so very recently be associated with the proposers of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the proposition embodied in this Bill should be rejected for many reasons.  There are, it seems, five or six specific reasons that can be identified as to why this Bill could, at this stage, be potentially dangerous.  First, I believe that unilateral thinking on the Constitution would be, at the very least, unhelpful and, in all probability, harmful. Second, I believe that the Bill as formulated would represent, if carried through in the manner envisaged, a <Col N="1015" /> shameful abandonment of the Nationalist people of Northern Ireland.  They too have an aspiration.  Third, I believe that it would have no impact whatsoever on the promoters of violence, and perhaps this is the most important reason of all, because if there were any reason to believe that the people who promote violence would in any way be influenced by this, then my attitude would be different.</P>
    <P>No matter how well meaning, there is a danger that this debate could be portrayed as suggesting that we in this part of Ireland are in some way equivocal on our commitment to peace.  For our part, we on the Fianna Fáil side have reiterated on dozens of occasions our commitment to unity only through peaceful settlement. Yet, I suspect that in some quarters, particularly some Unionist quarters, this debate could be conjured up and portrayed as something which it is not &mdash; and I am not suggesting that that was Deputy De Rossa's purpose or that of his party in putting the issue forward for debate at this time.  I am merely suggesting that it is a danger that lies there.</P>
    <P>The fifth problem I have with the Bill is that there is a related danger that by having this debate now we could be contributing to the very sterility of politics in the Six Counties which we must all abhor. Is it helpful, I ask, at a time when efforts are being made to woo people into talks, to effectively signal to them that something can be done or might be achieved by holding back on talks?  Again, I am not suggesting that that is Deputy De Rossa's purpose, but it is certainly one construction on the debate which I can foresee.</P>
    <P>The final grave difficulty I have with this debate is that it has the potential for great divisiveness, particularly in a referendum campaign which would inevitably follow from it.  Deputy De Rossa referred to our President and the very fine article on this specific issue written by her in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 21 April where, in addition to the portion quoted by Deputy De Rossa, she recognised:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> However, there may be a serious risk that any referendum on Articles 2 and 3 held in the present climate could highlight divisions, exacerbate fears and prove to be counterproductive. </P>
    <P>I too have that fear that a referendum could produce those unwelcome side effects.</P>
    <P>The Constitution &mdash; any constitution &mdash; is, of necessity, a complex thing.  A constitution, after all, is a treaty by a people to itself and it must cover all aspects of life within the state.  Tinkering with one part, particularly in a matter as important as the one under discussion, is seldom the right way to achieve progress. Until recently this too was the view of the major opposition party.  It would be interesting to receive some information from contributors in Fine Gael later as to why they seem to have changed their views in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that progress can be recorded in the years ahead &mdash; and not too far ahead &mdash; with the dismantling of the Border which sunders the two parts of this country.  When consensus is reached on this matter then, in the words of the New Ireland Forum, the building of the new Ireland will require the participation and co-operation of all the people of Ireland, and it will also require an entirely new constitution.  At that stage, as the Taoiseach himself has reiterated on many occasions, the new arrangements or structures which might be agreed for Ireland as a whole would clearly require an entirely new constitution. At that stage not only Articles 2 and 3 but all other Articles would have to be put up for discussion.</P>
    <P>In our discussions we must also bear in mind the position of the Nationalist people.  Like the Unionist people, they have their sensitivities about which we must be conscious.  I know the importance which is attached by that community to the legitimate and democratic wish for unity by consent.  I note too that the amendment proposed would be perceived by many in the Nationalist community as a tendency on our part to drift away from that aspiration, as a move <Col N="1017" /> towards a kind of creeping partition which would be deeply disturbing to the Nationalist community.  We must bear in mind that there are those who would portray the proposed amendment as an abandonment entirely of the Nationalist community and who would seek to exploit the situation and to confer legitimacy on the men of violence.</P>
    <P>It is another great fear I have that, however well meaning the proposal, were we to act on it, it would inevitably be abused by the armchair generals who show no regard whatsoever for law and show no regard for our Constitution but would certainly show an interest in abusing a well meaning proposition such as this.</P>

      <P>I am never shy of interruptions from Deputy De Rossa.  I find his questions always eminently answerable. However, I may come to the point he has in mind.  There is a related point on which I would like to dwell briefly here.  When people propose amending or dropping Articles 2 and 3 as a means of helping the sensitivities of one sector in Northern Ireland, as a recognition of the sensitivities of Nationalists, why do they not propose or demand that the counter aspirations, the Unionist aspirations, should similarly be treated?  In his contribution Deputy De Rossa was very <Col N="1018" /> generous to the Unionist aspirations and he referred only to the most uncompromising and intransigent Nationalists as taking the views I am taking.  The reality is that intransigence is not the monopoly of one side of this divide in Northern Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument is often put forward that Articles 2 and 3 in their present form in some way legitimise actions which could not be condoned by any civilised person.  This line of argument ignores the existence, for example, of Article 29.  When the Articles are read in conjunction with Article 29 it becomes clear that Bunreacht na hÉireann can never be invoked to justify the use of force to achieve the purposes of Articles 2 and 3, and there is no party in this House, no matter what side they take in this debate, that would accept for one minute that force should be used against our fellow Irish men and women to achieve the purposes of Articles 2 and 3.  The means by which unity may be achieved are clearly delimited by Article 29.  That Article lays down the obligations that affirm Ireland's dedication to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation and to Ireland's adherence to the principle of a peaceful settlement of international disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as violence from one side of the division is concerned, that is, the violence of the Provisionals and of the murder gangs who masquerade as Republicans, Articles 2 and 3 are of very little consequence. They are in the same position as official Sinn Féin and its armed offshoots were a few years ago before official Sinn Féin became The Workers' Party.  They do not now recognise our Constitution and they can claim no legitimacy for their actions from our Constitution. Indeed, I can envisage the perverse situation arising &mdash; and I think this is the point Deputy De Rossa is getting to &mdash; where the removal of the delimitation of Articles 2 and 3 or any tinkering with those Articles, no matter how well meaning, could be portrayed by <Col N="1019" /> the men of violence as a way of arguing for additional support for their particular viewpoint.</P>
    <P>If Articles 2 and 3 were adjusted or abandoned in isolation it is probable that the Provisionals would preach with renewed vigour that they were the sole defence left to the nationalist people, that they were the last line of defence for the nationalists' aspirations and the dream of unity.  I would not for one moment accept, no more than would any other Deputy, that they would have any right to put forward that lien of argument, but it is not improbable that one could see this debate producing that kind of reaction among those people.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that a unilateral amendment of these Articles would be exploited by the armchair generals to their own ends.  Of course violence does not come from one side only.  Murder is not the sole prerogative of those who label themselves republicans.  Some of the more heinous crimes committed in the North of Ireland have been committed by those who label themselves loyalists.  There is even less chance that these would be dissuaded from their bestiality by anything we do here in regard to Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>Each time there is a debate on Articles 2 and 3, no matter how well meaning it is, it is inevitably taken in Northern Ireland as signalling some doubt as to our dedication to the course of peace.  The actions of all the major parties here belie any such suggestion.  At the risk of repetition it is worth again recording the extent of our commitment to peace and progress.  We have paid a heavy price.  In economic terms the additional security costs to the Exchequer from the Northern Ireland troubles are estimated from 1969 onwards to have been approximately £1.5 billion.  Adjusted for inflation, we are talking of additional costs in the order of £2.5 billion for security as a result of the troubles of the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that our security forces have prevented even greater loss of life and carnage by their continuing <Col N="1020" /> success in intercepting and seizing very substantial quantities of arms, ammunition and explosives intended for use by one or other party in Northern Ireland. In so far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned, our commitment with regard to security is freely given in the common interest of society, North and South, to ensure that the forces of terrorism, whether of domestic or international origin, will not prevail.  In Government we will continue to commit the resources necessary to combat those who seek to achieve their aims by violence.</P>
    <P>We have invested more than simply money in the pursuit of the solutions to this problem.  As Deputy De Rossa said, over the last decade a considerable amount of political time and effort has been invested in the issue.  The Summit in Dublin Castle in December 1980 between the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and the British Prime Minister gave new momentum to the efforts of the two sovereign Governments in London and Dublin to try to address the problems jointly and to find a common way forward.  There followed a period in which various aspects of the current relationship between the two countries were examined in depth.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the New Ireland Forum brought together constitutional nationalist politicians from all the major parties in Ireland and explored the possibilities for advancement at that stage.  It is interesting to remind ourselves that far from proposing any dismissal of Articles 2 and 3 the New Ireland Forum recommended:</P>
    <P>The particular structure of political unity which the Forum would wish to see established is a unitary state, achieved by agreement and consent, embracing the whole island of Ireland and providing irrevocable guarantees for the protection and preservation of both the unionist and nationalist identities. A unitary state on which agreement had been reached would also provide the ideal framework for the constructive interaction of the diverse cultures and values of the people of Ireland. </P>
    <P>The whole island of Ireland is mentioned <Col N="1021" /> there.  That, at that time, had the agreement of all the major constitutional nationalist parties on this island.</P>
    <P>Following the Forum we saw in 1985 the conclusion of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. I freely admit that the Agreement did not fire Fianna Fáil with the same enthusiasm that it did other parties in this House and in Government at the time. However, in Government, in spite of the doubts that we had, we actively and in good faith operated the Agreement to the fullest possible extent and the fullest possible advantage.  In terms of political will, financial investment or political sacrifice, nobody on this island, however much ill will they may bear successive Governments can say that they have been wanting in terms of their desire and commitment to the peace process.</P>
    <P>My final concern is that discussion on amending Articles 2 and 3 is no mere academic process.  I feel very strongly that any referendum on these Articles could well put a wedge between all sides of the community.  It will certainly put a wedge into the consensus that exists in terms of the peace process.  It would open up divisions and it could give rise to elaborate fears.  In the end it could easily be counter-productive.  Were we to have a referendum, could we guarantee its success?</P>
    <P>Occasionally when a cause is labelled as liberal or progressive it is difficult to suggest that there are counter-arguments to that cause.  I make no apology for supporting the constitutional requirement to seek unity just as I reject unreservedly any idea of seeking to achieve unity by force or of imposing the jurisdiction of this State on the people of Northern Ireland.  The whole movement of political development in Europe is towards unity and the breaking down of barriers.  We witnessed the unification of Germany last week which many thought impossible.  Countries of east and west in Europe which had been locked in confrontation are now choosing co-operation and friendship.  Momentous changes are taking place, changes which everyone recognises will be of immense benefit to the people of Europe.  Why should we <Col N="1022" /> on this island be left out of the historic movement that is taking place?  Surely we can find some way of living together, some means of holding a dialogue involving all of our different opinions and beliefs.</P>

      <P>A Bill to amend the Constitution is a serious matter.  As Deputy Roche has just said, it is a treaty between a people and a Government.  It should be treated by the Oireachtas as being extremely serious, especially when it is brought in by a constitutional party.  I regret very much the language used by Deputy Roche in his contribution.  It was not a proper contribution to a debate on this subject.  I cannot see the Government taking this debate seriously.  As I have said, a Bill to amend the Constitution is a serious matter but yet the Government's opening speaker on this Bill &mdash; I do not mean any disrespect to Deputy Roche &mdash; is a backbencher, not a Minister of State, not a Minister with responsibility in the field of Northern Ireland like Deputy Collins and not the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dermot Ahern is a good contributor but it is not fitting for the Government to put in a backbencher on a serious debate like this.  I will now return to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view of the Fine Gael Party &mdash; which has been my view for many years &mdash;is that Articles 2 and 3 of Bunreacht na hÉireann expressed a political aspiration <Col N="1027" /> rather than what is now being interpreted as a legal imperative for the unification of Ireland.  The change of mind in the Fine Gael position was brought about by the judgment handed down by the Supreme Court last April.  There was a general understanding that Articles 2 and 3 should be read together because Article 3 somehow diluted Article 2.  Of course, they are all subject to Article 29 quoted earlier by Deputy Roche.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to this understanding was the view that Irish unity would come about by peaceful means and only by consent.  That is now the position of both major parties in this country and has been the case for a number of years.  The name of the party of which I am a member is Fine Gael &mdash; United Ireland Party; the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party to a united Ireland is well known and it has been reiterated here tonight by Deputy Roche.  It is dangerous for anyone in this House to start throwing stones from the glasshouse they now inhabit.  That applies to Deputy Roche and the difference between his party and mine is that we recognised many years ago when the first Treaty was accepted that the north east of this country could not be coerced into becoming part of the then Irish Free State.  We recognised that very early on and I am glad that other parties have come round to the same point of view. However, I do not intend to accuse any party in this House of taking a long time to come to that point of view, I am very glad they have now joined us.  For that reason, the contribution of Deputy Roche was most regrettable.  That is why we adopted a less militant form of nationalism than that of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>For the past 20 years we sought a political accommodation which would end violence and begin the process of reconciliation and normalisation of political life in Northern Ireland.  This was prompted initially by the chilling scenes on television at the end of the late sixties of the violence in Northern Ireland.  As Deputy De Rossa said, the civil rights movement achieved more for the Nationalist people in Northern Ireland, brought the problem <Col N="1028" /> to the attention of the world and did more in two years than all the rhetoric engaged in for the previous 40 years.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the intervening 20 years the former Taoiseach, Deputy Liam Cosgrave, said at one stage that the violence of one organisation was killing the desire among people down here for unity and bringing in a partitionist mentality which was very clearly evident in the recent Presidential campaign.  We were asked if we had to go to County Tyrone for a candidate and that type of attitude is particularly regrettable from a Government Minister.  It is an attitude which contradicts their claim that they want unity.  It was against that background that we participated in the Sunningdale talks on power sharing; that we proposed and participated in the Forum for a New Ireland and that we negotiated the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Sunningdale Agreement, the report of the New Ireland Forum and the Anglo-Irish Agreement categorically underline our contention that the unity of Ireland will only come about with the consent of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland.  In the Sunningdale Agreement, December 1973, the Irish Government stated that they:</P>
    <P>...fully accepted and solemly declared that there could be no change in the status of Northern Ireland until a majority of the people of Northern Ireland desired a change in that status. </P>
    <P>The Forum report, May 1984, reiterated this point by asserting:</P>
    <P>attempts from any quarter to impose a particular solution through violence must be rejected along with the proponents of such methods.  It must be recognised that the new Ireland which the forum seeks can come about only through agreement and must have a democratic basis. </P>
    <P>Finally, in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985 the Irish Government</P>
    <P>affirmed that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a <Col N="1029" /> majority of the people of Northern Ireland. </P>
    <P>The real significance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement was the commitment given by both Governments, particularly the Irish Government, that there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  The other significance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement was that for the first time in 60 years the Irish Government got the right to have a say in the affairs of Northern Ireland.  In spite of all the violence that had been used and all the rhetoric that had been poured out throughout the years the agreement gave the right to the Irish Government to speak on behalf of the Nationalists in Northern Ireland.  It gave the right to the Irish Government to put forward views and proposals to promote peace and reconciliation on the island and in Article 4 it imposed an obligation on both Governments to bring forward proposals about devolved Government in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This was a sea change because only three or four years previously the UK Prime Minister had said that no Irish Government had a right to have any say in anything that happened in the North of Ireland.  Within three years of that, this solemn agreement had been signed by both Governments, lodged with the UN, recognised in international law and for the first time in 65 years we had the right to have a say in what was happening in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another point about the Anglo-Irish Agreement was that it did not propose nor did it anticipate that there would be instant solutions to the problems.  It formally committed both Governments to a steady course towards seeking the goal of peace and stability.  Without that agreement the talks that are now taking place could not have been initiated. Hopefully they are leading towards peace and stability.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the proposed participants in those talks have not yet sat down.  I was encouraged by what the Taoiseach said today in that regard, that <Col N="1030" /> he is not pessimistic about the possibility of the talks taking place.  However, being &ldquo;not pessimistic&rdquo; is not enough.  Besides the rights which the Governments have under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, they have obligations.  One of the obligations of both the British and Irish Governments is to use their influence through the Anglo-Irish Conference where these matters should be discussed, to bring those people to the talks.  It is not enough to say that there are obstacles on the road to talks.  It is the responsibility of Mr. Brooke and the Minister, Deputy Collins, to get the obstacles removed and to get the talks under way for the same objective Deputy De Rossa wants to achieve by amending Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution to ensure that we will have in the North of Ireland communities that can live in peace and reconciliation with one another.</P>
    <P>These views which were held strongly by Fine Gael for 70 years did not mean that at any stage we were unconcerned with or indifferent to the injustices suffered by the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  We always sought to improve the conditions which the Nationalist people lived in, while we worked towards the solution of eventual reunification.  We could not say to them &ldquo;you suffer on until we get an ideal solution&rdquo;. We had to take a step by step approach of doing something for them now rather than getting everything for them at some unnamed date in the mystic future.  Both the Sunningdale and the Anglo-Irish Agreements sought to redress the injustices suffered by the Nationalists and to bring about reconciliation between both communities with the intention of allowing all the people both North and South, to live in peace.</P>
    <P>Of course what the IRA have done in this regard is the absolute opposite to what we are trying to achieve.  They want to maintain the divisions between the Nationalists and Loyalists on this island. The parties in this Dáil, in the Parliament, and the signatories to the Sunningdale Agreement and to the New Ireland Forum, want to find an accommodation with the people in Northern <Col N="1031" /> Ireland.  However, the Supreme Court judgment in the McGimpsey case in March of this year characterised the reintegration of the national territory as a constitutional imperative.  The implication of that judgment is that it is not merely a political aspiration but that the Government of this State have a legal obligation to pursue a united Ireland, whereas my interpretation of the Constitution was that we had to build a State here that was economically attractive and a society that was based on the notions of pluralism and Christian democracy to encourage people of the Loyalist tradition to join with us of the Nationalist tradition to work together in a federal or unitary state where they could enjoy civil and political liberties, and to which they could give the allegiance they now give to the Crown.</P>
    <P>In that regard the New Ireland Forum was a watershed in the evolution of politics on this island in that The Workers' Party who were not members of the New Ireland Forum but from what Deputy De Rossa has said, would have supported it, the Labour Party, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Social Democratic and Labour Party in the North of Ireland, the major voice of constitutional nationalism in the North, have all said formally to Unionists for the first time in over 60 years, that they had a right to be on this island, a right to be what they were and that our only interest in them was to find a way to work with them so that we could live in peace and harmony together in the future.  Unfortunately, the judgment handed down in the McGimpsey case could be interpreted by the Provisional IRA as giving the right to achieve by violence what the vast majority of the Nationalist people both North and South have said they want to bring about by peaceful means.  That is what has changed the attitude of the Fine Gael Party towards Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Earlier Deputy De Rossa quoted Mr. Cosgrave as saying that these Articles were a fiction.  That was true, and that was the interpretation of most people &mdash;<Col N="1032" /> that they were an aspiration and had no legal effect.  That changed last March as a result of the Supreme Court decision in the McGimpsey case.  That is why this party have changed and why we will now support a Second Reading of this Bill proposed by The Workers' Party.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 in the names of Deputies Gilmore and O'Sullivan.  Amendment No. 3 is an alternative.  It is suggested, therefore, for discussion purposes that we take amendments Nos. 2 and 3 le chéile.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 34 to 36, and in page 5, lines 1 to 3, to delete paragraphs (a) and (b). </P>
      <P>One of the deficiencies in this Bill relates to the number of cases where exemptions are provided for in the Bill.  In the definition section, in relation to what constitutes a discharge, two categories of exemption are provided for: dumping within the meaning of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, or the release of oil, oily mixtures, noxious liquid substances or harmful substances directly arising from the exploration, exploitation and associated offshore processing of seabed mineral resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be interesting to hear the reasons for exempting these categories in paragraphs (a) and (b).  In relation to the paragraph dealing with offshore oil and gas exploration we can envisage many situations where there may well be discharges from such activity which would pollute the sea.  As I understand it, that paragraph would effectively exempt any of the offshore oil or gas platforms which operate off our coast.  That is a serious omission because there is potential for <Col N="1033" /> considerable pollution of the sea from the activity associated with mineral exploration offshore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in my name is one which states very clearly that we firmly believe there should be no exception to dumping whatsoever.  We are very far behind other nations in regard to our acceptance of dumping, for whatever reason, but from this I will exclude accidental dumping.  In paragraphs (a) and (b) we are not referring to accidental dumping or accidental damage but about dumping that would occur from experimentation or exploitation of the seabed in the search for mineral resources.  I would like to hear what the Minister will have to say about the Dumping at Sea Act because for too long we have accepted that the sea is the refuse bin of the nation and of other nations where ships come and dump outside our territorial waters but, nevertheless off our coast.  This has a serious effect on marine life and on the area surrounding our coast.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is a serious attempt, as I believe it is, to control pollution of our waters, we will have to delete both of those paragraphs.  I cannot accept that there would be exceptions to the dumping of material which could cause serious damage to marine life and could put this country back years.  We will have to look very closely at other provisions of this section to ensure that they do not conflict with our attempt to introduce the MARPOL Agreement and to get to grips with what I consider to be the greatest threat to one of our natural resources.  I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say particularly in relation to paragraph (a).</P>

      <P>The reason I put down amendment No. 3 is, as already stated by <Col N="1034" /> Deputies Gilmore and O'Sullivan, that there should be no exceptions to dumping at sea.  Certainly paragraph (b) of this section needs to be removed.  It smacks very much of the jobs-at-any-price philosophy which I thought had, once and for all, been laid to rest, but here is another example of it.  Let us not forget it is jobs at the expense of other jobs.  In many areas for every job gained, frequently one or more jobs are lost in tourism, mariculture and so on.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  On reflection I agree with the amendment put down by the two previous speakers which seeks to delete paragraphs (a) and (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that these two paragraphs were included in the Bill and I hope the Minister will be in a position to give us a detailed explanation. Dumping at sea, regardless of what type, under whatever regulations or conventions, should not occur.  Relatively speaking, we have been fairly strict in regard to the type of activity that occurs on land but there is a belief abroad that anything is good enough for the sea and if it is taken sufficiently far out it is safe, that if it is taken to trenches in deepwater that is fine, the danger ceases.  That attitude is not acceptable because we all know regardless of the depth of the waters there is still movement in the sea bed which can vary from time to time.  I am totally opposed to paragraph (a) even within the meaning of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.  This Bill should prohibit all types of dumping, regardless of rules and regulations or monitoring and accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of paragraph (b) in section 3 (1), which deals with the release of oily mixtures and other substances, will release exploration companies from certain obligations and make it easier for them to conduct exploration in a carefree and haphazard way.  Therefore, those companies will not be too concerned about preventing the release of oil and other substances which need to be monitored.  The fact that the Bill will not cover exploration will make it more <Col N="1035" /> difficult for the Department of Energy to issue exploration licences.  This Bill should strengthen the hand of the Department of Energy in the issue of exploration licences for oil and gas off our coast and for that reason I do not think this exemption should be included in it.</P>
    <P>Much activity takes place off our coast, particularly in the Continental Shelf, and there is an onus on the exploration companies to ensure that the least amount of pollution possible occurs.  Most of the exploration companies are multinationals with a lot of capital behind them.  They can afford to take the preventive measures necessary to ensure that the minimum amount of pollution occurs.  It is important that the same type of rigorous strictures apply to them as apply to the ships which use our waters.  For that reason I oppose section 3 (1) (b).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the contributions of the Deputies on these amendments I am gaining in euphoria that we are going to have a good Bill, well debated and discussed and decided after a proper teasing out of the issues.</P>
      <P>Were the situations mentioned by the four Deputies not adequately covered otherwise I would be the first to accept the amendments before the House.  I want to explain exactly what I mean by &ldquo;covered&rdquo;.  Article 2 of the MARPOL Convention defines the word &ldquo;discharge&rdquo;. Article 2 (3) (a) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Discharge&rdquo;, in relation to harmful substances or effluents containing such substances, means any release howsoever caused from a ship and includes any escape, disposal, spilling, leaking, pumping, emitting or emptying; </P>
      <P>Article (3) (b) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Discharge&rdquo; does not include:</P>
      <P>(i)  dumping within the meaning of the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters, done at London on 13 November 1972; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> (ii)  release of harmful substances directly arising from the exploration, exploitation and associated off-shore processing of seabed mineral resources; or</P>
    <P>(iii) release of harmful substances for the purposes of legitimate scientific research into pollution abatement or control. </P>
    <P>That is the definition of &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; in the MARPOL Convention which we are in the process of adopting.  We are giving effect to the Convention and its definition of &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; and exclusions must be accepted by us.</P>
    <P>With regard to dumping at sea, under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, dumping is controlled by a licensing system, as this House very well knows, and by prosecutions in cases of illegal dumping.</P>
    <P>With regard to discharges from exploration which was referred to by a number of Deputies, discharges arising from off-shore explorations are subject to regulations under the Continental Shelf Act, 1968.  As the Deputies who have read the Bill carefully will be aware this will be amended by section 36 of the Bill. The position is that while the concerns raised by the Deputies opposite are valid they are covered by MARPOL 1973 and other statutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three categories of exemptions identified under this definition.  I have no problem with the exemption made for the purposes of scientific research and I am open to persuasion on the exemption which relates to the London dumping convention.  In regard to releases in connection with exploration or exploitation of sea-bed mineral resources, I had a quick glance at section 36 which the Minister stated covered such releases by way of amendment to the Continental Shelf Act, 1968. I must say from my reading of the section that it does not appear to adequately cover the situation at all.  It provides that the Minister for Energy may make regulations prohibiting or regulating the discharge of oil, and so on from a pipeline or otherwise than from a ship as a result <Col N="1037" /> of any exploration or exploitation of the seabed.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a specific question: are service vessels which service oil rigs and operate out of Irish ports exempt under the definition included in the Bill?  From my reading of the section it would appear that they are exempt because they are engaged in an activity which arises directly from the exploitation or exploration or off-shore processing of seabed mineral resources.</P>
      <P>Secondly, what is the position in relation to oil rigs &mdash; are they exempted or included?  I raise this point specifically because there is a fair deal of exploration for oil and gas off our coast.  Deputy Garland referred to the employment potential which has been generated by that.  I certainly welcome the employment generated by this activity but I am also aware that &mdash; fortunately none of this has occurred in our waters &mdash; there have been very serious accidents on oil rigs in the North Sea.  In the case of the most serious accident which occurred in 1988 &mdash; the name of the rig escapes me at present, but I am sure the Minister will recall it &mdash; very serious questions were raised at that time about the standard of maintenance on the rig.  That accident resulted not only in the loss of life but in very serious pollution of the North Sea.</P>
      <P>As I have said, fortunately there has not been any example of that type of accident here but it is important that we know precisely the position in regard to oil rigs.  I would be concerned if oil rigs were totally exempt from these provisions because that could give rise to abuse.  I should like the Minister to clarify the position in relation to service vessels and, specifically, in relation to oil rigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the specific point of the amendment, the exemption relates merely to the release of harmful substances directly arising from the exploration, exploitation and processing of sea bed mineral resources.  The safety of rigs, etc. is quite a different question. We are covering releases into the sea and the MARPOL Convention excludes the three discharges I have just mentioned. <Col N="1038" /> The position is as I outlined.  There is coverage in MARPOL and coverage by specific statute.</P>
      <P>We will come to the amendment of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968 at section 36. The Government made a decision on 17 May 1990 approving the text of the Bill, subject to amending the text to cover all territorial seas.  The amendment will apply to pipelines used for offshore exploration operations, etc. and to any operation for the exploration of the seabed.  The Department of Energy and the Department of the Marine are currently in discussion with the parliamentary draftsman on suitable amendments to be made on Committee Stage on this point.</P>
      <P>Section 36 states:</P>
      <P>The Continental Shelf Act, 1968, is hereby amended by the substitution for section 7 of the following section:</P>
      <P>7. &mdash;(1) The Minister for Energy, in consultation with the Minister for the Marine, may make regulations prohibiting or regulating the discharge of any oil, oily mixture, noxious liquid substance, harmful substance, sewage or garbage&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  from a pipe-line, or</P>
      <P>(b)  otherwise than from a ship, as a result of any operation for the exploration of the sea-bed and subsoil, or the exploitation of their natural resources in a designated area. </P>
      <P>(2)  Where there is a contravention of any such regulations the owner of the pipe-line or, as the case may be, the person carrying on the operations shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>(3)  A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000, or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding twelve months, or, at the discretion of the court, to both such fine and such imprisonment, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £10,000,000, <Col N="1039" /> or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding 5 years, or, at the discretion of the court, to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The points raised by Deputy Gilmore are covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the MARPOL Convention states only a limited number of items.  In this Bill the Minister has adhered fairly closely to the MARPOL Convention but he is not obliged to confine himself to what is contained in that convention.  There is an opportunity to show national independence on this matter and to show that he is more committed than the MARPOL Convention to the protection of the marine environment by introducing tighter guidelines.</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement with regard to the pipeline is open to question.  It could be interpreted to mean solely the pipeline coming on shore from a rig, while the pipe from the rig to the seabed could be interpreted as the drill.  There is a danger that the exploration could be exempt and that the section would apply only to the pipe going on shore.  There is a defect in what the Minister is suggesting and there is a need for a real examination of the position.  I still believe that neither exemption should be included.  The Minister has an opportunity to show his independence and a commitment over and above that of other countries and I ask him to withdraw both subsections.</P>

      <P>If there is a breach in a gas pipeline and liquid gas is polluting the sea, I understand it is covered by this legislation.  It seems that the requirements for reporting such leaks are not very strong and that the penalties in the event of a prosecution are very mild.  A company might be prepared to risk a <Col N="1040" /> fine of £1,000 on summary conviction or £10,000 on conviction on indictment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister drew a distinction between a discharge and the standards of safety and maintenance on an oil rig.  I would remind him that discharges can result, and have resulted, from accidents which have occurred on oil rigs and those accidents in turn have been attributed to standards of maintenance on the oil rig.  I would refer the Minister to some of the famous North Sea cases where there have been major blowouts and people like Red Adare have tried to cope with the associated problems.  The Bill is quite specific when it deals with ships and relating the possibility of polluting discharges to the standard of maintenance on ships.  We should not have one rule for ships, another rule for oil rigs and another for something else.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not reply to the specific question I asked earlier.  I draw from what he said that oil rigs will be exempt from the Bill as it stands, but I am not clear about the position of vessels which will be servicing oil rigs and whether they are included.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The ships attending oil rigs are not exempt.  Regarding oil rigs themselves, we will probably have a fruitful discussion on that matter under section 36.  They are exempt under section 3 but section 36 applies the terms of the Bill to them.</P>

However, as the Minister will recall when we debated the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Bill &mdash; which transferred responsibility for the harbour from the Office of Public of Works to the Department of the Marine &mdash; it was clear that the intention was that that was to be an interim arrangement pending the establishment of a statutory harbour authority.  As we know, the Minister has established an interim harbour authority and I know he is committed to establish, on a statutory basis, a proper harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I hope it will not be long before the necessary legislative measures are implemented to establish a statutory harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that in this Bill, the provision &mdash; which is really one of stating that the harbour authority would be the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine &mdash; is seen to be an arrangement pending the establishment of a statutory harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire.  In that way it would be clear from the provisions of this Bill that the control by the Department of the Marine of Dún Laoghaire Harbour applies until such time as a statutory harbour authority is established.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will have no difficulty in accepting that amendment.</P>

      <P>I would think that the <Col N="1045" /> establishment of a harbour authority for any major port would be essential to the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill. I am trying at this stage to make a case for the establishment of a harbour authority at Howth.  At present the Harbour is under the authority of the Department of the Marine and is without a harbour-master. It is very difficult to run the port, let alone monitor pollution, without a harbour-master.  Howth is a major fishing port on the east coast.  It had landings of fish worth £4.7 million last year.  It caters for large beamers and very large trawlers, and the establishment of a harbour authority there would be very beneficial to the running of the port and help in the monitoring of pollution.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister's amendment, or Deputy Gilmore's amendment to it, has to be tabled at this point.  This House hoped a considerable time ago that Dún Laoghaire harbour authority would have been set up by now on a statutory basis.  I appeal to the Minister to view this matter urgently and set up a proper harbour authority in Dún Laoghaire.  I know he took over the responsibility some time ago from the Office of Public Works, but we were promised repeatedly in this House that a Dún Laoghaire harbour commission would be established.  It is unfortunate that at the end of 1990 we still have not got this much promised harbour authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I support the general thinking behind both amendments, I hope this will be temporary and will prevail only until a proper harbour authority are put in place in Dún Laoghaire, one of the busiest ports in the country.  There is a need for a proper harbour authority to monitor and develop the harbour in Dún Laoghaire.  There is tremendous potential there and it is up to the local authority, and members of the harbour board who will be appointed, to set about doing that work.  The Department of the Marine have a national responsibility and harbour authorities have responsibility for specific harbours.  I support the line <Col N="1046" /> of both amendments but I appeal to the Minister to come before the House shortly with legislation in relation to Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy Gilmore's special interest in Dún Laoghaire. The interim board are working very well. We are vigilant in the Department about Dún Laoghaire and it is generally agreed that it is being well managed as of now. The fact is we must not lose sight of the main purpose of the Bill.  It is a sea pollution Bill and that is what it is all about.  Whether the authority are statutory or non-statutory, interim or permanent, the sea pollution aspect is the paramount aspect of the Bill and we want to apply it no matter what type of authority are there.  I cannot say I am blaming or being critical of Deputy Gilmore for using the opportunity of getting his blow in for a permanent harbour authority, but we are now concerned with sea pollution. For that reason I want Dún Laoghaire included and to have the protection of this Bill.  As the Deputy knows, the interim board are working very well at the moment and we will have eventually a statutory authority.</P>
      <P>I accept that Howth is without a harbour master at the moment but that is not connected with the fact that there is not a harbour authority.  The Deputy knows the circumstances with regard to the harbour-master in Howth.  I am not in any way minimising the importance of Howth as a fishing port or the size of the business there each year.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn was exaggerating a little when she talked about &ldquo;constantly promised&rdquo; and so on.  I want to put on the record what is known in the House, that the Bill transferring Dún Laoghaire Harbour to the Department of the Marine is the Bill of 1990, though Deputy Taylor-Quinn made it sound as if there were decades involved with regard to this authority.</P>

      <P>The last thing in the world I want to do is delay the process of this Bill on a local matter.  My only concern here is that this section of the Bill defines what a harbour authority is and the Minister's amendment defines the harbour authority in the case of Dún Laoghaire as the Minister for the Marine. My concern is that that would establish on a permanent basis the Minister for the Marine as the harbour authority for Dún Laoghaire with no reference to the concept which, when we debated the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Authority Bill, seemed to have been accepted by the Minister, that he would in the not too distant future establish on a statutory basis a proper Dún Laoghaire harbour authority.  If the Minister can simply tell me that is his intention I will be happy to withdraw the amendment and accept his good faith in the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 12, after &ldquo;a&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>For me the amendment before the House is one of the most important.  I know the Minister can appoint an inspector which could mean a surveyor of ships, a person appointed to be an inspector by warrant of the Minister under section 20, an officer holding a commissioned naval rank with the Defence Forces or a member of the Garda Síochána.  I have a difficulty with the last part.  I have asked for the insertion of a &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; member of the Garda Síochána.  I have no argument about appointing a particular garda but under sections 20 and 21 it could mean that an inspector would have the power to order a harbour-master to do certain things or take certain action which I feel he may not be qualified to do under the Bill as it is.  As we all know, a harbour-master has a very important and difficult job.</P>
      <P>I was under the impression that the Harbours Act should be repealed to allow the appointed person to override the harbour-master's power.  Unless the Minister states categorically that the Garda appointed should be suitably qualified in matters concerning the pollution of the sea, in matters concerning shipping, this cannot work.  I do not see, under the sections laid down, that that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 provide for the appointment of inspectors by the Minister and his or her scale of powers are very far-reaching indeed.  I also notice that an inspector could mean surveyor of ships, an officer holding a commissioned naval rank, a member of the Garda Síochána, etc.  I maintain that a member of the Garda Síochána must have a specific rank with qualifications, sea-going experience or experience in dealing with noxious substances.  I cannot understand why the Minister has not included harbour-masters as inspectors.  If the harbour-master was an inspector he would have full control.  There is confusion in my mind as to the powers of an inspector <Col N="1049" /> and those of a harbour-master.  Section 23 (3) is as follows:</P>
    <P>If the harbour-master has refused entry under subsection (1), the Minister, or a person appointed under subsection (2), may direct the harbour-master to permit the ship to enter, and to comply with such conditions as may be specified, in which case the harbour-master shall permit the ship to enter the harbour upon such conditions, and the Master of the ship shall comply with said conditions.</P>
    <P>This gives fairly wide ranging powers to an inspector to override a harbour-master in this instance.  To go back to my original point, the Minister has indicated that he could appoint an ordinary Garda to be an inspector.  Will the Minister clarify the position because it seems to be unsatisfactory? I have experience of the port of Cork and other areas where harbour-masters have to take on a very important and vital role.  A harbour-master has a Master's Ticket and is normally fully qualified to deal with any shipping emergency within his jurisdiction, which is the whole harbour area.  I would like the Minister to explain why he has provided that a Garda could become an inspector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the section defining an inspector is sufficiently specific and it is for that reason that I tabled an amendment to section 20.  My amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;with suitable qualifications&rdquo;.  The reason I tabled that amendment is the legislation is very specific as to what an inspector is.  He is a surveyor of ships, a person appointed to be an inspector by warrant of the Minister under section 20, an officer holding a commissioned naval rank in the Defence Forces or a member of the Garda Síochána.  I do not object strictly to the definition that is there, but I do think it is limited and that there is a need for a broader definition, particularly when one is dealing with modern naval or maritime activity.  Modern ships carry a variety of goods, a variety of chemicals, <Col N="1050" /> a variety of toxic liquids, dangerous substances of all sorts, and there are various types of ships traversing the seas.</P>
      <P>The different types of situations that could occur where an inspector would need to be put on board are quite considerable and I believe there is a need to include as inspectors people with scientific, engineering and, indeed, nuclear qualifications.  The definition of inspector is much too limited in view of modern developments and the variety of situations that now occur.  There is a real necessity to broaden the definition and to include persons with suitable qualifications and expertise.  If the Minister includes that amendment it will give him the necessary legislative power to employ or instruct somebody to go on board a ship or do what is necessary in the circumstances with the necessary legal documentation, and there will be people with that additional expertise over and above those with legal expertise.  A member of the Garda Síochána, or indeed an inspector or superintendent, are very much legal people implementing the law.</P>
      <P>In relation to the contravention of this Bill, there is a need for the Minister to have a case that he can sustain.  That is why it is important that the inspector who goes on board should be in a position to make a scientific or engineering analysis or have whatever other type of expertise is required.  It is for that reason I am tabling this amendment and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of what has been said by the previous two speakers.  There is a need to be clear about who may or may not be appointed as inspectors.  It is important, however, not to get carried away and require inspectors to have PhDs in nuclear physics before they can go aboard a vessel to carry out some of the functions that are provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would imagine, and I think it is provided for in the Bill, that the appointment of inspectors may differ from time to time, but the warrant appointing an <Col N="1051" /> inspector may specify particular functions and requirements given the particular situation.  We have to have a clear priority and the priority here is to prevent sea pollution and to find the evidence of where sea pollution is occurring so that the persons responsible can be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Obviously the persons appointed as inspectors would have to be suitably qualified and I take the point made by Deputy O'Sullivan in the case of members of the Garda for example.  It does not need to be clear whether we are talking about any garda being appointed as an inspector.  Are we talking about a situation where any member of the local Garda Síochána can walk down to a harbour-master and, on foot of this Bill, make requirements of that harbour-master? That needs to be clarified. However, there is a balance to be struck between making sure that there is no abuse of the powers conferred on an inspector and, at the same time, that we do not set the standards for the appointment of inspectors so high that it would be virtually impossible to find somebody in the State who would fulfil those requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make up my mind on this amendment when I hear what the Minister has to say.  As Deputy Gilmore said, one can look at this question in two ways.  Section 21 outlines the powers the inspector will have.  We need to project our minds forward to what inspectors will be doing and what timescale is involved. There may be a high degree of urgency in appointing an inspector.  It may be that at the end of the day the only person available who would get to the scene before the ship leaves port would be a local garda.  By accepting this amendment one could be constraining whoever is responsible for appointing the inspector. It may be that flexibility is required. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As was adverted to by other speakers, Deputy O'Sullivan <Col N="1052" /> pitched the qualifications very high.  I will outline to the House precisely what we are doing.  The intention is that members of the Garda Síochána and commissioned officers of the Naval Service would only be used as support to the technically qualified inspectors in the performance of such duties as stopping and detaining ships and ship personnel.  It is important to stress that.</P>
      <P>The marine surveyors of my Department will be qualified to carry out all the functions appropriate to an inspector. With regard to the inspectors appointed by the Minister under section 20, which was adverted to by Deputy O'Sullivan, they would have warrants &mdash; I want to emphasise this very important point &mdash; and the warrants would specify the functions they could perform.  I would have to be satisfied that the inspector was qualified and equipped to perform those functions.</P>
      <P>The statement made by Deputy O'Sullivan that, for example, an inspector could overrule the harbour-master is not correct.  The only person who could overrule the harbour-master is the Minister of the day, and it is important that that is known.  There are examples where gardaí have been used for inspection purposes. One example is the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988.  Under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, the gardaí are deemed to be sea fisheries protection officers.  There is no question of making demands for over-qualified people or using under-qualified people for functions to which they are not suited.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made life more difficult.  I have been listening to this debate on the monitor.  As a harbour commissioner in a harbour not too far from here, I am well aware &mdash; or at least I thought I was well aware &mdash; of the powers of the harbour-master but as I read this Bill I think the Minister is creating a monster.  He said the inspector will be a support for the qualified personnel, who I assume will be the harbour-master.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is in support and he has the warrant, he is the boss.  There is a need for the Minister to be very clear about the position of these inspectors in terms of the port authorities covered by the Harbours Act, 1946.  We know there are many ports and harbours other than those covered by that Act which carry on a great deal of trade.  Therefore one sees the need for a person such as an inspector who would cover these ports, some of which bring in a lot of business.  For example, there is a very busy private port outside Arklow, and I can see the need for an inspector in that area where the Arklow harbour-master would have no rights or duties.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am concerned that there would be some conflict under the Harbours Act as to which of the personnel would have the duty to carry out inspections.  At present the harbour-master has that duty.  Perhaps the Minister might be advised to make amendments to the Harbours Act, 1946, to allow a harbour-master to do the work that is to be carried out by these inspectors. The harbour-master is appointed not as a servant but as an officer in his own area.  He has to go before the Local Appointments Commission for appointment and he must have certain qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see a possible duplication in appointing an inspector who, as the Minister has said, may be less qualified than the harbour-master but yet will have the power of a warrant to carry out specific duties in this area.  It is in this regard that I have a difficulty with the Bill and that is the reason I came in here tonight. Those of us who represent the ports should know exactly what the Minister is doing.  I see no provision in this Bill to <Col N="1054" /> repeal any sections of the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will give some time during the next year to modifying and up-dating that legislation which has been in operation for the last 45 years. This legislation is outdated in many areas, for example, as regards ports and in this area.  These problems were not considered when that Act was brought into law.  The Minister may be creating a difficulty for those port authorities covered by the Act in that specific duties are conferred on the harbour-master under the Act while the Minister is giving the inspector similar duties under this Bill. There seems to be considerable conflict as between the duties outlined in the Bill before us and those which are laid down very specifically in the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to insert &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; as an adjective to Garda Síochána.  With regard to the Act which the Deputy rightly says is 45 years on the Statute Book, I think the Deputy knows &mdash; I have made it known publicly &mdash; that a review of all harbour legislation is being carried out in my Department at present as a matter of urgency, having regard to changing circumstances in 1992.  I said specifically that the marine surveyors of the Department will be fully qualified to carry out all the functions appropriate to the inspectors. The second set of inspectors appointed by me will carry a warrant and their functions will be specifically stated in the warrant. There will be no question of confusion or a clash of authority as far as they are concerned. These functions will be performed when the Department &mdash; and I as Minister &mdash; are satisfied that the particular inspector is qualified and equipped to perform those duties.  There is no question of enlarging the powers.</P>
      <P>As far as the point about the harbour-master is concerned, I reiterate what I said already, that an inspector would have no power to overrule a harbour-master.</P>

      <P>I refer the Minister to section 23 (3) which says that if the harbour-master has refused entry under subsection (1), the Minister, or a person appointed under subsection (2), may direct the harbour-master to permit the ship to enter.  It is clear that the inspector may override the harbour-master.  He may direct the harbour-master to permit the ship to enter the harbour and to comply with such conditions as may be specified, in which case the harbour-master shall permit the ship to enter the harbour upon such conditions, and the master of the ship shall comply with the said conditions.  As Deputy Kavanagh said, there will be a very clear direction by the inspector, the man with the warrant, who has been appointed by the Minister. He is the boss when there is a disagreement in relation to a ship.  That is why I included the words &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; member of the Garda Síochána because, as I outlined already, the harbour-master, generally speaking, has the qualifications of a sea-going man.  He has his ticket, he knows his harbour, the ships, the conditions and, again generally speaking, the cargoes of the ships entering port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great difficulty in accepting what the Minister said even though he may have meant that he would be supportive of the harbour-master.  However, it is clearly stated in the section to which I referred that that is not the case.  It states that the harbour-master will be under the control of the inspector when it comes to a dispute about a certain vessel.  That is why I inserted &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; member of the Garda Síochána because, technically speaking, a Garda Síochána, under this Bill, can be appointed an inspector.  I have grave reservations about a garda being appointed an inspector. I do not want an inspector to be a professor in a particular field, I want to him to be a man who has knowledge of the sea, ships and pollution.  He should be a man &mdash; or woman &mdash; who can decide whether a ship can enter the port.  If the Minister had said that the harbour-master can be an inspector it would at least have tied the two things together. <Col N="1056" /> However, I have difficulty in accepting that the Minister or the Department can appoint a member of the Garda Síochána. I do not mean any disrespect to the Garda Síochána but, under this Bill, an ordinary garda who has no knowledge of the sea, cargoes, wreckage, pollution or toxic waste could, technically, be appointed an inspector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, speaking earlier on the amendment, stated that the suitable qualifications would apply to the Garda Síochána. Amendment No. 21a in my name refers to &ldquo;suitable qualifications and expertise&rdquo; in relation to someone that the Minister may, by warrant, appoint to be an inspector to carry out, for the purposes of this Act, such functions as are specified in the warrant.  Section 20 is not specific and that is why I tabled the amendment.  I am afraid that a situation will arise in future where literally anybody could be appointed an inspector.  Will the Minister say where it is stated in the Bill that an inspector from his Department will have expertise?  There is nothing in the Bill which suggests that to me.</P>
      <P>In other areas of the Department of the Marine bailiffs appointed by the local fishery boards were political appointees &mdash; we might as well be honest about it &mdash; who in many instances, know very little about their job.  However, when some of them acquired power they abused it.  That is a reality in different parts of the country and I tabled the amendment to ensure that someone, for political patronage purposes &mdash; I am not suggesting that the Minister would do that &mdash; would not give this authority to someone unsuitable.  The definition of &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; is not adequate and I am concerned that people without the necessary expertise or qualifications would be able to board a ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh made a lot of sense in relation to the position of the harbour-master and the Minister should look at the points raised by him in relation to the Harbours Act, 1946.  I should not like to see someone who knows less than the local harbour-master acquiring power to <Col N="1057" /> execute the necessary work under the warrant.</P>

The proposers of the amendment are seeking a very modest addition &mdash; the insertion of the words &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; in the definition. Presumably, the Minister will not appoint somebody who is not suitably qualified so perhaps the simplest thing would be for the Minister to accept the proposed amendments which would enable us to make more progress on the Bill.</P>

      <P>All of the inspectors appointed in my Department have special qualifications for their roles. Marine surveyors are the first I mention, and they are qualified to carry out all the functions of an inspector under this Bill. Later we will be dealing with section 23 in relation to specific inspectors.  Those inspectors will have a warrant and I and my Department will have to be satisfied that they are fully qualified and equipped to perform the duties specified in the warrant.  The warrant is the job specification. They will have to be qualified before being appointed to do the job outlined in the warrant.</P>
      <P>Somebody appointed by the Minister to go down to that little place south of Arklow would be fully qualified and would have specified in his warrant what he is entitled to do.  If the Minister decided to overrule the harbour-master's decision, the inspector is the only person who could do so.  I accept, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, that the harbour-master is usually a man of experience with regard to all the matters covered in this Bill.  I have taken full cognisance of that in the wording of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The warrant will specify the job and the person who has it will know what he is supposed to do but where in the Bill does it state that the person who will get that warrrant will have the qualifications to implement that warrant?  I put down the amendment because, as far as I am concerned, that was not specified in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a whole range of qualified inspectors in my Department.  I do not pull them out of the sky or pick them off the street.  They have to apply for their jobs, show their qualifications, pass an interview, and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing about whether departmental inspectors are qualified.  I fully accept that they are qualified, but the Bill does not state that the inspectors appointed will be from the Department.  It only says that the Minister will arrange to have a warrant issued <Col N="1059" /> to a person who is an inspector.  Then it defines in section 3 what an inspector shall be.  In section 20 it further defines what an inspector will be, but it does not specifically state that the person who will be appointed inspector will necessarily have special qualifications and expertise in that area to actually implement the job specification in relation to the warrant. That is the deficiency in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that in the Minister's opinion a garda would support the inspector who would have to go on a ship.  Why is the garda specified in the Bill if the Department have very efficient inspectors?  The Department have proved this over and over again.  In the Bantry Bay debacle the inspectors did an excellent job controlling pollution and their expertise is beyond question.</P>
      <P>My difficulty relates to why a harbour-master cannot be an inspector.  Is there a clash of interests here?  The harbour-master would be the ideal inspector in certain cases and it would save quite a lot of money.  The Minister should answer that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having read the sections carefully I am still convinced that the inspector can override the harbour-master.  The inspector will have a warrant and will be acting on the Minister's behalf so that the Minister can override the harbour-master.  In relation to the appointment of an inspector, the Bill says clearly that a garda can be an inspector.  Unless a suitable adjective is inserted in front of the word &ldquo;Garda&rdquo; the word &ldquo;Garda&rdquo; should be taken out.  Looking at it realistically a garda can go to the harbour-master and insist that a ship will come in, even if the harbour-master disagrees, because a garda can say that he has the warrant, that he has been appointed by the Minister and that he is acting on behalf of the Minister.  Has the Minister discussed this problem with harbour-masters or harbour boards?  I suspect that there is a certain amount of concern in harbour authorities about this aspect of the Bill <Col N="1060" /> which concerns harbour employees and the harbours for which they are responsible.</P>
    <P>We should try to plug every loophole in the Bill.  This is the first time we have had a Bill of this nature before us.  It is the first time we will be appointing inspectors with certain duties to carry out.  I would have difficulty in accepting a garda or other inspector appointed by the Minister when qualifications are not specified in the Bill.  An ordinary garda without any qualifications in this area could be appointed as an inspector and he would have far ranging powers in determining what happens in certain ports or harbours.  I accept the Minister's motives but I cannot accept the Minister's proposition.  If the Minister agrees to amend the Bill or to accept my amendment, I will be happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to keep our eye on the object of the exercise which is to put on the Statute Book a sea pollution Bill, not the powers or little empires of anybody.  I cannot envisage any situation where the inspector from my Department, the harbour-master, the officers of my Department or the Minister at the time would not be fully committed to the one objective, that is, to be as effective as possible in the control of pollution.</P>
      <P>Regarding the much emphasised Garda Síochána at paragraph (d) under the definition of &ldquo;inspector&rdquo;, that garda would have no powers except what the Minister gave him in the context of this Bill.  It is important to emphasise that if the Minister gives him power then he has it; if not he does not have it.  In the case mentioned by Deputy Kavanagh and, indeed, by other contributors to the debate &mdash; I am not sure if it was Deputy Gilmore &mdash; the garda might be available in an area where an accident took place which could cause serious pollution when nobody else would be available and it would be highly desirable that he be equipped with his warrant specifically stating what his powers would be in that instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to <Col N="1061" /> understand clearly that I am making a distinction between two different groups of ports and harbours: those covered by the Harbours Act and those which are not covered by the Act.  I see the need for this inspectorate for those areas which are not covered by the Act.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, if there are harbour-masters who are not appointed by local generals in any particular port but are required to prove before an appointments commission that they have the expertise, the master certificates etc., why is it not contained in the Act that they are appointed inspectors for their harbours under the Harbours Act and that the other categories of people, which the Minister has listed, including the member of the Garda Síochána, refer to those areas, which may not be ports but could still be polluted, for example, Brittas Bay or some such area that could be threatened?  Thus a member of the Garda Síochána might be the person, be he a garda, a sergeant or an inspector, urgently required to take control where there was a danger of oil pollution from a vessel.  I see the need for a provision such as this in the Bill, but I suggest very strongly to the Minister that where there is an expert he should automatically be designated the inspector. There is no doubt about the expertise in the Department.  When the Minister looks to his right he will be aware of the level of the expertise there.  Some of the officials in the Department know more about the harbours around this country than the harbour commissioners.  They have been dealing with them for a very long time and have been considering extensions which were being built and grants that were required.  They know exactly where everything is in every harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, in underlining the suggestion that where there are something of the order of 27 harbour authorities with harbour-masters etc., the Bill should provide that they be automatically designated the inspectors for their areas.  If the Minister has some reason why they should not be, then he should inform the House.  The <Col N="1062" /> Minister intimated earlier, and I was delighted to hear it, that he will review the whole Harbours Act.  There should be a fairly long debate on that subject because it is so outdated, and some of the appointments made under that Act need to be very closely scrutinised.  I urge the Minister to be very careful how he appoints inspectors because some of the methods for appointment of harbour commissioners under the provisions of the Harbours Act need to be reviewed but that is for another day.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell us why a harbour-master should not be the one automatically appointed as the inspector for those ports under the Harbours Act. If he could explain why that is, I might be prepared to advise my colleague that he should reconsider his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific amendment we are dealing with refers under paragraph (d) to a member of the Garda Síochána and is simply stated.  Deputy O'Sullivan has put down an amendment seeking to insert &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; and there are other amendments related to it. I can tell Deputy Kavanagh that when we come to deal with section 23 we will have a look at what he has been saying.  I am not making any promises &mdash; that would be a rash thing to do &mdash; but certainly I will have something to say about the points made by Deputy Kavanagh.  I would like to reiterate that the much needed review of the harbour legislation is under way at present in my Department.  We realise much time has passed since a worth-while review and revision of the legislation took place, and that review is in train at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister still has not answered the questions I put to him.  We have a situation where an inspector means a person appointed to be an inspector by warrant of the Minister under section 20.  Section 20 (1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, by warrant, appoint a person to be an inspector to carry out for the purposes of this Act <Col N="1063" /> such functions as are specified in the warrant. </P>
    <P>Where in this Bill is it stated that that inspector must be from the Minister's Department?  I know the Minister would appoint one of his own inspectors.  We are putting through this House legislation that will be on the Statute Book for future Ministers and we want to ensure that it is so specific and tight that there is no leeway for strange machinations.  This is a dangerous situation.  Under paragraph (b) defining &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; and under section 20, the local Fianna Fáil cumann member or the Fine Gael branch member or a Labour Party branch member, who has the ear of the Minister, or the parish priest or the local shopkeeper could be appointed an inspector if the Minister of the day was crazy enough to do that.  This Bill does not prevent the Minister from taking that action.  Where in this Bill is the guarantee that the inspector will be a person from his Department or a person with the necessary expertise to execute the warrant with which that inspector is issued?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy forgot to mention The Workers' Party.  As they were committed to their community and taking part in the political process, that would not necessarily exclude them from an inspectorate provided they had the qualification which my Department insist that inspectors should have.  I do not think there is anything disreputable about belonging to any of the organisations mentioned by Deputy Taylor-Quinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave said a moment ago that Howth harbour does not have a harbour-master.  There is a problem there which when resolved will result in a harbour-master being made available to Howth harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my question.  He has gone right, left and side-ways but he has not answered the specific question I asked. This Bill is not specific and it is evident <Col N="1065" /> from the Minister's reply that the warrant may be issued to anybody because there is nothing in the Bill about appointing a person who is suitably qualified.  Our amendment provides for the appointment of someone with suitable qualifications and expertise but the Bill does not provide for this.  The Minister, by his reply in the House, has admitted that anybody can be appointed as an inspector under section 3 and section 20 by a Minister who is haywire enough.  We should remember that strange things happen in political life and that a Minister could do strange things in the future.  It is up to us to ensure that the legislation we pass has as few loopholes as possible so that this type of situation will not occur in the future.  I know I am talking about a hypothetical case but within the terms of the legislation it could occur.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment to ensure that that does not occur.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not specifically state that the inspector appointed and issued with a warrant shall be an inspector from the Department of the Marine.  Everyone agreed that the Minister's inspectors are excellent &mdash; the only problem is that he does not have enough staff &mdash; but the Bill does not specifically state that the inspectors shall be experts from the Minister's Department; and Joe Soap could be appointed.  I ask the Minister to guard against this happening by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much for clarifying the position.  My amendment was not put down today or yesterday; I put it down a while ago.  I studied carefully the phraseology used in the Bill and I completely accept the Minister's integrity on this issue.  I have no doubt about what he has said this evening.  He has made a determined effort to bring this Bill before the House so that it can be enacted as soon as possible. I accept this whole-heartedly and I have no doubts about his intentions.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, with all due respect to the Minister and the people who framed the Bill, I have to say that, like other Deputies, I am not clear about this provision. We have discussed this provision for nearly three quarters of an hour and some Members referred to the weak points in it.  I am as anxious as the Minister to ensure that any legislation into which I have an input is as strong and water-tight as possible.  I ask the Minister to look again at this amendment.  We have asked certain questions but the Minister has not answered them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that an inspector can be a member of the Garda Síochána. As Deputy Kavanagh said, perhaps the people who framed the Bill intended a member of the Garda Síochána to act only if a harbour-master was not present and, obviously, he has the law behind him to act in such a manner.  I have no difficulty with that provision but I have <Col N="1068" /> difficulty with the paragraph which specifically provides that a member of the Garda Síochána can become an inspector. I have great difficulty in accepting that provision.  If the words &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; are not included in this paragraph I will not be able to accept the section.  Even though the Minister has tried to explain this provision and outlined his Department's intentions, I am not satisfied that a member of the Garda who is appointed with a warrant would not in certain circumstances use his powers to override the harbour-master. My amendment stays.</P>

      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  Hugh Callaghan, Paddy Joe Hill, Gerry Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, Billy Power, John Walker &mdash; the Birmingham Six &mdash; are still in prison in their 17th year, having been brought into custody for crimes they did not commit on 21 November 1974.  An article by Tom McGurk in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Friday, 15 April 1988 stated:</P>
      <P>After 14 years and five months imprisonment for the Birmingham Six, it took less than an hour yesterday morning in a small ante room of the second floor of the House of Lords for a Committee of Law Lords to decide that there was no further reason for the British Judiciary to concern themselves with their conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Law Lords Keith, Griffiths and Oliver refused the Six permission to <Col N="1069" /> appeal against the failure of their original Court of Appeal hearing and as precedence has it gave no reason... </P>
    <P>I can understand in the light of subsequent events and taking account of precedents that their lordships did not give a reason.  It was wise not to do so in the light of subsequent events.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I wrote a letter, in conjunction with my brother, Niall Andrews MEP, to the Right Honourable John Major MP, Prime Minister, 10 Downing Street, London.  The letter stated:</P>
    <P>Dear Prime Minister,</P>
    <P>We write to you on behalf of the Birmingham Six who are beginning their seventeenth year in prison convicted of dreadful murders they did not commit.</P>
    <P>Their convictions cannot be sustained and the reported refusal of your D.P.P. to make an immediate recommendation to the Court of Appeal flies in the face of the new evidence on the forensic and confessions side of the case alleged against the men.</P>
    <P>In the ongoing climate of goodwill between your Government and the Government of Ireland, it would be very much appreciated in this country if you exercised your considerable powers to send the case to the Court of Appeal with the necessary recommendations before Christmas so as to end a deeply serious and continuing miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>Wishing you well in your new high office.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">David Andrews TD,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Niall Andrews MEP. </P>
    <P>As late as August last the case of Richard McIlkenny fell on the grounds that there was alleged and sustainable interference with his confession.  In other words, the confession was taken and it subsequently emerged under examination by new technology that the confession was interfered with.  That is reflected in the confessions of the other men.  Those of us who witnessed the court of appeal in 1987-88 will have seen the demeanour of Dr. Skuse, <Col N="1070" /> the Foreign Office forensic scientist who was fired from his position for limited capacity.  I respectfully suggest that the confession side of the case and the forensic side are very wanting.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, two very able people in the context of the Anglo-Irish Conference, and the Taoiseach to make a pre-Christmas representation to their counterparts in the UK to get the Director of Public Prosecutions, of whom I am not in any way critical, to send this case to the Court of Appeal with the recommendation that the men be declared innocent.  I further respectfully suggest that the British authorities be reminded of the precedent in the case of the Guildford Four.  That case went to the Court of Appeal with the recommendation that they be acquitted. All of the evidence has been there for the past 16 or 17 years but even more so in the past few months.</P>
    <P>It is a travesty of justice that these men remain in prison.  I urge the Government and the Ministers operating the Anglo-Irish Agreement to make the strongest recommendations to their counterparts once again.  They did so on 30 November at the most recent meeting of the conference.</P>

      <P>The fact that the issue of the Birmingham Six comes up again for consideration here testifies to the seriousness with which all sides in this House treat this case.  Over the years, many Deputies, including and in particular Deputy Andrews, have maintained an active and sustained interest in this important case.  It is only right that I should place on record the Government's great appreciation of the support and concern voiced by colleagues from all sides of the House; their interest and understanding have been of very considerable help to the Government in their pursuit of the case with the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's consistent and strong position on the Birmingham Six case reflects the broad and non-partisan desire of this House to have justice <Col N="1071" /> secured for these six men.  I know, too, that Deputies will share our dismay at the prospect of the six men spending their 17th Christmas in prison, if they are not released quickly.</P>
    <P>The Birmingham Six case is one of a small number of cases which date from the 1970s and which have been of the deepest concern to the Government. Dramatic developments have taken place in these cases in the last year or so.  The whole country shared in the great relief and joy at the quashing of the convictions of the Guildford Four, and at the encouraging announcements, arising out of the May Inquiry, made by the British Director of Public Prosecutions and the Home Secretary in relation to the Maguire family and their friends.  The Birmingham Six case, however, which dates from the same period as the other two and which shares with them very many of the same disturbing features still awaits a satisfactory resolution.</P>
    <P>I should recall at this stage that the Birmingham Six case is now before the courts; this will inevitably limit the scope of my remarks.</P>
    <P>When the then Home Secretary announced on 29 August that he was referring the Birmingham Six case to the Court of Appeal, the Taoiseach, in welcoming this decision, expressed the Government's hope that, in the interest of justice, this protracted case was at last close to a satisfactory solution.  While the Home Secretary's statement makes it clear that his decision was taken on the basis of a particular aspect of the case, the effect of that decision is that the whole case is now once more before the Court where it will be treated as an appeal by each of the six men.  It will, therefore, be open to each of the six to raise with the Court of Appeal any matter which they consider relevant.</P>
    <P>We have conveyed to the British authorities at every appropriate opportunity the urgent need for the earliest possible resolution of the case.  The Taoiseach raised the matter with the former British Prime Minister.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has discussed the case with the <Col N="1072" /> Home Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I also discussed it with the Home Secretary and will do so again shortly.  I will be raising the matter with my opposite number, the new Home Secretary, Mr. Kenneth Baker, in Rome over the next few days when we have a meeting of the Trevi Group of Ministers of Justice and the Interior.</P>
    <P>We have also, when we considered it appropriate, raised the case in the international context, including at the United Nations last September where the Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed the Government's sense of urgency in seeing the case satisfactorily resolved.  Most recently, we underlined our concern to the British authorities at the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting in Belfast last Friday.</P>
    <P>The Government have also taken an active and concerned interest in the prison conditions of the men; in this regard, we welcomed their reclassification last year from Category A to Category B.  On instructions, officials of the Embassy in London have been making regular visits on a structured basis to the men and have done everything possible to ensure their welfare.  The Embassy has also facilitated prison visits by a number of Deputies to the Six.  In this connection, I would again like to pay tribute to colleagues, including Deputy Andrews, who have been frequent visitors to the men and have brought hope and solidarity to them.</P>
    <P>I have, I believe, gone over in some detail the consistent commitment of the Government to securing justice for the Birmingham Six.  Over a period of years, we have vigorously conveyed our serious concern about the case to the British authorities and pressed them to undertake a complete review of the case.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, warmly welcomed the establishment of the Devon and Cornwall Police investigation into the case and its subsequent referral to the Court of Appeal.  While I feel it would be inappropriate for me to comment publicly on recent developments, and it appears that an interim decision was taken in the past <Col N="1073" /> week by the British Director of Public Prosecutions, I can assure Deputies that, with the strongest possible sense of urgency we will continue to convey to the British authorities the united view of this House and the people we represent about the need for an urgent resolution of this tragic case.  We do not want to see them in prison for another Christmas.  I can assure the Deputy that I will carry the points he has made here tonight to the British Home Secretary whom I will meet in Rome in the next couple of days.</P>

      <P>I support the request of the Castletownbere Fishermen's Co-operative Society Limited, Beara Fisheries Shipping Limited, Fast Fish Limited, Eiranova Fisheries Limited and James Scott Fisheries Limited, Castletownbere, for an extension of the territory under the jurisdiction of the Castletownbere harbour-master to include the inner and outer Castletownbere harbour from Ardnakinna Point inwards to Roancarrig Lighthouse with free access via outer Bantry Bay for all ships destined for Castletownbere port and Berehaven Sound Anchorage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this area be controlled and revenue collected by the harbour-master in Castletownbere.  It is also <Col N="1074" /> important that the area from Shot Head westwards be a free zone but, in the event of a marine casualty, this area should be controlled by the Castletownbere harbour-master. It is most important that these requests be granted by the Minister immediately as it is vital that the people of Castletownbere should have the right to manage their own business independent of the jurisdiction of the Bantry Harbour Board.  As chairman of the Bantry Harbour Board I can assure the Minister that the board have no objection to the Minister granting that request, thereby letting the people of Castletownbere manage their own business.  It is also vital that any charges placed on commercial fishing vessels coming into Berehaven Sound, be they for catching, processing, purchasing, trans-shipment of fish or vessels for repairs or any other emergency, should accrue to Castletownbere and the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>Castletownbere is one of the major fishery ports in this country and for this reason I ask the Minister to accede to my request on behalf of the people of Castletownbere.  They want jurisdiction over the inner and outer harbour and the Bantry harbour authorities have no objection to jurisdiction being placed with the harbour-master in Castletownbere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">

      <P>It is important that the Minister understands and realises fully the depth of feeling in Castletownbere, and indeed in the Beara Peninsula generally, at the effects of the order made by him on 19 October last. Emotions are running very high there and it is our duty as the Members of the Opposition from Cork South-West to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  I do not do this in any condemnatory fashion.  My colleague, Deputy Sheehan, and I bring with us a request from the people of the area that the Minister respond to their reasonable demands.  Essentially, they want jurisdiction over the inner and outer harbour with access thereto.  This is a very simple request.  It is also a very reasonable one. <Col N="1075" /> The Minister may say there are technical difficulties, be it a question of amending a Bill or the order of 19 October, but perhaps he would give a statement of intent that would defuse the matter forthwith.</P>
      <P>This is one of the major fishery harbours in the country with excellent berthage. At the beginning of the century it was used by the British Admiralty.  In fact, it was one of the ports under the Treaty not released back to the State until 1938.  It also has a harbour-master.  The people in the area want to control their own destiny and there is no conflict between the people in Castletownbere and Bantry.  I am glad to see the Minister giving full powers to the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  However, it comes down to a question of Castletownbere &mdash; 30 miles away &mdash; being asked to accept jurisdiction from Bantry.  It is just not on.</P>
      <P>Before the matter gets out of hand and emotions run too high, the Minister should try to defuse the situation and meet the deputation.  We would be very glad to accompany such a deputation to discuss the matter and to try to find a solution to this problem before it gets out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to what Deputy Sheehan and Deputy O'Keeffe had to say.  As the House knows, the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners were established under the Harbours Act, 1976, which was introduced by Deputy Peter Barry, to establish public authority control over shipping in the bay, particularly traffic to and from the Gulf Oil Terminal on Whiddy Island.  The 1976 Act defined the limits of the harbour and provided for the various parts of the Harbours Act, 1946, to be brought into operation by ministerial order.  The limits of the harbour are the area, including all tidal inlets, bounded by a straight line drawn from Sheeps Head to Crows Head and the line of high water, which area is known as Bantry Bay, but excluding the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to October 1990 only certain parts <Col N="1076" /> of the 1946 Act had been brought into operation in relation to the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners, for example, the constitution of the board, officers and servants of the board and finance and accounts.  The harbour commissioners had not been given powers, such as the power to charge rates or to control operations in the harbour.  As Deputies are aware &mdash; and Deputy Sheehan is the chairman &mdash; an order granting full powers to the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners was signed by me on 19 October.  This was requested very strongly by the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.  Consequent on this, the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners were requested to apply to me for a harbour rates order fixing goods, tonnage and other rates to be charged at Bantry Bay Harbour and submit for approval and confirmation by me by-laws for the good rule and government of Bantry Bay Harbour.</P>
    <P>Under the Harbours Act, 1946, a harbour authority, in accordance with rates fixed by me, may charge tonnage rates in respect of vessels entering within the limits of the harbour, goods rates in respect of goods shipped, trans-shipped or unshipped within the limits of the harbour, and service rates in respect of work done or services rendered by the authority in relation to those goods.  The position, therefore, is that traditional users of the bay, cruise liners, fish factory ships and so on who, up to now have not been liable for harbour dues, will be required once the Bantry Bay Harbour rates order has been made to pay dues to the Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners have now applied for a harbour rates order.  The commissioners were authorised by letter of 12 November 1990 to publish notice of the application to allow interested parties, within a specified period, to lodge objections or representations regarding the proposals.  It is understood that the commissioners will be publishing the notice within the next week or so.  Any objections or representation received must be taken into account by me before making the order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> The Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners have only recently been granted full powers.  They are now responsible for the management, control and operation of Bantry Bay Harbour. Safety of navigation will be of paramount importance in view of the mix of activity in the bay &mdash; fishing, oil, commercial aquaculture and amenity.  To do this effectively, they must have a source of revenue.  The commissioners are expected to operate as a commercial undertaking and to be financially selfsupporting. The harbour dues collected will, of course, be used by the commissioners to, <i>inter alia</i>, control operations in the bay.</P>
    <P>The Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre is managed and operated by my Department and Bantry Bay Harbour is also under the aegis of my Department. Therefore, the whole of the bay is under public control and because of this I see no compelling reason that the limits of jurisdiction of the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre should be extended. I listened carefully to what both Deputies had to say this evening.  If objections are received by me, following publication by Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners of notice of their application for a harbour rates order, the question of extending the area of jurisdiction of the Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre will be further considered by me.</P>
    <P>Some fishermen have expressed concern that they may be subjected to charges from Castletownbere Fishery Harbour Centre and, by Deputy Sheehan, in the Bantry Harbour Board.  This will not happen.  I am pleased to put those sentiments on the record of the House. I hope that the Deputies who showed concern will be pleased with them.</P>

      <P>The Minister closed the Celtic Sea herring fishery on Friday last resulting in 120 fishermen now being grounded and 120 factory workers being out of work because, as the Minister is aware, this herring fishery is a labour-intensive one, fishing being engaged in mostly for the extraction of roe for the Japanese market.  This means many families are affected, with many people now unemployed.  In addition, there are approximately 30 truck drivers unemployed as a result of this decision.</P>
      <P>There is no point in the Minister coming into this House this evening saying that the quota has been exhausted or that the entire fishery has been fished out.  This fishery has been reduced in recent years by unacceptable proportions. The onus rests on the Minister to do everything necessary to ensure increased quotas in future negotiations conducted within the EC for the Irish, particularly in the Celtic Sea.</P>
      <P>The Minister should recognise the serious position that has developed, particularly the number of families facing into the Christmas season without jobs who will have a very lean Christmas as a result of this closure.  I am appealing to the Minister this evening to examine the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an opening available to the Minister to allow at least 2,000 tonnes of the 1991 quota be fished between now and the end of December.  I am asking <Col N="1079" /> the Minister to bring forward 2,000 tonnes from the 1991 Celtic Sea fishery quota enabling that amount be fished out by the end of this year.  The Minister will be aware that the value of the fish per box now is much greater than it would be in January and February next; it is now almost double the price it would yield two months hence.  Therefore it makes a lot of economic sense from the Irish fisheries point of view to do so now.</P>

      <P>It is very clear that the consequences of the Minister's order are catastrophic for families all along the seaboard in south west Cork and beyond. My concern is with my area but its implications go beyond that.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister will refer to management committees and so on.  It is now a question of passing responsibility; the buck stops with the Minister.  We are seeking a solution.  In circumstances in which dozens of boats are tied up, with hundreds of people with on-shore and off-shore jobs now unemployed, facing into Christmas, can a solution be found at this stage, in order to allow them a couple of weeks' fishing, giving them some chance of Santa Claus rather than a bleak fare on their Christmas tables?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister tell the House now how it cannot be done, or rather outline to us what can be done?  Deputy Taylor-Quinn suggested bringing forward a couple of thousand tonnes from next year's quotas.  There may be other ways. For example, I heard talk of the need to re-establish the old boundaries of the Celtic Sea as between the Tusker and the Galley.  Although it was not then the responsibility of the Minister I gather that the change effected in 1982 may have been a contributory factor.  I am told that there are ample supplies of fish there.  Is there any way in which the Minister can give the fishermen a way of getting at them?</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Sheehan, was anxious to endorse the view and, with your approval, Sir, I would seek your indulgence to allow him do so.</P>

      <P>I endorse the sentiments expressed by Deputies Taylor-Quinn and Jim O'Keeffe, that the Minister do his very best to endeavour to solve this pressing problem.  Quite a number of people are now unemployed in Schull and Castletownbere fishing plants because of the lack of herring.  As Deputy Taylor-Quinn suggested, perhaps the Minister could bring forward 2,000 tonnes of next year's quota and allow the fishermen to fish them between now and Christmas which would go a long way to alleviating their position and restore some sanity to the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on this subject particularly in view of the ill-founded criticisms and comments reported in the media.</P>
      <P>I should explain from the outset that this year the Celtic Sea fishery was managed for the first time by a local management committee comprised of representatives of the Irish Fish Producers' Organisation &mdash; that is the fishermen &mdash; and the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters' Association.  On the basis of a quota allocation of 15,120 tonnes, the committee took key decisions with regard to the pace of exploitation of the quota.  This arrangement differed from last year when the fishery was managed by my Department, in such a way that the fishery remained open to the very end of the year.</P>
      <P>In so far as this fishery is concerned the core issues are very simple.  First, there is the question of proper management, in accordance with my legal obligations, of this important fishery in order to protect the long term interests of the fishermen and processors who benefit from the fishery.  In addition, there is the issue of the distribution of the available catch for the year so as to maximise the returns to fishermen and processors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the first issue, it is clear to all that this fishery is a particularly difficult one to manage.  There are elements involved who show no regard either to their own long term interests or to the interests of their fellow fishermen.  If the <Col N="1081" /> management committee are to work effectively they require the full support of fishermen.  Such support was not forthcoming this season.  This led to a disruption of the fishing pattern and to an earlier than planned closure.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would remind Deputies that the certain result of overfishing will be a collapse in the fishery, which could then be followed by a long period of closure so as to allow the fishery to recover.  This would be a disaster for all concerned.  Previous overfishing in the seventies led to just such a collapse and resulted in a five-year closure for the period 1977 to 1982.</P>
    <P>I am determined to ensure that this will not happen again.  This is largely an Irish fishery in which we have an 86 per cent share of the allowable catch.  The stock at present is not in the strongest of states. The quota in 1989 was 17,280 tonnes.  On the basis of the scientific advice available, the European Commission proposed, last December, that the quota be reduced to 12,960 tonnes.  The Commission, in the light of a very strong and forceful case advanced by me, throughout the night, increased the final quota to 15,120 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of this fishery is that the annual quota could probably be kept up to about 17,000 tonnes on an ongoing basis if fishermen behaved responsibly. The danger, however, is that the quota will fall again in 1991 because of the over exploitation and excessive discarding and therefore killing, of herring that should be left in the sea.</P>
    <P>My aim is to manage this fishery and in that regard to use all the powers at my disposal to allow the stocks and, therefore, the annual catch to improve.  This will require tough decisions and I do not intend to shirk those decisions.  My Department will be reviewing with the representatives of the industry recent developments with a view to improving further the management arrangements in 1991.</P>
    <P>To conclude, the position now is that the fishery is closed and will remain closed until the end of December.  There <Col N="1082" /> is no mechanism for bringing forward as Deputy Taylor-Quinn suggested any part of next year's allocation.  I want to make it quite clear also that the full resources of my Department and the Navy will be used to protect this fishery in the light of what I have said, that the danger of it being over-fished could result in its closure again.  Any fisherman illegally fishing must be prepared to meet the full rigours of the law.</P>

      <P>The Government must recognise that the victims of crime are in many ways neglected under our criminal justice system.  Every one of the 90,000 criminal offences reported annually involves a person who has suffered injury, often serious, sometimes fatal.  In most cases the system does not take into account the trauma and loss suffered by these victims or provide adequate mechanisms for compensation and restitution. It is a very sad reflection on this Government that persons who are injured as a result of a criminal activity have to wait two years for their hospital expenses to be paid by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  These individuals are not covered by the VHI and in many instances have to borrow large sums of money to pay their medical expenses. Because of the present financial crisis, hospitals and health boards have to be paid immediately.  They just cannot afford to wait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make the necessary funds available in the Estimates to ensure that all outstanding claims are paid immediately.  I tell him we cannot have a situation where people <Col N="1083" /> become victims not merely of one injustice as the result of possibly a savage criminal attack but also of an attack of a different kind by their Government.

As the Minister is aware, over many years people welcomed developments in that area and when the President signed the Bill in December 1989 we all envisaged that it would be implemented.  The concern at this stage is that I understand the regulations are still being drafted and the legislation is not being implemented. Meanwhile we have up to 2,000 videos coming into this country each year with no censorship whatsoever.  We all know that around the country in every town and village there has been a proliferation of units selling videos.  My concern is reflected by many parents approaching me who are concerned particularly about teenagers having regard to some of the videos which are for sale.  I ask the Minister to implement speedily this much needed legislation.  Are economies holding it up?  One would have to strengthen the censorship section if the legislation is to be implemented effectively.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Dún Laoghaire is a town the size of Limerick, with a large shopping centre, busy main street and about 15 financial institutions.  It is the focal point for the various forms of transport &mdash; boat, Dart, <Col N="1084" /> buses etc.  For this reason a convenient Garda station is essential.</P>
    <P>The presence of the Garda station in the town centre plays a major part in crime prevention.  Because of the constant movement of personnel towards a central Garda station serious crime such as armed robbery and robberies from persons making deposits at banks is prevented. When the Garda station moves from the town centre, there will definitely be an increase in this sort of crime.</P>
    <P>The gardaí work a shift system.  The new Garda station will be two miles from the town and there will be a break in continuity of policing of the town and due to the change-over of shifts.  This will be taken advantage of by criminals.  Can you imagine a tourist in Dún Laoghaire who has just been robbed of all his belongings seeking directions to the local police station? It would be extremely difficult for anybody to direct them to Kill Avenue. By having the Garda station in the centre of the town, it is possible to deal very effectively with drunk and disorderly persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it Deputy Andrews has not exhausted a portion of my minute?  I wish to express the serious concern of my constituents in the rural communities of Clonaslee, Durrow, Ballyinan and Stradbally at the proposed changes envisaged by the Minister for Justice in rural policing.  The concept as envisaged, of a garda travelling daily up <Col N="1085" /> to 20 miles in a car to open a Garda station for a couple of hours and then travelling back is not in the best interests of the community.  The patrol car will be used as a mere taxi service, notwithstanding the statement of the Minister for Justice on 4 October to the effect that no rural Garda station will close.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to be more specific about the changes envisaged.  I ask him to bear in mind the detriment to the community should Garda stations be reduced to opening for an hour, an hour and a half or two hours per day.  Crime in rural areas is rising and the only way it will be halted is by having the local Garda station properly manned and resourced.  The only way to defeat crime is by having the local gardaí present in the community, in the village, because local knowledge is the essence of the garda's work.  I ask the Minister before making any decision on the matter to consider the views of bodies such as Community Alert, the Garda representative bodies and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the matter raised by Deputy Deenihan, I refer him to my reply to his Parliamentary Question of 27 November 1990 and to my reply on the Adjournment to Deputy Gay Mitchell on 15 November 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the matter raised by Deputy Finucane, the regulations to give effect to the provisions of the Video Recordings Act, 1989 are being drafted at present and will be brought into effect <Col N="1086" /> in stages as soon as possible.  Furthermore, work on the installation of the necessary administrative and technical systems at the Film Censor's office is being carried out at present but it is not possible to say precisely when the regulations will be finalised.  I expect the first stage will be completed early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point raised by Deputy Andrews, as I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 206 and 207 on 24 October 1990, the Garda Divisional Headquarters building in Dún Laoghaire is in very poor condition and in urgent need of repair.</P>
    <P>The site of the existing station could not accommodate the proposed new station. It has been necessary, therefore, to try to find an alternative site.  Ideally, what is required is a suitable and centrally-located site on which a modern Garda Divisional Headquarters building can be erected.  For this reason, considerable efforts were made to obtain part of the site, adjacent to the Town Hall, which is held by the Department of the Marine.  However, despite these efforts, it has not been found possible to obtain the agreement of the authorities concerned, but I assure the Deputy that I view this as the ideal site and I share his concern about moving elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that a new Garda Divisional Headquarters building is needed to serve the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and I am anxious to proceed as quickly as possible with the provision of this new station.  In the absence of a more central site, the question of obtaining a site in Kill Avenue adjacent to the new fire station is being pursued as a matter of urgency, but I want to emphasise that I still believe that the site at the Town Hall is the ideal site and it would be my hope that the views in that area would be changed.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Flanagan's point I want to assure the Deputy that the concerns to which he refers are without foundation.  There are no plans to close any Garda station in County Laois or reduce Garda manning levels there.  I would refer the Deputy to the statement made on my behalf by the Minister of <Col N="1087" /> State at the Department of the Gaeltacht during the Adjournment Debate on 14 November on the question of policing in east Cork.  That statement, which dealt with policing in rural areas generally, repeated and confirmed my commitment to keep rural Garda stations open.  It also reaffirmed my determination that there <Col N="1088" /> should be no reduction in the Garda presence in rural Ireland and that nothing should be done to interfere with the close relationship which has traditionally existed between rural communities and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 December 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 34, 44 and 56 together.  As the CAO is a private company established on their own initiative by the third level institutions involved the Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on administrative details such as the fee charged or the closing date for applications. However, I am confident that the CAO seek at all times to maximise the efficiency of their service to applicants and to do so at minimum cost.</P>
      <P>The refusal rate of first options offered in the first round of offers this year under the CAO system was not unusual as it consistently runs at 20 per cent or so, as it did this year.  The Deputies will appreciate, I am sure, that students like to keep as many options as possible open, the possibility of proceeding to third level being one of them.</P>

      <P>However, the wider question of permanent school accommodation for children who are mildly handicapped including those attending St. Anthony's, must be viewed in the light of the general policy orientation towards the integration of such children into ordinary schools.  I would see the best interests of the children attending St. Anthony's as being served through their integration into ordinary schools in the area.  To the extent that the more seriously handicapped children attending St. Anthony's could not be integrated in this way, I would see their needs as being met through the services of St. Bríd's special school in Castlebar.</P>

      <P>The age profile of teachers in national schools is quite low.  Thirty seven per cent of national teachers are under 35 years of age while only 10 per cent are over 55 years.  There is, I feel, a number of factors that will help to maintain a low age profile.  These include the career break scheme where younger teachers obtain employment as replacements for teachers on career breaks.</P>
      <P>There are 1,400 teachers on career breaks in the current school year.  The fact that replacements appointed for teachers on career breaks are usually recently qualified helps to reduce the overall age profile.</P>
      <P>Another factor is the provision of the national teachers superannuation scheme which allows teachers to retire before reaching 65 years of age.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with the number of girls that sit for the examination in higher level mathematics in the leaving certificate.  I must point out, however, that it is open to any pupil to choose either higher or ordinary level.</P>
      <P>My Department make in-service courses available every year for those teachers who are taking or who wish to take higher level mathematics with their classes.  In 1990, for example, 76 women teachers out of a total of 132 attended such a course in Cork while in 1989, 68 women teachers out of a total of 117 took part in Limerick.  This increase in the number of women teachers attending such courses augurs well for an increase in the number of girls choosing higher level mathematics in the future.</P>
      <P>I am concerned also at the under-representation of girls taking physics to higher level at the leaving certificate.  The under-representation of girls in the physical sciences, particularly physics, is a worldwide phenomenon and the extent of it is remarkably constant throughout the developed world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To help in dealing with this problem my Department have developed a scheme of intervention projects in physics (and chemistry) in girls' schools.  The scheme involves an experienced teacher being selected by the Department and appointed to introduce physics (or chemistry) to a selected school in a particular region.  The brief of this teacher, termed a visiting teacher, is not only to introduce physics or chemistry as a subject in the project school but also, in co-operation with the science teacher in the school, to establish a tradition of the subject within the school and to foster an appreciation <Col N="818" /> of the subject as an integral part of a modern curriculum.</P>
    <P>In this way the pool of physics teachers in girls' schools can be increased thus leading to a consequential increase in the number of girls taking the subject at leaving certificate level.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue with this intervention programme.</P>

      <P>The provisions I have referred to arise from the introduction of greater flexibility into the scheme in recent years for the benefit of students.  I do not accept that an injustice is involved as indicated by the Deputy.  All students from the same leaving certificate cohort are treated in the same way under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation in relation to Rathcormac National School, County Sligo.  I accept that sketch plans had been completed some years ago which provided for an enlarged general purposes room.  However it was not possible for this project to proceed because the policy adopted in relation to the Primary Schools Building Programme required that the available resources be concentrated on the provision of essential classroom accommodation.</P>

      <P>Members of the Second Line Reserve when undergoing annual training or on security duty receive the same rates of pay and allowances (other than military service allowance) as Permanent Defence Force personnel in equivalent ranks.  While the rates of gratuities for members of the Second Line Reserve were last increased with effect from 1 January 1981, the increased rates of pay and allowances awarded to members of the Permanent Defence Force as a result of the recommendations made in the Gleeson report extend to members of the Second Line Reserve as will the benefits of any further increases in those rates which may arise.  The increase in the consumer price index since January 1981 is 71 per cent.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the reduction of the period of annual training for members of the Second Line Reserve which was necessary in recent years, arrangements were made for payment of the full amount of gratuity.  These arrangements will continue to apply during 1991 at the existing rates of gratuity.</P>

The taxpayer mentioned comes into the category.  The trade union which represents clerical assistants in the office of the Chief Inspector of Taxes has refused, as a matter of policy, to allow its members to do work allocations of non-replaced officers.  Consequently, a full review of the taxpayer's liability has not been carried out in this case to date.</P>

I understand that no officer in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas was promoted while on extension of service beyond the normal retiring age, during the period specified in the question.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the criterion (a) for the granting of an extension of service after the age of 65 years and (b) after 70 years of age; and whether the same criterion is used in all Departments and in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</Quest>

      <P>Officers may be retained beyond the age of 65 (a) on grounds of hardship; to qualify on grounds of hardship an officer's income on retirement must fall below a certain threshold &mdash; the same threshold applies in all cases; (b) on grounds of public interest; (c) for the purposes of increasing pension, lump sum or gratuity (for a maximum of three months only and subject to prescribed conditions).</P>
      <P>The criteria applied in the granting of extensions of service beyond the age of 70 are similar to those applied in granting extensions beyond the age of 65.  The retention of an officer beyond the age of 70 is subject to particular review by the parent Department having regard to health and efficiency and requires special certification by the personnel officer. Since 1987 all extensions of service require the sanction of my Department and the same criteria are used in assessing all applications.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the <Col N="845" /> Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 19 October 1990 and submitted a claim to the inspector of taxes on 16 November 1990 for repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment. The inspector replied on 23 November stating that there was no refund due at present but to reapply on 1 February 1991, if still unemployed, at which time a refund would be due.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer commenced employment in November 1989 but the inspector of taxes was not advised of the position until the taxpayer completed a return of income on 22 April 1990.  Also, his employer had erroneously granted him tax-free allowances against his earnings without any authorising certificate.  A certificate of tax-free allowances for the current year, 1990-91, was issued to the taxpayer on 16 May 1990.  As the allowances granted were less than those that had been operated by the employer, tax was underdeducted from 6 April 1990. The underpayment was not collected as the certificate which issued on 16 May 1990 applied the allowances from that date only.  A refund will not, therefore, arise until 1 February 1991.</P>

      <P>Pending completion of cost benefit analyses and environment impact assessments of drainage schemes for the Owenmore and Arrow catchment, County Sligo, which are at an advanced stage, and the Mulcair catchment, County Limerick which have recently been put in train, it is not possible to indicate the extent of works to be included, or, consequently, the cost of such schemes.  Nor is it possible to give any commitments in relation to likely commencement dates.</P>
      <P>There are no EC funds available for arterial drainage at present.  However, if and when the Owenmore/Arrow and Mulcair schemes reach works stage they will be considered for any EC funding available at that time.</P>

At the current rate of progress, it is expected that works on the Boyle/Bonet and Blackwater (Monaghan) catchment drainage schemes will be completed in 1993.

      <P>The drainage of the Shambles river was considered by the Commissioners of Public Works for inclusion <Col N="848" /> in the Blackwater (Monaghan) catchment drainage scheme, but was rejected at planning stage on economic grounds. Following receipt of representations from Monaghan County Council the commissioners re-examined the matter to see if circumstances would warrant the execution of some or all of the works required.  However, as the problem is, primarily, one of urban flooding, the commissioners submitted a proposal to the council in May, 1990 whereby they, the commissioners, would undertake the work on an agency basis on behalf of the council.  A formal response is awaited.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for IDA aid under the Government's rationalisation and modernisation programme for the pigmeat industry, processors must formally undertake to concentrate on the production of export-oriented products. The levels of exports sales to be achieved are specified but these can vary from case to case, depending on such factors as the levels of exports already achieved.  The failure to meet the agreed conditions can result in a company being required to refund all or part of aid granted.  The monitoring of the performance of grant recipients and decisions to vary the grant are matters for the IDA.  I am satisfied that the IDA are carrying out their responsibility in this regard.</P>

      <P>An Bord Glas was set up on an interim basis in April 1987 with the general remit of developing horticulture. The progress made by the interim board is referrred to in the speeches made to the Dáil and Seanad during the second stages of the Bord Glas Bill, 1989.  I would refer the Deputy to volume 392, No. 5, columns 1327-1341 of the Official Dáil Report of 2 November 1989 and to Volume 123, No. 15, columns 1693-1705 of the Official Seanad Report of 7 February 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of the statutory Bord Glas, set up under the Bord Glas Act, 1990, was appointed with effect from 20 July 1990.  The statutory Bord Glas will continue the work of the interim board and in particular the implementation of the plans outlined in the documents entitled <i>A Programme for the Development of Horticulture</i> and <i>A Programme for the Development of the Seed Potato Industry.</i> These programmes envisage a combined market recovery and export expansion of some £60 million and the creation of <Col N="857" /> 1,800 full-time and 1,500 part-time jobs by the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>(a)  Jobs Created: in 1988 it is estimated that 350 full-time jobs were created in horticulture; in 1989 some 300 full-time and 400 part-time jobs were created.  Preliminary estimates suggest that up to 150 full-time jobs and 200 part-time jobs will be created in 1990.</P>
    <P>(b) and (c) Percentage increase in home requirements of vegetables produced here, in exports and in production: detailed estimates of horticultural output for 1990 will not be available until early next year.  However, the indications are that the trend in recent years of an increase in self-sufficiency is likely to have continued.  In the period January-August 1990 exports of vegetables increased by 24 per cent compared with the same period of 1989, from £25.4 million to £31.4 million and imports declined by 30 per cent from £0.106 million to £0.075 million.</P>
    <P>(d) Number of producers who have joined producer groups: the Department of Agriculture and Food retain legal responsibility for the official recognition of producer groups.  A number of groups have been in discussion with the Department on this matter.  However, as there are detailed organisational and legal requirements to be met in order to conform to EC Regulations, it could take up to a year from the time of application to the date of formal recognition.</P>
    <P>(e) Grading standards: the Minister for Agriculture and Food has legal responsibility for the enforcement of grading and quality standards for horticultural produce.  There has been a steady improvement in standards in recent years and An Bord Glas and the Department of Agriculture and Food will continue their efforts to ensure further improvement. </P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware of my urgent programme to complete social security agreements with countries which are outside the EC.  Our emigrants will benefit directly where these agreements <Col N="862" /> are completed.  I have already completed an agreement with Austria and last Thursday I signed a further agreement with Canada.  This agreement with Canada will benefit thousands of Irish people who emigrate to Canada to work and who also have spent time working at home.  Many of these people come back to Ireland to retire.</P>
    <P>With regard to the United States, considerable progress has already been made between officials of my Department and officials of the US Department of Health and Human Services on a bilateral agreement on social security between Ireland and the US.  Further negotiations are taking place this week in Washington involving the officials who accompanied me to Canada for the signing of the agreement between Ireland and Canada.  I would hope to have the US agreement in place towards the latter half of 1991.</P>
    <P>The agreement will cover the Irish social welfare schemes of contributory old age pension, retirement pensions, contributory widows and orphans pension, invalidity pension and death grant and on the US side the federal programmes of old age, survivors and disability insurance.  The main purpose of the agreement will be to allow periods of employment in one country to be counted towards satisfying the conditions for pension entitlement in the other country. In addition, on the Irish side, when the agreement becomes operational recipients of US social security pensions who are resident in Ireland will become eligible on a par with Irish pensioners for free travel, free electricity, free TV licence, free telephone rental and free fuel.  This is as a result of the initiative which I introduced as part of the social welfare improvements announced in this year's budget.</P>

      <P>In general, I am satisfied that all pensioners qualified for a weekly fuel allowance receive their due entitlement automatically and in good time.  Pensioners who qualified for fuel allowance in the last winter season have received an allowance automatically as part of their normal weekly payment at the start of this season, unless their circumstances have changed in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entitlement of new claimants to fuel allowance is generally decided and paid quickly.  I have taken various measures to streamline the processes in recent years.  These measures include incorporating the fuel supplement into the pension book which means that one transaction only is required to obtain the full set of entitlements.  A small number of persons who were accustomed to <Col N="865" /> receiving a separate fuel payment in previous years queried their position last year and this year.  However, the incidence of inquiries is dropping and the overall position is that clients in general find the new arrangements much easier to manage.</P>
    <P>To qualify for a weekly fuel allowance pensioners must satisfy the following conditions: (A) be in receipt of one of the following payments: Old Age Pension (Contributory or Non Contributory), Retirement Pension, Widow's Contributory or non-contributory Pension, Deserted Wife's Benefit or Allowance, Lone Parent's Allowance, Prisoners' Wives' Allowance, Blind Pension, Invalidity Pension, Single Women's Allowance, Long-term Unemployment Assistance (including smallholders), Pre-Retirement Allowance, Disabled Person's Maintenance Allowance, Infectious Diseases Maintenance Allowance, Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance, Special Department of Defence Allowance, Equivalent social security Pensions from other EC Member States, Austria and Canada.  (B) be living alone or only with certain specified dependants, and (C) be unable to provide for his/her own heating needs, either by having other assessed means in excess of £5 a week or by having access to his or her own fuel supply or certain other subsidised heating provided by Local Authorities.</P>
    <P>The fuel allowance scheme and its administration are kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>More than 154,000 pensioners (that is 36 per cent) benefit from this important scheme each year.  In addition, some 50,000 persons on unemployment assistance receive the allowance and health boards make payments to another 7,100 persons.</P>
    <P>The scheme will cost £35 million for the 1990-91 season (including £7.1 million to meet the cost of smog fuel allowance). It complements the free electricity and gas schemes which are available throughout the year at a cost of £22 million and the various local authority schemes for subsidised heating in local authority houses.</P>

Persons intending to avail of the scheme should consult with their employment office at the early stages of making their plans.</P>
      <P>In addition to the scheme for full-time second level education opportunities for the unemployed, I have introduced three other schemes as follows: the vocational training opportunity scheme which enables certain unemployed persons to follow a full-time education and training course and receive an allowance equivalent to their weekly rate of unemployment assistance; and the vocational preparation and training programme which enables certain unemployed persons to attend full-time education courses in the VECs in the Dublin area while continuing to receive a special allowance equivalent to their unemployment assistance payment.</P>
      <P>Provision can also be made in appropriate cases for persons engaging in part-time education.  The circumstances vary considerably from case to case.  I have ensured however that each case is dealt with sympathetically.</P>

Local authorities were also given responsibility in the Act for ordering the sale, disposal or destruction of impounded animals where the owner is not known and also where the owner fails to pay the pound fees.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 185 together.  I presume the Deputy is referring to damage caused to public roads.</P>
      <P>Grants are provided by my Department to meet the full cost of improvement and maintenance works on national roads, including works arising from storm damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of non-national roads, the cost of improvement and maintenance works normally falls to be financed from <Col N="875" /> the local authorities' own resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided annually by my Department. Local authorities are expected, within that funding, to undertake any remedial works arising from normal weather conditions, including winter weather conditions.</P>
    <P>The question of providing special funding arises only where abnormally severe weather conditions occur.  In such exceptional circumstances, and within the limitations of the funding available, grants are determined in the light of reports prepared by the local authorities involved and assessments by my Department.</P>
    <P>Four million pounds was allocated in grants earlier this year towards the cost of remedial works to public roads arising from the severe storms/flooding last February. The reply to Question No. 73 of 23 May 1990 gave details of these allocations.</P>

      <P>The power to apply traffic measures to control the use of vehicles in Dublin city is vested, in the first instance, in Dublin Corporation acting with the consent of or at the request of the Garda Síochána.  In applying such measures, the corporation must operate within the provisions of the Dublin Area Traffic and Parking By-Laws 1986 (S.I. 182 of 1986) made by the Garda Commissioner with my consent.  These by-laws contain a number of parking controls which range from all day parking bans to time restricted facilities.</P>
      <P>The Garda who are responsible for enforcing the parking regulations are greatly intensifying their efforts in this regard.  The Garda tow-away service has been completely re-equipped and strengthened and is now making a significant impact on illegal parking which is disruptive to traffic flows in the city. Almost 6,000 vehicles have been towed away by the Gardaí so far this year.  This amounts to a fivefold increase on the 1988 figure and almost treble last year's figure. Moreover, the traffic warden service has been expanded by the appointment of 50 additional traffic wardens to enforce the parking laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May last, I announced phase I of a transportation study for the greater Dublin area.  Recently, I appointed consultants to carry out phase I, which involves an evaluation of the recommendations of previous studies, an assessment of traffic forecasting processes and the identification of data <Col N="881" /> requirements.  Over 130 submissions received relating to phase I are being considered by the consultants and a steering committee.  Phase 2 will develop a strategy for transportation in Dublin, which will carry us well into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I have already referred publicly to the need to consider strategies which optimise the use of existing road space and to the related question of whether we are prepared to constrain car use to a greater extent so as to facilitate public transport.  I have also referred to the question of rationing road space to ensure that it is used for movement rather than parking.  The question of having a more widespread ban on roadside parking on key city routes is, therefore, being considered, in advance of the completion of the transportation study, in consultation with the other public authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>I am aware of an opinion recently expressed in the medical press that attributes the shortage of Irish trained doctors in Ireland to inadequate post-graduate training and research facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish doctors have always had a <Col N="886" /> tradition of going abroad for further training and experience to further their careers.  The available evidence suggests that there are many other reasons why Irish doctors choose to go abroad.  It is not clear that a perceived lack of training and research facilities is a major cause of emigration.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of young Irish doctors going abroad at an early stage in their careers which, in turn, has increased our reliance on non-national doctors to fill non-consultant posts &mdash; particularly in the smaller hospitals.  I recently consulted with a number of statutory bodies in the matter.</P>

      <P>I am aware that certain problems have arisen with regard to the provision of an elective orthopaedic service in the Waterford area.  This year I have approved an additional £517,000 for the provision of elective orthopaedic services in the south-east and I agreed a number of measures with the South Eastern Health Board which have enabled the output of hip replacement operations to be greatly increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increase is quite substantial in that output has increased from 71 in 1989 to <Col N="893" /> 127 up to 31 October 1990 &mdash; an increase of 78 per cent.</P>
    <P>Arrangements regarding an individual patient's position on a waiting list and when his/her operation will be performed are entirely a matter for the clinician concerned and the Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter in which I have any involvement.  However, I have been informed by the South Eastern Health Board that this patient was admitted to Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital for a hip replacement operation in September 1988 but declined to have the procedure performed.  I understand that this patient subsequently changed his mind and I am informed by the board that he remains on the waiting list.  I would suggest to the Deputy that if the condition of the person referred to in the question has deteriorated, his general practitioner should contact his consultant in order to stress the urgency of the case.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health, on the basis of reports from the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, monitor the prevalence of HIV on a national rather than a regional basis.  This monitoring shows that a total of 1,005 persons have tested positive for the virus since HIV monitoring began in 1985.  Similarly, deaths from AIDS are monitored by the Department through direct reports from the consultant in charge of the case, to the national AIDS co-ordinator.  The majority of patients with full blown AIDS reported so far have occurred in the Eastern Health Board area.  There have also been cases in the South-Eastern, Southern, Western and <Col N="894" /> North-Western Health Boards areas.  No person with AIDS has been recorded to date in the North-Eastern Health Board area.</P>

      <P>In view of the demographic trends and projected enrolments, the provision of additional second level permanent accommodation is not generally warranted in Limerick city.  In the particular circumstances of this school, in June 1990, I received a deputation from the school authorities and agreed to allocate a specified sum as grant aid for a modified scheme to assist the school in replacing substandard accommodation to cater for its immediate needs.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, my Department wrote to the school authorities on 10 July 1990 confirming my approval of the specified grant aid.  It was emphasised that, in order to avail of the grant, the work should be completed in the current financial year, i.e. 1990.  The school management were also asked to submit architect's plans and costings for the modified development to the Department.</P>
      <P>To date, the costed proposals have not been submitted to my Department.</P>

    <P>The position with regard to library staffing in the colleges in general is under consideration at present.

Trainees are entitled to tuition fee remission and a monthly maintenance allowance currently valued at £547 or £1,373 per annum depending on whether or not they must reside away from home in a college town.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing the ESF scheme stipulate that the lower rate of grant is applicable in the case of trainees, (a) whose home is within 15 miles of the college attended, (b) who travel, or could reasonably be expected to travel, daily between their home and the college.  The regulations further stipulate that the higher rate may be paid only to those not covered by (a) and (b) above who are obliged to stay overnight in a college town for the purpose of attending a training course.</P>

      <P>11,434 trainees participated in Vocational Preparation and Training VPT-2 courses in 1989-90.  VPT-2 is aimed at trainees who have either completed a senior cycle programme or a VPT-1 course but who need further training to enhance their prospects of securing lasting employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation by schools in the programme is subject to approval annually by my Department, and programme delivery is monitored on an on-going basis.  At present each trainee who successfully completes the programme is awarded a certificate by my Department which is supplemented by locally based <Col N="917" /> assessment certification.  However, there is a need for a national, performance based certification system.</P>
    <P>A working group will report to me shortly on the general question of assessment and certification of second level vocational training programmes with a view to the establishment of such a national system.</P>
