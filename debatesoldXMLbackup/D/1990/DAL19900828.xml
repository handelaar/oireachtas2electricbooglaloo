      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  It is also proposed that Nos. 1 and 2 shall be taken without debate.  I also wish to add for the information of the House that I am writing to you, a Cheann Comhairle, to request a special meeting of the Dáil tomorrow for the purpose of discussing the Middle East situation.</P>

      <P>In relation to the serious situation facing this House, indeed facing industries outside this House, it might be more appropriate at this stage to leave the debate for today open-ended.  The Taoiseach might consider at some stage, because there will be many amendments down to the Bill before the House, providing for a meeting of the Whips to see if we can conclude the business as suggested at 10 o'clock or, if necessary, if we could have an open-ended debate and some hours could be added on to today's debate.  In relation to today's Order of Business, the Dáil is convened under Article 24 of the Constitution, could I ask the Taoiseach if all the <Col N="2050" /> appropriate notices have been issued? Perhaps the procedures have been complied with.  Does he consider it necessary that the President should in fact have consulted the Council of State or should do so before tomorrow's meeting of the Seanad if they are to consider the abridged legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I met all the party leaders yesterday and the Order of Business for today was unanimously agreed between us.  I accepted suggestions from the Leaders of the Opposition parties as to the Order of Business for today.  I believe we should adhere to that agreement. Secondly I am advised that all the necessary procedures with regard to the sittings of the Dáil and Seanad today and tomorrow have been adhered to.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach said, what has been announced was agreed by us yesterday and I have no problem with that, except in so far as I understand the agreement to have a sitting tomorrow would be included in the Order for today.  Am I to take it from what the Taoiseach said to the Ceann Comhairle that he will be issuing a request to him to convene again tomorrow, in the same way as a request has been issued under, I think, Standing Order 19?  Could I ask, therefore, if any other business can be carried on today? Are we confined exclusively to the business referred to in the Order reconvening the Dáil?  There are other matters which I am sure Deputies will want to raise.  In my own area the Gateaux factory is one which requires urgent attention.  Will it be possible to raise matters such as that on the Adjournment today or indeed by Private Notice Question?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as it applies within my area of responsibility, the party leaders also agreed yesterday that the Dáil would sit tomorrow from 10.30 a.m. to 4 o'clock to discuss the Middle East crisis.  I propose to follow through on that agreement.  We will also discuss whether it will be possible to have an agreed <Col N="2051" /> motion to put before the Dáil.  I suggest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should meet with his counterparts in Fine Gael, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party to see if we can have an agreed motion before the Dáil tomorrow. I propose to ask the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to call the Dáil tomorrow in accordance with what we agreed yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the order in which you called speakers, might I remark that I have not heard dissent from what was agreed yesterday?  I have heard a number of observations that seemed to me to be something other than dissent.  I also remark that I am glad that the House is sitting today and intends to sit tomorrow. It has always been my view that this House should resume its business much earlier than the Government proposed last month and that we should in fact not be meeting today and tomorrow in a special session, we should be meeting in the normal course of our business.  Could I ask the Taoiseach on the Order of Business if he intends, like me, to meet today with representatives of relatives of people who are now unlawfully prevented from leaving Iraq?  Will he be in a position to give them any assurance either that further more detailed information will be made available to them as to the situation of their sons and daughters in Iraq or if he will be in a position to give them any statement or assurance about the kind of action the Government here will take to secure freedom of exit for those people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that the Government, myself, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Department of Foreign Affairs and our diplomatic service have been making every possible effort, on the one hand to keep in contact with our citizens in Kuwait and Iraq and on the other hand to provide the maximum possible amount of information for relatives here.  A meeting was held in the Department of Foreign Affairs yesterday.  Arising out of that <Col N="2052" /> meeting it has been arranged that I will receive a delegation from the relatives of our citizens in Kuwait and Iraq as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, our economic fortunes are never totally within our own control.  One does not have to be directly engaged in international trade to appreciate how events occurring in other parts of the world can greatly affect this country. <Col N="2056" /> I Indeed, even the holder of the most modest mortgage will be aware of the impact that world events can have on interest rates, and the susceptibility of exchange rates to such happenings will be familiar to anyone who travels abroad. The present events in the Middle East have sharply reminded us, if that were necessary, that despite good economic management &mdash; and the Government's record is second to none on that score &mdash; it is simply not possible to control all the forces that affect commercial life.</P>
    <P>What the State can do, however, is to try to improve the environment that assists and encourages companies to cope with difficulties which arise, whether as a result of international developments or otherwise.  It was with this in mind that measures very close to those I am introducing today were included as part of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  I should remind the House, in this connection, that the thrust and underlying rationale for the provisions concerned has already been endorsed on the floor of the House when it passed the Second Reading and by a Special Committee of the House before the summer recess in the form of Part IX of that Bill.</P>
    <P>The decision to accelerate the passage of these particular provisions is a recognition that significant extra difficulties may be faced by Irish companies as a result of the present unrest in the Middle East, and that to wait for the passage of the main Companies Bill later this year might deprive some companies of the benefits of having this particular type of mechanism in place.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, the provisions involved provide what I believe will be a valuable new mechanism for the rescue and return to health of ailing, but potentially viable companies.  To use a medical analogy, these provisions are intended to be of use to companies that are temporarily&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>To use a medical analogy, these provisions are intended to be of use to companies that are temporarily &ldquo;sick&rdquo;&mdash; I would not normally expect to see them being used by healthy companies or indeed in the final analysis by companies that are terminally ill.</P>
      <P>The central feature of what is being proposed is the appointment to a company by the High Court of an expert, called an examiner in the Bill, and the placing of the company concerned under the protection of the court for a limited period.</P>
      <P>Essentially, in order to qualify for protection, the company concerned must, under section 2 of the Bill, be unable to pay their debts, or be likely to be unable to pay their debts.  At the same time, that section gives guidance to the court as to whether the company should get protection, in other words, it may take a view as to whether the company have a chance of survival as a going concern.</P>
      <P>The petition for the appointment of an examiner can, under the Bill, be sought by creditors or shareholders of the company, by the company or by their directors. In the case of shareholders, section 3 provides a standard cut-off point whereby they must hold at least 10 per cent of the share capital in order to apply to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the normal run of creditors can also apply to the court, a special safeguard is inserted in the case of contingent and prospective creditors.  In order to discourage precipitous or vexatious <Col N="2058" /> requests from such categories of creditor, section 3 (5) requires that they give security for costs to the court at the time of the application.</P>
    <P>From the date the court becomes involved, the debts of the company will effectively be frozen since, under section 5, no enforcement action can then be taken by creditors.  Neither can proceedings for a winding-up of the company be commenced nor a receiver appointed. The purpose of this stay is to preserve the <i>status quo</i>, to enable the company to be stabilised and to enable the process of rehabilitation to be put in place.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise, however, that the temporary suspension of these normal remedies or procedures is only being allowed within the specific parameters set out in the Bill, under the supervision of the High Court and with the aim of achieving the restoration to health of companies in financial difficulty.  Granting this breathing space is designed to allow the company's difficulties to be resolved in an orderly way and in a less threatened environment.  The aim would be to achieve a result that is much more desirable than the result of any rash action to close the company.</P>
    <P>Many companies, of course, operate within a group of companies and, accordingly, section 4 provides for the making of orders in relation to related companies.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention at this stage that, in the normal run of cases, the examiner might be expected to be just that &mdash; an examiner, analyst, diagnostician or whatever.  However, it must be accepted that there will be many cases where the examiner will have to take action himself, in terms of asset disposal, trading policies and so on which the existing management is either unwilling or incapable of doing.</P>
    <P>For example, there may be an asset which is a drain on the company's resources but which in the normal course of events could not be sold because it is subject to a charge.  Subject to provisions recognising the interest of the security holder, section 11 will allow the court to authorise the disposal of such an asset by the examiner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> Similarly, the assets might need to be protected if there was a danger that action might be taken in relation to those assets by the directors or management which might prejudice the interests of the company or their creditors.  In such circumstances, section 9 will allow the court to order that all or any of the powers of the directors can only be exercised by the examiner.</P>
    <P>While the main role of the examiner is, of course, not to run the company, the court may nevertheless feel that giving the examiner control of certain functions would be in the best interests of the company or their creditors.</P>
    <P>Once the examiner is in place, he will carry out an initial assessment of the company's affairs and, if he considers from this initial assessment that the company, or part of it, can be saved, he will proceed to draw up a rescue plan.</P>
    <P>The examiner will, of course, have a vital need for a full flow of management information, and sections 8 and 9 will give him some important powers in this respect.  As well as requiring anyone with relevant information to give it to the examiner, it is essential, particularly within the tight timescale under which the examiner has to operate, that there are no delays in obtaining information.</P>
    <P>As a start, he must be given details of the company's assets and liabilities, and information relating to creditors, within seven days of his appointment.  In addition he will be able to attend all meetings of the directors, as well as general meetings of the company.</P>
    <P>In cases where a provisional liquidator or a receiver have already been appointed to a company it is important that the court can ensure, in subsequently appointing an examiner that the actions of either the receiver or the provisional liquidator do not frustrate the rescue process, so I am therefore proposing to allow the court to make certain types of orders in relation to both.</P>
    <P>Having conducted his initial assessment of the company the examiner will report back to the court within three weeks of his appointment, and section 16 <Col N="2060" /> sets out what that report must contain. While obviously containing financial information, it must also give the examiner's view as to whether the company and the whole or part of their undertaking, would be capable of survival as a going concern, what conditions are essential to ensure such survival, and whether &ldquo;compromise proposals&rdquo; might be more advantageous to shareholders and creditors than the winding-up of the company.</P>
    <P>The examiner must also give his own recommendations as to what course should be taken including, if warranted, actual draft compromise proposals.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the examiner's initial assessment is that the company would not be capable of survival, then the court must hold a hearing, at which all affected shareholders are entitled to be heard.  Following the hearing the court may make an order as to what should happen the company, for example whether it should remain in the protection of the court, should it be wound up, or whether some other course of action would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>Assuming, however, that the examiner's initial response is favourable, he would, as I mentioned earlier, proceed to the next phase without a court hearing. This would obviously involve rounds of discussions with classes of creditors and shareholders, meetings of various kinds and so on, in an effort to work out an acceptable rescue package or, in the terms of the Bill, compromise proposals.</P>
    <P>These proposals must contain certain specific information and must meet certain criteria.  They must, for example, provide equal treatment for each claim or interest of a particular class of creditors or shareholders.  They must also show how the different classes would be affected, and provide for mechanisms as to how the overall plan is to be implemented.  One particularly useful piece of information to be included is an effective comparison between the effect of the proposals as against the probable financial outcome of a winding up for the various parties involved.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us could underestimate the difficulty of doing this, and <Col N="2061" /> it will really take a major effort, even in the smallest of companies, to make the whole thing work.  However, assuming there is sufficient agreement to his proposals the examiner can then seek to have them confirmed by the court.  For its part, the court must be satisfied that the proposals meet certain tests &mdash; for example that they are fair and equitable to any class of members or creditors that has not accepted them and whose claims or interests would be impaired.</P>
    <P>If the court confirms the plan, it will be binding on everyone concerned, the examiner's appointment will be at an end, and the company will cease to be under the protection of the court.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the value of consultation with the creditors of the company and allows the court to direct that a committee of creditors be appointed to assist the examiner.  I would like here to point out that the need to keep all interested parties informed is catered for throughout the Bill.  For example, notification of the presentation of a petition in the first place must be delivered to the registrar of companies straightaway; when the examiner is appointed notifications must be published; the examiner must give the committee of creditors, if there is one, a copy of the proposals, and there are provisions for consultations with members and creditors on the proposals.</P>
    <P>The system will operate within a fairly tight timescale.  I strongly believe that this is the only way of ensuring that the mechanism can be successful and used to the full.  In fact, one of the main criticisms of similar systems operating elsewhere, for example the &ldquo;Chapter 11&rdquo; system in the United States, is that they can be too long-drawn-out and, therefore, obviously too costly.</P>
    <P>It is important that all those affected by the use of the provisions of this Bill should be reassured by the certainty that the system being introduced is to operate within a tightly-defined timescale.  Thus, the court protection period is restricted to three months, with an additional 30 days if needed to facilitate the examiner in the preparation of his final report. <Col N="2062" /> There are also tight time limits within which the examiner must furnish his reports &mdash; the one giving his initial assessment within three weeks of his appointment, and the second one containing his actual proposals within a further three weeks.  Again, I know these limits are very tight, but there are so many interests to be balanced in this whole process that, quite literally, time is of the essence.</P>
    <P>While it is not the practice to discuss in this House the financial affairs of individual companies, I think it would be unrealistic of me in the present circumstances not to refer to the affairs of Goodman International, about whose position there has been substantial speculation and comment.  I have been authorised by IBI Corporate Finance Limited, on behalf of Goodman International and Goodman Holdings, to disclose the following information in relation to Goodman International and other relevant companies.  This information, which was provided to me by IBI Corporate Finance Limited from whose letter to me, dated 27 August, I am quoting, is as follows:</P>
    <P>As at 17th August, 1990, Goodman International and its subsidiaries (other than Food Industries plc) owed banks approximately IR£460 million which had been available on an unsecured short term basis.  In addition, banks had guaranteed obligations in respect of the performance of Goodman International and its subsidiaries (other than Food Industries plc) under beef supply contracts in an amount of approximately IR£200 million.</P>
    <P>Goodman International and its subsidiaries (other than Food Industries plc) are owed IR£180 million by Iraqi entities, this figure includes £11 million of interest due.</P>
    <P>Goodman International and its subsidiaries (other than Food Industries plc) are owed IR£203 million by other companies owned by Goodman Holdings of which it is estimated that not more than IR£90 million will be recovered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2063" /> Shareholders' funds of Goodman International as shown by the consolidated accounts to 31st December, 1989 were IR£191 million and the net worth of Goodman Holdings as at that date was IR£273 million.  These did not take into account any major provisions in relation to the Iraqi debt or amounts owing by other subsidiaries of Goodman Holdings which now stand at the amount stated above.</P>
    <P>The trading operations of Goodman International continue to be substantially profitable before interest which mainly arises from the failure to receive payment for beef shipments to Iraq and the inability of other subsidiaries of Goodman Holdings to repay the debt outstanding.</P>
    <P>Food Industries plc is a separate listed company with its own independent board of directors and management. It continues to trade profitably and arranges its own finance independently.  It has virtually no trading links with Goodman International. There is no inter-dependence of borrowings between Food Industries plc and other subsidiaries of Goodman Holdings and/or Goodman International. The links between Food Industries plc and Goodman International are the ownership of 68 per cent and some common directors.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this information was provided to me by IBI Corporate Finance Limited.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to comment on the beef industry, its achievements and present problems.  The pre-eminent position of the cattle and beef industry in the Irish economy is best illustrated by the fact that it contributes some 10 per cent to gross domestic product.  Output of cattle and calves for 1989 was valued at £1,211 million or 36 per cent of gross agricultural output, while cattle and beef exports amounted to £760 million and represented 32 per cent of total agricultural exports and 5.2 per cent of total exports.  If export refunds are included, export earnings from the beef sector <Col N="2064" /> increase to £1,010 million and their contribution to agricultural exports and total exports increases to 43 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.</P>
    <P>Output in the cattle and beef sector is of crucial importance to the beef industry. The output of cattle and calves depends primarily on the size of the national breeding herd.  Over the ten years 1976 to 1986, total cow numbers remained unchanged at around two million head but in 1987 and 1988 the numbers dropped by 3 per cent largely as a consequence of the earlier imposition of the milk quota régime.  Numbers have now increased again.  This increase is accounted for almost exclusively by an increase in the beef breeding herd.  This is a welcome sign that there will be an improvement in the quality of our beef cattle with the move to more specialist beef breeds.</P>
    <P>The beef sector has achieved very significant progress over the past 20 years in terms of moving away from live exports and increasing value added exports.  This situation is evident from the fact that our live cattle exports represented 46 per cent of the total destined for export in 1969 and less than 11 per cent by 1989.  Indeed, the level of live exports to destinations outside of the island of Ireland in 1989 was down to less than 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Over the same 20 year period the industry progressed from producing cattle for export and subsequent slaughter in other countries to one which now exports 75 per cent of our cattle output as beef to destinations throughout the world.  It has progressed from then exporting 87 per cent of our beef in the bone-in state and only 13 per cent boneless to now exporting 58 per cent boneless and 42 per cent bone-in.</P>
    <P>It must also be acknowledged that an increasingly significant, if yet small, proportion of this takes the form of high quality chilled boneless cuts.  A major beneficial consequence of this progress to the Irish economy is that some 5,000 people are now employed directly in the meat processing industry.  In addition there are some 100,000 farmers involved in the production of cattle, the raw <Col N="2065" /> material of the industry.  The industry is also of major benefit to the services sector particularly in the area of transport.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that our membership of the EC and the access to the various support schemes have contributed more to the increased production of the beef industry over the last 20 years than has our access to the large EC market of consumers.  We have manifestly failed to penetrate this sophisticated and increasingly valuable continental EC market to any significant degree, a market where we sell only 40 per cent of steer production. As a consequence we have relied on volatile Middle Eastern markets as outlets for much of our beef exports.</P>
    <P>Approximately 1.5 million head of cattle are slaughtered in Ireland each year.  Disposal of the beef from these slaughterings, in cattle equivalent is approximately as follows: 200,000 head &mdash; mainly heifers &mdash; for the home market; 500,000 head &mdash; mainly steers &mdash; for export to third countries; 360,000 head &mdash; steers, cows and heifers &mdash; to the United Kingdom; 210,000 head &mdash; steers &mdash; for intervention and 150,000 head &mdash; steers, cows and heifers &mdash; for the European mainland.  In addition, some 150,000 cattle are exported live to North African countries and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>As our cattle production is grass-based a high proportion of slaughterings and thus of purchases of slaughter cattle from farmers, takes place from September on. In 1989, the final quarter accounted for 47 per cent of cattle slaughterings.  For the second six months of 1990 about 950,000 head of cattle will be ready to offer to our factories for slaughter, some 800,000 head in the September-December period.  Most of the beef produced &mdash; about 265,000 tonnes in bone-in terms &mdash; will have to be exported to the United Kingdom, the East or our minor third country markets in the Caribbean, Mexico, Yugoslavia, Japan and West Africa.</P>
    <P>Serious problems have arisen recently in our principal markets abroad.  For example, we stand to lose a major outlet for our beef due to the embargo on trade with Iraq.  This embargo prevents all <Col N="2066" /> exports of beef to a destination which took 51,000 tonnes of Irish beef in 1989 and which could reasonably have been expected, in the absence of the embargo, to take between 30,000 and 40,000 tonnes in the remainder of this year, an export quantity which we now stand to lose; there is a widespread threat to our third country exports in general due to the BSE scare.  Iran and Egypt are of most serious concern.  Iran, which is the most important of the third countries with which we have BSE problems, took 61,000 tonnes of Irish beef in 1989; the demand for beef in the UK and the Continent is down by at least 10 per cent and there is little prospect of a significant improvement in the short term; and the outlets for our live cattle have also been affected, particularly in Libya, by concern about BSE. Our competitors are in a position to provide sizeable alternative beef supplies to our third country customers.</P>
    <P>Overall, if the present situation continues unchanged, the prospect is that over the September-December period the only realistic outlet for quite a proportion of our beef will be the intervention system.  Under existing arrangements for intervention the safety-net mechanism which gives guaranteed access to intervention for certain categories of steers is operating and we anticipate that this will continue for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>However, this will not take all of the steers, and heifers and cows do not qualify for intervention under existing EC rules.  While this safety-net is of real assistance to our industry it is an expensive system for the Community.  There may be some difficulties when the system comes up for review again at the end of 1990.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the provisions of the Bill we are addressing today, I said earlier that the substance of the measures proposed had already been welcomed by a special committee of this House.  In fact, it was dealt with in some considerable detail by that committee.  I would like to take this opportunity to record my gratitude and admiration to the Chairman and members of the committee for <Col N="2067" /> the constructive and efficient manner in which they conducted their business.</P>
    <P>The possibility of difficulties arising for companies generally because of the Middle East crisis has accentuated the desirability of having these provisions put in place as soon as possible.  As legislators, we are sometimes criticised for the length of time it takes to introduce new laws.  In recalling both Houses of the Oireachtas we are showing that we can respond, when necessary, to rapidly changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this legislation can work.  I see it as an encouragement to firms experiencing difficulties to tackle, in a new way, their problems at an early stage and initiate action that can ensure their continued existence.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive debate and to the enactment of this valuable piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth of the matter is that the Government are asking this House to pass legislation today to prevent the collapse of the Goodman Group.  Let us not mess about in any way; this is what this is all about.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister for Finance on the radio this morning &mdash; on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;&mdash; when he attempted to convince our people that this would have happened anyway, that we might well have been back in this House as early as today.  He did not manage to persuade too many of us that that was actually the case.</P>
      <P>Before the announcement of this bombshell the prospects for our agricultural industry were bad enough but this collapse could be the final straw. The reality is that there are thousands of families and many jobs at risk, including the possible collapse of small businesses, if this closure were to take place.  We on this side of the House are not in the business of supporting measures to see an end to a very valuable industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While all of this is happening members of the Government remain silent on the circumstances which brought this sad event about.  Indeed, the failure of the <Col N="2068" /> Taoiseach and his Ministers, particularly those involved in 1987, to disclose publicly the circumstances which led to the reintroduction of export credit insurance for Iraq in 1987 forces me now to call for a full inquiry into the events that took place at that time.  The decision of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; and his colleagues in Government &mdash; to restore export credit insurance cover clearly signalled support by the Government at the time to develop an extension of trade with Iraq.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer Deputies to various Dáil debates where there is clear evidence to support what I said.  The Minister, Deputy Reynolds when introducing the Insurance (Export Guarantees) Bill in 1988, as Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
    <P>As a result of successful growth in business contacts in Iraq and in the context of the Irish-Iraqi Joint Commission, it was decided to provide export credit facilities to Iraq.  This is a positive development in terms of sustaining growth in the long term.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Burke, answering questions on 3 May 1989 as Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
    <P>For my part I should like to confirm the Government's confidence in the wellbeing of our economic relations with Iraq.</P>
    <P>This action was taken and these things were said at a time when most other European countries, in so far as one can judge, had decided not to grant export credit cover because the risks were too high.  It should not be forgotten that one year earlier, in 1986, the previous Government made a decision not to continue to underwrite any further losses for Iraq because of the high risks involved. There is an obligation on the Taoiseach and his Ministers, especially those who were in office from 1987 to 1989, to explain why the decision was taken to restore cover for Iraq, exposing this country to potential liabilities well in excess of £100 million.  We should be <Col N="2069" /> told why in particular they encouraged expansion of the beef industry to Iraq despite the huge risks involved.</P>
    <P>Certain aspects of this whole affair need to be clarified.  We should be given details of the discussions which took place in 1987 between the Government and the Goodman Group in relation to contracts for the supply of meat to Iraq.  We should be told if discussions took place between the Taoiseach and-or members of the Government, representatives of the Government group and Mr. Goodman, regarding the provision of export credit insurance to cover contracts secured for the supply of meat to Iraq.</P>
    <P>Were members of the Government aware that, to fill the contract, some meat would have to come from a source outside this country?  Was Mr. Goodman aware that the insurance policies only covered meat in this country and that his company would be exposed to liabilities in respect of meat outside this country?  Were any claims made in respect of any of these policies?  If so, did the Goodman Group try to recover losses in respect of meat outside this country?  Were there any indications that they were about to make such claims before the cover was cancalled by the Government in October 1989?</P>
    <P>The sad result of this whole debacle is that the Goodman Group are now owed nearly £170 million by Iraq and our economy faces enormous difficulties as a result.  The Taoiseach must explain why he and his Ministers actively encouraged these developments and then decided to cancel the cover in October 1989 leaving a trail of destruction.  In most other civilised countries those responsible for such decisions would resign.  When answering these questions the Taoiseach might also explain what happened to the famous Goodman-IDA expansion programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In view of the dramatic circumstances surrounding the recall of the Dáil and the situation which faces the country, the minimum the House deserves, before passing this legislation, are answers to the important questions I posed.</P>
      <P>Our beef industry is a vital part of our economy and Fine Gael do not support measures proposed by Deputy Stagg to bring about its liquidation.  I hope that my colleagues in other Opposition parties will support my reasonable requests and that we will not spend our time indulging in hearsay titbits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we would not be here today if there had not been a crisis in the livestock industry.  Fine Gael are deeply concerned about the catastrophic effects which the collapse of the livestock industry would have on employment and the economy.  We want the Government to take steps to ensure maintenance of a viable livestock industry but the record of the Government to date in this area is nothing short of appalling.  How did they allow the present situation to arise?  Surely they were aware of the problems long before now, especially after the cancellation of the insurance cover?  It is the responsibility of the Minister to clearly outline how the proposals contained in the Bill before us will achieve a satisfactory conclusion to the problem now facing the beef industry. We do not want to hear in a few weeks or a few months that the proposals did not work, that hundreds of millions of <Col N="2071" /> pounds have been lost in exports and that the industry has been wiped out.</P>
    <P>We will have many questions on Committee and Report Stages and we will be pressing amendments which are necessary to strengthen the provisions of the Bill.  As the Minister rightly said, the Bill now before us was originally Part IX of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which went through Committee Stage before the summer recess.  During the course of debate on Committee Stage we recognised that the provisions of the Bill were a genuine attempt to provide a new legal mechanism for the rescue, reconstruction or aiding potentially viable companies. Fine Gael will be pleased to support workable proposals which would help businesses and jobs.  However, it is unfortunate that we are forced to discuss these proposals in the prevailing atmosphere because it should be remembered that it will be a long time before the Dáil will again have the opportunity to discuss ways and means of saving companies capable of being saved and not waiting until the day of liquidation.</P>
    <P>The history of the introduction of Companies Bills in this House leaves a lot to be desired and the fact that the present Bill is nearly four years before the House speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we tabled ten amendments to the Companies Bill already before the Dáil.  Deputy Bruton and I intend resubmitting these amendments to the new Bill as soon as Second Stage is concluded. These amendments are designed to improve the general effectiveness of the rescue proposals and are not related to the problems now facing the beef industry. The Bill in its present form could cause major problems for the examiner in the performance of his duties.  There is no provision whereby the examiner can be given immediate powers to take over the running of the company from the date of his initial appointment without necessarily waiting for his first report to the court after 21 days.  This could lead to conflict between management and the examiner from day one.  I should like to <Col N="2072" /> give notice that we will table an amendment on Committee Stage to resolve this problem.  The persons petitioning for court protection will usually be the directors of the company in difficulty.  Yet it is these directors who will have the responsibility of nominating who will examine their company's affairs.  We believe there is a potential conflict of interest here and to deal with this we propose to table an amendment which will give the Minister the power to lay down strict rules as to who may be appointed as an examiner.  These could cover any past or future relationships with the company and also necessary professional qualifications.</P>
    <P>The rescue provisions in their present form are liable to lead to lengthy and time-consuming court proceedings.  Fine Gael propose to table amendments to improve the efficiency of these provisions. We would like to see a specialised court dealing with commercial matters. It should be possible to see to it that the same judge will deal with a case from beginning to end.  As the Bill stands at present there is no guarantee that the same judge will be involved when the examiner reports back.  This could lead to absolute chaos in the courts and long delays.  One must, with respect to the Judiciary, question whether there are within our court structure sufficient judges who have a deep knowledge of company law and who will be able to make what are basically commercial decisions in the courts.  The question we must ask ourselves is: will a case be heard one day before judge X and another day before judge Y, who will have to brief himself of the circumstances of the case? This could lead to the postponement of decisions and perhaps the ultimate collapse of the company we are trying to save.</P>
    <P>We also intend to table an amendment which will give the examiner the power to waive some of the protections enjoyed by a company if he believes this might contribute to a speedier solution to the company's problems.  We will also table an amendment which is designed to encourage the examiner to make use of <Col N="2073" /> creditors committees with a view to maximising consensus and minimising conflict in the courts.  There has been much discussion over the past number of days, particularly in the media, about the advantages of this legislation, and it has been compared with Chapter 11 in the United States.  Without sounding negative, I am sure that, like me, most Members of the House want every possible effort to be made by whatever Government are in power to introduce measures to try to save businesses at an early stage rather than allow them to get into such difficulties that they have to be liquidated.  None of us want that to happen and it is not in our interests to come in here and oppose for the sake of opposing if there are measures which can be implemented whereby companies can be saved.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the measures being proposed are good-intentioned &mdash; if that is the correct expression &mdash; but this examiner will have to face practical difficulties on a day-to-day basis.  For example, the examiner will not have complete control of the company; the same management and board of directors will stay in place. As everyone knows, one must have a boss and somebody must ultimately make the decisions.  Catastrophic problems will arise if the examiner wants to do one thing and the management disagree with him.  If this Bill is to succeed consensus will be necessary.  This Bill is trying to get consensus by using the sledgehammer approach because it is the courts who will make the decisions and a majority of a class of creditors will be able to make a decision which will ultimately affect another class of creditors.  Therefore, there is bound to be conflict.</P>
    <P>The difference between this measure and the measure introduced by the 1983-87 Coalition Government in relation to the PMPA was that the PMPA had what is known as an administrator who had absolute power over the running of the company's affairs and had funds available to him.  I have spoken to many professionals who deal with receiverships and liquidations, and I think most of them want to be positive about this legislation. <Col N="2074" /> However, I understand they have approached the Department on numerous occasions to try to get changes in this legislation so that it will be somewhat more effective than they think it will be. The difference between an examiner and a receiver is that a receiver will have the support of the banks and the first thing he will be able to do when he goes into the company is to guarantee that next week's wages will be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case with some of the receivers I have dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The first meeting someone who is trying to save a company will have will be with the employee's representatives, be they trade unions or others, and he will be asked if he has the money to pay next week's wages.  If a company is in difficulties and there is a possibility that the banks are about to move in, the examiner or whoever is in charge of the company will want to have some guarantees about cash flow.  I do not want this measure to fail at the first hurdle just because we have not thought it through to a proper conclusion.  If this measure is to be used in relation to the Goodman Group it is important that it succeeds on day one because if it fails in relation to this group the business community will not have any confidence in it. Confidence means everything in this sort of situation.  This measure should be about giving people confidence that if they use this mechanism they can save their companies.  We want to encourage the directors and members of companies to look at this legislation and use it if they believe their companies can be saved, and stand aside and allow sensible decisions to be taken immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the examiner will examine the circumstances of the company, their books, assets and so on and will report back to the court after 21 days.  In the case of an ailing company 21 days is a hell of a long time and much can happen during that time.  In fact, anyone who has any dealings with business knows that one day is a long time, particularly when you are facing problems.  We have <Col N="2075" /> to be absolutely certain that there is a provision in this Bill whereby the court, if it thinks it is in the interests of the company, will have the power to give control in management terms to the examiner from day one.  If this is not in the interests of the company or there is a different set of circumstances then the court can decide to use the normal measures proposed in the Bill.  However, there must be a provision whereby the court can have that option for the sake of the success of this legislation.  I want this legislation to succeed and not to fail.</P>
    <P>I want to again lay down a marker to the Taoiseach, his Ministers and the Government: if this measure is used in the case of the Goodman Group and it does not succeed it will be dead.  I listened to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, on the radio this morning when he compared this legislation to Chapter 11.  He said that it had been used successfully by Texaco International on a number of occasions.  As the Minister knows, there are very few Texaco Internationals in this country and what that company and ABC Limited, who employ 20 people, will do will be entirely different. Texaco International can afford the expense which will be involved in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Nobody here is under any illusion.  It costs a hell of a lot of money to keep traipsing down to the High Court on a regular basis looking for directions from a judge and if an examiner sees that legal expenses, court hearings and his expenses will cost £90,000 or £100,000 and that as a result of these actions the assets of the company will be reduced and there will be nothing left, then my guess is that after the 21 days he will propose winding up the company.</P>
    <P>That is what I mean about having the power to make immediate decisions.  Let us be honest about it, there are very few Goodman Groups in Ireland.  Most of our companies are small, employing 20, 30, 40 or 50 people.  They do not have money to spend on legal costs to the tune of £90,000 or £100,000 and there will be a responsibility on the examiner to see to <Col N="2076" /> it that any action he takes will not jeopardise the future of the company or that he will be forced to recommend to the court that the company be wound up.</P>
    <P>As I said, we want to try to establish consensus, not conflict, in this legislation. Perhaps the Minister will, on Committee Stage, answer questions in relation to this area and accept amendments to strengthen the Bill.  He knows we are making these points in a constructive fashion to get the best legislation possible so that we can save businesses and jobs.</P>
    <P>We are not here today solely to delight in the difficulties facing the beef industry. I am too well aware of the thousands of people throughout the length and breadth of the country who are concerned about the future of the agricultural industry &mdash; those who are employed in factories, their families, those running small businesses and shops in the towns.  All these people are depending on a proper resolution of this problem.  I sincerely hope the Government have thought this out because they will have to answer these points.  If we come back here in one or two months' time and the beef industry has been wiped out, the Government of the day will be the people who are responsible.</P>
    <P>I tell any of them who has time to go down to the Library to read the Official Report on the PMPA and the ICI affairs. It is amusing to read what was said by the same gentlemen who now occupy the Government benches about the way the Government were handling these affairs and what the disadvantages would be to the ordinary member of the public.  All I can say to those same Members is that as far as we are concerned the PMPA is back in business.  It was sold off as a viable company and people can get motor insurance.  A similar situation arose in relation to the ICI and the banks did not go to the wall.  The gentlemen who made those remarks in 1985, or whenever it was, should think again about whether the decision they are taking today is the correct one.  We should pay tribute in this House to the late Deputy Frank Cluskey for his bravery in attempting to save the <Col N="2077" /> PMPA and the Irish people from absolute chaos on our roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us remember that a similar situation arises today.  They have responsibility for the thousands of families, the small businesses, depending on this industry, and these measures had better work.  I will certainly go along with reasonable proposals that will see to it that this industry, as distinct from any vested interest &mdash; let that go on the record here &mdash; will be saved.  That is the important thing as far as Fine Gael are concerned.</P>
      <P>We would also like to see the Minister with power to petition for court protection for a particular company.  In view of the public interest issues involved in larger companies in particular, we believe the Minister should have this power and we will be tabling an amendment to provide for this.  As I said, under the legislation a limited number of people can petition for the appointment of an examiner, but in the public interest there may be circumstances where it would be wise for the Minister to have power, if he feels it is necessary, to go to court to petition for the appointment of an examiner.</P>
      <P>In closing, I would like to ask the Minister to explain one little thing which I think is of vital importance: does he see the examiner having access to funds to keep a company ticking over particularly in the early days of the appointment?  Let us not pull any punches here.  The reality in relation to the Goodman Group is that thousands of employees are going to ask a simple question in a couple of weeks, or this week &mdash; or maybe they are asking it at the moment &mdash; that is if their wages will be paid next week.  You cannot have consensus and you cannot save companies without having the co-operation of those working in those companies.  If the employees decide to withdraw their labour or if the farmer decides not to supply goods, then no measures will succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one question that has to be <Col N="2078" /> answered is where the money is going to come from.  You cannot save companies or jobs without access to funds.  You will not get people to continue to supply you or to work for you unless you are prepared to pay their wages.  I would like the Minister before replying on Second Stage, to think about this.  I do not intend to be negative here, but advice given to me would suggest that if certain things are done in the course of this legislation they could affect the confidence of Irish business in their dealings with financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The financial institutions, whether you like them or not, are in the business of lending money and they must be satisfied that there are measures here that (a) will protect their interests &mdash; let us be frank and honest about it &mdash; and (b) the proposals are workable.  If they see that Irish business can find an easy way of relieving themselves of genuine debts, then in the future, Irish companies &mdash; again I am talking about small companies &mdash; could find it difficult to get finance to set up and keep running.  He could find that financial institutions would be looking at higher interest rates for Irish business compared to other countries.  I ask the Minister to state in his reply if he is satisfied that all steps and all necessary measures have been taken to ensure that confidence in Irish companies will remain and that Irish companies will not be disadvantaged as a result of any measures here.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I could say about this legislation and that should be said about the sad circumstances leading up to the situation which brings us here today.  I say to the Taoiseach, looking him straight in the face, that he has a responsibility to answer questions that are being posed every day about what went on and why cover was given at a time when everybody else had pulled out of the market.  There is no point saying the matter is <i>sub judice</i> and that we cannot get answers.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to pass this legislation. I do not want to see anybody go out of business.  I do not believe in personal vendettas against successful <Col N="2079" /> business people.  Some people make profits and some make losses; you take the good with the bad, but we encouraged people to do business with a country everybody else was afraid of and in doing so exposed the taxpayer to possible liabilities and the taxpayer is still so exposed.  Remember, there is a court case pending which, I understand, is due to be heard in October and could cost the taxpayer enormous sums of money if the decision of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to cancel export credit insurance cover is found to be improper. As I said, there is a possibility that the taxpayer will be exposed to vast liabilities in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, who was Minister for Industry and Commerce, knows all the circumstances.  I know some of them but I hear bits here and there and I do not like hearsay, I like to hear the facts and I would like the facts to be exposed so that nobody will be able to make claims that are not valid and people will be forced to tell the truth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated yesterday, it has been necessary under Article 24 of the Constitution for the Taoiseach to send a written message to the President, the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad certifying that &ldquo;the Bill is urgent and immediately necessary for the preservation of public peace and security, or by reason of the existence of a public emergency, whether domestic or international&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the attempts by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce over the weekend to describe this legislation as essentially routine and non-controversial, the Dáil must be wondering when it will be told the exact nature of this emergency which necessitates the curtailment of the constitutional right of both Houses and of the President to examine the legislation in detail.  I should like the Taoiseach to confirm that he is satisfied that all the requirements of Article 24 have been complied with and that it is not necessary, <Col N="2080" /> as is stated in the Article, for the President to consult the Council of State before requesting an abridged meeting of the Seanad tomorrow.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the circumstances surrounding the Bill make it impossible for it to be considered routine.  As things stand, it looks very much like a measure aimed simply and solely at protecting rich people from their bankers.  The Labour Party will seek to amend the Bill in a number of ways and make it more relevant to the protection of the public good, to the interests of farmers, now and in the future, and to the interests of workers in the industry or in any other enterprise affected by this legislation in the future.  I will list what we are seeking by way of amendment.  We will be seeking to have all reports prepared by examiners made public unless, in the opinion of the courts, it is clearly contrary to the public good in particular cases.  The Bill, as drafted, provides only for the publication of orders made by the court.  We will be seeking to ensure that no examiner has the right to issue redundancy notices to workers and that the problems generated by mismanagement are dealt with. We will be seeking to change the jurisdiction to the Circuit Court so that small as well as large employers can seek legal protection.  It is clear from the Bill as presently drafted that only companies with large turnovers will be able to afford the fees involved.</P>
    <P>We will seek to make it an offence for any person to interfere with examiners in their work or to destroy any documentation. We will demand to know what steps have been taken by responsible authorities to ensure that shredders were not working overtime last weekend. We will seek to ensure that no person associated with the enterprise in a professional capacity can be appointed as an examiner.  These amendments will make the Bill more clearly an instrument aimed at protecting enterprise rather than simply giving rich men time to buy themselves out of trouble.  Even if it means extending the time necessary for consideration of the Bill, we believe they are vital in the light of what we now know.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2081" /> It has been argued that this is relatively non-contentious legislation already approved in principle by the House, but the circumstances in which it reaches us today make it essential for us to look at it again and to consider in depth some of the issues of principle involved.  Today's debate confronts us with some of the most serious issues that most of us, as politicians elected in a democracy, have ever had to face.  The relatively innocuous legislation that we are asked to deal with is, in a way, a smokescreen.  Hidden behind that smokescreen are some of the most serious questions we could possibly ask.  Perhaps the most fundamental one is this: how much has our concept of democracy already been undermined by the exercise of secret power, by the pulling of strings in book-lined offices and in gracious drawing-rooms, and by the willingness of a democratically elected Government to acquiesce in the greed and ambition of individuals?</P>
    <P>The Irish beef industry, one of the cornerstones of Irish agriculture and the largest exporting industry in the country, has been brought to the brink of destruction by adventurism, greed and the determination of one man to concentrate material and political power in his own hands, and by the venality of politicians. The story of the near destruction of this vital industry is one that the Government ought to be thoroughly ashamed of. Unlike Deputy De Rossa, who was interviewed on radio yesterday morning, I find it impossible to generate any respect for the way in which the Goodman business was built up, nor do I believe that Mr. Goodman should be saved with taxpayers' money.  Our job now is to ensure that the beef industry, not Goodman, is rescued from the situation in which it finds itself and is restored to the basis it needs if it is to continue to develop and contribute to the overall economy.  We must do a great deal more as well.  The international commercial standing of Ireland has been very badly hit in the last few weeks.  Exporters, manufacturers looking for overseas markets for their products and public servants seeking to attract investment here will find that their <Col N="2082" /> efforts have been seriously undermined by what has happened in recent weeks. It will be a long time before we are able to hold our own against other investment locations or with other small exporting economies.</P>
    <P>The reason is simple.  We have been exposed, in the eyes of the international financial community, as an economy willing to tolerate cowboys.  More than that, if we spot a cowboy the Government immediately supply him with a six shooter and a Stetson hat.  There is only one way for us to undo this damage.  We must demonstrate to the world, and especially to our cowboys, that we are not willing to allow them to ride roughshod over the entire regulatory apparatus established to ensure honesty in business.</P>
    <P>From what we have heard so far in this debate, and in the last few days, there is very little reason to be confident that we will emerge from this debacle with our image strengthened and the damage that has been done to our international reputation minimised.  This is a time for telling the truth but I do not believe we have been told the whole story so far.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has insulted our intelligence by implying that this is a routine matter of company law. Ever since this matter came to public attention there has been a tissue of distortions and misinformation.  For example, when the Taoiseach announced the recalling of the Dáil he refused point blank to admit that it was because of a crisis facing Mr. Larry Goodman even though the dogs in the street knew that was the only reason.  He went on to deny specifically and categorically that he or the Government had received any representations from Mr. Goodman, but what are we to make of newspaper reports, which have not so far been denied, that Mr. Goodman landed his helicopter in the grounds of Kinsealy for a cosy lunch with the Taoiseach only last Thursday?</P>
    <P>We have been told again and again that it is the Gulf war which started a couple of weeks ago, that is responsible for Mr. Goodman's troubles.  That is a myth that must be dispelled.  There is a serious <Col N="2083" /> exposure to Iraq as confirmed by the Minister &mdash; as much as £180 million, but that exposure has been there since at least September 1989 and was shown on Goodman's balance sheet at that time.  It has not got any worse since then.  What has happened is that the personal commitments Goodman offered his bankers to cover that exposure have been spent in foolish and greedy investments in the United Kingdom which have gone disastrously wrong.  The truth is much worse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;than anything that has been reported in the newspapers so far. I have in my possession a complete breakdown of the banks to whom Mr. Goodman owes money and the amount of money involved in each case.  It makes extraordinary reading and amounts to a catalogue of commercial adventurism that is surely unacceptable by any business standards.  It is the unacceptable face of Irish capitalism, to coin a phrase.  What those figures tell us above all is that we would be fooling ourselves if we were to maintain that the Goodman enterprise is facing a little short-term difficulty brought on by the Gulf crisis.  The Goodman enterprise is finished and the task facing us is to put a new, better and more honest entity in its place.  Mr. Goodman owes a grand total of just under £700 million in cash and guarantees.  Altogether well in excess of 30 banks have been taken for a ride, American, German, Dutch, Swiss, Japanese and French banks as well as Irish.  The total can be broken down into about £500 million cash and approximately £200 million in guarantees.  In so far as the cash state is concerned, nearly £60 million is owed to Irish banks, almost £80 million to foreign banks with Irish subsidiaries and more than £330 million to banks overseas. That indebtedness is twice what it was only one year ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This money is owed by a company who claim unlimited liability.  The purpose of this claim is to shield the company from <Col N="2084" /> the normal requirements of disclosure of information.  It also conveys that the debts of the company will also be borne by their shareholders.  In this instance, however, contrary to what is generally believed, I understand that the principal shareholders of Goodman International are a company registered in the Channel Islands and known as Kitlar, a limited liability company.  So, in effect, the concept of unlimited liability has been entirely circumvented in this case.  The creditors of Goodman International can only look to Kitlar after taking whatever fixed assets Goodman International hold.</P>
    <P>On page 11 of the Minister's speech he quoted from a briefing note supplied to him which points out that effectively subsidiaries of Goodman International are owed over £100 million by other Goodman companies which will never be recovered. It is an extraordinary statement for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to read into the record of this House without any comment whatever; but even that is only part of this horrible saga.  The real truth is that the vast bulk of the money owed is already, and to all intents and purposes, a bad debt.  The banks involved will lose millions and, in the case of some of the smaller ones, may be irretrievably damaged.  The assets which have been offered cover only a fraction of the total.</P>
    <P>One of the more intriguing pieces of information to be disclosed and to come to my notice includes the fact that among those assets is Classic Meats which, as we all know, Mr. Goodman has always strenuously denied, both to Government and to Opposition, he has any interest in. Without blinking an eyelid, at his meeting with his bankers in London last week, Mr. Goodman informed them that of course he owns Classic Meats and will include it in his assets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the United Kingdom assets are already mortgaged to secure still further debts.  The story of <Col N="2085" /> Mr. Goodman's downfall is, in fact, a simple one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good question. He has been lent very large sums of money to cover the working capital requirements of a substantial company, Goodman International.  Despite giving assurances that that was the purpose for which the money was being borrowed, he used it instead to finance his empire building in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. There is no doubt that, in the process, deceit and misrepresentation were used.  In the end, the banks whose loans are unsecured are those which thought they were lending for the routine purposes of Goodman International.</P>
      <P>It could be argued, and it is an argument for which I would have a certain sympathy that we should not shed any tears for the &ldquo;who's who&rdquo; of the banking community that has been so badly stung. It may well be the case that they are the victims of their own mismanagement, and that we should not shed any tears for them.</P>
      <P>Whatever feeling one might have about these banks, the truth is this: our standing in the world as a country, our ability to compete, our prospects for trade, will all be fatally undermined if the international banking community come to the view that Irish business is not worth doing business with.  That is the view of these bankers now and there are good reasons for that view, which I will return to in a moment.</P>
      <P>First I must ask this question: how did all this come to pass?  How are we involved in this mess?  Are we really to be expected to believe that debts of this magnitude are the result of honest but misguided trading in the Middle East? Are we really to be asked to believe that this is a temporary setback for an otherwise sound enterprise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, it is time to speak the truth. This leading Irish capitalist and entrepreneur has spent the last couple of years pursuing personal ambitions.  He did not want to control the Irish beef industry, <Col N="2086" /> he wanted to own it and more, the dairy industry, the sugar industry, not only here, but in the United Kingdom.  His ambitions have been without limit for the past several years, and there has been no one to set a limit to them.  The only people who have stood in his way have been a handful of public representatives, some media representatives, and a significant number of individuals in the farming and agri-business sectors, all of whom had their own reasons for opposing his monopolistic tendencies.  The public representatives who tried to warn about unlimited ambition, and to expose irregularities and wrongdoing were vilified, accused of national sabotage by the Taoiseach and of being &ldquo;anti-bloody well everything&rdquo; by Mr. Goodman himself. There were few enough who recognised then that those public representatives were speaking up in defence of the farming community whose futures were being mortgaged by Mr. Goodman's greed and ambitions.</P>
    <P>Any journalist who tried to expose what was going on was threatened with huge libel actions and effectively gagged. We can all remember grovelling apologies being read on RTE, for example.</P>
    <P>With farmers, different tactics were tried &mdash; enormously expensive public relations campaigns, lobbying campaigns that were orchestrated by Deputies in this House and others, cash offers to farmers to mortgage their futures that were tantamount to bribery.  Overtly, the Government were silent throughout all of that but nobody was in any doubt about where their sympathies lay.</P>
    <P>If all of these had worked, Mr. Goodman would today be presiding over the same kind of monopoly in the dairy industry that he has created in the beef industry, and the dairy industry would today be facing the same parlous future that is in prospect for the beef industry.  Fortunately, when farmers were given a choice, a majority opted to retain control of their own futures, and to put their trust instead in a co-operative movement that is professional and respected throughout the world.</P>
    <P>None of this would have been possible <Col N="2087" /> if Mr. Goodman had not been given access to cash, to spread around like confetti. Everybody here knows that it is not easy to get access to that sort of cash. Many of us have spent time trying to help businessmen and manufacturers &mdash; usually small businessmen &mdash; to get the cash they need to start worthwhile ventures. It is all too often an exercise in knocking on one locked door after another.  But Mr. Goodman had a key. The key was Fianna Fáil, and the explicit support he was given by that party in Government.  This support manifested itself in a number of ways.  There was the decision of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 to reinstate export credit insurance, and then subsequently to ensure that Mr. Goodman got the lion's share of it.  These were decisions taken against the best professional advice available to that Government.</P>
    <P>Support included changes in the tax laws, to enable a substantial amount of Mr. Goodman's income from beef processing to be taxed at the 10 per cent manufacturing rate.  Further changes included provisions which made section 84 financing for Mr. Goodman more advantageous.</P>
    <P>But perhaps the most explicit form of support stemmed from the famous press conference of June 1988, attended by a beaming Mr. Goodman, flanked by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  The purpose of that press conference was to announce, effectively, that Mr. Goodman was to be entrusted with the task of developing the Irish beef industry, essentially as the only agent of the Irish State in the matter.  The package announced that day involved substantial investment by Mr. Goodman, together with significant investment by the State &mdash; up to £60 million.  This programme never materialised and was a tremendous exercise in bad judgment on the part of the Government.  It was to revitalise the Irish beef sector, and make it the most modern and competitive in Europe.  But the reality, as we know, has been that nothing happened &mdash; except that Mr. Goodman, for the next two <Col N="2088" /> years, used his closeness with Fianna Fáil and Government, and with some of the most senior political figures in the land, to gain access to the boardrooms of the world's banks.</P>
    <P>So what we are now faced with is a crisis for farmers today, coupled with a very uncertain future and a crisis for creditors, and let us not forget that we are not just talking about banks here.  From the moment the examiner takes over this business, all of the debts owed to packaging suppliers, to deep freeze companies, to the ESB and other utilities, and to the Revenue Commissioners are frozen immediately.</P>
    <P>What is left behind is essentially a carcass. Nobody knows how many people are employed by that company, since the employment practices of the business have ensured that many of the employees are now technically contractors.</P>
    <P>This has been very useful in the past when it was necessary to distance the company from very dubious practices. Many of those employees may now find that the security of employment they thought they had is another of the Goodman myths.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the job we have to do is to rescue the beef industry, and to restore it to a sound footing.  We must also face here the need to restore Ireland's image in the business environment around us.  These are not going to be easy tasks.</P>
    <P>I believe that we have to take a three-pronged approach.  The problems facing the beef industry are deep and varied. Although they have been exacerbated greatly by Mr. Goodman's lack of commitment to anything other than himself, we would be fooling ourselves if we were to say that once Mr. Goodman is got rid of the problems will disappear.  Mr. Goodman will have to be got rid of &mdash; of that there is no doubt &mdash; but we will have to do a great deal more as well.</P>
    <P>The first prong in any approach will have to be the examiner.  That will alleviate pressure in the short-term, and buy some time.  Although I suspected initially that the examiner would be unable to operate without some support in the way <Col N="2089" /> of public funding, I now believe that there is very little reason for the State to take any risks in the matter.  There is no reason, unencumbered by the outstanding liabilities of Mr. Goodman, the examiner would not be able to trade at a modest profit, at least in the short term. I welcome the assurance of the Minister that no taxpayers' money will be employed, and I propose to monitor that assurance carefully to ensure that it is adhered to.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the day-to-day operations of the examiner, and as part of the same short-term approach, there is an urgent need to seek out new markets.  I wish the Minister for Agriculture and Food well in this regard but I must add a note of caution.  We must be in a position to provide the most categoric assurances about the quality of Irish cattle, particularly in regard to disease, as mentioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I would like to believe that we can put ourselves in a position where any veterinary surgeon from any part of the world is welcome to inspect Irish beef at any time and that we are secure in the knowledge that we will pass that inspection. Before the examiner is appointed, there must be a rigorous examination by the courts of the circumstances involved in this mess.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second prong of the three I mentioned earlier.  I believe strongly that there must be a sworn judicial inquiry into this whole matter. We cannot rely on the examiner alone to uncover the facts of this case and to suggest all the remedial actions that will be necessary.  We must know those facts and take that action for two reasons.  The first is simple: if we do not learn the lessons of our mistakes we are bound to repeat them.  The second is equally crucial: we must reassure the world that Ireland is capable of regulating and controlling its affairs, that Ireland is a place where honest businessmen can be trusted because dishonest ones will be found out and punished.</P>
    <P>The inquiry will have a lot of questions to answer.  I have already raised some of <Col N="2090" /> them.  We need to know the extent to which deceit and misrepresentation are at the root of this problem.  We need to know if any conflicts of interest are involved in the enthusiastic support given to this entrepreneur by our Government. We need to know if even now the whole truth is being told.  For instance, there is a deep suspicion that secret assets have been salted away to ensure that the banks will not get hold of them in trying to recover their losses.  We need to know the full extent of dubious business practices to which a blind eye has been turned by regulatory authorities, the false labelling and accounting, the commercial arrangements involved in the disposal of offal and so on.  We need to know the role played by professional advisers such as accountants who signed off a balance sheet just four weeks ago that revealed nothing of these difficulties.  There is more.  Mr. Goodman has alleged privately in his recent dealings with bankers that he has been a victim of a massive internal fraud in the company, accounting for perhaps £40 million of the missing money.  What is the background to this and have the Garda been called in to investigate it?</P>
    <P>The third prong of any solution must be a detailed root and branch analysis of the medium-term and long-term situation facing the industry.  The Government must accept the bounden obligation of drawing up a plan for the industry based on the principle that no more monopolies will be allowed to be developed and taking into account the need to develop new markets based on the excellence of the product and the quality of production. Such a plan need not take a great deal of time to draw up, given the number of studies that already exist.  There is considerable room for hope that the fund of expertise available to the beef industry will ensure that this industry continues to survive and prosper, unencumbered by the machinations of greed and dishonest men.</P>
    <P>The future of the beef industry can be bright.  I believe that there is a role for the co-operative movement in that future. Farmers themselves have indicated in the <Col N="2091" /> past that they believe the control of their industry is best served by co-operative endeavour.  What is crucial here is that we recognise now that the industry cannot be allowed to struggle from crisis to crisis in the hands of unscrupulous individuals.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister for Industry and Commerce confirm to this House that the £50 million law claim that Mr. Goodman is pursuing against the Minister and the Irish Government has now been withdrawn, as it has not been referred to in the statement read by the Minister this morning supplied to him by IBI Corporate Finance?  Perhaps the Minister could give the House some information in relation to that.  The Minister might also refer to the situation in relation to the export credit relief and give guarantees to the House that export credit relief will not be reinstated for this type of venture. We might be as well off just to give him the money for some of these ventures.</P>
    <P>I would call on the Taoiseach to ensure that once the short-term situation has been resolved the necessary steps will be taken to place our beef industry on a sound footing.  The Labour Party will be closely monitoring the situation as it develops and we will hold the Government responsible for any future crisis in this industry.</P>
    <P>In the particular situation in which this industry finds itself and having regard to many other issues which we will be dealing with in more detail tomorrow, it would be wrong for this House to walk away believing its work was done tomorrow evening.  I would call on the Taoiseach to reconvene the Dáil at the latest one month from now and to ensure that a full progress report is presented to the House on all of the issues we are dealing with today.</P>

      <P>I believe that your admonition was unnecessary but if you consider that I am going to engage in the same sophistry as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance over the past week in pretending that this legislation is to have general application and is not motivated by the scandal in the Goodman operation, I do not intend to observe that particular admonition.</P>
      <P>The decision to recall the Dáil during the summer recess for the first time in 14 years represents a desperate attempt by this Government to keep the lid on what may well be one of the biggest economic and political scandals in the history of this State.  What we are dealing with today is not simply a case of a commercial enterprise being an unfortunate victim of an unforeseen military venture on the part of Saddam Hussein.  What we are dealing with is a potentially calamitous situation for thousands of workers and farmers in this country, brought about primarily by the avaricious expansion of the Goodman organisation coupled with a total disregard for the interests of anyone other than the owner of those companies.  For years conservative politicians, especially those in Fianna Fáil, have held up the Goodman organisation as a shining example of the very best of Irish capitalism and entrepreneurship.  This was a company, we were told which had recruited the best brains Irish business could offer, a company that were adventurous and imaginative who went after new markets and were export orientated, a company founded by a man who had pulled himself up by the bootstraps, and who now, on their own account, account for some 4 per cent of gross national product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To criticise Mr. Goodman or to raise questions about his business methods was to run the risk of being dismissed as a <Col N="2094" /> political begrudger or even accused of national sabotage.  But sadly for us all the Goodman bubble has now well and truly burst.  For the third time in seven years the Dáil has had to step in and take emergency measures to save the Irish people from the consequences of the greed, recklessness, irresponsibility and incompetence on the part of Irish private enterprise.  In 1983, it was the PMPA; in 1985 it was Allied Irish Banks and ICI and now in 1990 it is the Goodman organisation.</P>
    <P>Those who have closely watched the development of the Goodman organisation in recent years will not have been surprised at the crisis which was brought to a head by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The frenetic pace of his expansion, his obsessive determination to gobble up as much of the food industry as he could acquire, his willingness to spend vast sums of money to score victories over his rivals, his disregard for labour relations and opposition to trade unions and the ruthlessness of his business tactics, are typical of the worst excesses of capitalism, especially when allied to his obsessive concern with secrecy.  We have seen at home and abroad similar seemingly invincible companies, often with a powerful figure at their head, expand and expand before coming crashing down. There are striking parallels between the troubles of Alan Bond in Australia and Donald Trump in the United States and our own Mr. Goodman.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that it is a company involved in the meat trade that is at the centre of the current difficulties.  Much of this trade appears to operate at what could be described as the margins of the law.  Evidence has been uncovered of substantial fraud involving EC payments, the extent of which is unknown but some reports put it as high as £40 million.  Fraud in the meat industry is not a victimless crime.  Apart from the implications for price and quality of meat, the victims are the taxpayers who must foot the bill not to mention the poor and the unemployed who could benefit if the money was used for job creation or social purposes rather than put into the coffers of the beef barons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2095" /> Unfortunately, we do not seem to take business crime, or the so-called white collar crime, very seriously in this country.  Indeed, it is interesting to note how much more seriously it is taken in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain.  If Lester Piggott or Earnest Saunders had operated in Ireland, far from facing jail sentences they would probably have ended up as members of boards of semi-State companies or even winning a Taoiseach's nomination to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Goodman companies or employees of the Goodman Group have been in court on at least three occasions in the past three years.  In 1987, a close aide of Mr. Goodman was convicted of attempting to defraud the Department of Agriculture and Food having been found in possession of forged South African customs stamps.  A gentleman whom I will not name was fined £8,000 and received a two year suspended jail sentence.  In April of last year a Goodman factory in County Waterford was fined £1,000 for irregularities in cattle documentation, and only last month a company owned by Goodman at the time of the offence was convicted and fined on two charges related to illegal labelling of meat carcases.  This particular incident was the one in the Eirfreeze plant in North Wall to which Deputy Mac Giolla had drawn attention in the Dáil in March 1989, an action for which he was attacked and vilified by Mr. Goodman and a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies in this House.  Former Deputy Barry Desmond received similar treatment on a number of matters he raised.</P>
    <P>There have been many more questionable activities by Goodman firms.  It was revealed in March 1989 that a penalty of over £1 million had been imposed on a Goodman firm for breaches of beef export regulations.  There was also Goodman involvement in the export credit insurance scheme scandal, so described by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, when it was revealed that one-third of the £120 million worth of beef insured for export to Iraq had not originated in this country.  It has never <Col N="2096" /> been explained why Mr. Goodman tried to take over Master Meats in circumstances of high secrecy more appropriate to a CIA operation than a legitimate business venture, and why he continued to insist he was not the beneficial owner until meeting his bankers last week.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have, on a number of occasions in the past two years, called for a full sworn inquiry into all aspects of the beef trade.  The sudden threat of the collapse of the Goodman Group makes this inquiry more imperative than ever. Such an inquiry should look into all aspects of the beef trade, establish the extent of irregular or illegal activities in the interests of the industry, the farmer suppliers and workers and make recommendations as to how these practices could be stamped out.</P>
    <P>This extraordinary recall of the Dáil has as much to do with the integral links between Fianna Fáil and the Goodman organisation as it has with protecting a key Irish industry and the jobs and livelihoods that depend on it.  The protection of those jobs of meat workers and of farmers who, especially at this time of the year, are almost solely dependent on their cattle being taken off the land must be the priority of this Dáil.  However, that priority must not blind Members to the fact that more and more it is becoming evident that we are staring into a financial slurry pit, nor can this House continue in the make-believe that what is good for Larry Goodman is good for the country.  That consensus has been set to some extent by Deputy Barrett in his opening address as it has been set in the media: statements like Ireland needs Larry Goodman more than Larry Goodman needs Ireland are absolute nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, I apologise to Deputy Barrett for misinterpreting what he had to say.  Indeed it may well be that what is good for Larry Goodman is good for Fianna Fáil, but it is not necessarily good for Ireland.  Farmers, finally and belatedly, have acknowledged this fact in the conduct of the recent Killeshandra and Lough Eglish hostile take-over bid.  I am sure even the farm leaders are now embarrassed about the manner in which they tacitly, at least, and, in some cases, openly assisted the Goodman take-over bids of various co-ops.  It was only when it came to the Killeshandra and Lough Egish take-over that the farmers in the north-east copped on to themselves and to the fact that Larry Goodman's interests were not consistent with theirs. It is regrettable that those co-ops had to spend £2.5 million fighting off that take-over bid.  Some of the literature used in that campaign is very interesting and prophetic &mdash; I will return to this later &mdash; but a number of the cartoons relating to Mr. Goodman's aspirations, particularly the cartoon showing Goodfish International as a giant shark chasing a small producer underwater, are particularly striking and have turned out to be very prophetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present crisis also exposes the fact that Goodman is no more than a commodity trader with virtually no value added accruing to the Irish economy.  I want to take the opportunity of this extraordinary Dáil debate to demand again a full inquiry into the Goodman group of companies.  I shall set out some of the reasons.  The Workers' Party consider such an inquiry is now imperative. First, it is clear that Larry Goodman's meteoric rise is at least partially attributable to the fact that he has always enjoyed the partisan political support of Fianna Fáil.  Knowing the inside political track has enabled Goodman to get access to exceptional lines of credit and to benefit from risky but profitable Middle East <Col N="2098" /> contracts, confident in the knowledge that he is guaranteed by the Government so long as Fianna Fáil remain in power. This did not start in 1987.  For example, some years ago there are good grounds for believing that Mr. Goodman was allowed to cherry-pick the best of the ICC property portfolio because he had the inside political track before any other body became aware.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that a blind eye is turned by the Revenue Commissioners to the type of &ldquo;remuneration packages&rdquo; enjoyed by his senior executives because of Mr. Goodman's political connections? Similarly, would other companies escape scrutiny if they operated the contract system for such a large proportion of their workforce in the manner in which Mr. Goodman does and where PAYE and PRSI payments are not returned to the Exchequer for many workers?</P>
    <P>However, the most disturbing cause for concern relates to allegations of misuse and abuse on a grand scale of the privileges conferred by the generous Fianna Fáil Government's support for the failed 1987 £260 million development plan for the beef sector.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil returned to power in 1987 they made two disastrous decisions both involving Larry Goodman as the major beneficiary.  First, they re-introduced the export credit insurance scheme and operated it in such a manner that the then Leader of the Progressive Democrats claimed in the Dáil, according to the Official Report, column 2033, of 10 May 1989, that:</P>
    <P>There are good grounds for believing that a substantial abuse has occurred, that the actions of some of those involved were deliberate, that as a result there is a risk to the Irish taxpayer of a liability currently measured at not less than £56 million and potentially much more and, most important, that this state of affairs has come about as a result of a series of steps involving governmental and ministerial intervention and responsibility.</P>
    <P>They were the precise words of the Minister who now comes into this House to <Col N="2099" /> introduce this legislation and to maintain the charade he has maintained in interviews up to now, that it is really not motivated by problems in the Goodman empire.  I welcome the fact that the same Minister subsequently cancelled the export credit insurance scheme.  Had the not done so what kind of situation would we be in now?  ICI would be liable to be short of £200 million as a result of the Iraqi situation, and as a result we, the taxpayer, would be expected to underwrite it.  I give credit to the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, for taking that decision but I give him no credit for maintaining the ridiculous illusion that this debate is not about helping one giant company that has run into trouble out of their own greed, avaricious and imprudent investments abroad.  In the Official Report of 10 May 1989, at column 2033, Deputy O'Malley stated:</P>
    <P>The scale of the abuse and of the potential liability of the State is unprecedented. </P>
    <P>Second, the Fianna Fáil Government handed over development of the beef sector to Mr. Goodman, offering him extraordinarily generous assistance to do so.  The £260 million development plan &mdash; the most major announcement ever made in the food industry here &mdash; was to consist of £60 million in assistance from the IDA and the EC and a package of section 84 loans totalling £170 million. Already it has been said in this debate, as it has on a number of occassions in this House, that that development plan for the food industry has collapsed. Although I had serious reservations about it from the beginning I regret very much that it has collapsed because, at least, it was an initiative to develop a major indigenous industry.  I do not agree with the way it was done or with the manner in which all our eggs were concentrated in the Goodman basket but what this House apparently does not have is information that has been supplied to me to the effect that notwithstanding the collapse of the package that Mr. Goodman has proceeded to draw down a great <Col N="2100" /> deal of the £170 million package of section 84 lending.  This is an extraordinary situation which, of course, effectively defrauds the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring's memory is slightly faulty on this point because it was not the Minister for Agriculture and Food who was jostling for position at the elbow of the Taoiseach and Mr. Goodman when that package was announced but Deputy Joe Walsh, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food. Deputy Walsh has been remarkably silent since this affair happened.  At that time we were told he was the man who first brought the package to Government. Deputy O'Kennedy, the Minister for Agriculture and Food sulked for some months after having been excluded from the Taoiseach's company.  Did Deputy O'Kennedy know something that was denied to the rest of us in this House? What does the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, have to say now about the package he brought to Government?</P>
    <P>I am now stating in this House that I have information which suggests that Mr. Goodman proceeded to draw down much of the £170 million package of section 84 loans.  I am stating that it is my information that those exceptional credit lines were manifestly not used for the purposes for which they were approved; rather that Mr. Goodman used these facilities to fund imprudent and speculative investments outside the State that had nothing to do with the beef industry and that in that process the Exchequer was effectively defrauded of substantial revenue. These are serious charges which I am asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce to address.  Has Mr. Goodman used the section 84 facility which formed an integral part of the development plan approved by Government for the beef industry &mdash; and the beef industry only &mdash; to enable him fund speculative ventures outside the State?  I would remind the Minister that when in Opposition on 10 May 1989 he described the manner of abuse of the export credit insurance scheme by the Goodman organisation as a &ldquo;fraud on the Irish taxpayer&rdquo;. <Col N="2101" /> Does he agree that resort to the facilities approved by the Government in the context of the 1987 development plan, in the manner that I have described, is a more serious fraud on the Irish taxpayer?  May I take the opportunity to ask the Minister if he can tell the House whether the IDA did actually expand taxpayers' money on feasibility studies associated with the so-called joint venture with the Goodman organisation?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, is now asking the House to approve legislation to protect Mr. Goodman from his bankers, although, like the Taoiseach, he persists in the sophistry that it is not motivated by the Goodman crisis.  Yet, is it not true that Mr. Goodman's problems are contributed to by his recent decision to raise a loan of £20 million and to put it on deposit, as a tax dodge, with Mercantile Credit, in order to avoid DIRT tax and that as a result of the problems in Mercantile Credit, and other problems, the £20 million is now missing?  I would like to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce address whether the information which he has been supplied with by IBI Corporate Finance Limited makes reference to this.  Is the Minister aware of it?</P>
    <P>If our actions are successful today &mdash; and The Workers' Party hope they will be &mdash; in protecting the beef industry coming into peak season, together with the livelihoods dependent on it, this crisis makes a full inquiry into the Goodman organisation, in our view, imperative.  How can any Government justify leaving the families of so many farmers and meat workers at risk?  They are dependent on a group of companies, the hallmark of which is Mr. Goodman's obsessive secrecy and financial chicanery.  Why has Mr. Goodman moved to restructure 15 holding companies as unlimited liability companies?  The only sensible explanation can be to avoid the terms of the EC directives on disclosure of company information.  Time and again in this entire saga that question of disclosure of information comes to a head.  Mr. Goodman, at all stages, even through resorting to <Col N="2102" /> gagging writs has avoided answering pertinent questions raised in the public interest both outside and inside this House by public representatives.</P>
    <P>Sections of the media are busy telling us that Ireland needs Larry Goodman more than Larry Goodman needs Ireland, that we should have admiration for the fact that he is cashing in his chips to help recovery with the exception of a few family trusts.  I would like to know how much is salted away in those family trusts.  For example, if a building society forecloses on my mortgage I will not get away with pleading any family trust if I want to retain a roof over my head.  It is fatuous of the media to be lecturing us on how grateful we should be to Mr. Goodman that he is going to cash in his stake in Food Industries or will realise his declining share in Beresford or whatever, to expect us to welcome that and acknoledge that he can have family trusts while workers face the prospect of being thrown out of jobs and farmers risk the calamity of a disaster in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister now confirm the accuracy of information available to me that suggests that today's Bill is a third choice proposal only of the Goodman organisation arising from the meetings that have been held with the Taoiseach, one of which Deputy Spring referred to in Kinsealy last Thursday?  I ask the Minister to deny that the first proposal which the Goodman organisation put to Government involved a £300 million rescue package which Mr. Goodman demanded the Government should underwrite.  I challenge the Minister for Industry and Commerce to deny that.  I should also be interested to hear the lineup at Cabinet that resulted in that proposal quite properly being thrown out.</P>
    <P>The second attempt by Mr. Goodman's friends in Cabinet involved an approach to the EC Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry &mdash; a man who knows a thing or two about buying cattle himself &mdash; in an attempt to persuade him to bring forward an EC plan that would be of similar assistance to Mr. Goodman but which would be cosmetically packaged as <Col N="2103" /> being in the interest of the &ldquo;total industry&rdquo;. May I ask the Minister whether it is safe for me to presume that this may still be done although, presumably, it could not be done sufficiently quickly to keep the wolves from the door, but that this package is likely to emerge still and to be seen to complement the measures we are enacting today?</P>
    <P>There is a savage irony for all of us that this giant private enterprise, who so bitterly and with such scant regard for the truth, resented any Member of this House raising, in the public interest, any legitimate questions about the conduct of his affairs, is now dependent on the same public representatives to enable him forestall his creditors.  Perhaps now we understand somewhat better the anger and incoherence of his riposte to the concerns raised in this House by Deputy Mac Giolla and former Deputy Barry Desmond last year.  Indeed it is interesting to note that, only a few months ago, in a similar incoherent denunciation of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, arising from what has been dubbed the mystery meats affair Mr. Goodman claimed to have 28 per cent of the beef kill.  I am sure some of the media will have the press release &mdash; rambling, incoherent and angry as it was &mdash; still on file.  Now two or three months later, when it suits him, he tells us he has 40 per cent of the beef kill and, as such, of course we must rescue him; to do anything else here would be against the national interest, would be heretical.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are convinced of the need for a thorough and rigorous inquiry into the Goodman affair because if, miraculously, this crisis should blow over Mr. Goodman may again embark on commercial adventurism under-written by the Government.  Alternatively, if the crisis worsens, this House may yet be presented with the even more unpalatable option of baling out Mr. Goodman at taxpayers' expense.  Either way we are satisfied that such a dominant position in the industry must not be retained by Mr. Goodman.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a passing <Col N="2104" /> remark of Deputy Spring concerning his having a different view on this from that articulated by my party leader, Deputy De Rossa.  The extent of the information revealed to this House by Deputy Spring and me is such that, in the interests of the industry and of the jobs involved, we may well reach a stage yet at which it will be necessary for this House to consider such a proposal from Government.  Our response to that would be that the overriding interest would be the protection of the beef industry, jobs and suppliers, that one simply cannot take up a position of rejecting out of hand State investment to rescue that industry.  Of course nobody is suggesting that that State investment should be for the benefit of Mr. Larry Goodman.  We made that mistake already in the previous examples of the ICI and AIB.</P>
    <P>Financial circles around this city are still incredulous at the failure of the Government at that time to secure an equity stake from the AIB; the equity stake was there for the taking having regard to the gravity of the position then being faced by AIB.  Similarly here I am quite satisfied that, if it should come to that eventuality, the jobs must be baled out, in these circumstances farmers must be rescued with no blame attaching to them but that the cost of doing so must be that the State will take equity participation in this company and, furthermore, that this company will be broken up in the public good.  For example, there are co-operatives who have expressed an interest in this company in the past who are at present hogtied. At present nobody can compete with this man because of the manner in which he has the inside political track and has tied up, locked-in FEOGA and IDA grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a good deal of other things I wanted to say, but let me put it this way.  It is time that the myth <Col N="2105" /> of the Goodman organisation contributing to added-value in this economy was exposed for what it is, a nonsense. Even looking at the performance of the co-operatives which many people contend is not as good as it should be and so on, it must be acknowledged that many of them have been very successful in business to business selling, in creating branded products for long life on shelves in Germany, Britain or wherever.  That is not done in the manner of the process engaged in by Mr. Goodman.</P>
      <P>Is it not time that we examined whether the structure of the industry is right in this country?  For example, take the failed Greenfields project that was to go into the empty Polaroid factory in Deputy Stagg's constituency.  They attempted to develop such a new branded beef product and had to abandon it.  In their view £3 million or £4 million would have made the difference between success and failure. Yet here we are, as open-ended public representatives, handing out guarantees and grants to this company when all that accrues to this economy are the wages paid to the workers by the Goodman outfit.  Of course, most of those are on contract.  Mr. Goodman's style of take-over has been accompanied by tactics of bullying the unions.  He has introduced confrontation post every take-over success, has introduced a system of contract labour that has operated throughout the industry.</P>
      <P>Our overriding concern is that the industry and jobs within it must be protected. But it is imperative that we avail of the opportunity afforded us by this Bill to ventilate the very serious public concerns and public interest that arise as a result of the commercial adventurism of Mr. Larry Goodman.</P>

      <P>As a member of the committee to which the Minister referred in his introductory remarks I am indeed pleased to participate in this debate.  That committee considered this legislation in its fuller context under the title of the Companies (No.2) Bill, 1987, and spent considerable time discussing this section of that legislation.  We felt it to be an <Col N="2106" /> extremely important part of that Companies Bill and teased it out at some considerable length.  Indeed we felt it to be a most essential part of any new company legislation.  This was based on the experience of many of us in our role as public representatives and in the tasks which we were sometimes called upon to perform in trying to help different companies in difficulties, for one reason or another.</P>
      <P>The role of the examiner is most important and innovative in so far as industry is concerned.  As time goes on and the position of the examiner is utilised in industry, I am convinced that we will see its beneficial aspects in terms of industry. I also believe that this legislation will allow for many of the questions posed by Opposition speakers to be answered, especially in regard to the Goodman organisation.  In studying the legislation, it is clear that the powers of the examiner are very wide indeed in relation to seeking answers to questions regarding the financial aspects of the Goodman organisation which have been rightly asked by members of the Opposition.  If an examiner was to be appointed to a firm like the Goodman organisation &mdash; or any other &mdash; he would have the power to seek information, documents and financial reports and to question officers of individual companies in seeking background information as to how a company got into difficulties.  The examiner will be a very powerful person so far as the company are concerned.  The legislation will be beneficial from that point of view and will allow major questions posed here to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot ignore the present international situation arising largely from the difficulties in the Gulf region and we cannot expect to be untouched by what is happening there.  We are not alone in this regard.  Last week a major UK company made a decision, arising from what is happening in the Gulf region, to lay off 500 workers because of the trade embargo.  That is only one difficulty which has been made public but I am sure there are many, many other companies which, for a variety of reasons, will be in <Col N="2107" /> difficulty as a direct result of what is happening in the Gulf region.  For that reason, we should pass this important legislation because, whatever happens over the next months or years, we can be sure that the difficulties to which I referred will impinge to some extent on Irish industry and that we will be unable to ignore them.  The legislation will be of great benefit to different Irish companies if they get into trading difficulties largely as a result of circumstances outside their control, particularly external circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am sure that meat is not the only product we have been exporting to the Gulf region.  We have built and developed a very sophisticated electronics industry here and many of our nationals work in the region installing advanced technological systems covering a wide range of uses.  Many of those products have been manufactured in this country and they will also be affected by the trade embargo.  They will have to take action to try to minimise the effect on their industrial base in this country.  We should not be critical of their involvement in export markets because we know that a country such as ours must, from an industrial point of view, export or die. That may be a cliché but we must find markets for our products, goods and services. We must ensure that there will not be a major difficulty in Irish industry continuing to pursue export markets.  As we know, the international commercial arena has changed dramatically even in the last year; new markets have opened up and old markets have, for one reason or another, been closed.</P>
    <P>The marketing executive in this country trying to break into new areas must continue to be free to do so.  Unfortunately, exporting goods abroad always involves a certain risk.  We will never be able to effectively cancel that risk; it will always be there.  Chances must be taken by those sending goods abroad.  There is always the worry as to whether they will arrive safely, that they are utilised for the purposes for which they were intended and that the purchaser will be in a <Col N="2108" /> position to pay for them.  Very often, in foreign markets, there are tough negotiations and stringent conditions are laid down.  If the exporter is not prepared to meet the terms and conditions the buyer in the foreign market can simply thank them and go elsewhere.  That is always a risk in the export area unless you have specific guarantees on payments or are paid in advance.  However, we do not tend to operate in the international commercial sector on the basis of always getting payment in advance for goods and services.  The industrial bases here, in the food, industrial and electronics sector, must seek new markets all the time, expand existing markets and, as far as possible, try to ensure that there is not a detrimental effect on the base at home by doing bussiness with foreign buyers.</P>
    <P>Of course there will be occasions when the commercial climate will go disastrously wrong in an individual country for a variety of reasons.  That is where the difficulties to exporters in this country can arise.  However, we cannot batten down the hatches and not get involved in exports because we cannot be sure of payments.  For that reason we must have some sympathy with the Goodman organisation in regard to what happened in the Gulf region.</P>
    <P>The farming community were doing well through the Goodman organisation in regard to cattle sales, etc., in so far as payments were concerned.  I understand that farmers were paid on the day.  From my limited knowledge of the farming sector, I am sure that was welcomed by the farming community and I know that other, separate organisations in the Goodman Group also operated a similar policy.</P>
    <P>In the past we know that far too much of our cattle stock was going out on the hoof and we frequently heard complaints from the urban areas &mdash; apart from the rural sector &mdash; regarding the non-processing of meat in this country.  There was a movement in that direction in the last five or ten years &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; because it meant that we were providing jobs here in processing beef instead of exporting it.  The processing of beef is not <Col N="2109" /> necessarily or essentially a rural concentrated industry.  Many of the associated industries in this sector are based in larger urban areas.  This industry transcends any particular individual sector of our commercial base.</P>
    <P>The people who process beef and other meat for export are taking the chance I referred to earlier.  There will always be difficulties in this area.  As the Minister stated earlier, and as we know, we export a tremendous amount of processed beef of one kind or another.  There are difficulties in some of these markets and, as some of our rural colleagues can undoubtedly tell us, exporters of lamb to the French market are faced with major difficulties because French farmers are taking action to try to deal with imported meat from this country and the United Kingdom.  These markets were to some extent freely available to us but because of changing circumstances they are being closed down.  This means our producers have to seek alternative markets further afield, even in areas where the commercial base, financial and otherwise, is not as established and firm as they have been used to.  All these factors cause problems for exporters.  Today one major company is involved but tomorrow, next year or the year after, another company may be involved.  We do not know what markets our exporters will be able to penetrate but we can be sure that we need those markets.</P>
    <P>Because of the difficulties which can arise in foreign markets in terms of payment, etc., for the goods supplied, we need this legislation.  Not alone will it be of benefit to exporters but it will also benefit the home market.  We seem to have been addressing one particular industry in this debate, but this Bill will be of benefit right across the commercial sector.  We all know of companies which have been pushed to the wall and driven out of business by the precipitate action taken by a banker creditor or supplier.</P>
    <P>This legislation will give industries, whether small, medium or large, three months grace through the appointment of an examiner who will give calm and rational consideration to their trading <Col N="2110" /> position under the control of the courts. This means realistic decisions can be made about the possibility of preserving or protecting a particular industry.  As we have seen too frequently, good solid companies, through no fault of their own, were pushed to the wall by the early and unnecessary action taken by one element in their trading relationship, for example, a banker, creditor or supplier.  The problem was that there was no provision in existing legislation which would have given those companies a breathing space so that they could preserve and protect jobs and their commercial establishment. This legislation will give such companies that breathing space.  It is very specific and detailed legislation and is weighted in favour of the workers who are interested in preserving their jobs.  The three months breathing space will give these industries and their workers an opportunity to save their companies.  Frequently in the past companies were saved when they were given some time to resolve their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The effect of the appointment of an examiner on any industry is crucial.  Section 5 points out very clearly the various effects the appointment of an examiner will have on a company.  It will give the company the opportunity to gather their forces to see if they can be sustained and saved.  I am absolutely convinced that the absence of legislation of this kind has led to the untimely demise of many potentially good commercial organisations which were hastily liquidated.  Some companies which were being pushed to the wall by an individual banker or creditor fought back strongly, with the co-operation of workers and management, and were able to survive and, in some cases, to grow and expand.  This legislation will give such companies the opportunity to fight back.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate the importance of the role of the examiner in eliciting the information required to allow him to draw up a plan for presentation to the court on the way forward for the business to which he has been appointed.  This will confer on him very substantial powers for getting information either through the <Col N="2111" /> production of documentary evidence, books etc., of that business or examining individuals within the organisation and eliciting the required information under oath.  The examiner will have very strong powers to get the sort of information referred to here this morning in regard to the particular company.  When this legislation is in place the examiner will have these powers and report his findings to the court.</P>
    <P>All these provision taken together make for good solid legislation.  The special committee of this House, comprised of Members from all sides, met for one year and had detailed discussions on various aspects of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  We spent a considerable time discussing this section of the Companies Bill and, if my memory serves me correctly, we basically agreed on the final wording of the legislation which, I believe, will be of tremendous help to industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This House would not be in session were it not for the financial problems facing Goodman International. No matter how the Government or even Deputy Flood in his wisdom tries to explain the importance of this new legislation, we just would not be here today were it not for what has happened to Goodman International.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House today should be judged on its ability to meet three main objectives.  First, the short-term future for the Irish cattle industry is in jeopardy.  It is in jeopardy anyway, but it will be particularly so if the Goodman <Col N="2112" /> group of meat factories close next week or the week after.  Let that be clear to the Government and to the examiner, whoever he or she might be.  Based on the traditional system of 50 per cent of our national kill being effected during the months of September, October, November and December each year and on its staying at that all the time, there would be absolute mayhem at our factories and our marts because we would not have the killing capacity, and any of us who happened to be involved in a professional way with the meat industry back in 1974 knows what it is like to have cattle ready for sale and nowhere to go with them. Therefore, it is most important that that be said straightaway as far as farmers are concerned.  Literally thousands of farmers would become redundant if that happened, not to speak of the thousands of workers who would lose their jobs.  If it were farmers and workers who were in the position Goodman International are in today, would we be here?  Most definitely we would not.</P>
    <P>It appears from figures for the trade that about 90,000 extra cattle have been killed at this point this year over last year. However, this is offset by the fact that there is an almost total slow down in the numbers of shipments of live cattle.  I understand that for very good reasons &mdash; or very poor reasons depending on how you look at it, because of the scare of BSE &mdash; since last July that has almost terminated.  That means that we will have just over 500,000 steers to kill in our Irish factories between now and Christmas.  It is important that I put on the record how they will be killed and where they will go.  About 125,000 will be slaughtered in September: 20 per cent of that kill will go to the commercial market, supermarkets in Europe etc., 75 per cent will go into intervention and 5 per cent will go outside the EC.  In October the numbers rise dramatically and we will have between 175,000 and 200,000 cattle to kill that month: approximately 15 per cent of the kill will go to the commercial markets, 65 per cent into intervention and, it is hoped, 20 per cent to other <Col N="2113" /> markets outside the EC if we get a foothold on the Iranian and Egyptian markets. The November figures will resemble September with a much lower, 50,000, kill in December.  That is the background to what is going to happen in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The Bill's second major objective must be to grant sufficient powers to the examiner to conduct an overall investigation into the affairs of the Goodman group of companies which has been called for many times today.  However, the examiner must have the necessary powers not only to investigate every aspect of Goodman International Meats as we know them but also to go over a number of years to establish what benefits have accrued to the company, if such benefits were available to other companies in like businesses in similar circumstances and whether those could be used by other meat processors for one reason or another.  The examiner must also examine Irish and EC funding paid to Goodman International by way of intervention, export refunds, aids to the private storage scheme, moneys or concessions from section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987 and, of course, the export credit insurance scheme.  Above all else, the question of cross-subsidisation of other companies within the group must be looked at.  Nothing short of a full exposé of the entire operations of the company will be acceptable on this occasion.  Furthermore, the obvious unique relationship between the Fianna Fáil Government led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey, and Goodman International requires scrutiny and great attention.</P>
    <P>The £260 million food processing package announced two and a half years ago by the Taoiseach, surrounded on that day by half of his Cabinet and with Goodman International either in the wings or there but all together on the one stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food.  However, the Cabinet gave their approval for this deal although the role of the IDA had remained a secret at this stage.  I have brought this on to the floor of the Dáil on numerous occasions.  I want the Minister to inform the House if the IDA had been given sufficient time to evaluate the project and what their recommendations to Cabinet were. Surely for a huge package by Irish standards the Government must have had all the relevant details about the Goodman Group before they decided to play footsie with them on this scheme.  Was there indecent haste to ensure that Goodman benefited before any other company could get in or did the Government jump the gun and prematurely announce the deal?  Many neutral observers found it difficult to understand, and still do so, why so many of the personalities involved in Goodman International in the takeover of Westmeath and Bailieboro' were closely associated with that party.</P>
      <P>It is in the interests of Irish farmers that we should have a number of meat processors in this country who have the ability to handle big international meat deals, and a vital element is to have true competition around.  The international trading of meat is a hazardous business at any time with so many variable factors to contend with.  Because of shrinking world markets for beef, mainly in the most politically unstable parts of the world, the competition for the contracts is razor sharp.  I have to say that Goodman International have the muscle and the expertise to deal worldwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> However, many smaller yet very efficient companies argue that they were unable to draw on the many benefits that were available at a particular time and were unable in some cases to gain access to certain markets as a result of this.  There is no reason to believe Goodman International will lose any of their markets or contracts or their continued involvement in the export of meat because of what has happened, and I hope what we are doing here today will ensure that they trade in meat after this, but I will qualify that to some extent in a moment.  It is vital that there is a competitive element in so far as export markets abroad are concerned and that other companies who so wish are allowed the facilities of the same level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>The Minister must explain how the examiner will provide working capital. This is a big question and will test the mettle of this legislation.  Where will the working capital come from for Goodman International to purchase the large numbers of cattle I hope they will be allowed to do between now and the end of the year?  I assure the House I am not speaking of small potatoes on this.  As my colleague, Deputy Seán Barrett asked, where will the money come from to pay the huge staff?  There must be a decision by the bankers involved and by the examiner when he is put <i>in situ.</i> That must be a central part of this rescue operation.  If that money is not up front, there is no point in the Government hiding behind an examiner being installed at this stage, and the legislation we have here today will prove absolutely useless.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about marketing of beef.  This is the time and place, although I have referred to it on many occasions in the past year in the House. Our national interest would be best served by commercially selling our beef on markets where quality would command premium prices.  We are no better at marketing today than we were this day ten years ago; if anything, I would say we are somewhat worse because all we do is lump it into intervention if it is there and that is the end of the story, and 75 per <Col N="2116" /> cent of our entire output will be slammed into intervention this very year as it was last year.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food seems to have little interest in creating an environment to commercially sell meat products abroad.  Look at what the Government did to CBF, the meat marketing board.  Their budget has been cut by the Government by 50 per cent over the past two years.  Commissioner MacSharry seems utterly unconcerned that the orderly marketing of beef has great potential as far as this country is concerned.  Winter beef fatteners, a very important group of farmers, have been going through a nightmare over the past three or four years.  Many such farmers will not be involved in winter production of beef at all this year.  The knock-on effect on prices for store cattle is nothing short of disastrous.  Neither the House, nor the Minister for Agriculture and Food sufficiently realise just how bad cattle prices are, particularly for store cattle.  Unless store producers receive some other form of income they will be put out of business shortly.  Commissioner MacSharry never gave any incentive to meat processors to market beef commercially.  That is one black mark against him.</P>
    <P>We must have a marketing strategy if we are to have an efficient industry.  This demands a continuous supply of cattle all year round.  Farmers, meat processors and the EC would all gain from such a strategy.  The Minister should be giving the lead in this matter but instead both the Minister and Commissioner MacSharry have shown themselves to be totally disinterested in such a development.</P>
    <P>The handling of the market crisis in Iran and Egypt confers no glory on the Minister.  I wish to put on record that while the EC ban on ministerial visits to Iran was in place because of the Salman Rushdie affair both France and West Germany, colleagues of ours around the EC table, managed to do deals with Iran. How do they justify their actions?  Was it the Rushdie affair or BSE disease which prevented Ireland from making progress? The Minister did not sufficiently impress on these Middle Eastern countries that <Col N="2117" /> Ireland has no indigenous case of mad cow disease.  Unlike Britain, we are able to identify the source of the disease.  Let it be said that we have imported any problem cases that we have and have dealt with them in a very professional manner.  When is the Minister going to Tehran?  I should like to know the day and the time and to know if he is going to Cairo.  No pressure has been brought to bear on the Egyptian authorities with whom we have a good track record.  It is a scandal at a time when we cannot secure markets that the Minister is not operating like a roving ambassador.  The Minister should be visiting all countries trying to secure markets for beef.  Instead of that we find it difficult to get him to leave the country.  When the Minister was President of the EC Council of Agriculture Ministers he blew a very loud trumpet when he secured an agreement between the UK and other EC countries who had demanded a ban on UK imports because of BSE.  That was a good decision.  When he took off his cap as EC President he proved useless at selling Irish beef abroad.  Our exports of beef are extremely important to us, more so than to any other country in the EC.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should have this group of companies to ensure real competition but everyone should be treated fairly and share in any benefits that might arise.  We must protect the taxpayer from exposure to any losses that might accrue.  The Minister told us that there is a gap of £300 million between the liabilities and realisable assets of the company.  Obviously, we want the company to continue trading but we do not want to wake up one morning and find that the losses have been passed on to the taxpayer.  This would not be acceptable.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  I thought we had 30 minutes.  I hope Deputy Deasy will give me a moment or so to conclude.  It has been represented to me that under the export credit scheme, which was discontinued by the Minister some months ago, almost £50 million is owed to the Goodman Group.  I hope the Minister will comment on that and say if there is any truth in the story that is going around.  Farmers and farm leaders are anxious that the Bill would provide for preferential payment to them for agricultural produce already supplied.  Will the Minister state if such a provision is contained in the Bill?</P>
      <P>I lay the blame for the collapse of the Goodman Group squarely on the shoulders of the Government.  It will not be acceptable for the Government to shrug their shoulders and say that the matter is out of their hands and that it is now up to the examiner and the courts.  There are many questions which must be answered and my colleague, Deputy Bruton, and others will deal with them on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The collapse of the Goodman enterprise poses a major problem for Ireland and for all those employed by the group. Nothing short of total commitment by the Government, who caused most of the problems, will satisfy the people.</P>

      <P>Larry Goodman's reign <Col N="2119" /> might be over but we all hope that the Goodman empire will be maintained, that the examiner will sell it off as a series of going concerns and that the overall enterprise will continue.  It is important that the industry as we know it is retained. This whole episode reminds me of a dancehall brawl where the big fellow is knocked down and every gurrier in the place wants to put the boot in.</P>
      <P>Larry Goodman has done more for the beef industry and for agriculture than any other individual since the foundation of the State, and let anybody try to contradict me on that.  Next to the Taoiseach, and Deputy Liam Lawlor, I probably know the man better than anybody else in this Assembly.  He is a tough hard-headed businessman.  He has brought agriculture and the beef industry out of the 19th century and into the 20th century. He has created an empire which employs 2,500 people and processes 40 per cent of the beef here, and he has raised farm incomes enormously.</P>
      <P>In the mid-seventies when we joined the EC, the catchcry was that we should keep the jobs at home and stop exporting cattle on the hoof.  That is exactly what Larry Goodman has done.  When we joined the EC, 70 per cent of Irish beef was exported as live cattle.  Today the amount exported is as low as 2 or 3 per cent of the total.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The crisis in the beef industry, resulting in this rushed emergency legislation, did not develop because of <Col N="2120" /> the Gulf crisis, of mad cow disease or of Larry Goodman's incompetent investment decisions.  These were certainly all contributing factors.  The real roots of the crisis lie in the long-term neglect, complacency, ineptitude and craven private sector policies of consecutive conservative Governments in the agriculture and food sectors.</P>
      <P>First, Irish agriculture is dangerous and over specialised.  Beef, along with milk, makes up 70 per cent of total farm output, whereas before the much vaunted CAP these two commodities made up less than 40 per cent.  This concentration arose because price support policies favoured sectors like beef which need high acreage and capital-intensive farming.  Not only has Government policy allowed an unhealthy concentration on just two commodities, they happened to be commodities which favour larger, ranch-style corporate farming.</P>
      <P>Second, Irish beef production is highly seasonal, six times more seasonal than the rest of the EC.  Forty-six per cent of cattle are killed in one three month period of the year resulting in over reliance on intervention, workers being put on short time and under-utilisation of factories.  Because we did not invest in full year beef production, we set ourselves up for major economic problems in the event that something went wrong in the beef trade during the slaughtering season.  Now it has.</P>
      <P>In 1987, the Fianna Fáil Government invested considerable resources in the beef sector.  This made sense since our food production was being wasted in live exports and intervention.  However, even at this stage, policy planners should have sensed the long term signals.  EC beef production was getting out of control while consumers were eating less beef. While the beef sector should be developed, it was wrong to make this the long-term focus of Irish agriculture since it was in slow decline.  Agricultural expansion cannot primarily be based on the beef sector in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government entrusted the development of the beef sector to Larry <Col N="2121" /> Goodman and his many incestuous companies. Export credit insurance covered Goodman's risks in developing Middle Eastern markets.  In return Goodman made a deal with the IDA.  Where is that deal today?  Larry Goodman agreed, in return for the taxpayers' underwriting of his business risks, to invest in the beef sector.  This meant a £260 million investment in the beef industry, including the construction and modernisation of processing factories.</P>
    <P>In no time at all Goodman reneged on his part of the agreement.  He took his massive profits, subsidised by taxpayers' money, and ploughed them into foreign food and property companies, property speculation and a host of other disastrous investments.  Goodman landed the State with a liability of £110 million under the insurance scheme even while he was engaging in fraudulent practice by using non-Irish beef.  The IDA plan was thrown out the window.</P>

    <P>The Government's policy was not only in tatters, it had created a monster which <Col N="2122" /> was out of control.  The Government had no comeback on Mr. Goodman because of the method of subsidy &mdash; underwriting foreign trade without any conditions attached.  The Government could not influence the company's policy, their investments or profits.  These profits, resulting from taxpayers' subsidies, should have been ploughed back into the Irish economy and agriculture.  Instead, they went to amass a personal empire for one individual.</P>
    <P>Given that the Government were putting so much store by Mr. Goodman, it is amazing that they never required financial details of his companies &mdash; something that occurs under ordinary grant-aid applications.  Indeed, so fanatical was Mr. Goodman about the secrecy of his corporate information that he removed the limited liability of his companies. Even without such financial details the Government should have been alarmed at the dangerous concentration of beef processing in the hands of, effectively, one person.  A minimum of 40 per cent of beef processing is controlled by Goodman, amounting to 3 per cent of GNP.  Another concern should have been the dependence on unstable Middle Eastern markets, namely, three countries, which make up over 40 per cent of all foreign beef trade.</P>
    <P>The resulting crisis developed from over-dependence of agriculture on the beef sector, over-dependence of beef production on one three-month period every year, over-dependence of the beef industry on one company, indeed on one individual, and over-dependence on exports to just three unstable national markets.</P>
    <P>This is the economic anarchy of the private marketplace.  It has nothing to do with developing the industry, nothing to do with the creation of jobs or national wealth, but everything to do with rewarding the most vicious, unscrupulous players in the game.  The Government have not only tolerated this Russian roulette with the beef industry, they have openly participated in it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party consistently opposed the Government's propping up of the <Col N="2123" /> Goodman business empire.  Because we exposed the special favouritism shown to Mr. Goodman by Fianna Fáil Ministers, Labour TDs had threats made against them by Mr. Goodman and his representatives. This bullying and thuggery shows Goodman to be the ugly face of Irish capitalism.</P>
    <P>Goodman, whose profits came courtesy of the taxpayers, makes disastrous investments.  He cons bankers into giving him more credit to make even further disastrous investments.  One mess-up with a shipment in Iraq and the entire beef sector stands at the precipice.  The Government's response is to rush through a Bill to protect Mr. Goodman from his creditors and the beef trade from anarchy.</P>
    <P>However, the principle of this Bill should be welcomed.  Companies who experience short-term temporary difficulties should be given protection from parasitic sharp-practiced financial interests, many of whom are only looking for the slightest opportunity to move in on a company, close them down, strip their assets and make the workers redundant. In this instance, the workers and industrialists have a common interest against finance capital.  Anything that protects such companies, their commercial activity and their jobs is welcome.</P>
    <P>However, to what extent can Goodman avail of this legislation to continue trading?  The Goodman operation is financially unsound.  His debts are considerably greater than his assets.  He is insolvent.  It is also clear that the company need a further £200 million cash injection if farmers are to be paid and beef processed for the market.  Protection from creditors will not create this cash.</P>
    <P>The court, under this legislation, may find it has no option but to call in a receiver.  While insolvent companies should not receive preferential treatment, the scenario I have outlined could defeat the purpose of this legislation which is to give breathing space to a company to allow them to be re-structured, thus saving jobs and output.  If, at the end of the day, a receiver has to <Col N="2124" /> be called in, it would not be the public interest which would receive priority, but the interests of the creditors.  This could have disastrous consequences for the beef industry.</P>
    <P>What lessons can be drawn from this disastrous state of affairs?  First, we must never again allow such a vital economic interest to be determined solely by one company or one individual.  Never again should our economy be held hostage by private sector forces whose only concern is to maximise profit without regard to wider social interests.  The Government should use public enterprise, equity arrangements, conditional grant-aiding, trade union participation, regulation and IDA monitoring &mdash; a number of measures &mdash; to ensure the private sector is held publicly accountable.</P>
    <P>Secondly, they must consider legislation to give power to oversee controlled liquidation of enterprises of strategic national importance.  For instance, if the Goodman empire went into receivership it could have a disastrous effect on the beef sector.  Liquidation controlled by the Government could ensure, for example, that the meat processing industry of the Goodman empire is retained within the State and that jobs and output are maintained. Liquidation at the request of creditors could only take into acount their own interest, not the national interest or the interests of farmers.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Government must introduce wide ranging legislation to force greater disclosure of corporate information. Goodman got away with so much because he was able to hide so much from the State, from the taxpayers, from his bankers and creditors.  Fuller information is not only vital for the successful functioning of markets but it is necessary so that the State and private individuals can fully assess the risk of business and economic investment.</P>
    <P>If the Government believe this legislation will somehow tide us over this crisis they should think again.  The rot in the beef industry, this saga of deception, fraud, greed, incompetence and complacency, will stay with us for a long time to come.  It is not too late to make a <Col N="2125" /> radical reappraisal of Government policy in the beef sector but they must not cod themselves into thinking that market forces will somehow magically right all wrongs.  It is the same forces that have brought us here today and if we allow this to continue we will be back again very soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our party take no responsibility for the specific legislation that is being introduced here today.  It is legislation which is drawn from a Companies Bill and of all 11 Parts of the Companies Bill, this Part, Part IX, has been most roundly condemned by the professionals involved in company law as being inadequately drafted and likely to lead to immense delays, to immense dispute where there should be compromise and to cause serious uncertainty as far as the credit rating of all companies is concerned, in so far as securities previously capable of being relied upon can no longer be relied upon.  This Part is most subject to criticism of all the sections of the Companies Bill which have been going through the special committee.</P>
      <P>The fact that such ill-prepared legislation should be rushed through in one day is something for which the Government owe us a serious explanation.  They have not given a sufficiently frank or full explanation as to why it is necessary that this legislation be rushed through in these circumstances.  It is not clear that this legislation is in any way capable of dealing with the problems of the Goodman Group which have received so much publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this legislation the examiner has no funds to meet day-to-day expenses. To say that the largest beef processing company in this country could be run by an examiner who does not have any day-to-day funds at a time when the maximum amount of cattle have to be supplied, killed and paid for on the day is ludicrous. The Minister has given no indication whatever as to where the money will come from to fund the examiner's operation. If there is no money available to fund the examiner's operation in buying <Col N="2126" /> the beef, then this legislation is quite literally irrelevant to the position of the company.  There is no justification for rushing it through this House on the basis implied that it would solve the problem when it is clear it cannot solve the problem because money has to be paid tomorrow for cattle to be supplied tomorrow.</P>
    <P>If farmers are not certain that they will be paid they will not supply their cattle and if they do not supply their cattle to the 40 per cent of the capacity controlled by the Goodman Group, all the cattle will have to be supplied to the remaining processors.  It is obvious that for the three week killing period of the entire beef processing year that the remaining residue, 60 per cent killing capacity, is not sufficient.  Farmers will be faced with supplying an examiner in respect of whom they have no certainty that he will be able to pay them, or waiting in a long queue to get their cattle killed in another processing plant, for whose facilities the demand is far too great.  I have not been convinced that this legislation, which has many other defects to which I will refer, will solve the problem and if it cannot solve the problem it should not be rushed through here today.</P>
    <P>The Companies Bill being considered today could have the effect of preventing the natural growth of other Irish based companies on the international scene. One of the objectives of Irish industrial policy encouraged by the Telesis report has been to encourage the growth of Irish based companies on the international scene, strong Irish indigenous companies. If the Bill is passed unamended it may become much more difficult for other companies based in Ireland to borrow money internationally at favourable terms than it would be for other competitor companies in their sector based elsewhere to borrow money from the same banks.  This will be particularly so for companies who wish to give security as the basis for getting money from those foreign banks.  This legislation makes security given in return for loans markedly less valuable than it was in the past because securities can be set aside by direction of a court, without guidance <Col N="2127" /> from the Oireachtas, under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The effect of this Bill will be in certain circumstances to set aside securities given for loans by Irish companies to banks here and overseas.  This Bill allows secured creditors, who up to now could count on their security, to be overruled and have a compromise forced upon them.  Under this Bill if a simple majority of any one class agree to a scheme of compromise, not a simple majority of all the creditors but a simple majority of any one class of creditors &mdash; perhaps a small class of unsecured creditors who are going to get nothing anyway under a normal liquidation &mdash; all the other classes of creditors who object to the compromise can have their rights set aside.  One result of this will be that banks will simply be much less likely to lend money on the basis of security granted by Irish companies to other Irish companies who are carrying on their business in a normal way.</P>
    <P>The people who will be paying for the crisis will be those who find that they will not be able to borrow money, or if they do borrow money will have to borrow it at higher interest rates, for one reason only &mdash; that they are Irish companies operating under this legislation under which securities can be set aside in a fashion that is not possible in any other country in Europe.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries about legislative provisions in other European countries in regard to similar schemes of arrangements where creditors' rights can be set aside and they are far more restrictive than anything proposed in today's Bill. Ireland and Luxembourg are the only countries in Europe which allow a simple majority of creditors to agree to the imposition of a scheme of arrangements on all the other creditors.  In France there must be a two-thirds majority of the creditors, in Italy two-thirds majority, the Netherlands three-quarters, in Germany three-quarters, in the United Kingdom three-quarters, in Belgium two-thirds, while in Denmark 60 per cent of the creditors must agree to any imposition of <Col N="2128" /> a forced settlement.  In Ireland all you need is a simple majority, not even of all the creditors but of one class of the creditors, and that can be imposed.  The banks are watching this.  Banks are lending large amounts of money to Irish companies at the moment.  As soon as this legislation is passed, those banks will say, &ldquo;Sorry, we must have a substantial risk premium on the interest rate you are paying us now to take account of the fact that you might decide to avail of this Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1990 and the security which we had been counting on up to now can no longer be counted upon.&rdquo;  That means that ordinary Irish companies which are trading properly and effectively and doing their job right exporting may well have to pay higher interest rates which they do not deserve to pay, and which they ought not have to pay, simply and solely because of this rushed, ill-digested, ill-considered legislation.</P>
    <P>This legislation is only being brought in by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, as window dressing to keep the Taoiseach, who is personally concerned about individuals who may otherwise be affected, happy. The Minister has dreamed this up so that, on the day, it may look as if it will solve the problem.  He knows it will not solve the problem, probably, the Taoiseach now knows it will not solve the problem, but we have been called back to put this bad legislation through so that the Minister for Industry and Commerce can give the appearance to the Taoiseach that he is doing something about the problem.</P>
    <P>I understand a majority of the people are not too unhappy to see banks suffering for their mistakes.  Indeed, much could be said in favour of passing legislation such as this on a European scale to prevent banks taking too much in security, but it seems to be commercially ill-advised to pass legislation such as this in one small country in Europe which is competing with the rest where banks enjoy much greater protection.  This is certainly something we should not do as a panic reaction to particular events for the sake of appearances in Cabinet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2129" /> There is another problem.  This legislation will be applied to debts which were agreed to before it was passed, in other words, people who loaned money to companies under the Companies Act, 1963, may now find they cannot get their money back because it is subject to legislation passed since they granted the loans.  Essentially, that is retrospective confiscation of their rights.  A bank in giving a secured loan to a company acquires a property right.  The Dáil is now saying to those who acquired a property right under one piece of legislation that under the new legislation we are introducing in one day that property right may be redeemed arbitrarily under circumstances which were changed after the event.  I do not believe any bank would agree to that.</P>
    <P>Introducing retroactive legislation of that kind will not do wonders for our credit rating.  We may not like the fact that this country is proportionately one of the biggest debtors in Europe or we have to do so much business with banks on a day to day basis, but I wonder what effect it will have on the borrowing policies internationally of the Minister for Finance.  If those banks can find in relation to money they have advanced to private Irish companies that the terms of the loan can be radically changed as far as the securities are concerned, will there not be a question mark in the back of their minds that if the heat is on, the Government may decide to apply a similar measure to money they had loaned to the Government?</P>
    <P>Is it possible for example, that the ESB, who have borrowed substantial sums of money benefiting from State guarantees if they found they could not repay it, might decide to avail of the Companies Act, 1990?  If that is the case, what would be the value of State guarantees?  Could they be set aside?</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from this Bill that it will be open to a court to set aside third party guarantees as part of a reconstruction of a company; in other words, not only is the company being protected but anybody who gave a guarantee to the company could have their guarantees set <Col N="2130" /> aside by the court if it so decides on criteria we have not been told.  It is quite possible under this legislation that the court could decide to set aside a Government guarantee of the debts of the ESB as part of a scheme of arrangements sought by the ESB.  I do not understand why there is any need to protect those who have given third party guarantees because they are not affected; they are not insolvent.  Why should they be protected as well as the company under the legislation, and yet this legislation fights for that.</P>
    <P>This legislation is not the same as Chapter XI in the United States legislation which makes provision for delays but where a creditors' committee is in control.  In Ireland the position is entirely different.  The people in control will be the courts acting under legislation which gives them no guidance as to how they should act.  Nobody knows what affect this legislation will have, or in what way judges will interpret it.  Prior to today, people knew what existing company law meant, what securities were worth and what compromises they might have to make but now we find there is no longer any certainty and it will all depend on whether Mr. Justice X or Mr. Justice Y hears your case.  It is possible Mr. Justice X may be very sympathetic to the banks whereas Mr. Justice Y is sympathetic to creditors and you do not know which of them will hear the case.  Therefore, anybody lending money to a company will need to know if the company are likely to avail of this Bill and, if so, which of the many judges in the High Court is more likely to be sympathetic to the creditors or to the banks.</P>
    <P>We are pushing through legislation containing no criteria as to how it should be applied and we are creating uncertainty. The one thing business needs is certainty, and the Legislature should be trying to create certainty, within which business can operate.  In this case it is clear no certainty is being created.  I would like to know if the Government spent the last week instructing their diplomats in countries where there was a bank which had loaned money to the Goodman <Col N="2131" /> organisation, to get on to the people in the Department of Foreign Affairs and those in the banks in the country in question to tell them to go easy as the Government were going to sort this out.  As a result, perhaps these people went easy but now they find that the situation is now far worse than it was last week.  Were Irish diplomats used to assist a private company?  Were representations made through the Department of Foreign Affairs to individual banks in foreign countries to protect this company?  We must have that information.</P>
    <P>Some say that some companies have been aware of this situation for the past two months but they did not act because of political representations from this Government.  If so, what liabilities have the Government incurred as a result of any such representations?  We have been told that Classic Meats have been claimed to be part of the assets of this organisation. If so, is this not contrary to the assurances given previously?  In this House it has been alleged that a private company has been set up overseas to avoid the provisions of unlimited liability which were used in the first place to avoid having to file accounts.  If this is the case, can the Minister give us an assurance that the powers he is taking, which are extensive, in section 8 are sufficient to ensure there will be full disclosure with regard to the truth or otherwise of the allegation made earlier in this House concerning that account?</P>
    <P>I would like to make one other serious point.  When I was Minister for Finance, I introduced section 52 of the Finance Act, 1986, the purpose of which was to ensure that a company could not claim a capital allowance to the full value of a machine if part of the cost of the machine was met by a grant; in other words, they could only claim a capital allowance for the money they put up themselves.  They could not use taxpayers money provided by the IDA as a basis for claiming further relief, I think that was unexceptional common sense legislation, yet when Fianna Fáil took office, Deputy Reynolds, the new Minister for Finance, <Col N="2132" /> introduced section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987, which stated that food production companies would be exempt from that provision, in other words, they could double claim; they could claim a tax allowance in respect of money which had already been provided by the taxpayer. Why did he do this?  Was that part of the Goodman deal which was agreed to with such aplomb by the Taoiseach and announced by him in December 1987?  If so, given that the Goodman deal did not go ahead and that none of the commitments for processing facilities was fulfilled, was that section used by this organisation?  Will we be given the information as to whether that section was used, to what extent it was used and whether it was used on the basis of any&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Furthermore, I would like to know if the Government, or any Minister, gave any assurances to the Goodman organisation that it would be all right, that export credit would be used in respect of some meat that was not exclusively Irish meat.  Did Government Ministers, prior to the revocation of the contract by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, say that would be all right, or did they know for any length of time prior to the revocation of that contract that the cover might have been used for non-Irish meat?  If they knew that, what case has the Government got to defend in regard to the allegation that they withdrew the export cover on the basis of information they already had, and which they pretended to have discovered for the first time?  We need to have that information because we need to know what exactly are the liabilities of the State in the pending court case.  If assurances were given, or if Ministers knew long before the Minister, Deputy O'Malley acted, that the <Col N="2133" /> credits were being used for that purpose then, the Government were an accomplice to the use of the credits in that way.  We need to know that and we need to know to what extent and how the taxpayer is exposed.</P>

      <P>May I say in the very short time available to me that having listened to so much vilification here today it is difficult to know what we are supposed to be discussing? The principle of what is before us seems to be headed in the right direction but there may be flaws in it because of its fast introduction.  However, what we must be concerned about is saving the facilities provided by the Goodman operations in the interests of our country &mdash; our farmers, our workers and our economy.  I do not know how that can be brought about but if this legislation gives a breathing space &mdash; I think that is all it will do &mdash; to find a solution to the dilemma and the disaster that the collapse of the Goodman structure would have on our farmers, our economy and our country, then anything that staves off such an eventuality and gives time and opportunity to find a way of salvaging the situation, must be applauded and supported by this House, even if it is attempted in inadequate time, in inadequate debate, in inadequate discussion and undermocratic procedures.</P>

    <P>Goodman is longer in the meat business than most of the Members here are in this House &mdash; only I and a few other Members have been in politics longer than he is in his business.  I hold no brief for Mr. Goodman.  I have no personal association with Mr. Goodman but, over the years I have had knowledge of his operations on a small, modest and obviously efficient scale, otherwise he could not and would not have come to the surface.  The only question I have been asking since he hit the big time is <Col N="2135" /> how was it done.  We have heard the wisdom of those who, in retrospect, can find various reasons for charging him with various operations that were not laudatory.</P>
    <P>I do not lend myself to those comments but I say that he has had a most bitter experience of a combination of circumstances, all of which have tended to bring about a situation that is bad not just for Goodman and his companies but for this country at a time when our cattle trade is already in regression, our sheep meat trade is in dire trouble, we are approaching the season of the biggest kill, the Gulf troubles are creating a big hole in our outlets and rightly or wrongly, the Minister who is here today is withholding up to £50 million that might well have been used to keep the show on the road and we would not be here today trying to salvage a company that is vitally important to us, regardless of how it was put together or how it is managed at present.</P>

However, that can be regarded in its own light; he is operating as part of a Government.  It has not helped and it could not help any company internationally trading if it were known &mdash; as it was known &mdash; that a Minister in high places &mdash; and particularly the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; was of the mind that the people running this company were not good operators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The current threat to Ireland's beef trade posed by the difficulties of Goodman International illustrates the dangers of allowing a single, privately-owned company to establish such a dominant position in one of our most important industries.  We fully acknowledge that the collapse of Goodman International would be an appalling blow not merely to farmers and those people directly employed by Goodman but also to thousands of workers in ancillary industries.</P>
      <P>The Goodman organisation is a huge concern accounting for more than 40 per cent of total beef exports from this country; probably it accounts for between 4 per cent and 6 per cent of our gross national product.  The Goodman Group have expanded at a rapid rate in recent years, acquiring several co-operatives and, along the way, gobbled up huge chunks of the food industry.  When Mr. Goodman targeted the publicly-owned Irish Sugar Company for possible takeover in 1988 and 1989 my thoughts at that time were that the likelihood was that the only man who would own anything here would be Mr. Larry Goodman.  We have noted that the Irish Sugar Company have consolidated their position while the difficulties of the Goodman Group have led to the Dáil being recalled to rescue that company.  Any assistance provided by the Government, with the aim of aiding Goodman International, should be conditional on the company publishing fully audited accounts for recent years and on Mr. Goodman making available his personal assets in any rescue operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to alleviate the acute difficulties being experienced by our cattle farmers the immediate priority must be to secure alternative markets for our beef which, in normal circumstances, would <Col N="2137" /> be going to Iraq.  The Ministers for Agriculture and Food and Industry and Commerce, along with CBF and Coras Tráchtála, should establish an emergency working group to seek alternative outlets for our beef in other parts of the world. Indeed, I wonder why Deputy Deasy, when Minister for Agriculture, did not endeavour to have our beef exported under a brand name.  Had he done so we would not be encountering problems now with countries such as Iran and Egypt with our beef being sold abroad under an English brand name.</P>
    <P>There is a number of lessons to be learned from the present crisis and which need to be addressed in the long-term. First, the Government should take appropriate steps to ensure that no single private company be allowed to secure or occupy such a dominant position in any one industry because when they run into difficulties major problems are created for our economy.</P>

      <P>Second, we should endeavour to ensure that our markets for exports of beef are spread world-wide so that any political or military crisis in any country or region will not endanger our overall industry.  Finally, I suggest we seek greater diversification in Irish agriculture so that in future we are not so dependent on single commodities such as <Col N="2138" /> beef.  I might add that four successive Ministers have failed to provide a proper agricultural export policy so that we would not have to depend on the seasonality of beef production, as is the case at present.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should emphasise that this Bill is part of a longer one which has been going through this House for some time.  As I mentioned earlier the entire Bill had almost been passed into law in this House, is now at Report Stage here and has been since the end of June.  Certainly, it had been my fervent hope that that Bill, in its entirety, would have been passed before the summer recess.  I had not expected that the committee who examined it so thoroughly would have taken such an extended period to do that.  They undertook that task well but, unfortunately, took seven-and-a-half months, entailing 21 meetings of the committee, some of which were very lengthy.  Indeed, it is worth recalling in regard to that committee that of the 11 separate Parts of the Bill, some of which were relatively short, this Part IX is the one that received least discussion.</P>

      <P>Of course, that is not so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor have I any idea whether, in any particular case, they can be successful.  I was a little taken aback to hear some of the criticisms of the Bill being made on the basis that it harmed the interests of banks in some way or that it meant that secured creditors were placed in a slightly less advantageous position than they might have been without it.  The alternative would have been not to bring forward &mdash; as was the case three years ago &mdash; legislation of this kind, to allow companies experiencing difficulties to go into receivership or liquidation. Members of the House who are now suddenly highly critical of the provisions of this Bill should contemplate the consequences of their suggestions.  I would pose the question: do they want us to leave our law as it is so that the only step open to a company or their creditors &mdash; that is a company running into some difficulties or experiencing problems in paying their debts &mdash; is to appoint a <Col N="2140" /> receiver or go into liquidation?  It has been identified for a very long time in Irish company law that one of its great weaknesses was that there was no intermediate step between normal trading, on the one hand, and receivership or liquidation, on the other, which effectively meant the demise of the company. Whatever the context I would have thought that legislation of this kind should be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton made the point &mdash; and perhaps it was a little dangerous for him to have made it &mdash; that Irish companies would now experience difficulty in raising money from international banks because these provisions exist in Irish law.  Far more difficult provisions &mdash; from the point of view of banks &mdash; exist in United States law and have been the case for a long time.  Relatively similar provisions exist in British law and I have not heard that suggestion made in regard to banks or companies in Britain. It is a rather dangerous suggestion to make that in some way banks are put at a disadvantage in lending to Irish companies. It is much healthier that Irish companies have something akin to the rights of American and British companies, to take only two examples, to rescue themselves when they are in difficulties as, inevitably, some companies will from time to time, particularly when a major external event of the kind we have seen this month occurs.  That is why the Government consider it appropriate that this legislation would be available now, instead of in a few months' time, to companies which may be facing problems arising from this major external event which, of course, we hope will not get any worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton and a number of other Deputies made the point at some length that this Bill would not be any good unless funds were available to an examiner who might be appointed under it.  Who, I wonder, does he envisage will supply these funds?  I can only assume from the context of the remarks made in the House today that most Deputies who referred to this assumed that the Exchequer should <Col N="2141" /> provide the funds.  If that is their feeling, I certainly dissent from that view&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what was suggested.  We suggested that the Bill was unworkable in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of private companies, the Exchequer should not be expected to put up sums of money because that is a road which has no end. So far as the ability of the examiner under the Bill to raise funds is concerned, it is certainly no worse than that of a receiver; in fact it is a great deal better.  It is not suggested that a receiver cannot raise funds.  We know the process of receivership and that receivers can negotiate with banks for funds to run the company in their own names.  As I said, an examiner is certainly in no worse a position than a receiver, if anything, he is in a better position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of section 10 of the Bill make it clear that if an examiner incurs liabilities during the protection period &mdash; the period while he is examiner &mdash; he can certify those liabilities as having been necessarily incurred for the benefit of the company if the company subsequently go into liquidation or receivership.  Not alone then are the moneys raised by the examiner ordinary debts of the company, they are preferential because they will rank with the examiner's expenses and those of the liquidator.  For that reason, I do not foresee examiners having any major problem in raising money to carry on the business of a company to which they may be appointed.  One would assume, in any event, that the bankers of the company concerned would have approved of the <Col N="2142" /> proposal to petition for an examiner because it is very unlikely that, without their agreement and consent, such a petition would be successfully made in most cases.  It would happen in some cases but, in most cases, as a number of Deputies mentioned, a degree of co-operation is needed between all concerned to try to ensure that the company survive and prosper.</P>
      <P>A number of allegations were made in regard to things that happened in 1987 in respect of a particular company.  It is not my function, as I have said on at least two previous occasions &mdash; perhaps three &mdash; to answer for what happened during a period when I did not hold office.  In that context it was asked what the position would be if finance was raised under the provisions of section 84 of the Finance Act and subsequently used by the person raising it for purposes other than those envisaged in the section, and perhaps envisaged by the IDA and the Revenue. It was asked if efforts would be made to recover the money on the basis that it was used for purposes other than those envisaged.  Of course that is not the way the section works but, if funds were raised under section 84 and used for purposes other than industrial investment in Ireland which would create employment as certified and recommended by the IDA, the bank will be penalised by losing the tax concession they would otherwise have got on the lending of those funds. The funds are not provided by the IDA or the State and it is a matter for the bank concerned to seek to recover the funds and any additional costs they incurred as a result of the disallowance by the Revenue of this lending under the provisions of section 84.  There is no mystery about it, that is how it is and the State is not involved.  As I said, it is recovered by the banks who loaned it in the normal way and I am sure they will do that in due course if they feel it appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Spring made the point that there was a defect in constitutional procedure in relation to this Bill.  The matter has been rechecked with the Attorney General and, according to him, <Col N="2143" /> the point raised by Deputy Spring regarding the constitutional procedures and early signature by the President is not an issue.  The involvement by the Council of State does not arise under the procedure being used under Article 25 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett and Connaughton asked about beef market prospects this autumn.  I already dealt with that this morning in some detail but I will say a few further words in regard to it.</P>
    <P>In so far as the beef industry is concerned the intention is to enable the orderly marketing of cattle during the critical autumnal peak slaughtering period when some 650,000 to 700,000 cattle will be slaughtered.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food is continuing his close contact with the Community Commissioner for Agriculture to ensure that the Community price support mechanisms are applied in such a way as to ensure a way as to sustain cattle prices to Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>It is difficult in the present circumstances to see any considerable outlets on the market.  This is due mainly to the reduction in the demand for beef in the Community, especially in the UK, the embargo on trade with Iraq and the more general difficulties in exporting to Iran and Egypt due to the BSE scare.  In previous years over 200,000 cattle were exported after slaughter to the Middle East.  On the assumption that these markets will not take any significant quantities of beef from this year's autumnal production, even if we succeed in having the Iranian and Egyptian markets reopened, the main outlet will have to be the European Community safety net intervention purchases.  Since these are made at a fixed price they will sustain cattle prices to our farmers.  It is the Government's intention to ensure that confidence is retained in the beef industry's ability to slaughter cattle this autumn in an orderly manner which also sustains cattle prices to farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton also questioned whether the Bill would provide preferential status to farmers in the selling of cattle.  That, of course, has to do with the winding-up question rather than with the questions we have here. What we are dealing with here today is a company which is not being wound-up or put into receivership: it is in contrast to that &mdash; we are putting forward a procedure which will enable companies to avoid receivership or winding-up.  The Bill does not deal with liquidations.  That is a matter which could be raised, as I understand it was, on the general Companies Bill which I hope to be back with as early as possible in the autumn for its Report and Final Stages.</P>

      <P>A great deal of detailed questions were asked about specific sections, particular words, etc., in the Bill. I think it is better if I do not try to deal with those now but leave them to Committee Stage.  We will have a relatively long Committee Stage &mdash; seven hours &mdash; and it should be possible to deal with most of this Bill during that time.  I will answer the detailed questions on the sections, particular wording and so on at that time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett made the case &mdash; I must say I have some sympathy with the point he is making &mdash; that this procedure can be very expensive for small companies. I believe it will be too expensive for very small companies but unfortunately it is necessary at the moment to have these sort of applications made in the High Court.  I am looking at the possibility of having them made in the Circuit Court but that is not altogether satisfactory particularly during vacation periods which are quite lengthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious, from looking at the Bill as a whole, that the number of potential references to the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; is rather higher than I would like it to be and I will see if we can devise a means whereby we can cut out some of the less necessary references to the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; in order to reduce the cost.  There is no question of these references to the court causing delay because the whole thing has to end within a maximum of four months and one cannot have the kind of delay one has, for example, in the United States. While on the one hand criticism is made of all these references to the court, on <Col N="2146" /> the other hand the very fairness and independence of the system proposed in this Bill is underlined by these constant references to the court.  It will not be possible, for example, for a company to bully their way through a period of protection under this Bill and get their way by sheer force or by influencing the examiner. Everything in the last resort will have to be approved by the court.  Therefore, I am not anxious to remove the court from too many steps.  It is one of these balances which has to be struck and sought to be maintained.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with many of the more general points which have been made.  I will leave the other points to the Committee Stage.  I understand 39 Opposition amendments have been put down to the Bill.  Because the Bill incorporates all the amendments made at the Special Committee and because I have a very small staff who will have to try to consider these amendments can I suggest to the House that instead of an interval until 3 p.m. we adjourn until 3.30 p.m.?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As you will observe, Sir, the section we are dealing with is a definition section of this Bill and as it stands the Bill defines only the creditors and shareholders of a company as &ldquo;interested parties&rdquo; who are entitled to appear at court hearings.  The amendment I am proposing includes representatives of the employees in that company in the definition. The definition of &ldquo;employees' representatives&rdquo; is based on that contained in the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, and I will be submitting to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it would be far more appropriate to include that wider definition rather than the definition in the Bill as it stands. The amendment also provides that the definition of &ldquo;collective redundancies&rdquo; set out in the 1977 Act shall apply to this Bill.  The minimum number of redundancies required by the definition varies with the size of the workforce.  In an establishment normally employing 21 to 49 employees collective redundancies take place where at least five are dismissed within 30 days, at least ten in an establishment employing 50 to 99, at least 10 per cent in an establishment employing 100 to 299 and at least 30 persons where 300 or more persons are employed.  I say to the Minister in relation to the first amendment that it would be far wiser and far more in keeping with the trends in relation to the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, that we allow the wider protection to be given in the course of the passage of this Bill.  I will find it very hard to understand any objections put forward by the Minister or any argument to support any objections, because the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, has served us well and is now well established. I believe we should try to stick to the present situation and that is what I will be asking in this case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 16 in relation to section 16 of the Bill, I am proposing that we should insert five additional paragraphs into the section as follows:</P>
      <P> (a) For the purposes of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, the examiner of a company shall be deemed to be the employer of the employees of that company.</P>
      <P>(b) Collective redundancies shall not be effected in respect of a company under the protection of the court other than by the examiner and with the leave of the court.</P>
      <P>(c) The employees' representatives shall be entitled to be heard by the court on any application under paragraph (b) for the creation of collective redundancies.</P>
      <P>(d) The appointment of an examiner to a company shall constitute a transfer of the undertaking of that company for the purposes of the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980, and the provisions of those Regulations shall apply to such appointment accordingly. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the very crucial aspects of this legislation which has not been dealt with in any detail on Second Stage is the matters which the examiner must report upon when he goes before the court.  I believe it is extremely important, given the background to the problems in particularly the beef sector, that the examiner should state whether information or circumstances have come to his attention in the course of the performance of his functions under the Bill from which it appears to him that any past or present officer or any member of a company may be guilty of an offence in relation to the company for which the person will be criminally liable.  This assimilates an examiner to the position of a liquidator who would be obliged to report to the <Col N="2151" /> Director of Public Prosecutions in similar circumstances.  Secondly, he must report whether in his opinion the whole or any part of the undertaking of the company will be more likely to survive if any or all the directors or other officers of the company are removed from office or any member of the company is required to dispose of his shares.  Thirdly, he must report whether in his opinion proper books of account have been kept by the company and have been made available to him for his inspection and whether he has by act or omission been obstructed or hindered in the performance of his functions under the Bill by any officer or member of the company.  Fourthly, he must report whether it appears to him that any transaction was entered into by the company during a period in which they were unlikely to be able to pay their debts as they fell due for payment in circumstances which were prejudicial to the interest of creditors of the company. Finally, it is very important that the examiner also report on the steps, if any, taken by him in the discharge of the duties imposed on him by the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.  Perhaps the most important aspect of this legislation, given the role and the absolute powers the examiner is going to have, is that we should consider ensuring that the examiner has detailed wide powers and is able to examine and investigate the matters which are referred to in this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my error and I <Col N="2152" /> regret that.  Amendment No. 16 relates to section 9 and deals with a company's position under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.  We are imposing procedural obligations on employers who propose to create collective redundancies. The purpose of the 1977 Act is to ensure that where an employer dismisses a number of employees within a specified period he must consult with the employees' representatives and notify the relevant State authorities of the impending redundancies.  The amendment provides that in relation to a company under the protection of the court the examiner shall be deemed to be the employer of the company's employees for the purposes of the 1977 Act and that collective redundancies can be created only with the leave of the court after the employees' representatives have been heard on the question.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment, it is extremely important that employees have their rights protected.  In the past when liquidators and receivers were appointed to companies, employees were treated harshly and had little by way of recourse to the decision-making that took place.  They would have little recourse to the decision making of an examiner carrying out his function.  It is important to give them every possible protection and bring this into line with the 1977 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it impossible to accept these amendments.  I do not think they are necessary or in the interests of the employee.  It would alter the status of the employees from being employees of the company, which is a continuing company, and bring their employment by the company to an end and then start up a new employment with the examiner. Under the terms of the Bill the longest period they could be employed for by the examiner is four months whereas they might have had ten or 20 years service with the company.  It would be very much to their advantage to remain employees of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not really an analogy in this instance between a company in respect of which an examiner is appointed and a <Col N="2153" /> company to which a receiver or liquidator is appointed because the company, to all intents and purposes, comes to an end when they go into receivership or liquidation due to insolvency.  The whole point of this legislation is to keep the company in existence.  There is no point in putting all the obligations proposed in amendment No. 16 onto the examiner. The obligations, in so far as they exist, exist as against the company.  The examiner is not there in lieu of the company. He is there to supervise the company and direct them if necessary.  Legally the company do not go out of existence.  They continue to trade under the examiner's supervision.  Therefore, whatever rights exist should, in the employees' interests, continue to exist as against the company and not as against the examiner.  As it is not in their interests I cannot accept it. It would put an unnecessary burden on the examiner which would not be of benefit to anyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the redundancies would have to have the leave of the court.  One of the problems with the Bill is that there are too many references to the court in it.  The court will be involved in deciding a number of questions and as a result various notices and so on will have to be served which will cause delays.  It would be better if it could be dealt with in a package rather than each individually being the subject of a court decision.  I am not certain that the interests of employees would be served by having relatively small numbers of redundancies out of a larger workforce being agreed not through the normal process of collective bargaining with unions but after a court hearing.  In many cases the survival of a company depends on speedy and flexible decision-making. There is a difficulty with involving the court in an industrial relations matter. Trade unions have been reluctant to see the courts involved in industrial relations. If that is the case, it would be inconsistent to bring the court into this dimension of industrial relations.  I can see that it might be better from the point of view of the <Col N="2154" /> employees to rely on their representatives. This is all the more reason to encourage workers to be represented by a trade union rather than relying on court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the Minister's reply in relation to the first amendment and to the fact that we are proposing that employees be considered to be interested parties.  I am worried that employees have no access to the court.  We are trying to widen the scope of the Bill so that employees can gain access to the court. Will the Minister respond to the idea of giving employees, and their representatives, access to the court in the same way as creditors and members of the company have such access?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>An employee has access to the court under the main provisions of the Bill, in section 3 (1) (c) where an employee can, if he so chooses, be a petitioner.  There are other provisions in the Bill which enable him to be consulted in regard to a proposal that is put up by way of compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Spring referred to employees as an interested party and I put down an amendment which seeks after line 17 to have them specifically referred to as such but that does not appear to have been included.  Perhaps there is a good explanation for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to seek to have collective redundancies defined and to have assigned to it the meaning provided for in the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.  I cannot see any reason the Minister would not take that on board.  The purpose of the 1977 Act was to give greater protection to groups of workers confronted by redundancy. It ensures that their representatives would be given at least some notice of impending collective redundancies. I do not agree that that Act has operated very satisfactorily.  In fact, it has operated very unsatisfactorily in a great many situations, largely because the penalty applying is completely inadequate. The companies that effected wholesale <Col N="2155" /> or collective redundancies have found themselves enabled to do so without observing the provisions of the Act, purely because the penalties applying are minimal.</P>
    <P>That does not, however, affect the point that Deputy Spring is seeking to make which relates to the definition to be attached to collective redundancies.  If it has done nothing else, the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, has at least assigned a definition, and that definition means that dismissal for redundancy reasons over any period of 30 consecutive days at least, is defined in relation to the number of employees in the particular employment, for example, five persons in an employment normally employing more than 20 or fewer than 50 employees, ten persons in an establishment normally employing at least 50 but fewer than 100 employees, 10 per cent of the employees in an establishment normally employing at least 100 but fewer than 300 employees, and so on.  I cannot see why, in this definition area of the Bill, the Minister would not agree to take this on board.  It is merely assigning a definition that is well established to the term &ldquo;collective redundancies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 16 I might be persuaded by the Minister that it is not desirable that the examiner should be the employer as prescribed in paragraph (a).  After that, however, the remaining paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) have a great deal of merit, particularly paragraphs (b) and (c).  In a situation where there is a provision that collective redundancies cannot be effected in respect of a particular company under the protection of the court other than by the examiner and with the leave of the court, that is desirable and it is proper that the employees' representatives should be seen to be heard in respect of any such application.</P>

      <P>I would submit to Deputies Spring and Rabbitte that perhaps the problem is dealt with in section 17 (2) (c) where the final proposal is made that any interested party can be heard. That clearly would include employees. Deputy Rabbitte had amendment No. 26 down to make that more explicit by adding &ldquo;(c) an employee acting solely or through his or her trade union&rdquo;.  I would suggest that that probably provides sufficient access to the courts in cases that cannot be settled adequately through collective bargaining without bringing in the courts at an earlier stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;court&rsquo; shall have the meaning assigned to it by section 2 of the Principal Act, save that the President of the High Court may, if he deems fit, establish within the High Court a specialised court for dealing with commercial matters;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both this morning and during the course of the debate in this special committee I <Col N="2157" /> made the point that the many references to the courts in this Bill could lead to high costs and that ultimately fewer small companies would avail of the opportunities afforded by this legislation.  The Bill as presented did not, unfortunately, take into account the suggestions that the Circuit Court should deal with these issues.  We have decided, therefore, to table this amendment to give the President of the High Court, if he should deem fit, powers to establish, within the High Court, a specialised court for dealing with commercial matters.</P>
    <P>There is precedent for having specialised courts.  We have family courts which means that marital disputes can be dealt with outside the normal court atmosphere. We should remember that this legislation is about trying to get a consensus among various interested parties, so the less formal the proceedings are the better the opportunity to get that consensus.  It is also important that there is consistency as a result of those hearing the cases being <i>au fait</i> with company law language and having an insight into the realities of commercial life and a greater prospect of having the same judge dealing with a case from beginning to end.</P>
    <P>I fear that the Bill as presented will lead to different judges hearing the case when an examiner has to go to court. That would be detrimental to the whole procedure.  Looking at the affairs of a particular company is a difficult enough process.  It would be impossible if different judges dealt with individual hearings. If this is to remain within the High Court, I believe it is in the interests of companies and in the interests of employment and investment here that the President of the High Court would have powers to establish a &ldquo;company court&rdquo; or a court dealing with commercial matters.</P>
    <P>In his reply to the Second Stage debate, the Minister recognised the point consistently made by Deputy Bruton and me that there is continuous reference to the courts here.  Not alone is resorting to the courts expensive, it is time consuming, and in situations like this time is of the essence.  I was glad to hear the Minister say he was looking at ways and means of <Col N="2158" /> eliminating such frequent mention of the courts and recognised that this could lead to a high level of expense.</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment I am asking the Minister to accept the bona fides of our argument and I would ask my colleagues on this side of the House to support our request which I think is a valid one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address the amendment in the names of Deputies Barrett and Bruton before moving to amendment No. 9.  While they both relate to the courts, they are quite distinct in their direction.  I would support the amendment put forward by Deputies Barrett and Bruton, in particular the <i>raison d'être</i> in bringing forward this section of the Companies Bill.</P>
      <P>The courts and the examiner are going to find themselves in a huge undertaking, a huge court of inquiry, the likes of which we have never seen in this State.  In that respect, and in relation to the already over-burdened situation in our High Court, it would be extremely important that in this instance the President of the High Court would be allowed to assign a specialist judge, indeed to have a specialist court.</P>
      <P>We have heard many references today to the weaknesses in our company law and it is being said in defence of this section that it has been referred to many times as an area of major weakness in company law that there is no limbo between difficulties and receivership or liquidation.  It is extremely important that we, as quickly as possible, allow a specialist court to be established.  As a former practitioner, I say that all judges would have competence in these matters but some would specialise in the area of company law which, as we will discover in the course of the afternoon, is extremely technical and requires specialist knowledge &mdash; not just specialist knowledge in an academic sense but also in terms of day-to-day involvement with the practical working of companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support amendment No. 2 and ask the Minister to give it consideration <Col N="2159" /> because it has tremendous merit in the context of the difficulties that the courts face on a day-to-day basis and it would be a far more pragmatic way to deal with our business if we were to provide for a specialist court.  We will need a specialist court to deal with the scale of the problems that it now looks certain the examiner and the court will have to face in the first referral under this Bill, if it is passed by the House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of this amendment.  The most compelling argument is the one with regard to expense.  The Minister has conceded in his response to the Second Stage debate that, as is the case with Chapter XI in the United States, it is the really big players that will be able to afford to avail of this mechanism.  Having regard to the fact that there are very few such companies in this country, we are introducing a mechanism here that will prove too expensive for them to avail of.</P>
      <P>I have agonised quite a bit on this point, which I understand Deputy Bruton raised this morning.  On the one hand, it seems to be a very sensible and good thing to have a mechanism enshrined in company law which forestalls financial institutions foreclosing on viable companies which have a temporary difficulty. That seems to me to be a very sensible measure and worthy of support.  I notice in reading the minutes of the debate of the special committee that the Minister's deputy put forward the argument that this had broad support from the business community.  Since this row blew up, I have had representations from a broad cross section of the business community to argue a different point of view, which I would like to hear the Minister address, to the effect that it is not so simple to import a mechanism that is suitable to the American economy into the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the United States the majority of companies trade within the borders of the United States and raise their loan capital from the domestic market.  That is not the case here.  The <Col N="2160" /> major international trading companies here have to raise their money from the foreign banks.  Now that the law has changed, where previously some of those foreign banks were prepared to extend unsecured credit, will they no longer be prepared to do so or will they be a lot more rigid in the terms they will apply? I would like to hear the Minister comment on that in terms of whether it will lead to a tightening of credit, which in turn could have an impact on interest rates and so on.</P>
    <P>As somebody who frequently experienced at first hand in the early eighties the receivership phenomenon and liquidation, on balance I think that this is a sensible mechanism to give respite to companies which otherwise might face the prospect of receivership or liquidation, but will the majority of Irish companies be able to afford to avail of it? The thrust of this amendment to cause a special court to be set up would at least allow access to the court and allow the use of this mechanism to be available less expensively to companies who consider they are in need of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 2 on the basis that it is purely a permissive provision.  It allows the High Court to set up such a court if the High Court thinks that is sensible.  It does not bind the High Court to it.  It is a practical amendment designed to give maximum flexibility.  In the same vein, I support Deputy Spring's amendment which again allows the High Court a discretion in certain cases to remit a case to the Circuit Court.  Given that there is an inherent flexibility in both of these provisions, I hope they can be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak on amendment No. 9 and I will be very brief.  On many occasions in the past, the Minister referred to worries about this aspect, namely, the enormous cost of litigation. It is important in the context of this legislation where facilities are being provided that we should also provide for small companies and businesses.  For <Col N="2161" /> every large business or industry that get into difficulties, you can be sure there are also small companies getting into difficulties. Small companies whose total liabilities do not exceed £25,000 should not have to incur the enormous expense of facing into an application to the High Court.</P>
      <P>The Minister expressed some worries in relation to the long vacations of the Circuit Court but it would be quite practicable, with the co-operation of the Circuit Court, to provide for a facility where the Circuit Court could meet and applications could be made to Circuit Court judges whenever necessary, whether in session or during vacation.  I do feel it is necessary when we are providing this new facility in company law that we also consider small companies which are threatened with difficulties but because of liabilities of less than £25,000 could not face the option of going to the High Court.  I would urge the Minister to give this consideration, which he seemed to accept in principle this morning.</P>

Amendment No. 9, as drafted, would not be of much use as I do not think they would bother about it, be it in the High Court or the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 2, we went over much of this ground at the special committee when I undertook to look at the idea of trying to bring in the Circuit Court.  We could do this by changing the definition of &ldquo;court&rdquo; in the 1963 Act or at least that is what I intended at that time when I assumed, as did the committee, that the whole of the 1987 Bill would be taken together.  That is under consideration and it was proposed to put down an amendment on Report Stage to be taken at the end of October when we were satisfied about it but given the speed of events in recent times that has not yet proved possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept amendment No. 2, even if I were happy about the principle, <Col N="2162" /> because one cannot establish a court if a particular judge deems fit.  One would have to produce him in court to prove that he deemed fit.  A court can only be established by an Act of the Oireachtas and not at the whim of an individual judge.  I am a bit loath to have a specialised court or a division of a court because the first thing it would lead to is a demand for more judges and staff, fellows with wigs to walk in front of them and carry their staffs or whatever they do.  The thing works quite well in practice because in effect there is a number of judges who are the commercial division of the High Court.  At present Mr. Justice Costello plus one or two others deal with all these cases.  They are very experienced and very good on these matters.  Therefore we have it in practice and we should not set it up separately by statute.  Certainly, we could not do it on the basis that the President of the High Court from time to time may deem it fit.  That would not be an appropriate way of doing it.</P>
    <P>Because I am anxious to bring in the Circuit Court, I would be prepared to accept amendment No. 9 but not on the basis that it is there because I do not think it would be of any value referring as it does to total liabilities of £25,000. That would be an extremely small company. Furthermore, the amendment refers to total liabilities and not net liabilities. There is almost no company in the country who would not have total liabilities of £25,000.  Their net liabilities might be a lot less but if we added a nought to the figure and made it £250,000 I would be disposed to accepting amendment No. 9.  That would still be a very small company but it would give the Circuit Court some jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Despite what Deputy Spring said there is a difficulty in trying to get things heard in vacation in the Circuit Court.  That is why they do not have much jurisdiction when it comes to injunctions and so on which are hardly ever applied for.  In the High Court all the judges, for reasons best known to themselves, live in Dublin on the well known basis that if you do not live in Dublin you are not alive.  In the Circuit Court, strangely enough, as <Col N="2163" /> far as I am aware nearly all the judges live in Dublin too.  Very few of them live in their circuits.  Given the very long vacations which amount to four and a half months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

With that reservation I would be disposed to accepting the amendment even though it may not be as useful as both Deputy Spring and I would wish it to be but I want to make a gesture towards reducing costs and try to decentralise things out of the High Court.  I suggest to the Deputy that we do it on the basis of a figure of £250,000.  If he is agreeable to amending the figure we could perhaps accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we could leave it stand for the moment and come back on Report Stage on the figure.  I appreciate that the Minister agrees with the thrust of the amendment and his departmental advisers are closer to the mark in relation to the type and size of companies and their debts and liabilities.  Therefore I will accept his advice in that respect.  In relation to the difficulty he adverts to in relation to Circuit Court judges perhaps the time has come to make sure that Circuit Court judges are available on their Circuit.  The Minister stated, to use his own expression, that if you do not live in Dublin, nothing happens but there should be an obligation on people in those positions to provide a service.  We should look at that matter in the context of the Courts Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to accept that the Minister's advice is that the wording of the amendment may not be technically correct but this does not get away from the fact that people practising in this area are of the view that this legislation will <Col N="2164" /> lead to inconsistency in terms of who is going to hear cases.  Let me give one example.  Section 7 which deals with powers of an examiner states:</P>
      <P>The examiner may apply to the court to determine any question arising in the course of his office, or for the exercise in relation to the company of all or any of the powers which the court may exercise under this Act, upon the application to it of any member, contributory, creditor or director of a company.</P>
      <P>One can go back to the court at any given time to seek clarification but there would be no assurance that the judge who heard the case first day would be available to hear technical points relating to a company on a continuous basis.  The more intricate the problem the more difficult the matter is going to become for a judge. Delays will also be encountered because as I understand it &mdash; I do not profess to have any expert knowledge on the workings of the courts &mdash; they will go in to seek a hearing but it may be delayed until the following day or the day after.</P>
      <P>I cannot see anything wrong with having a specialised court to deal with issues relating to company law.  As I understand it some of the provisions of the Insolvency Act introduced in Britain in 1986 related to the establishment of a company court.  Given that the amendments were circulated yesterday I would have thought, if the Minister is of the view that there is some merit in the argument that there could be delays and different judges would hear different aspects of the case, he would have introduced his own amendment to amend the wording he considers defective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not make any difference if we had a special court in this regard.  The same judge will hear the case when he is available but he is not going to be available more often in the month of August and if he is on holidays somebody else will have to hear it.  It is not unusual to have one net point decided by another judge and it is not necessary to go into the background to the case.  One of the <Col N="2165" /> advantages of the High Court, as presently constituted, is that all judges have equal jurisdiction, and in vacation one can go to any one of them.  If it is some small net point where no detailed knowledge is required, such as to enable an examiner to do something, then any one of the judges can deal with it.  In terms of expedition it is probably better to have it as it is rather than to have a special court which is what Deputy Barrett wants.  I have already given the reason I think this would not be advisable, that it would lead to demands for staff, premises and so on which simply cannot be provided.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Spring.  I observe that amendment No. 4 in the name of the same Deputy forms a composite proposal.  Amendments Nos. 5, 6, 8 and 26, in the name of Deputy Rabbitte, are related or form alternative amendments and I suggest that we discuss amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 26 together.

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following definition:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2166" />&ldquo;&lsquo;employees representatives&rsquo; means officials (including shop stewards) of any trade union or staff association to which some or all of the employees of a company belong and with which it has been the practice of the company to conduct collective bargaining negotiations;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment because of my concern that there should be access to the courts for employees and, indeed, employees' representatives.  It is extremely important, given the difficulties that employees and employees' representatives will face in relation to these applications, that they should be considered as interested parties.  These would include applications for the determination of any question arising in the course of the performance by an examiner of his functions or in relation to a company who have already the powers which the court may exercise under the Bill.  Even though the Minister said earlier that employees could be considered to be creditors of the company, at the end of the day given the difficulties and the position of employees they should be specifically identified in the legislation so that they can very easily make their applications to the court.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Minister might consider this to be onerous or unnecessary because, just as in the definition section we have provided for creditors or members of the company, employees who in many cases will have been involved in the company for many years will be facing extremely uncertain futures and may have little or no assets to rely on.  In the case of older employees the chances of re-employment will be very slim.  They should be specifically identified in the Bill, as proposed in amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>This is the best advice I have in dealing with this matter at this stage.  I repeat that we are discussing amendments Nos. 3 &mdash; which has been moved &mdash; 4, 5, 6, 8 and 26 together. All the amendments, with the exception of amendments Nos. 3 and 4, are in the name of Deputy Rabbitte.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we find ourselves, having spent hours and days in the select committee, expected to form a view on the relative merits of any one of these amendments as compared to another more or less on the spur of the moment.  Those of us who were members of the select committee know that hours have been devoted &mdash; perhaps sometimes tediously &mdash; to teasing out the implications of matters such as this.  Therefore, I am happy to support the thrust of Deputy Spring's amendment rather than my own.  I would be interested to hear whether the Minister thinks one amendment meets the situation better than another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More important, we are asking the Minister to accept that workers in this situation are interested parties.  I know the Minister will say that the definition of &ldquo;interested party&rdquo; as it relates to section 2 includes a creditor and that an employee is technically a creditor.  While that is technically true an employee is not a creditor in the sense that is envisaged as being the <i>raison d'être</i> of this legislation. It is almost accidental that an employee happens to be co-incidentally a creditor for a very small amount of money.  It is necessary to expressly include in the definition section an employee of the company or an employee acting through his or her trade union as an interested party.  I can conceive of a number of situations where a trade union <Col N="2168" /> might want to exercise the powers conferred by this legislation.  They would be distinct and separate from any rights an individual employee may have technically as a creditor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as these six amendments are concerned the issue that is involved in them &mdash; and that is clear also from what has been said in regard to them &mdash; is the question of trade union recognition.  As far as I am concerned this is a companies Bill, it has nothing to do with the recognition or otherwise of trade unions.  For that reason I think the amendments are inappropriate.  I have already said that so far as employees are concerned they will not just normally but probably it is true to say, invariably, be a creditor.  Therefore, the employees are interested parties within the terms of the definition in section 1 and they have to be consulted before any final arrangements are made or agreed by the court.  It seems to be perfectly adequate that employees be consulted.  It is not necessary to bring trade unions specially into it.</P>
      <P>It appears that amendment No. 8 is unnecessary because an employee would not normally be a contingent or prospective creditor, he would, as I said already, almost invariably be an actual creditor.  Therefore, the question of giving security for costs on the part of an employee would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it regrettable that the Minister should take a swipe at trade unions in relation to what I consider to be, in mine and Deputy Rabbitte's amendments, constructive contributions. In fact, our amendments offer a method of tidying up representation of workers which can be done perhaps more ably and in a more organised fashion by their trade union officials, including shop stewards, than by every employee seeking to rush off to the courts themselves.  I suggest to the Minister that the provisions of our amendments would be constructive, providing a facility whereby the trade unions who would be representing the employees, in the first instance, would be able to represent them collectively in the <Col N="2169" /> context of decisions to be taken affecting their futures.  I find it regrettable that the Minister, in a disparaging manner, feels that the trade unions, as representatives of employees, should have no right to a hearing in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister expound his views somewhat on this because I do not want to ascribe to him things he did not intend.  I am thoroughly bemused by his reference to the fact that this is the Companies Bill, that it has nothing to do with regulation of trade unions.  That sounds as though the Minister has in mind the kind of Frank Lorenzo approach in the United States to Chapter 11 which he used very effectively in the case of Texas Air to frustrate the trade unions, cause the strike to be declared illegal, causing workers to break their contracts, as is a phenomonen of Chapter 11 throughout the United States. I do not know whether the Minister is saying that that is what he means by that particular swipe.  It seems to me extraordinary to say that this is the Companies Bill and that it has nothing to do with trade unions or workers.  In the first instance a company would not be in business without the input of workers and staff at all levels.  This seem to do no more than take account of their vested interest in the circumstances and of the fact that it can be done in a more orderly fashion as is proposed in these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about a set of circumstances we have seen occur not infrequently in this country when, for whatever reason, company directors may decide, for example, to deliberately run down a company? What about the kinds of activities of certain predators whom I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would advise me I am not allowed to name in the House who engage in acquiring companies for the purposes of asset-stripping?  In those circumstances ought not the right rest with the trade union to take its own action? I cannot understand why the Minister should be hostile to the notion.  It seems to me to do no more than tidy up the position, acknowledge the fact that <Col N="2170" /> workers have rights in such circumstances in a Bill in which every other body appears to be provided for but where there appears to be very little express consideration given to the interests of workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, was surprised at the Minister's remark.  I had thought this Bill was all about consensus.  If we are to take the view that this is a Companies Bill, that trade unions have not a major role to play in this whole process, then we are in deep trouble.  I cannot see how one could possibly obtain consensus without the co-operation of those employed in companies.  First employees must be given an assurance that the whole process is about endeavouring to protect their jobs.  Surely the whole thrust of this Bill is about the protection of employment?</P>
      <P>My party are not here to protect any vested interest.  I spoke about the beef industry.  In this instance I am speaking about employment, its protection and the creation of additional jobs.  It should not be a question of our being solely concerned with somebody who perhaps is losing money deciding to go into business. There are hundreds of thousands of other people who will benefit from the provisions of this Bill.  Indeed section 3 does provide that an employee may seek from the court the appointment of an examiner.  There may be circumstances in which an employee may request a representative to undertake the task on his or her behalf.  Surely there should be discretion allowed in regard to this matter?  Let us be frank and honest; there are many people who have never been inside the doors of a court, who do not like going into court, who have a thing about courts.  If I cannot nominate somebody to represent me to go into court and present a case on my behalf then I contend there is a flaw in this Bill.  It should be made quite clear that an employee seeking the protection of the court can be represented by his or her trade union official, or some other compromise should be reached which would ensure the outcome we all seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do that, if it goes out from this <Col N="2171" /> House that this Bill is about consensus &mdash; that it is essential we get the co-operation of not alone creditors but employees, trade unions and all of those engaged in the day-to-day running of businesses &mdash; then it is essential that the trade union movement, representing thousands of workers, feel that they would be part of this process.</P>
    <P>While section 17 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The following parties shall be entitled to appear and be heard at a hearing under subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) the examiner,</P>
    <P>(b) the company,</P>
    <P>(c) any interested party,</P>
    <P>(d) any person who is referred to in the report in relation to the matters mentioned in subsection (1) (d) </P>
    <P>I am sure a trade union would regard themselves as an &ldquo;interested party&rdquo;, so that they could go into court as an &ldquo;interested party,&rdquo; on behalf of a group of employees to state their case.</P>
    <P>For that reason the Minister should endeavour to listen to calls from this side of the House to the effect that if an employee wishes to appoint a representative on his or her behalf, that provision should be included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the sentiments underlying the amendments in the name of Deputy Spring.  However, on reflection, I do not think they are strictly necessary.  I do not know that there is anything that would prevent an employee's trade union representative going into court and speaking on his or her behalf in relation to the presentation of a petition in the High Court.  There is certainly nothing that would prevent an employee from consulting his or her trade union who, in turn, can get their solicitor or counsel to go into court and argue the case on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the other point made, as the Minister has pointed out, clearly an interested party, includes an employee. It would appear to me to be rather curious <Col N="2172" /> that Deputies Spring and Rabbitte should argue in favour of circumstances in which a trade union representative or shop steward, as a representative of employees, should be entitled to be consulted rather than the employees themselves. The Bill seems to me to be much more democratic as it stands, namely, that there is an obligation to consult the employees, as a whole, as interested parties, that is each and every one of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been put well by Deputy O'Dea.  Regrettably I have to take the opportunity to put the record straight.  I must do this because of the tone adopted, which is familiar to me since, to some extent, we had it at the special committee, when views were attributed to me I never expressed nor did not hold.  The view that this Bill was not about trade unions or workers was attributed to me.  What I said was that the Bill was not about the principle of trade union recognition.  It is very much about workers.  As I have pointed out frequently on this Bill, as in the larger one, references to employees appear constantly and, where they did not appear, we put them in on numerous occasions, as Deputies who were members of that special committee will recall.  What we refused to do was agree to specific references to trade unions and trade union officials because I regard the employees as the people who count, not the trade union officials.  I can understand that some people would wish to have trade union officials rather than employees named in these matters.  I do not think so; one's obligations are to the employees.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Dea has said, there is nothing to prevent any one employee, or more of them, if they want, getting trade unions to represent them in the High Court if they do not want to go in themselves. They can do this through an official or a solicitor and counsel, which regularly happens.  As I made abundantly clear, &ldquo;employees&rdquo; are interested parties who must be consulted and they are the people about whom we should be concerned, not trade union officials.</P>

      <P>In relation to this amendment, there seems to be a certain agreement on the rights of employees. However, the Minister and Deputy O'Dea are not taking cognisance of the reticence, inability and reluctance of employees to approach the court.  In the context of the kind of companies about which we are talking approaching the High Court, the employees &mdash; individually or otherwise &mdash; would be faced with enormous difficulties.  The Minister said that there is nothing to stop them being collectively represented, and, therefore, I call on the Minister to accept this amendment and to give the trade unions representing workers the status before the court specifically in this section of the Bill.  That would clarify matters and allow for a streamlined application to the court which would be far more acceptable from the point of view of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the Minister seems to think he has given a definitive response; perhaps we are at cross-purposes but I certainly do not see it that way.  We are discussing a group of amendments and mine specifically states &ldquo;an employee of the company acting solely or through his or her trade union&rdquo;. Both options are there and I do not accept the view that there is an ultra democratic situation where all the workers have this option if they choose to exercise it individually. The Minister is entitled to his attitude, one I have met frequently, which is that there is an apparent reluctance on the part of some people to acknowledge the wish of workers who choose to join a trade union to have that union representing them.  They make the decision freely and voluntarily, nobody obliges or coerces them and, if they make that decision, why can it not be accepted by the company &mdash; or the court in this case &mdash; that they have a right to make that decision and to be heard collectively through the union?  It is an important point, and the manner in which employees are included throughout the Bill is entirely different from the sense at issue here.  In these provisions, the role of the trade union should be acknowledged <Col N="2174" />&mdash; where it exists &mdash; or, as in my amendment, where an employee chooses to act solely or through his or her trade union.</P>

All these arguments were made and rejected and I do not see the point in opening up the whole discussion again.  If you want to argue that particular classes of creditors should get special rights, I would have thought that unsecured trade creditors are entitled to special representation because they are the weakest and most vulnerable people who normally get clobbered and who lose most in liquidations.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to try to help them in a situation where a company goes under, where the banks and other secured creditors will all be looked after and where, generally, the employees are also looked after.  The worst that can happen to most of them is that they are owed a week's wages but they will still get statutory redundancy and so on.  The people who get nothing normally are the unsecured trade creditors, and the trade creditor by definition is virtually unsecured.  They get nothing and if there is a class to whom I thought preference should be given it would be them because they are the biggest losers.</P>

We are talking about people possibly losing their livelihoods and a half week's pay per year of service under the Redundancy Payments Acts would not bring them very far in terms of any kind of protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot dismiss out of hand the interest of workers who may have a particular input to make and who may have information which the examiner would find very interesting indeed in terms of other sections and which should be put at the disposal of the examiner.  They may have a bird's eye view, and to say that they should not be hard because they are well looked after is a ridiculous statement <Col N="2176" /> which does not have any regard &mdash; as I suspected &mdash; to the rights of people who contributed to creating the wealth in any given company, some, as Deputy Spring said, over most of their working lives.  If they decide to join a trade union, why should that not be accepted?</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows, individual workers would be very reluctant in the normal course of events to come forward to give information or evidence or to put their necks on the block in circumstances where a petition is envisaged.  The fact that a trade union can do it on their behalf depersonalises the whole thing.  The case is a compelling one and the Minister has not dealt fairly with it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1); between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Companies nowadays sometimes are so large that there is not just an interest in their survival in those who are employed by them, those who owe them money and in the members of the company, but there is also a wider public interest in regard to the companies in question.  In order that court protection for a company could be sought in the public interest as distinct from the interests of the creditors or members, this amendment has been framed to allow the Minister to petition for protection for a particular company. We do not envisage that this provision would be used very often but it might be used in some limited circumstances.</P>
      <P>The original draft of the Bill contained a provision where Fóir Teoranta could be one of those entities which could apply for a petition.  As Fóir Teoranta have been abolished there is no responsible statutory body which can make a petition and it is in that light I am suggesting that the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; might be added.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. I believe it has merit, particularly in the instances referred to by Deputy Bruton where there is no statutory body such as Fóir Teoranta.  Particularly where companies have been allowed to get into positions which are virtually monopolies the adverse effects on those companies' trading positions or the difficulties in trading may be of such enormous consequences not only to the employees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unless the Minister has some reason which we have not thought of for rejecting this Greek gift, I hope he will accept it.  He and several other Coalition Ministers for Industry and Commerce would have been very happy to have had that power in the mid-seventies, particularly in relation to PMPA.  No such power existed and the PMPA continued beyond the point where <Col N="2181" /> it was desirable because it was not possible to act.  The Minister would have been happy to have had that power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Deputy FitzGerald's point, the draftsman may have foreseen that because under section 3 (2) only the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the right to present a petition in respect of an insurance company and the Central Bank in respect of a bank.  So far as ordinary trading companies are concerned, it would be inappropriate for the Minister to have power to intervene in this way.</P>
      <P>Fóir Teoranta were mentioned in earlier drafts of this Bill when they were in existence as a rescue agency.  However, I want to make it clear that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not a rescue agency and I hope he never will be.  He has no ambition to be but if this amendment were accepted he would be automatically drawn into the matter with pressures from various interested parties in cases of suspected difficulty or where, as Deputy Spring mentioned, a company had become too big or dominant.  It would not be right for the Minister to come in and deal with it in this way.  If a company is too big or too dominant and abuses its dominant position, I have a Bill which I hope to introduce in October to deal with that as it is dealt with under Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  That is the appropriate way to deal with it rather than through this device.</P>

      <P>A Minister may have information sooner than any other creditor indicating that something needs to be done to rectify a situation in a company in the public interest.  The public interest is not just the employees of the company or those owed money by the company but those who may in the future have to deal with the company or who would have to suffer the consequences if the company went out of business.  It would be wise to allow the Minister power to intervene as a last resort.  It is to allow him to deal with cases where no one else is prepared to act and it is in such <Col N="2182" /> circumstances that we see merit in having the Minister included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide variety of people are entitled to act and if the Minister were added to the list he would not be looked on as a person of last resort but rather as the first port of call.  The other people listed would probably want the Minister to take the initiative rather than taking it themselves.  I do not think it would be appropriate.  Ministers should not intervene in these matters if they can avoid it.  I am non-interventionist by nature.</P>

      <P>Non-interventionist, except when it comes to insurers.  Where is the logic if the Minister has power to intervene when an insurance company gets into difficulty, because presumably it would be in the public interest that he would intervene, as was the case when Deputy Cluskey had to intervene in the public interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should take this power and use it at his or her discretion in the public interest.  I know the answer I would get if I went to the Minister and asked him to intervene just because he had the power to do so.  He would not be shy about saying no, but there are occasions when it might be in the public interest to avail of this power. I cannot see how the Minister would have power to intervene if an insurance company were involved but if any other kind of company were involved he would not want the power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the present case.  It may be in the public interest if no one else were to intervene but the Minister.  Is the Minister afraid that if this power were given to him now he might be embarrassed tomorrow morning if he did not intervene? I do not see why there should be embarrassment in one area of commercial life &mdash; i.e. insurance companies &mdash; and not in others.  I am not convinced by the Minister's argument.  We have made <Col N="2183" /> a reasonable case.  I do not see that it would create any difficulties for the Minister to take the power that is being offered to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine that the number of occasions that such a power, if vested in the Minister, would have to be availed of would be very few. It would be a very rare occasion indeed that the Minister would be called upon to use such a power.  It could, however, arise.  I agree with the Minister that it is not a power he would want to use &ldquo;if he could at all avoid it&rdquo;.  There could perhaps be a very rare situation where it just might not be possible for him to avoid it and where a company might go under unless the Minister stepped in.  One could envisage that a company on the slide could be rescued but that the directors and members were just not bothering. If the company was continuing on the downhill slide, and there was quite a lot at stake in the way of employment and goods that might be required by the State, it might then be appropriate for the Minister, as a port of last call rather than as a port of first call, to take the step of going to the courts to put in an independent person to keep the company going if, having examined the situation, the Minister came to the conclusion that it was appropriate for him to do so.</P>
      <P>It may be, as the Minister says, that his office would be regarded as the first port of call if he was given that power.  That may be so, but I do not think that matters greatly.  The question is not whether he would be a first port of call but whether all the ships converging on that port would reach the safe haven of the bay.  Basra may be a first port of call for many ships at the moment but not many, apparently, are getting there.</P>
      <P>I do not see that it can do any great harm to have that fallback position.  I do accept that it would be used rarely but it might just be required and the day could come when this or some future Minister for Industry and Commerce would regret not taking this power when the opportunity presented itself.</P>

      <P>Before you put the question, I would like to reply to Deputy Barrett.  He asks why, if this power resides in the Minister in regard to insurance, it should not reside in him in regard to other companies.  There is a very big difference.  The reason it resides in him in regard to insurance is that the Minister is the supervisory authority in respect of insurance companies.  Very detailed reports are made to the Minister at least annually but, in practice, far more often than that &mdash; quarterly in respect of many of the companies.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is probably the only person who knows whether a company is going well or not.  The general public would have no way of knowing that, and the Minister has a particular responsibility in that regard.  The Minister is not the supervisory authority in respect of any other companies, and particularly not privately-owned companies. I do not believe it is desirable that he should be the supervisory authority.</P>

      <P>This section deals with related companies and provides that where the court appoints an examiner to a company it may, at the same time or at any time thereafter, appoint an examiner to a related company.  Subsection (3) of section 4 states that a related company to which an examiner is appointed shall be deemed to be under the protection of the court for the period during which the company to which it is related is under such protection.  The initial company is under the protection of the court from the date of the presentation of the petition.  If <Col N="2188" /> an examiner is appointed to a related company, say, a month after the original petition is presented, how can the property and assets of the related company be retrospectively immune from sequestration, distress, etc?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The period in respect of the related company will end when the period in respect of the original company ends.  That was adverted to in the past few days.  It was not in the original draft but it is covered now.  It may mean that a related company is under protection for a couple of days fewer than the original one, but one has to have finality about it.  One could not have them ending on different days.</P>

      <P>The point does not relate to when the period of protection ends but when the period of protection commences. If the period of protection commences when a petition is presented on behalf of the original company and if a month after that petition is presented successfully the court decides to appoint an examiner to a related company, as I read it, subsection (3) states that that related company will be under the protection of the court for the same period as the initial company, that is, from the presentation of the original petition.  The main consequences of being under the protection of the court are that the property and assets of the company are immune from sequestration, distress etc. What if a receiver has been appointed or if sequestration has been effected against the assets of the related company during the first month?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 28, after &ldquo;effect&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;unless the examiner has consented thereto&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 (2) states that &ldquo;For so long as a company is under the protection of the court in a case under this Act, the following provisions shall have effect&rdquo; and we go on to list the provisions.  We are seeking to add the words &ldquo;unless the examiner has consented thereto.&rdquo;  The reason is that there may be occasions when it is in the interest of the company and those related to the company, those involved in the company and those employed in the company, that an examiner should have power to act quickly. While many of the provisions of subsection (2) are in the interest of the company, there may be occasions where the examiner would want to dispose of something quickly without having to go immediately back to the court.  That adds to the point <Col N="2190" /> the Minister made in reply to the Second Stage when he said he was conscious of the fact that throughout this Bill there were numerous references to referral to the court.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to minimise the need for such referral and to give the examiner some independence if he feels it is in the interests of the company to take certain steps, which otherwise he could not take because of provisions outlined in subsection (2), without going back to the court.  I am asking the Minister to accept this amendment in the interest of making the examiner's life easier in dealing with the day-to-day problems I have no doubt he will face, depending on the circumstances of each company.  It would be in the interest of the legislation that this amendment be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been represented to us that receiverships work quite well because the receiver has very wide powers, can make quite quick decisions and can dispose of assets quickly.  The spirit in which this amendment is proposed is to give an examiner maximum flexibility to make decisions of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is that while Deputy Barrett's proposal may be laudable in as much as he is trying to avoid or prevent the necessity to go back to the court there is no obligation under subsection (2) to go to the court or to get the consent of the court in respect of any of those things.  It just says that these things shall not happen.  One does not have to go to the court to stop them. They are stopped by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, I cannot see in this instance how an examiner would consent under subsection (2) (a) to a winding up by somebody else.  What is envisaged by the Bill as a whole is that he would go back to the court and would say this company is hopelessly insolvent, he cannot do anything with it and he would ask the court to make an order winding it up.  It would not be for him to consent. The Deputy's idea may be a good one, but I think he has applied it to the wrong subsection.  There is no obligation on the <Col N="2191" /> examiner to go to court for any of these six or seven purposes.  It is to stop other people going to court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11.</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 49 and in page 7, lines 1 to 8, to delete paragraph (f).</P>
      <P>One of the consequences of the granting of a petition is that where a third party has given a guarantee to a company which is under court protection in accordance with subsection (2) (f) the third party cannot be pursued for their guarantee. There does not seem to be any need for this.  If the purpose of the legislation is to protect companies, then it is sufficient to protect the companies.  There is no need to protect third parties who have given guarantees as well.</P>
      <P>I believe that this subsection is causing major concern among the banking community. Where they have lent money on the strength of the third party guarantees they can find that is not the company to be put under protection, where they will get their money from the company, but that process on its own, quite independently of any investigation of the circumstances of the third party which is not envisaged in this legislation, will prevent the third party guarantee from being called in as well.  There is no need whatever for paragraph (f) and no justification advanced for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This could have considerable implications for State guarantees that have been granted to State companies.  It is possible for the State to avail of paragraph (f) to avoid its liability under State guarantees where a State company might avail of protection.  A State guarantee of a borrowing by a company can be rendered null by paragraph (f).  That is a <Col N="2192" /> subsidiary point related to one possible instance where this might come in as far as a State guarantee is concerned but if it is not the main point which is that there does not seem to be any need, from the point of view of protection of the company, to protect third parties as well.  I cannot understand the purpose of the subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The power to seek the appointment of an examiner rests, among others, with the directors of the company.  Directors who have given guarantees might seek to protect their personal positions by having an examiner appointed so that they cannot be got at personally, thereby avoiding their personal guarantees.  I cannot understand why we would wish to involve ourselves in that kind of approach.</P>

      <P>I do not quite see why the amendment would defeat the intent or purpose of the Bill as it seems to be a quite distinct issue.  If there is a guarantor of a company and that company go into receivership or liquidation, the liability of the guarantor is in no way affected.  If a person gives a guarantee the guarantee stands even though the company is in receivership or liquidation.  Why then should the position logically be any different if the company is under protection? Surely, the same principle ought to apply and the liability of the guarantor is a quite distinct and independent liability from the liability of the company.  It would appear that the section, if left untouched, would incorporate the veil of protection and extend it beyond the company into a quite extraneous position and a completely different contract, namely, a contract of guarantee.  I would like the Minister to indicate how he can draw a distinction between the position of a company in receivership or liquidation and a company under protection.  The guarantee holds good in the case of receivership and liquidation and surely, logically, it should also hold good in the case of protection, perhaps <i>a fortiori</i><Col N="2193" /> should hold good in the case of protection, where the company is soldering on with advantages to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did.  Deputy FitzGerald mentioned that people evade their personal guarantees.  They will only be able to evade their personal guarantees for four months at most.  As anybody with experience of dealing with companies will know, the sort of people who give personal guarantees to guarantee the debts of a company are usually dominant people within the company.  One does not find some small shareholder or employee of a company giving personal guarantees.  If during the period of protection we change the legislation to allow people to whom guarantees have been given to personally go after those people, the incentive for those people will be to allow the company to be put into receivership in the hope that there will be sufficient moneys to discharge their liabilities rather than to immediately suffer sequestration of their personal assets.  If we were to remove this subsection we would defeat the purpose of the Bill and encourage liquidations and receiverships rather than keeping a company alive, which is the purpose and purport of the legislation.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Dea will find, if he consults the record, the amendment I put down on Committee Stage proposed to limit the amount of a bank guarantee to a proportion of the debt; it would not have got rid of bank guarantees. I will be reintroducing that amendment on Report Stage when it comes before us again because it is a sensible one.  What we are talking about here are guarantees that have already been given, <Col N="2194" /> and on foot of which bank money has already been loaned.  What we are saying is that, retrospectively, those guarantees can now be set aside in respect of a company under protection.  That is changing the rules of the game after the game has begun.  Certainly, in the future, as my amendment to the Companies Bill proposed, it will be reasonable to say that no guarantee shall be sought for more than a proportion of the amount loaned. That would restrict the banks' use of guarantees in the future and change the rules of the game that was now starting. In this case we are changing the rules in respect of a game that is half over and I do not think that is a good way to proceed in any form of human activity.  It has not been explained to me how personal guarantees cannot be separated from, and are not separate from, the fate of the company.</P>

      <P>Is Deputy Bruton suggesting, to use his own words, that the guarantees should be set aside?  If the examiner finds he cannot save the company and seeks a winding up order in the courts or the appointment of a receiver, then the personal guarantees will be available to the company.  There is no question of the setting aside of guarantees <i>ad infinitum;</i> Deputy Taylor also referred to this fact.  If the company goes into receivership or liquidation the personal guarantees will be available to the company and if the company survives they will also be available.  The purpose behind appointing an examiner is to allow the examiner proceed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This seems to be an extraordinary provision for which there must be a better reason than the one we got from the Minister.  Perhaps he would explain further why this has been put in. If there is a good reason, fair enough, but we have not heard it.  There would need to be a good reason to take such drastic action to protect individuals and companies. Perhaps the intention is, but it is not said here, that &ldquo;where, under any enactment, any person other than the company is liable to pay all or any part of the debts of the company&rdquo; no attachment shall be put in place.  Perhaps that is what is meant but it does not say that.  Perhaps the Minister will help us by clarifying his thoughts and giving better reasons for this or otherwise considering the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, as I understand it, under subsection (2) (c) one cannot have direct attachment, sequestration, distress or execution against the company, and paragraph (f) proposes that one cannot circumvent that prohibition by doing it indirectly in respect, for example, of a debtor of a company.  I have given that example already.  If &ldquo;X&rdquo; owes £100,000 to a company which is under protection under the provisions of this Bill, it would be inequitable for &ldquo;Y&rdquo; to come along, sue &ldquo;X&rdquo; and collect the £100,000 from him, &ldquo;Y&rdquo; being a creditor of the company, and evade the prohibition in section 5 (2) (c) about direct sequestration by arguing, &ldquo;I am not sequestering directly against the company, I am doing so against somebody else&rdquo;.  The net effect in the heel of the hunt is exactly the same because the £100,000 that &ldquo;X&rdquo; owes the company is as much an asset of the company as £100,000 worth of land or other property. This is to prevent the debts due to a company from being sequestered or otherwise obtained by way of equitable execution or in any of those other indirect fashions.  For that reason it seems that this makes sense because otherwise there would be an incentive to circumvent the prohibition which is properly contained in subsection (2) (c).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said and I understand him very well.  He is absolutely right in what he has said and I support him fully.  He is talking about a garnishee and the sentiments he expressed are entirely logical and correct and I agree with him 100 per cent.  Perhaps he will agree with me when he looks at paragraph (f) that the net is cast too wide.  It covers the situation he is talking about but it covers something different as well which would be entirely inappropriate and that is the guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two distinct issues, unfortunately, appear to be caught by paragraph (f).  I doubt if it was the Minister's intention to catch the guarantee which would not be appropriate although the garnishee issue is appropriate.  It is emotive to put the guarantee issue when talking about banks.  Guarantees can be given to people other than banks and one tends not to be unduly sympathetic where banks are concerned and that is understanable.  Let us take the case of a farmer considering supplying beef to a company who is worried whether the company are good.  The farmer might have an urgent need of a quick cash flow and the absence of it could prove disastrous to him.  What does he do?  He may go to the main director or promoter of the processing plant and say, &ldquo;I am not prepared to supply you unless you give me your personal guarantee that I will be paid and that you accept <Col N="2197" /> responsibility for the beef which I will supply you and your company&rdquo;.  The director may give that guarantee.  If the beef processing company are put under protection under the provisions of paragraph (f) the unfortunate small farmer who sent in his beef may be held up for a minimum of four months and his personal guarantee from the director would become useless for at least four months.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen is right in saying it is only for four months but it could be that those four months could be crucial for a small farmer.  The loss of finance for that period could be vital for his farming activities and his business.  I do not think a person who gives such a personal guarantee should have a free run for four months simply because the main company are under protection.  A new element is being introduced.  If the company were in liquidation the guarantee would have full force and effect.  Why should that guarantor be let off scot-free for four months with possible disastrous consequences for the person who had the prudence to apply for, get and take the guarantee in the first place?  The section is cast too widely and, perhaps, the guarantee question could be excluded at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I am baffled by this section.  I am not an expert on company law and I have not got much experience of the deviousness of many of our private entrepreneurs in the company business on how to manage debts and so on.  It is obvious that we have in three paragraphs, (c), (d) and (e) the words &ldquo;except with the consent of the examiner is not required in paragraph (f).  Since we are here to discuss a Bill in the context of one particular company, I want to know how this is going to affect the company about which we are talking, Goodman International. In this case, the person is the company.  Paragraph (f) states: &ldquo;Where, under any enactment, rule of law or otherwise there is no reference to guarantees] any person other than the company is liable to pay all or any part <Col N="2198" /> of the debts of the company&mdash;&rdquo;.  In this case we are talking about a person other than the company who is liable for practically all the debts of the company, not just any part of the debts of the company. Are we to understand that no attachment, sequestration, distress or execution shall be put into force against the property of this person in respect of the debts of the company or are we to understand that no proceedings of any sort may be commenced against this person in respect of the debts of the company? The consent of the examiner is not required.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister precisely how this affects not just company law in general but the company the Dáil was recalled to deal with.  In my view we are dealing with a person rather than a company, that person being the person on whom an examiner would be dependent and on whose assets the examiner would be dependent to save the company. What will the examiner do if he cannot proceed against such a person in respect of the debts of the company?  It may be that the Minister can explain that this is covered elsewhere but in this section the consent of the examiner should be inserted in paragraph (f).  If the examiner could decide and agree he could prevent other persons from taking such proceedings, attachment or whatever else.  The examiner should be able to make a decision and consent to such a case.</P>

      <P>Let us not forget that the examiner will be nominated in the first place by the petitioners who is the person in trouble.  A director of a company, who may have been the person who gave the guarantee, may be the person who will be nominating the examiner. The examiner is nominated by the petitioner and the court confirms.  There is a problem here.  Deputies Cowen and O'Dea point out that this protection lasts only four months and strictly speaking, that is true.  If one looks at section 17 (3) one will see that it is possible for the court to make any order it wishes at the end of an examinership.  It could decide to <Col N="2199" /> discharge personal guarantees at the end of an examinership.  Likewise, the examiner who, as I pointed out earlier, is somebody who will have been nominated by the petitioner in the first place, could propose as part of his scheme of arrangement that the personal guarantees be set aside.  Given that we have put into section 5 the setting aside, at least for the period of the examinership, of personal guarantees, as if that was inter-linked with the affairs of the company, that gives a signal to the judge that he can consider proposals which would deal with guarantees as well.  It seems to me to be wider than we need go.</P>

      <P>We proceed now to deal with section 16, amendment No. 19 in the name of Deputy Rabbitte.  I observe that amendments Nos. 33 and 35 are related.  If it is satisfactory to the House we will take amendments Nos. 19, 33 and 35 together.  Is that satisfactory? Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 14, paragraph (g), line 35, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the employees as a whole or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 16 (g) reads:</P>
      <P>(g) whether, in his opinion, an attempt to continue the whole or any part of the undertaking of the company would be likely to be more advantageous to the members as a whole and the creditors as a whole, than a winding-up of the company,</P>
      <P>This is another case where we believe the employees should be included and, as the Minister said during the discussion on the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, were included on a number of occasions.  This is another section where we believe it would be more advantageous to the employees as a whole as well as the credtiors as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment No. 19.  Employees are not adequately consulted or informed of major decisions being taken by their companies.  It should be realised that the main thrust of legislation in this area is to place the boards and managements of companies in the position in which they are legally bound to concern themselves solely &mdash; and here I emphasise the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo;&mdash; with maximising profits for their shareholders.  In fact, any companies seeking to do otherwise could be sued by a shareholder.  That is not dramatising the position; it has happened. Therefore, a fundamental change in company law is needed to acknowledge <Col N="2201" /> employees' rights and those of the community and consumers generally.</P>
      <P>To proceed from the general to the particular, we all know why we have been recalled from holidays, not to deal with a hypothetical situation.  I might remind the House that the Bill before us today basically is a section of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  It is a sad reflection of the way the Oireachtas carries on its busines that the Committee Stage of the 1987 Bill was concluded only in July last. All parties in the House, with the possible exception of The Workers' Party, must bear responsibility therefore.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Goodman Group, we do not want a recurrence of what happened to Irish Shipping, when the company was sunk not through any fault of its employees or normal trading, which was profitable, but rather by speculation by the company at top level.  We have a parallel in the case of the Goodman Group where the company has been brought to its knees by Stock Exchange speculation on the part of Mr. Larry Goodman.  It would be my hope that the employees of the Goodman Group would receive better treatment from the Government than did Irish Shipping employees if a doomsday position should arise.</P>

      <P>Employees are covered in the phrases &ldquo;creditors as a whole&rdquo;; they are taken into account there.  As far as I know that covers the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get the Minister's point there.  The whole point of the section is that an examiner will decide whether to wind up; whether it would be in the best interests of certain people to continue the company in existence, as it is, or to close down part and continue another part thereof.  In the case we are talking about, this is the very type of decision an examiner will have to be making.  In this case, there is a whole series of different companies &mdash; I think 14 or 15 different subsidiaries, bits and pieces &mdash; that may be kept going while others may be closed down and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section stipulates that, where the <Col N="2202" /> examiner is conducting this examination, he will have to consider whether it would be more advantageous to the members as a whole or the creditors as a whole to continue bits and pieces, or the whole lot, rather than wind-up.  What this amendment seeks is that he should take into consideration whether it would be in the interests of the employees as a whole that part of the company be closed down, part kept going, rather than wind up the whole company, paying off creditors. Surely what is most advantageous to the employees as a whole should be taken into consideration by an examiner when taking that type of decision.  In this case the Minister need not have an hang-ups; I am not asking him to decide on the trade union movement as a whole, simply on the employees of a company; forget about trade unions.  We are simply asking that an examiner must take employees into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I have made already is a perfectly valid one: for the purposes of this section and the definitions involved, it is quite clear that employees are included in the word &ldquo;creditors&rdquo;.  Therefore, their interests are taken into account in that respect.</P>
      <P>The other point I might make in response to Deputy Mac Giolla is that section 16 (g) reads:</P>
      <P>Whether, in his opinion, an attempt to continue the whole or any part of the undertaking of the company would be likely to be more advantageous...</P>
      <P>Obviously it would be more advantageous in every case from the employees' point of view to continue the undertaking in whole or in part.</P>

      <P>The suggestion that &ldquo;creditors&rdquo; covers employees is totally mistaken.  There seems to be an idea that they are due some money, holiday money and a couple of thousand pounds by way of statutory redundancy.  However, the employees would forego all that if they were kept in employment.  Their whole livelihood is at stake and the fact that they are creditors for a few thousand pounds is not what constitutes their problem; their job, their future and that of their families is the problem.  The Minister is assessing the viability of certain sections of the company and what would be got by selling off the company or sections of it.  Under this section the employees and their future are not taken into consideration.  He is thinking of the employees as creditors but he is not considering their future and indeed their whole life.  If the Minister had any humanity, that should be one of the first things of which he would think.  Many examiners are auditors who simply think in figures and not in human terms.  We would like to see it in black and white in legislation that he must take their interests into consideration.  That is all we are asking.  &ldquo;Employees as a whole&rdquo; should be inserted in the section as well as &ldquo;creditors as a whole&rdquo; and &ldquo;members as a whole&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent from the Minister's response to this amendment that employees are totally marginalised <Col N="2204" /> in company legislation.  They are so marginalised that they are not even mentioned. To say that they are included in the creditors in a very sick joke.  The Minister should be man enough to admit that employees are totally disregarded in company legislation and it is time for legislation to be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather unfair of Deputy Garland to state that employees are being deliberately marginalised.  The position is that the examiner's report must set out various things and one of them is his opinion as to whether the continuation of all or part of the undertaking would be in the interests of members or creditors as a whole.  As the Minister rightly said, if the words &ldquo;employees as a whole&rdquo; were inserted it would preclude the examiner from exercising the option of saving part of the company because to do so would not, obviously, be in the interests of the employees as a whole.  If you take the interests of employees as opposed to this artificial concept of the employees as a whole, to continue part of the enterprise will obviously be to the advantage of some employees.  Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister's resistance to this amendment is an ideological one, which was demonstrated earlier.  I thank Deputy Garland for his contribution and agree with his remarks. The Minister's mistaken position is that he presumes that in all instances the interests of the members and the creditors as a whole will always be compatible and consistent with the interests of the workers as a whole.  I submit that that will not always be the case.  I honestly do not think that there is much value in persisting in the submission that the <Col N="2205" /> employees and creditors are, therefore, included in the section as it stands.  Technically, of course, that is true but we know very well that what is intended by the word &ldquo;creditors&rdquo; is not designed, except coincidentally, to include employees.  That is not the meaning to be ascribed to the word.  It may well be that the interests of the workers as a whole will vary from the interests of the members or the creditors as a whole in a given situation.  That kind of dilemma has been faced in industry where it might well suit the John Teelings of this world to go in a particular direction which would not suit the workers employed.  That is why it is necessary to explicitly include this amendment in the legislation.</P>

      <P>It does but that is not the point.  We are not talking about employees as creditors; we are talking about employees as workers in a particular enterprise who may have an interest which on occasion differs from the interests of the members of the company or the creditors.  This amendment is asking the examiner to do no more than express an opinion.  Under section 16 (g) the examiner's report shall state, &ldquo;whether, in his opinion, an attempt to continue the whole or any part of the undertaking of the company would be likely to be more advantageous to the members as a whole....&rdquo;  He is only being required to include in the report an opinion on whether or not the interests of the workers in the sense I mean here are included.  I do not understand how this would impose an additional difficulty on the examiner.  Surely he will have formed an opinion in any event on whether measures he might contemplate are in the best interests of the workers.  I am sure that is an opinion he will have readily formed and it escapes me why the Minister should object to it being comprised in his report.  It may be that I misunderstood the Minister's position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This argument goes to the mushy heart of this legislation in the sense that the criteria to be used by the court in deciding whether or not debts should be written down are so vaguely phrased as to give no guidance as to what a judge will decide.  Essentially, a judge can decide to either agree or disagree to a scheme or arrangement depending on whether he considers it to be in the interests of the members as a whole and <Col N="2207" /> the creditors as a whole.  This means that people with totally conflicting interests will all be given equal consideration with no guidance being set by the Oireachtas as to the scale of values which should be applied in this case by the judge.</P>
      <P>Given that all the creditors as a whole, without guidance as to who is more important, and that all the members of the company, without guidance as to whether they are more important than the creditors, are entitled to have their rights considered without any guidance from the Oireachtas, Deputy Rabbitte is absolutely right in saying that because everybody else is having their interests considered without discrimination or advice from this House employees should be included as well.  However, the fact is that the more uncertainty there is by failing to give guidance and including more and more interests that ought to be considered, the harder it will be for companies to borrow money in the future because they simply will not know how this legislation will work out in practice or how judges will interpret it in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be moving from a situation where under existing law we have relative certainty as to what one is entitled to into a situation where essentially we are saying, &ldquo;that is all suspended, the whole thing will be handed over to a court and we will see what it will decide in concrete situations&rdquo;.  We will be moving from concrete statute law which sets out various people's rights into a situation where it will in future be case law set out by judges <Col N="2208" /> on this legislation over a period of time, the duration of which cannot be foreseen at this stage.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much point in arguing to and fro about the wording of section 16 because even if we include the term &ldquo;the employees as a whole&rdquo; we do not know what way a judge will interpret it.  The Minister cannot tell us how a judge will interpret that wording because he is not including any criteria as to the guide which should be set by the judge. It is typical of this entire companies Bill that all sorts of things are being handed over to the court without guidance from the Oireachtas.  In a sense what we will have under this legislation is judge-made policy.  The place for making policy in this country is here and not in the Four Courts.  However, because the politicians cannot handle this sort of legislation they are increasingly saying, &ldquo;we will hand it over to the courts and let them decide because we cannot make up our minds in here about what is right, what should be first, second or third&rdquo;.  That is typical of the attitude of politicians here.  They are constantly talking about priorities but they never say that anything else should be a posteriority.  One cannot have a priority without a posteriority.  We are always saying that everything is important but we never say that anything is less important than something else.  I am afraid that is the essential mushiness of this legislation.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 20 in the names of Deputies Barrett and Bruton.  Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 are related.  It is proposed to take amendments Nos. 20, 22 and 23 together. Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(j) his opinion as to whether the facts disclosed would warrant further enquiries under sections 33 and 34,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A company that has been managed in such a fashion and gets into difficulty could, in some circumstances, do so because of fraudulent or reckless trading. Under the Companies Bill, 1987, which is still before the House, it is proposed that there be civil liability for persons concerned with fraudulent trading or reckless trading.  This is to be disclosed <Col N="2211" /> to the court by a receiver or liquidator when the liquidation or receivership is concluded.  If the receiver or liquidator discovers fraudulent or reckless trading he is obliged to disclose that fact.  In setting up a new instrument to change the status of companies it is only right that the examiner should have the same obligation in regard to reporting fraudulent or reckless trading as the other two officers &mdash; namely, the receiver and the liquidator &mdash; will have under the legislation currently before the House.</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Bill, which was not contained in the original Bill as drafted, states:</P>
    <P>(1)  If in the course of proceedings under this Act it appears that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) any person was, while an officer of the company, knowingly a party to the carrying on of any business of the company in a reckless manner; or</P>
    <P>(b) any person was knowingly a party to the carrying on of any business of the company with intent to defraud creditors of the company, or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose; </P>
    <P>the court, on the application of the examiner, or any creditor or contributory of the company, may, if it thinks it proper to do so, declare that such person shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any part of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the court may direct.</P>
    <P>The section is phased rather passively in the sense that if it appears by some happening, for which no one is particularly responsible, such activity is discovered, then the court may take certain action.  The purpose of amendment No. 20 is to place a specific responsibility on the examiner to report on whether there were any suggestions which would warrant further inquiries as to the possibility that there was reckless or fraudulent trading.  In other words, rather than <Col N="2212" /> leaving it to emerge the examiner would have specific responsibility to bring the matter to light in his report.  That should be one of the matters upon which he should be required to report under section 16.  That is only sensible.</P>
    <P>The introduction of court protection for companies is potentially giving company directors a new form of lifeboat which was not available to them before. If the lifeboat is being made available to them the liability should also be imposed on them if they leave the lifeboat as a result of having behaved fraudulently or recklessly.  In order to ensure the balance between the advantage to the director of this new protection and the requirement to provide the broader community with an assurance against corporate fraud, this amendment is entirely justified.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 relates to an obligation being placed on an examiner to report on whether a company has complied with the reporting requirements imposed on it by the Companies Acts. There are very clear reporting requirements imposed on all companies.  Until fairly recently only public companies had to report publicly but under EC legislation private companies now have to report publicly as well.  One company required to report publicly was the Goodman International Group.  They decided they did not want to report publicly and in order to avoid that they converted themselves into an unlimited company. An unlimited company must be one that is genuinely unlimited and where the directors of the company are fully reported.  To obtain the exemption from reporting which is available to unlimited companies without genuinely creating a situation in which the persons directing the company are personally liable would be to defeat the purpose of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made in the House, of which I have no first hand knowledge, by Members who claim to have personal knowledge that a device has been used by this company where the shares in the unlimited company are held by a limited company in another jurisdiction and not by individuals with <Col N="2213" /> unlimited liability who could be pursued. In other words, the suggestion is &mdash; it may not be correct &mdash; that the reporting requirements have been circumvented.  It is important that the examiner should investigate that matter.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 23 where we require that the examiner would report on compliance with reporting requirements.</P>
    <P>I have made clear the intention of the amendment.  If the Minister can find a better way of expressing it to make absolutely sure that we do go behind any devices that may have been used to avoid reporting requirements, of course, I would be more than pleased to have a ministerial amendment to substitute for this one to achieve a better wording.  I note that Deputy Spring has proposed an amendment in similar vein and again I am not going to be dogmatic about the wording of my amendment as against his or against one the Minister might produce.  If the Minister can produce one I presume it would be better than anything either Deputy Spring or I could produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would speak to my amendment in the same spirit as Deputy Bruton who referred to the amendments being put forward in an effort to improve this Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to my amendments to section 16, I consider section 16 to be a very important, if not the most important, part in this legislation.  It is important because of the powers we are giving the examiner in relation to his function to report and that we give him a very wide remit.  It is in the context of the examiner's report that the information would be provided to the court and that the full situation would be disclosed.  It is obviously of major importance that the examiner has the legal entitlement, the resources and the ability to ensure that all the information is put on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many references were made in discussions in the last session to levelling the playing field in another context. However, I think it is extremely important where the Oireachtas is providing <Col N="2214" /> legislation to enable companies, in particular a company, to stave off a very difficult situation for a period of months, that that company &mdash; ironically a company which is suing the Minister for Industry and Commerce for £50 million &mdash; the directors and the shareholders of that company must, I would insist, be in a position to come forward and make a full disclosure of all the transactions of that company of the accounting and the financial situation and of moneys in and out of that company over the relevant period which will be examined by the examiner.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and it is something I believe, that we had weaknesses in our company law in the past and in our existing company law in relation to fraudulent activities.  It is well known that there have been many suspicions about certain companies but we were unable to pursue them, although in other jurisdictions the companies which were involved here and in, say Northern Ireland or Britain, were brought before the courts and people were punished.  We seem to have an amazing unwillingness to pursue white collar crime.  Our Garda, for example, are under-resourced or under-funded when it comes to pursuing white collar crime.  In fact, the treatment by people who would be considered to be respectable businessmen and professional people in the city of the fraud squad in the last number of years when they were attempting to pursue and investigate allegations was deplorable.  No co-operation was given at any time.  In fact, if anything, people stood in the way of investigations and obstructed the conduct of investigations by the Garda Fraud Squad.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that the examiner should be in a position to trace the movement of funds to the company. Where we are looking for full disclosure it should be a prerequisite of this legislation that the examiner should be satisfied prior to offering his protection to the company that he is in possession of all the facts in relation to the directors, the shareholders and the movement of money in and out of the company and <Col N="2215" /> in and out of the country.  Also, where companies avail of either limited liability or in in this case, unlimited liability, the examiner must be in a position to look behind the status of the company, to look behind the label of unlimited liability because unlimited liability and limited liability are parts of our company law which are there for particular reasons, and where people claim to have unlimited liability, then I believe they must be made to stand over that claim.</P>
    <P>Where representations have been made by people to borrow money from numerous banks on the basis of unlimited liability, those people must stand over that claim.  I am proposing a number of amendments which I believe &mdash; and I would hope that the Minister would take cognisance of this &mdash; would strengthen the hands of the examiner and remove the weaknesses in our company law to which I have referred, weaknesses in relation to the pursuit of fraudulent activity and fraudulent or reckless trading. I believe anybody who is familiar with our company law would have to accept that it has been extremely weak.</P>
    <P>Second, I propose that the examiner must report whether in his opinion the whole or any part of the undertaking of the company would be more likely to survive if any or all of the directors or other officers of the company were removed from office, or if any member of the company was required to dispose of his shares in the company.  I believe this would be a very important power for the examiner to have.  The examiner must be in a position where he can make a judgment in relation to the conduct and behaviour of the directors and the officers of a company.  There is little point in having an examiner appointed if the day to day management of the company is still in the hands of the previous executives or the previous directors or shareholders because the examiner would be frustrated in his efforts to get full information.</P>
    <P>Likewise, it is important that he would express an opinion about whether proper books of accounts have been kept by <Col N="2216" /> the company, if they have been made available to him, if there has been any obstruction or if he has been hindered in the performance of his legal functions by any officer or member of the company.  I do not think any of us should underestimate what acts people will carry out to avoid presenting proper books for full inspection.</P>
    <P>In relation to this legislation, I believe it is extremely important that the examiner would be in a position to report to the court if he has been obstructed or hindered in the carrying out of his duty. If we are serious, and I believe the Minister is serious in his efforts to safeguard companies in difficulties, then we have to give the examiner the powers to which I am referring.  If we are not prepared to strengthen the examiner's hand we might as well not be here in this emergency session.  There is no point in appointing an examiner for the sake of it, to give the breathing space the Minister has referred to for three or four months.  I believe this is a much wider issue.  We have to convince the international community, the international lenders, that we are prepared to pursue, by way of the examiner in this instance, companies which have been reckless and which have been involved in fraudulent or irresponsible trading.  In that respect it is extremely important that the examiner would have more powers than are being given him in section 16 as it stands.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say they are wide powers and indeed they are.  We should not stop short, and in that respect the amendments put forward by Deputies Bruton and Barrett are in the same direction as those which I have outlined in some more detail.  It is extremely important, as I said at the outset, that the examiner is allowed to get right to the root of all the transactions which have taken place.  Likewise if it appears to the examiner that any transactions were entered into by the company during a period when it was unlikely to be able to pay its debts as they fell due in circumstances which were prejudicial to the interest of the creditors of the company, <Col N="2217" /> that matter is also one on which he would be reporting.  The Houses of the Oireachtas, by the emergency consideration of this legislation, are providing a vehicle for companies in difficulties.  There is a very heavy burden and a very heavy responsibility on any company who seek to avail of this legislation, on the directors of those companies, on the executives in particular and on those who run those companies, to come clean with the examiner and to provide assistance to the examiner in relation to the activities of the companies. If the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas are providing facilities effectively to help companies that cannot trade without the assistance of an examiner or the protection of the courts, there is a huge obligation on the companies involved to reciprocate and to disclose the facts in detail.</P>
    <P>I will put these amendments to the Minister in a constructive manner respecting the strength of the examiner's hand which is already provided for in section 16 governing the examiner's report.  It is extremely important.  One other aspect on which the Minister might be able to elaborate is the examiner's report.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether the examiner will have the authority to pursue funds of companies based in Ireland which are being transferred outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of the contributions by Deputies Bruton and Spring.  It is my opinion that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has considerably improved this Bill &mdash; I am referring to the substantive Bill &mdash; since it was first published.  In terms of dealing with the phenomenon of rogue directors, the phoenix syndrome and a number of other areas, it is considerably improved and at the Special Committee I have consistently supported that more rigorous approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a compelling case to be made for explicitly including in the legislation something along the lines envisaged by Deputy Bruton's amendment or, alternatively, Deputy Spring's amendment to <Col N="2218" /> this critical section 16.  Section 16 of the Bill that has been visited upon us by general factors is central to the legislation for the reasons that have been stated.  It threatens to undermine the entire examiner experiment if one does not impose this requirement on the examiner.  Who is in a better position to have formed an opinion on whether there was, for example, reckless or fraudulent trading in the company than the examiner?  This is presuming, of course, that the examiner will be carefully chosen, and I am taking that for granted.</P>
    <P>In my experience, notwithstanding the terms of reference, codes of practice and so on, of auditors, I do not think that the lay person or the employee of the company can always rely on auditors to bring to light what they know or what they suspect.  Perhaps it will be necessary to provide in the legislation that the examiner will be carefully chosen.  If that is the case, as I hope it will be, the examiner will have the competence to tussle with the ramifications of the kind of case, for example, that has precipitated this legislation.  Certainly whoever that examiner will be, in the event of his services being sought, he will need considerable competence and tenacity if he is to get to the bottom of what I described this morning as the financial slurry pit that we are dealing with in this case.  Why ought the examiner not be required to make an express statement of his suspicion as it relates to sections 33 and 34 of this legislation?  Otherwise it threatens to undermine the value of this mechanism, because it means, presumably, that if this experiment is a success and puts a stay on creditors for a sufficient period to allow a company to trade out of their temporary difficulty and be restored to financial health, the bad habits engaged in by the directors of that company can be resumed willy nilly.  It is important that there should be an express imposition that he should report whether he has formed an opinion that an inquiry under sections 33 and 34 would be necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This examination to be carried out by the examiner will be most <Col N="2219" /> intriguing.  As Deputy Bruton has pointed out, it would be disastrous if his inquiries and investigations were challenged by the courts from time to time. The most frightening aspect of this whole episode as far as the general public are concerned is the veil of secrecy which surrounds these companies because of the unlimited nature of public unlimited companies.  It is essential that the truth is arrived at.  When I say the truth I mean the ownership, the involvement, the sums owed and why such large sums are outstanding.</P>
      <P>I refer to the credit insurance scheme which is the centre of so much speculation. The amount owed by the Iraqis is being put as high as £180 million and as low as £50 million.  It seems rather extraordinary that one country could owe so much to just one firm.  I would like to ask the Minister if the investigation by the examiner will involve companies other than Goodman's chain of companies. I read at the weekend &mdash; I think it was in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>&mdash; that another meat company, Caher Meats, are owed something like £50 million.  I would like to know if operations like PARC are indemnified by the insurance scheme and if the Government have to fork up if the Iraqis default on that payment. I would like to know how many other companies are covered by the credit insurance scheme in Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole problem may not just be confined to Goodman and his related companies and the sum involved could be considerably greater.  The unravelling of the structure of the Goodman companies will obviously be extremely difficult and if this section 16 does not enable the examiner to find out what that structure is exactly, then we will have considerable trouble.  This matter could drag through the courts for years.  We had the very simple saga in recent times relating to Premier Meats, the ownership of which has been in dispute publicly.  Goodman, apparently, denied at all times that he had purchased that company and despite the Minister's investigations, none of us has ever been entirely satisfied <Col N="2220" /> that it was in his ownership.  Various companies have been located in places such as Lichtenstein, Australia and South America who had a controlling interest but we suspect Goodman has had a controlling interest in those companies.  The examiner's report will have to be very thorough and, as this will be the first time such an operation has been carried out here, I hope the examiner can penetrate the veil of secrecy which has surrounded the operations of the Goodman enterprises. It will have to penetrate and ascertain what has been happening.</P>
    <P>Accompanied with this we have the rather unsavoury situation of Goodman at present suing the Minister for Industry and Commerce for a considerable sum of money arising out of the withdrawal of the export insurance scheme.  That may complicate the matter further.  The amount the Government and the Minister are being sued for has been represented in the media to be something like £50 million.  There are other alarming reports which indicate that the sum could be as great as £500 million.  It is intriguing and frightening and I hope the examiner will have powers which supersede anything the courts might be able to counteract. If the examiner does not have such powers we are going to have a long legal wrangle and may find ourselves in a totally unsatisfactory state.  One can call it a slurry pit, a septic tank or whatever but it will be with us for many years.  I hope the report will not be as unsatisfactory in its conclusion as the investigation into the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  We never found out exactly who was to blame in that particular instance. It seems as if it was the Ministers in the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government who got the blame for the extraordinary mistakes made by the board and executives of AIB.  I hope in this case the blame will be laid where it lies and not with the taxpayer and the general public.  Let me sound a note of warning that the examiner's powers will have to be immense and override anything the courts might be able to throw back.</P>

      <P>In relation to the three <Col N="2221" /> amendments, I would in the first instance point out to Deputies, who were anxious to add various additional powers, duties or contents to the report of the examiner under section 16, that paragraph (i) would cover all the matters mentioned. Paragraph (i) reads, &ldquo;such other matters as the examiner thinks relevant or the court directs&rdquo;.  All the matters mentioned would be covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He could consider any of the matters referred to here relevant or, alternatively, the court may direct him to do so.  If something comes up in the course of the report that seems relevant to, say, sections 33 and 34, or to the question of reporting requirements, then the court can direct that it be dealt with.  It could be done at the outset before the report is drawn up.</P>
      <P>I would counsel Deputies to beware of loading too many requirements and duties on to the examiner's shoulders. The debate on these additional duties and requirements over the last 20 minutes or half an hour seemed to be predicated on the basis that the examiner was some form of policeman.  If he is it is only very incidental to his basic duty which is that of rescue of a company who are not irrevocably insolvent.  The danger of adding on a whole load of duties of this kind, additionally and specifically, to him is that it will divert him away from his primary rescue role which is what this legislation is about.  I agree that he should watch out, in the course of his activities and duties, for improprieties and bring them to the attention of the court or whatever other authorities are relevant.</P>
      <P>I think he is covered under paragraph (i) for that.  Given the times we live in, and the fact that one of the cowboys in England today got five years whereas in Ireland they tend not to get charged, not alone get five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it might be no <Col N="2222" /> harm, as an expression of the views of this House, even though it is not altogether necessary, to accept amendment No. 20 but it would have to be put differently.  It should go in as paragraph (i) rather than paragraph (j) because paragraph (i) will have to come at the end.  Therefore, the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; will have to be deleted before it and the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; inserted after the figure 34.  I think it is covered by paragraph (i) as it is but it might be no harm, as an expression of the views of the Oireachtas, if the House is agreeable, to have it in.</P>
      <P>On the question of amendment No. 23 and reporting requirements, the point Deputy Bruton made was valid enough, if the position remained as it was prior to the last week in June.  The House may or may not be aware that in the last week in June, at the last Internal Market Council under the Irish Presidency, a directive was adopted which has the effect of requiring reporting by certain categories of companies, including GMBH's in Germany and unlimited companies here in certain circumstances where they have limited companies among their shareholders. I pushed that rather hard and I am glad to say we got it adopted.  I was aware of the fact that within the past 12 months here there was widespread delimiting of a whole range of limited companies &mdash; that may not be the word to use but that was the effect of it &mdash; in the beef trade, in the supermarket trade and in a couple of other profitable trades. They transposed themselves from being limited to unlimited companies apparently for the purpose of avoiding the disclosure requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive adopted in June reimposes this as a matter of European law and we will be reflecting that directive in company legislation here.  We may be able to introduce it on Report Stage of the main companies Bill in the autumn but I am not clear if we can do that. We already have four or five of these directives in that Bill and we may be able to do it.  If we cannot do so in the autumn, we will certainly do so at the earliest opportunity.  It will be European law on 1 January 1992.  The reason I do not think <Col N="2223" /> that paragraph (j) is necessary is because the position has changed since the end of June and this will be covered.  It is very unsatisfactory that people, if they consider themselves big enough and strong enough, can avoid the requirements of disclosure by transforming themselves into unlimited companies whereas a relatively small trader, who is a limited company, has to make fairly significant disclosures about his affairs when they are not really relevant to the public good. They may be of some relevance to his creditors or those he trades with but they are not of any real relevance to the public welfare.  The affairs of a company that turns over £1 billion is relevant not just to those who directly trade with them but, perhaps, to hundreds of thousands of people in the country.  I am glad that point is covered and for that reason I do not think amendment No. 23 is necessary. Amendment No. 22 is covered by Deputy Bruton's first amendment.  The other points are covered by other paragraphs in section 16 and particularly in paragraph (i) and also in section 16 (e). I think the point is made by the inclusion of amendment No. 20.  If the House is agreeable I suggest we adopt it with the slight modifications I suggested.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my appreciation of the fact that amendment No. 20 is being accepted.  It is an indication of the force of the arguments made by Deputy Barrett and I and also by Deputy Spring.  However, I am not convinced of the Minister's reasons for his reluctance to accept amendment No. 23.  The argument he makes is that, as we <Col N="2224" /> are improving the reporting requirements for unlimited companies for the future, there is no need to require the examiner to report on non-compliance with existing reporting requirements.  To my mind they are two separate events and there is no logical connection between them.  The fact is that Deputy Spring has made certain serious allegations in this House in regard to the use of a shareholding by a limited company in an unlimited company as a means of avoiding existing reporting requirements.  It would appear that that is not a legally correct process to have adopted.  That is something that ought to be investigated.  Amendment No. 23 would require the examiner to investigate it and report on it, in this or in any other circumstance.  Obviously, amendment No. 23 would have the advantage that, when the new legislation, to which the Minister has referred, is enacted it will require the examiner to report on the compliance with the new improved legislation as well.  It is entirely consistent with what the Minister is saying.  What he is saying is in no sense an argument against implementing amendment No. 23.</P>

      <P>While the Minister is making some gesture he is availing of the minimalist approach when we should go to the other extreme because of the seriousness of the situation.  I would prefer that everything was in rather than a global phrase such as the present paragraph (i) which will become paragraph (j). Paragraph (j) will read:</P>
      <P>such other matters as the examiner thinks relevant or the court directs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear the Minister's acknowledgement that companies have been setting out to circumvent the responsibilities of unlimited liability but I am a little disturbed that the Minister feels that that solves the problem.  It is extremely important that any solution we are proposing, any examination which will be made, complies with the requirements of existing company law.  I did put a question to the Minister in relation to assets transferred outside the State and what powers <Col N="2225" /> the examiner might have to pursue that. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, could respond to that point.  The position will be different and there will be more regulations after 1992 in relation to the European Directive which the Minister informed us has been passed. That is all very well post-1992 but we are dealing with a very serious situation now. I would like to have some assurances from the Minister of State that the powers outlined to the examiner for the process of his reporting that will allow him to pursue companies where it becomes obvious that they have circumvented what is normally understood by the concept of unlimited liability.  If that has happened people should be brought before the courts.  That is something we are particularly bad at in this country.  It is the reason I proposed the amendments.  It is unfortunate that the Minister is going for the minimalist global paragraph (i).  It does not go as far as my own amendment No. 22 to section 16 which contains far more clarity than what the Minister is saying and which I believe is warranted by the situation now confronting us in relation to the difficulties facing the beef sector.  Perhaps the Minister of State can give me some clarification on what authority if any the examiner will have to pursue shareholders or company holders who have sold their creditworthiness on the basis of unlimited liability and who by clever, but devious device, have no liability at the end of the day.  Perhaps the Minister of State would clarify what powers the examiner has in relation to the pursuit of that and also in relation to section 16 (d) which states:</P>
    <P>whether in the opinion of the examiner any deficiency between the assets and liabilities of the company has been satisfactorily accounted for or, if not, whether there is evidence of a substantial disappearance of property that is not adequately accounted for.</P>
    <P>What powers does the examiner have to pursue any traces of the removal of property or the removal of cash from this country to countries abroad?</P>

He is free to report back on any aspect of the company involved.  In relation to saving the company and the jobs the examiner's role is very specific.  The Minister made it clear that he did not see the role of the examiner as being a policeman.  There are many sections which have reporting requirements of all kinds.  The Minister has given leeway to the Opposition in accepting the amendment put down and <Col N="2227" /> has gone a long way to facilitating the points put forward.</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect, Sir, while I found the Minister of State's contribution very interesting I am even more interested in his answer to the two questions put very specifically by Deputy Spring, that is, what power the examiner will have between the passage of this Bill and 1 January 1992, to which the Minister referred, and the question of transfers outside this jurisdiction.  It might be of great advantage to us in understanding the role of the examiner &mdash; as the Minister of State is so anxious that we do &mdash; if we had very definite replies to these questions.</P>
      <P>I might add a question of my own as well.  Before leaving the Minister referred to the fact that it had become known in his Department that there had been widespread delimiting of companies.  Perhaps he might give the House information as to the number of companies they came up with and in what sectors of Irish industry they were located.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear the full extent of Deputy Spring's contribution, but to answer his last point first, in relation to the powers of the examiner to pursue the people about whom he is concerned, if he looks at section 33 (1) he will see that it reads:</P>
      <P>If in the course of proceedings under this Act it appears that&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) any person was, while an officer of the company, knowingly a party to the carrying on of any business of the company in a reckless manner; or</P>
      <P>(b) any person was knowingly a party to the carrying on of any business of the company with intent to defraud creditors of the company, or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose; </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the court, on the application of the <Col N="2228" /> examiner, or any creditor or contributory of the company, may, if it thinks it proper to do so, declare that such person shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any part of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the court may direct.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that that is a fairly substantial power.  I might also point out that the report of the examiner will indicate to the creditors whether they would have a right personally &mdash; whether by virtue of this section or of section 297 of the 1963 Companies Act which is being extended, I think, by section 116 of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 &mdash; to pursue the responsible officers or directors. From that point of view the role of the examiner would act as quite an impetus to pursuing people who have hitherto endeavoured to hide behind the veil of incorporation or behind the concept of limited liability.</P>
    <P>I do not know what was the other point about transfers outside this jurisdiction. It would appear to me that if the examiner's report contains evidence of substantial disappearance of property from the company which is not readily accounted for, the officers in charge of the company at the time &mdash; if they cannot explain this occurrence &mdash; will be brought within the ambit of the provisions of section 298 of the Companies Act, 1963, being extended by section 116 of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I revert to that point? Throughout the day there was what I would consider to have been a fairly constructive passage of this Bill.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce in response to a point raised by Deputy Bruton and me &mdash; and I think Deputy Deasy &mdash; adverted to the fact that he and his Department were aware of the fact that many companies were using this device basically to run away from their responsibilities.  The Minister was able to inform us further that he welcomed the fact that the Council of Ministers had moved to do something about that. Because of the fact that the Minister himself has informed the House of this fact, which is relevant &mdash; we did not object to the information as being irrelevant &mdash; I would put it to the Minister of State very strongly that there is now an obligation on him, acting for the Minister who has ultimate responsibility in this area, not only to inform the House but to criculate in the House a copy of all the companies which have been brought to the attention of his Department in the past 12 to 18 months which have availed of this invidious process.  I believe that would be in the best interest of this House in relation to the serious undertaking we are pursuing here today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k) his opinion as to whether his work would be assisted by a direction of the court enhancing the powers, or extending the membership, of the creditors committee under section 21 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I might refer the House to section 21 which relates to the appointment of a committee of creditors, subsections (1) and (2) of which read:</P>
      <P>21.&mdash;(1) An examiner may, and if so directed by the court shall, appoint a committee of creditors to assist him in the performance of his functions.</P>
      <P>(2) Save as otherwise directed by the court, a committee appointed under subsection (1) shall consist of not more than five members and shall include the holders of the three largest unsecured claims who are willing to serve. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the examiner has very little discretion in relation to the composition and work of the committee of creditors except in circumstances in which the court will direct other than what is contained in this section.  What we <Col N="2231" /> are attempting to do here &mdash; in addition to other items on which the examiner would be reporting &mdash; is to ensure he would also have an opportunity of giving his opinion as to whether his work would be assisted by a direction of the court enhancing the powers or extending the membership of the creditors' committee under section 21 of this Bill.  It is highly unlikely that a court would extend the membership or the powers of the committee of creditors without the direction of the examiner. Therefore, we feel it would be beneficial to add this additional subsection to section 16 clearly outlining what is intended.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State may give the House more information but, as I understand it, the success of the Chapter 11 mechanism in the United States is due to the fact that a committee of creditors technically run a company as long as that company is under the protection of the courts.</P>
    <P>We spoke earlier of the need for consensus, for agreement, in order to have the provisions of this Bill properly implemented.  It is important that there be flexibility for the examiner, in regard to the composition of the committee of creditors and the work that committee should undertake under his guidance and direction.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment which would be in the best interests of the Bill as a whole.  I hope that my colleagues on this side of the House will also support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Deputy Barrett in regard to this amendment. The whole idea should be to get agreement between all the creditors.  At the moment the committee of creditors which is to be established will consist of only the five largest creditors.  In any company, particularly the one about which we are talking at the moment, there is a larger number of creditors than that and, if you get consensus, the biggest five will not necessarily speak for them all.  It should be possible to provide a flexible mechanism of extending the committee of creditors to work with the <Col N="2232" /> examiner to get an agreement thrashed out quickly rather than having them object to it in court.  The argument should be in a committee setting where the tendency is towards agreement rather than an adversarial type of relationship.</P>
      <P>It is in order that the examiner would be specifically requested to say to the court in his initial report whether the thought it would be a good idea to extend the committee of creditors by a court direction that we tabled this amendment. I hope it will be accepted because it is designed to achieve what the Minister wants &mdash; and what we all want &mdash; to minimise court conflict and to maximise consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak briefly on this amendment which I support because it has considerable merit which is magnified in the context of the company to which this Bill relates.  There are so many creditors that it would be very unsatisfactory if we relied on section 21.  It would be more businesslike and efficient if the amendment was accepted because it would enhance and strengthen the position of the examiner.  It would also go a long way towards achieving some unity of purpose if the business is to be saved.  In this instance, there are many smaller creditors, indeed many of the smaller creditors are institutions in their own right but they will take a severe beating in relation to their Irish operation. It is extremely important to allow them to have access to the creditors' meetings by way of this amendment.  It would strengthen the Bill and if the Minister is serious about providing the powers and the authority to the examiner, he should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It may be that, in regard to some of the matters the examiner is deciding on his own, he might consider sharing responsibility for them with the creditors' committee of his own accord and voluntarily if he felt that that would be conducive to getting their agreement to a scheme of arrangement, for instance, perhaps in regard to the disposal of assets.  Instead of taking the decision on his own he might feel he had a better chance of getting them to agree to the whole package if he said that he would not dispose of anything without consulting the creditors' committee.  Of course, to do that he would need court agreement to give the creditors' committee a responsibility in that area which they do not currently have.  Nothing could happen, of course, without the agreement of the court and the examiner suggesting it.  However, the examiner might feel that he had a better chance of getting agreement through power sharing than through a solo operation.</P>

The section says &ldquo;save as otherwise directed by the court&rdquo;, in other words, the court would already have power to change the composition of the membership of the committee but we are saying that the report should include the examiner's opinion so that it is there for everybody to see.  Perhaps in the course of his discussions with various creditors leading up to the presentation of his report, he might feel he could get a compromise or consensus if he could persuade the court to enhance the powers or extend the membership of the creditors' committee.  The more interest groups represented on the creditors' committee <Col N="2234" /> the greater the chance there is of getting consensus, agreement and resolution to a problem.</P>

      <P>In page 14, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following paragraphs: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;(j) whether information or circumstances have come to his attention in the course of the performance of his functions under this Act from which it appears to him that any past or present officer, or any member, of the company may be guilty of any offence in relation to the company for which that person would be criminally liable;</P>
      <P>(k) whether in his opinion the whole or any part of the undertaking of the company would be more likely to be capable of survival if any or all of the directors or other officers of the company were removed from office or any member of the company were required to dispose of his shares in the company;</P>
      <P>(l) whether, in his opinion, proper books of account have been kept by the company and have been made available to him for his inspection, and whether he has, by act or omission, been obstructed or hindered in the performance of his functions under this Act by any officer or member of the company;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(m) whether it appears to him that any transaction was entered into by the company during a period in which it was unlikely to be able to pay its debts as they fell due for payment (taking into account the <Col N="2235" /> contigent and prospective liabilities of the company) in circumstances which were prejudicial to the interests of any creditor or creditors (whether secured or unsecured, and including prospective and contingent creditors) of the company;</P>
    <P>(n) a statement as to any steps taken by him in discharge of the duties imposed on him by the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, and the European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give a fulsome reply to my question regarding the information already before the Department. Will he make that information available to Members of the Oireachtas because it is extremely important that it is made available to us in relation to the responsibilities we share in regard to this legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Spring is going back on a discussion that took place before the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, left, in relation to the question of delimiting limited companies.  This has created a certain amount of concern.  The Minister clearly indicated the position in regard to this issue and he also said, in relation to company legislation, that he would consider this matter in the overall Companies Bill which deals with other vitally important aspects and which will also have to come before the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Minister wondered whether he could introduce an amendment on Committee Stage in relation to unlimited companies in the context of the European decision which was taken during the Irish Presidency in June and which will be implemented on 1 January 1992.  This amendment cannot be incorporated in this Bill at this stage.  We are dealing specifically with a vehicle for the rescue of companies and the appointment of an examiner.  I do not think the Minister indicated that he would include the amendment in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2236" /> In relation to the information being sought by Deputy Spring about specific companies which have recently taken a particular avenue, that information is available in the Companies Office.  I think the Deputy is anxious that we would make that information available to the House.  I do not think information could be given about specific companies because they may have certain reasons for taking a particular course of action which may not be related to the company. The Deputy may be prejudging the retionale behind their decisions.  As the Minister has pointed out, there have been certain developments in this regard and as President of the Council of Ministers he suggested this requirement at the Council meeting in Brussels.  We would not have the opportunity of getting the information Deputy Spring is seeking at this point in time.  The Minister is aware of Deputy Spring's request and he can put down a question at the appropriate time in relation to the number of companies involved.</P>

The Minister referred to this point, completely unsolicited to an extent, and I got the impression that he had the information at hand.  Perhaps the Minister and his advisers could see whether they could make that information available to us on Report State this evening.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister of State but I do not think he appreciates the seriousness of the debate which has taken place here today.  This is a very central part of the discussion which has taken place in relation to the avenues being used by companies to avoid their responsibilities.  I believe that information is on the Minister's desk and would be of help to the rest of us, the public and the bankers who are listening to this debate.</P>

      <P>In page 14, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k) the extent to which the company availed of the provisions of section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987, for the purposes of raising finance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is related specifically to Goodman International.  As the House will recollect, in December 1987 the Taoiseach summoned a press conference to announce the details of a package of assistance for a large number of new processing plants and expansions which were to take place under the aegis of Goodman International.  I understand that the IDA decision to facilitate that package had been rushed through the IDA at the behest of the Taoiseach and under pressure from him.  I understand also that the pressure to facilitate that package came more from the Taoiseach's office than from Goodman International.  In fact, it was the Taoiseach rather than Goodman International who were concerned at having it rushed through so quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is well aware, the extra jobs and processing capacity promised at that elaborate press conference never happened and, in fairness, none of the specific grants promised to be paid out by the IDA has been paid to Goodman International either.  I am not saying that the IDA gave the Goodman Group money that they ought not to have got but part of the package which was not <Col N="2238" /> announced on that occasions but which I believe was part of the agreement was a change in the Finance Act.  That change in the Finance Act was part of the deal and without it the deal would not have occurred and the Goodman Group would not have committed themselves to the expansion.  That part of the deal was delivered by the enactment of section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987, which involved exempting food companies from a general provision which had been made the year before in section 52 of the Finance Act, 1986.  The Finance Act, 1986, said that, where a company received a grant from the IDA towards the cost of a machine, they should be able to claim a capital allowance only in respect of the cost of the machine to which they had contributed from their own funds.  They could not claim a capital allowance against taxes in respect of the money they had got from the taxpayer in the first place through the IDA, on the sensible basis that that would be essentially double accounting.</P>
    <P>For some unexplained reason the Goodman Group felt, and the Minister agreed, that food companies should be exempted from that very sensible general requirement.  It would appear that section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987, was introduced specifically in order to facilitate the agreement of the Goodman Group to this elaborate grant package which the Taoiseach, rather than the Goodman Group, was so anxious should go through and which he, rather than the Minister responsible, was so keen to announce.  This was most unusual because during my time as Minister for Industry and Commerce I can never remember the Taoiseach, Deputy Garrett FitzGerald, saying &ldquo;move over, I want to make this announcement.&rdquo;  He did not do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Obviously, if an amendment to a Finance Bill which was introduced specifically to facilitate a package and designed to promote employment creation in Ireland was used to fund activities overseas while the investment activities in Ireland did not take place, that would be wrong, and we are entitled to know and have in the report of the examiner a clear statement as to whether that happened.  The purpose of amendment No.24 is to ensure that the examiner's report contains that specific information.  It is important that that be dealt with definitively.  It should not be a matter for innuendo or discussion in this House or anything like that.  Let it be put into the examiner's report and let us have the facts once and for all.</P>

Mysteriously, or not, this came back in by virtue of section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987.  We have referred on many occasions today to the press conference and the attempts by the Taoiseach to launch a big programme and, effectively, put Mr. Goodman in charge of the development of the Irish beef sector <i>in toto.</i></P>
      <P>As has been said, there were IDA grants for various projects around the country that never materialised. This amendment warrants inclusion in what is required in the examiner's report.  That will take this whole area out of political argy-bargy.  This amendment is the best and most clinical way of dealing with our business.  If the Minister of State has any strenuous objection to including it the suspicion will still lie there in relation to the motivation.  It would be far better in relation to the way we do our business in this House if the Minister of State, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, would accept this amendment because we would be nailing this down once and for all with no more messing or beating around the bush.  I am inclined to say when things are alleged and not denied in this House that then they stand, and, indeed, many things are standing as of now because they have not been denied.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an opportunity to establish his bona fides in relation to this transaction.  Let us remove the doubt, the shadow of doubt which will persist if the Minister resists Deputy Bruton's and Deputy Barrett's efforts to include this amendment which I believe is well founded.  It offers a possibility for this House to establish the facts with no messing around the place.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to have missed the initial part of this discussion. Earlier in this debate I complimented the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the overhaul he has done on the wider companies Bill much of which I agree <Col N="2241" /> with, but if the Minister wants to maintain his untranished reputation it is incumbent on him in the context of this legislation to take this amendment on board.</P>
      <P>In my contribution on Second Stage I dealt at some length with information that has come into my possession which impinges centrally on the implications of this amendment.  It is possible to argue that we cannot enact legislation designed to meet the exigencies of one company, but then, of course, this is not legislation introduced in normal times or circumstances. Since we are all agreed in this House on who is likely to be or may be the first beneficiary &mdash; if that is the word &mdash; of this legislation, and having regard to the information I laid before the House this morning concerning the abuse and misuse of section 84 lending, it is imperative that this amendment be taken on board.  If it is true &mdash; and it was not denied &mdash; that a substantial part of the package of section 84 lending was drawn down for purpose other than those approved by the Government in the package that has been referred to, then it is all the more important that this is taken on board.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's advice when replying concerning the procedure to be adopted now and on counselling the banks if they consider they have a case for wrongful use, if the section 84 facility was misleadingly availed of or if they were told less than the whole truth and how they should go about putting things right.  That is all very well, but it does not get to the heart of the issue that is being raised here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scandal of this proportion in the US would be on the front page of every newspaper for weeks.  In the context of our small economy a group of companies who claim to account for 4 to 5 per cent of the GNP of the State is enormous.  The taxpayer, and the public, are entitled to know to what extent these companies availed of the section 84 facility that was included in an extremely generous and, in my view, partisan package by the then Fianna Fáil Government that resulted in all our eggs in the beef sector effectively <Col N="2242" /> being put into the Goodman basket and being drawn down and utilised for purposes other than were approved.  Therefore, I consider Deputy Bruton's amendment is necessary in the context of the reasons the Dáil has been reconvened and it is imperative that the Minister take it on board.</P>

This Bill will assist in the saving of many jobs in the future.  Deputies who debated the Committee Stage of the main Bill are aware of the general acceptance of this section in the main Bill.  It was welcomed by all sides at that time.</P>
      <P>The policing or monitoring of aspects of the Finance Acts is not an appropriate duty for the examiner.  His duty is to see how the rehabilitation of the company can be achieved.  Placing other duties on the examiner that are not central to his role can only hinder him in the attainment of his objective.  Whatever provisions are placed in the Finance Acts should be monitored, if necessary, by appropriate arrangements.  It is not a duty, however, that should be placed on the examiner. The examiner should not spend the precious time available going down certain avenues in relation to the Finance Acts, and how they were dealt with by a company. I do not think that is appropriate to this Bill.</P>

      <P>In the course of the examination certain information will come to light, more than likely, about the affairs of a specific company.  I want to make it clear that as far as I am concerned I am not accepting the amendment because it is taking from the main thrust of the Bill which is to allow to examiner to rescue companies in difficulties now and in the future.  It is not his or her job to examine the implementation of sections of the Finance Acts at particular times or how they were used by a company.  We are taking away from the responsibility of the examiner which is to rescue the company and ensure that jobs are retained.  It is not his responsibility to become involved in following the allegations made about a specific company which is not mentioned in the legislation and which may or may not avail of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt, from the contribution the Deputy made on Committee Stage of the original Bill, that the would not expect the examiner to carry out this function.  The examiner's function is to save jobs.  There are other Acts which he may be required to look into when he takes over the responsibilities given to him by the court in relation to the examination of a company.  No doubt information will come to the examiner in the course of his examination of a company and that is normal.  It is not part of the examiner's job to go into the background of a particular section of a particular Act to see how a company availed of certain facilities which were <Col N="2244" /> available to them.  I am not accepting the amendment.</P>

It is an utter joke to try to persuade the public and Members of this House that we are dealing with normal legislation.  The Government have decided that this is a vehicle to deal with a major problem facing the beef industry and in particular with Goodman International.

      <P>Who is fooling whom? All we are doing here, because we are dealing with the Goodman problem &mdash; and let us not pretend that we are not &mdash; is asking the extent to which the company availed of the provisions of section 25 of the 1987 Finance Act for the purpose of raising finance.  That will only apply to one or two companies.  If it is put into the legislation it will not impose any massive burden on the examiner.  It will apply only to companies involved in food processing who received grants.  I do not know how the Minister of State can say this amendment is not suitable for this legislation. This is 28 August.  It is very suitable for the case before us which is that we allow legislation to be passed in order to deal with a major problem in the Goodman Group.  We are still awaiting answers from the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance as to what sort of deals were done in relation to the restoration of export credit insurance for this company.  Taxpayers are exposed to laibilities in excess of £100 million as a result of a deal which was worked out.  Part of that deal is contained in section 25 of the 1987 Finance Act and part of it was displayed on television when a so-called expansion package was launched.</P>
      <P>We live in a democracy and the people who elect us expect us to answer truthfully questions which are raised when decisions taken by a Government have caused serious problems to thousands of people.  Thousands of people depend on the beef industry and we deserve better than waffle from the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce in reply to a simple amendment which is clearly seen to be defending some behind-the-scenes agreement that took place in 1987.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has arrived back in the Chamber.  I would like to hear what he has to say about this amendment and why it cannot be included in this.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's reaction to this amendment &mdash; the Minister has not had a chance to speak on it yet &mdash; is a good test of the sincerity of the Government in regard to this legislation and the Minister's sense of freedom of action.  The Minister of State, who spoke in a rather extraordinary way, described the Bill as one to rescue companies and save jobs.  This Bills is to amend the Companies Acts, of which this is an <i>ad hoc</i> extract to meet particular urgent needs, which are designed, among other things, to ensure against malpractice of various kinds, and it is appropriate that the legislation before us should ensure that, where an examiner is appointed to a company, all information of the kind that is normally required under the Companies Acts should be extracted.  I hope the Minister shares this view and is genuinely concerned that these matters are brought out into the light of day and are not covered up.  Everything in his record so far has shown that that is his wish, and I would be very disappointed if he took a different line on this occasion.</P>

Where as the Minister of State tried to say that it was not the function of the examiner to clarify these matters in relation to section 25 of the 1987 Finance Act, I say that it is central to the whole debate.  There is an obligation on the examiner in relation to companies in difficulty to establish that they have done everything by the book otherwise.  The Minister has expressed grave dissatisfaction with this type of business. Now there is an opportunity once and for all to clarify the matter.  I would appeal to the Minister to allow this amendment to stand.</P>

Before I went out for a break I sought to caution the House in respect of a number of these amendments against loading too many duties on then examiner which were extraneous to his central role under this legislation of trying to rescue companies.</P>
      <P>Many of the Deputies who have been speaking over the last hour or two are, foremost, anxious to have some sort of policing in respect of companies or the directors of companies that are in trouble rather than trying to rescue the companies, and I think that is wrong.

      <P>Whatever horse I was on in the months of February, March April and May of 1989 when I raised these matters in this House first, I got fairly limited support and I have no apologies to make to anybody.  I see no reason to disagree with what the Minister of State has said on this occasion.  In fact, it accords with what I have said, that to load a long list of policing duties on to the examiner will only distract him from the central duties he will have under this Bill, when it is enacted, to try to rescue companies.</P>
      <P>I am ready to show my good faith in this matter, to express my agreement that anything untoward should not in any sense be protected or covered up.  I accepted amendment No. 20 in the names of Deputies Bruton and Barrett to the effect that if any facts are disclosed which would warrant any further inquiries under section 33 or 34 they had to be included in the examiner's report.  I think that would cover matters the present amendment seeks to cover just as well as general, criminal or civil liability matters.  That is perfectly broad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would again point out to Deputies, as I did before I went out, that paragraph (i) of this section says &ldquo;such other matters as the examiner thinks relevant or the court directs&rdquo;.  I cannot imagine a paragraph that could be wider in its effect than that and there is no activity which either the examiner or the court might think in any way improper that they are not entitled to report and comment on and refer to their relevant authorities under that paragraph.  I really think that people should not, therefore, be making <Col N="2249" /> an unnecessary song and dance about this because any impropriety that allegedly may or may not have happened under this section of this Finance Act &mdash; and I do not know whether it did or not &mdash; is clearly covered by the amendment I have already accepted as well as by paragraph (i) of section 16.</P>

All that this requires is the publication of information about whether it availed of this.  It does not involve any suggestions of malpractice or anything like that, simply the publication of information.  I am surprised that Deputy O'Malley would not want that.  However, we have heard this debate up and down and it is time to vote on it so that the matter can be decided by the House one way or the other.</P>

In fact, it is not even a breach of it; it is that he has to report on whether the company availed of it or not, and availed of it apparently quite lawfully.  I certainly do not think that is a matter that the examiner should be called upon to report on.  Why not have any other section of any other Finance Bill in it?  Why not have whether they complied with or availed of section 84 or sections relating to VAT, PAYE, PRSI or anything else?</P>

      <P>By Deputy Bruton's own admission this proposal seems to be directed specifically at just one company. I do not think this is the way to write law.</P>
      <P>We have to look at what the function of the examiner is.  It is to decide, in the first 21 days of his stewardship if a company can be saved, how it can be saved and whether an arrangement can be put in place to save the company.  That is a difficult, arduous task.  He has a short 21 days to do it.  I would like to know whether a company paid their rates, whether they paid their employees' holiday pay, whether they complied with the law on pollution control etc., but I do not think that all these matters or compliance with section 25 of the Finance Act are properly the function of an examiner.  If there has been some abuse of that section, the Revenue Commissioners have extensive powers to investigate fully in the fullness of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The examiner has a specific function. <Col N="2251" /> He has a very short period of time, particularly when compared with the United States legislation, to carry out a thorough examination of the financial affairs of a company and make recommendations as to whether that company should be saved.  It is inappropriate and illogical to load a whole lot of extraneous duties and functions on the examiner.  We would all like to find out about these matters but it is not the function of a company examiner to pursue them, to give opinions on them or to report on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 49 and in page 7, lines 1 to 8, to delete paragraph (f).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment concerns the rather unusual provision in section 5 of this Bill, where, for the period of an examinership, the guarantees given by third parties in respect of moneys loaned to the company shall be put on ice.  Putting third party guarantees on ice is not necessary for the saving of a company.  Only the debts owed by the company must be put on ice in order to protect the company.  Moneys owed by third parties on foot of guarantees given to the company are a separate matter and there is no need to put them on ice at all to protect the company.  Clearly, given that such guarantees are likely to be given to the company in most cases by directors of the company in respect of payment of loans borrowed by the company, given that it is these directors of the company who are likely to petition for protection under this legislation, also given that it is these directors who will select the person who is to be the examiner and propose <Col N="2255" /> his name to the court for approval, if they are the ones who are making the petition for protection, it seems to be quite odd, if they have given a guarantee in respect of repayment of a loan, that the very fact that a petition had been granted in regard to protecting the company should also provide protection in regard to guarantees undertaken by individual directors of the company or indeed any other third party who may have given a guarantee to a company.  There is no need from the point of view of protecting the company to also protect any individuals against being pursued in respect of guarantees that they owe.</P>
    <P>One of the inherent characteristics of a successful banking system and one of the reasons companies can get finance is that it is possible to have guarantees by individuals to back up lending to companies. The Irish banks have tended to overuse that facility, and I have proposed in the Special Committee on the Companies Bill that guarantees should be capable of being required only in respect of a proportion of the total amount lent by a financial institution to a company. That is something that would apply in the future if it were passed.  In this case, however, what we have is a situation where money was lent to a company in the past on the basis of a guarantee given in the past and the bank decided that that guarantee was sufficient to justify lending the money.  Now new legislation will be introduced literally overnight which will have retrospective effect in so far as it will suspend the operation of any such guarantees for the full duration of the examination of the company's affairs. As part of the scheme of settlement of the company's affairs, it is open to the court to decide to set aside those guarantees, because under section 17, following a hearing made under the section, the court may make such orders as it deems fit which could include any matter which is related to it, and given that paragraph (f) of section 5 &mdash; guarantees given by <Col N="2256" /> individuals &mdash; is one of the matters which is the subject of a stopping order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by virtue of the appointment of an examiner, it is not unreasonable to expect that the court might well feel that it was within its remit to make an order in regard to that matter just as it might well be the case that the examiner would consider that it would be appropriate for him to make proposals in regard to that matter because the legislature had included in the ambit of protection not just the company but also any individual who had guaranteed the company's debts.  I do not believe that would be right and there should not be any doubt about the matter.  There is no need for the purposes of protecting the company to provide protection also in regard to individuals who may have guaranteed individual debts to the company whether to banks or, as Deputy Mervyn Taylor mentioned realistically, to individual suppliers to the company. For that reason paragraph (f) of section 5 (2) should be removed and that is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

      <P>In supporting this amendment may I refer to the Goodman case today very briefly on a point of information. What legal advice has the Minister received regarding Goodman International's legal case against the Government which arose as a result of the withdrawal of export credit insurance?  Will the Government be at risk of further and potentially much larger claims for damages if, as a result of the Minister's stance, the Goodman Group are forced into closure.  If it is subsequently held that the Minister's refusal to pay this claim precipitated the closure of the Goodman Group of companies, by how much would the State be at risk if damages range as high as £1 <Col N="2257" /> billion?  May I have that information, please?</P>

Could not the funds claimed by Goodman be placed in a <Col N="2258" /> special fund which would be made available to pay farmers and suppliers of goods and services, pending an immediate determination by the courts of the legal claim?  This would ensure that the Government could not be held responsible for the closure of Goodman International and would assist farmers at this very crucial time.  If it transpired that the Goodman claim was not valid, the Government could then stand in the shoes of the farmers for any money owed to them and seek redress from the company, its examiner or liquidator in due course?

      <P>Deputy Bruton has reintroduced this amendment on Report Stage.  Despite the debate which I felt was constructive on Committee Stage he has made precisely the same point on Report Stage.  Deputy Bruton is seeking to suggest that on foot of section 5 (4) a court could, after the examinership is over, wipe out personal guarantees by third persons to the company concerned on foot of a petition brought to the court by interested parties set out in section 2. If Deputy Bruton honestly believes that to be possible, his knowledge of contract law astounds me.  There is no point in asking the Deputy to reply on Report Stage because, as I understand it, he may not do so but perhaps somebody else from that side of the House will explain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Can Deputy Bruton explain to me how he can confer section 17 (3) powers on the examiner on the basis of the report being brought forward by the examiner at the hearing in the court after he has made his findings.  I do not know how an intelligent man can suggest that there is even the remotest possibility that any judge has the power to wipe out what is a contractual debt owed to an individual when the examinership is over.</P>

      <P>One cannot seek to come in here, speculate, throw contract law out the door in so doing and expect to present a credible case.  If a contractual debt is owed and is suspended during the period of examinership, when the examinership comes to an end, the contractual debt reverts to where it was in the first place.  To suggest that a court has the power to supersede that is to give to a judge of the High Court powers he simply cannot have because they are not issues which are before him.  What is before him is the examiner's report on whether he should wind-up, appoint a receiver or make other ancillary orders relevant to the report he is presenting before the judge.  No other order can be made. Having listened to Deputy John Bruton advance detailed, constructive and helpful suggestions on Committee Stage of the main Bill &mdash; the Special Committee which I chaired over a number of months when we spent long days and nights on it &mdash; I find astounding for him to come up with a suggestion like that as being a possible construction of the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early debate on Committee Stage when this was being discussed the Minister's reaction was such that I thought there might be an amendment forthcoming from him on this section.  He seemed to take some of the points being made then.  One of the points he made himself seemed to me, in logic, to require at least an amendment to the section, whatever about acceptance of our amendment, because he related subsection (f) to subsection (c) and said they were part of the same process.  Those were not the exact words he used, but he contended that they were related to each other.  In fact subsection (c) is about attachment, sequestration and so on against the property or effects of the company whereas subsection (f) relates to attachment, sequestration against the property or effects of the person.  So he is right; the two seem to relate to the same thing, the company and the person and, in each case, to attachment, sequestration, distress or execution.  The point was also made that subsection (c) is governed by the phrase &ldquo;except with the consent of the examiner&rdquo;.  But those words are omitted from subsection (f) which appears to me to be difficult to explain.  Certainly it does not enhance the Minister's argument in relation to it as far as I understood it.  In replying perhaps the Minister could clarify that.  I had thought there would have been an amendment from him on this section, at least dealing with that point.  It seemed to me he was willing to consider some of the points being made.  I am surprised we have not got anything from him on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points made here are important. It is not an easy Bill to understand.  I think I have followed most of the points made so far but I really do not understand the purpose of the inclusion of this subsection. I can imagine possible reasons for it but normally I would expect the Minister to give us those reasons.  In his reply, the Minister has failed totally to justify the subsection although it may well be that there is a case for it.  I am in some difficulty in that, first, I have not heard an explanation of why it is here. <Col N="2261" /> The Minister justified it without explaining it on grounds that seemed to require, in logic, the addition of the words &ldquo;except with the consent of the examiner&rdquo;.  He seemed willing to come back with something but has not.</P>
    <P>In replying I wonder if the Minister could explain rather better than he has so far just what this subsection is doing here.  On the face of it it seems to be an inappropriate protection for an individual in a Bill designed to protect a company, to keep it going, viable, for the time being until it is possible to establish whether it, or parts of it, is capable of surviving.  So far no reason has been given as to why this is extended to persons who are liable to pay on foot of a guarantee or otherwise.  The Minister really owes it to the House in this case to do what has been done elsewhere, but not in this instance, that is to explain rather better than he has, the purpose of this subsection, to justify its inclusion and the omission of the provision &ldquo;except with the consent of the examiner&rdquo; which seems required by virtue of the analogy he drew between this subsection and subsection (c).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Garret FitzGerald has quite correctly made the point regarding the difference in the wording between subsections (c) and (f).  To draw the argument on to its logical conclusion one comes to the ridiculous possible position in which, in an appropriate case, the examiner might be giving his consent to attachment, sequestration or distress against the company whereas a guarantor would retain the exemption granted to him under the provisions of subsection (f).  That surely would be an absurd position to be reached&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one that could not possibly have been intended.  Deputy FitzGerald also raised a question as to why this clause had been included in the first place.  In fairness, the Minister did <Col N="2262" /> give an explanation on Committee Stage as to why it had been inserted &mdash; a very logical, cogent reason for having that clause there to cover what might be called the garnishee-type position so that the inter-relationships of the company itself <i>vis-à-vis</i> its debtors or creditors would not be interfered with during the course of the examinership.  That is perfectly logical and understandable.  But the section goes somewhat wider than that and there is no saver for the guarantee position.  The Minister did not address himself to that specific point when it was debated on Committee Stage.  I am interested to hear from the Minister in particular: does he accept that the wording of this section is sufficiently wide to cover the guarantee as well as the garnishee case?  It seems to me quite clearly that it does.  I strongly suspect that, in the parliamentary draftsman's office, that was not the intention.  It would be contrary to all logic if it had been the intention, having regard to the fact that, as I said on Committee Stage, in a receivership or liquidation &mdash; which is the ultimate position so far as a company is concerned &mdash; the liability of a personal guarantor remained totally unaffected throughout either by the receivership or the liquidation.  That is a separate matter as between the guarantor and the person who supplied the goods or whatever.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to hear whether the Minister accepts that subsection (f) is sufficiently wide as it stands to include a guarantor and, if so, why he has not brought forward a saver or exception to exclude the guarantee position from his coverage of the garnishee-type position which he gave, in which I fully support him and agree is absolutely necessary, logical and appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say I do not agree with Deputy John Bruton's interpretation of section 17 (3).  I would agree with the comments of Deputy Cowen in that regard.  I do not think it is in any way acceptable to say that the provisions of section 17 (3) give the court the kind of discretion to do <Col N="2263" /> literally anything it wants arising out of an examinership.  That would not be so; there would be the confines of the Act and so on; that would be a limited position.  Deputy Cowen made the point that to say otherwise would throw the ordinary law of contract out the window. He is quite right in that regard.  May I say this to Deputy Cowen: if we leave this as it is, with this guarantee position, that is throwing contract law out the window.  It is never in the contemplation of a person who gives a guarantee or one who needs to get such guarantee, seeks it and is given it, that some entirely extraneous matter of the company going into receivership, liquidation or examinership will affect an outside contract.  Consequently, that would be throwing contract law out the window.  There is no justification or basis that I can see for so doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Play has been made here of the question of banks and so on. As I have said, one would not feel very much sympathy with banks if they were all the section was to be in aid of.  On thinking about this further, it occurred to me that there could well arise circumstances in which, far from the bank being the institution that would exploit this provision, the bank could be the body that would be saved by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It occurred to me that, far from the bank exploiting this, they could be saved by it because a very big company, if it was necessary to do so, could have arranged for their own bank to give a guarantee, that the bank were the guarantor to an outside trader who was supplying goods or services to that big public or private company.  In a sense this is not relevant to the central issue involved and I cannot see why it would be necessary to put in that clause in the case of a guarantor.  When guarantors sign guarantees they go into the transaction with their eyes open and it could <Col N="2264" /> be crucially important to the person who sought the guarantee.  I instanced the case of a small beef supplier who might be worried about getting his money before he supplied the beef and would insist on getting a guarantor from the processors' bank or personal directors and to whom four months delay would be crucial.</P>
    <P>I do not accept Deputy Cowen's point that it does not really affect the person as the money is in suspension for four months.  Four months can be a very long time in a business transaction and in what happens to a company even when the examiner is in.  Being deprived of money for four months could well be crucial to a small supplier.  In some cases it could mean the ruination of his business and could be the reason for insisting on getting a guarantee before agreeing to supply the beef.  The Minister did not have an opportunity to clarify this on Committee Stage and perhaps he will do so now to assist the House.</P>

      <P>I cannot deal with the matter now as I wish to raise a point of order.  Unfortunately, due to the speed at which all this is happening, it was impossible for my staff to draft an amendment which we agreed should be considered and put forward in relation to section 4.  It only became available after Report Stage had begun as there was no interval at the end of the division.  Report Stage began in respect of an amendment to section 5 and we were not able to put down the amendment to section 4.  It is not possible for me or others to run off amendments as they come into our heads; we must have them checked and approved by the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an amendment in relation to a point made by Deputy O'Dea and others on section 4 (3) dealing with related companies and where the period of protection of the related company was expressed to be contemporaneous with the period of protection of the original company, the <Col N="2265" /> protected company, even though the order in respect of the related company would have been made subsequent to the order in relation to the original protected company.  We were trying to cover the point that it could not be backdated to the date of the protection order on the first company because there might have been an active sequestration or execution in respect of the related company subsequent to the date of the protection order on the original company but prior to the date of the order in respect of the related company.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have checked with the Attorney General's and parliamentary draftsman's offices about this amendment. The advice I have received from the parliamentary draftsman's office is that, where one is freezing the money in regard to a company, which is the intention under this legislation, and the freezing is for a limited period, it is desirable to retain section 5 (2) (f) in order not to create an impossibly confused situation which would otherwise arise.  If it was open for some creditors to move against guarantors the situation would be changing all the time and the indebtedness of the company to certain people would change in the course of the period of protection.  That would be undesirable and would make it very difficult for the examiner to cope with because, at some stage during the period of protection, the guarantors would become creditors or <Col N="2271" /> prospective creditors.  It was felt on consideration that this would be impossible because it would cause enormous confusion, which I can well accept.</P>
      <P>I thought I gave a very full explanation of my view in relation to this matter on Committee Stage.  I think Deputy Taylor took my point and he agreed that in so far as this relates to garnishees it makes absolute sense and is perfectly acceptable. I am glad Deputy Taylor has reiterated that now.  I would point out to the Deputy that it covers guarantees as well as garnishees.  If it is appropriate in respect of a garnishee equally it must be appropriate in respect of a guarantee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;otherwise I could see all kinds of subterfuges being used to circumvent it.  I would remind Deputies that it has been a cause of complaint in this House and in the Special Committee that banks were seeking too many personal guarantees from the proprietors of small and medium size companies at a very expensive rate.  They had to pledge their houses and so on in order to give security to the bank for the borrowings of the companies they owned or ran.</P>
      <P>If it is going to be possible to sue a guarantor in respect of a company's debts while the company is under protection it will mean that every lender to a company, almost without exception, will want a personal guarantee because he will be able to get at the managing director, chairman or whoever.  Section 5 (2) which relates to suing, sequestration and so on, will not apply to the guarantor but will apply to the main debt.  If Deputy Taylor agrees it is in appropriate that it should be possible or allowed to circumvent this prohibition on sequestration through garnishee, I think he will agree on reflection that the principle is exactly the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not prepared to accept this amendment because I do not believe it makes sense.  Deputy Taylor goes with me at least 50 per cent of the way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we are dealing with this matter under such pressure of time.  In the normal course of events, in the gap between Committee Stage and Report Stage, one would have had an opportunity to check, for example, whether there is protection extended to guarantee guarantors of debts as well as to the company themselves under the equivalent British legislation. I would be interested to know if that is a common provision to have in company protection legislation.  The case the Minister made against the amendment was basically in two parts.  The first part was that if you allowed guarantors to be pursued that would create, if the pursuit was successful, a new debt on the part of the company to the guarantor <Col N="2274" /> who had to pay up and there would be uncertainty, therefore, as to the amount of the debts of the company.  The amount of the debts of the company would be changing, so to speak, during the course of the examinership and the Minister felt that would create an unnecessary uncertainty. That is a valid point.</P>
      <P>However, it would be wrong to say it is a sufficient reason necessarily for removing the property right which is owned by somebody when they have been given a guarantee.  In this regard the value of the assets of the company will be changing all the time throughout the examinership anyway.  The value of what the company own may be going up or going down depending on movements in the market.  You are dealing with a moving target at all times anyway, so presumably any scheme or arrangement that would be entered into would be entered into with regard to percentages of assets rather than terms of absolute sums of money.  Therefore, if it transpired that there were more debts owing by the company than was originally thought as a result of guarantees being called in, that would mean the percentages applying would apply to a smaller amount of money than was originally thought.  It would, therefore, be quite practical.  There would not be the practical difficulty the Minister has suggested in this regard at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor made a clear distinction, which he is well qualified to do, better qualified than I am, between the two species of guarantee that might arise one of which, a garnishee, he felt should be excluded and the other which he felt should not be excluded.</P>

      <P>I do not want to speak about the matter because I do not feel I have the knowledge required to speak authoritatively about that distinction, but I believe that what we are doing here is <Col N="2275" /> removing a property right of one third party as against another third party in order to protect the company.  The Supreme Court has interpreted property rights quite severely.  There might be a public policy justification to interfere with property rights in order to protect the company if those were property rights against the company, but I do not think there would be public policy justifications to set aside the constitutional rights of property where those property rights are enforceable not against the company being protected but against a third party.  Essentially this is retrospectively reducing the value of a person's property right.  I do not think the constitutional excuse that might be given for this would hold up in this case.  Part of the possible application of paragraph (f) is liable to be unconstitutional on those grounds. That is a further reason for not including it, particularly not including it in rushed legislation of this kind.  Article 43 of the Constitution is very clear in regard to the protection of property rights. Undoubtedly a guarantee obtained is a property right which the State can interfere with only in a very measured and justified fashion which I do not believe can be justified in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 10, after &ldquo;examiner&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or at the time of presentation to it of a petition for protection of the court under this Part&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is an attempt to make it possible for the court to give to the examiner complete powers to run the company at the time of presentation to it of a petition for protection of the court under this Part.  Section 9 (1) provides that where it appears to the court at any stage on application of the examiner that it is just and equitable to do so, it may make an order that all or any of the functions or powers which are vested in or exercisable by the directors shall be performable or exercisable only by the examiner.  Therefore, there is provision in section 9 for the court on application to give those powers to the examiner at any stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of our amendment would be that it would prevent the examiner having to go back to the court.  In other words, we can reduce the number of court hearings. If at the very outset it is quite obvious to the court that it is just and equitable, then it can straight away give the examiner the necessary powers.  We think this would be a sensible provision to include in this section of the Bill. Again, of course, it would save time and reduce expense.  The advice given to us has been always that the biggest difficulty about this proposal is that you may have conflict of interests in so far as in the initial stages the examiner will not have <Col N="2277" /> complete control in the running of the company.  It may be argued that this is a good thing.  There may be certain circumstances in which the interests of the survival of the company the examiner should take over the powers vested in the directors straight away.  It would be sensible to give the court such authority and avoid a further court hearing at a later date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem I have about this amendment is that it goes against the principle contained in Part IX of the original Bill which we dealt with in Special Committee.  The principle enunciated in the proposal to provide an examiner rather than a receiver or a liquidator was to allow an examination to take place by a person who did not automatically assume control or management of the company to which the petition applied. However, if circumstances warrant it the examiner can be given such powers under the legislation.  The idea is that the examiner would provide his report within the limited specified time under the legislation while existing management continue to control the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this amendment the examiner may be given those powers at the time the petition is brought forward to the court.  That would pre-empt what the examination would reveal about the company. I do not think it would be just and equitable if, on the basis of a petition brought forward by any of the prescribed members set out under the legislation, the court could give him power <i>ex parte</i> to assume control of the company based on information available under the petition. Where the facts show it on a <i>prima facie</i> basis the examiner should be given the power by the court to go in and examine the company.  That is his first function. <Col N="2278" /> It is only after such an examination that the examiner should go back to the court and provide the evidence, under the provisions set out here, which would enable him to assume the management and control of the company.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the importance of personal rights and property rights in relation to other amendments but, where people have sunk their life's savings and investments into a company, we should not be prepared, based on a petition brought forward, to say that the examiner, who would be a nominee of one of the categories of persons set out in the legislation, shall assume control and management of the company forthwith.  That should only be done after an examination has been carried out within a specified time.  It would then be just and equitable in relation to the protection of shareholders, creditors or employees for him to assume control over whatever aspect of the company's affairs the judge decides. To do otherwise would be to go against the general thrust and principle of why the examiner was brought forward in the first place.  On that basis it would be best to leave the section as it is structured whereby a second hearing would be required and substantial evidence brought forward.  A proper decision could then be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the intention of this amendment it to avoid the necessity for a further court hearing to secure further powers for the examiner, the House should consider it carefully.  What may prove to be a difficulty in administering this Act is the number of court appearances, applications and so on that may flow from it.  Anything that might possibly control that is worthy of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A petition could be presented to appoint an examiner and whatever order the court made could be appealed to the Supreme Court but there are lengthy delays in having matters dealt with by the Supreme Court.  The essence of the <Col N="2279" /> procedure should be speed and if there is not speed the whole exercise will be theoretically frustrated.  One could envisage a situation where a petition is granted and the aggrieved company appeal the matter to the Supreme Court thereby putting the whole issue on ice for a year or more.  The whole object of the exercise would be soured.  I imagine that the kind of the circumstances in which, on the initial application, the court decided to vest the powers of section 9 in the examiner would be exceptional.  It would have to be abundantly clear that the circumstances of the company were such that it was essential at the initial application stage, based on the proven, sworn material and evidence before it, to give the powers in order to protect the assets of the company and to secure them.</P>
    <P>It would be strange if the court was denied the power to do that in the exceptional case where the weight of the evidence put before it on the initial application was so overwhelming.  On balance it might be no harm if the courts were given that power.  Courts are very cautious about granting orders of this nature and before they would accede to the application, let alone anything beyond that, they would require to be well satisfied on documentary and other evidence that the making of the order was warranted.  If, at the same time, the question arose as to whether the powers provided for in section 9 were to be given there would have to be an overwhelming body of evidence that would put it beyond yea or nay that a drastic order of that nature was needed there and then.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that it would do any harm to give that power to the courts in the reasonably secure knowledge that High Court judges would base their decisions to make such an order on the facts adduced on such an application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of these applications would be made by creditors of a company.  Deputy Cowen has made the <Col N="2280" /> point that the whole idea is one of examination and it may not be possible for a creditor to be aware of the full facts. When a creditor comes into court he would come in <i>ex parte,</i> in other words, he would come in without notice to the company.  In that event the company would not have a say as to whether the director should be put out of the company and an examiner put in his place.  It would be preferable if an opportunity was given for the examiner to examine the company before he came in and make an application to have the directors put aside so that he could take over the functions of the directors.  That would be relevant in most cases.  It may not be relevant where the directors come into court and look for an examination.  That would have to be looked at.  If this amendment was accepted there would be a problem in cases where creditors come in <i>ex-parte.</i></P>

      <P>I agree with Deputies Cowen and Ahern.  They have identified the difficulties that arise with regard to this amendment.  It would be inappropriate for the court to be given power to fire the directors and appoint the examiner in place of the directors &ldquo;at the time of presentation to it of a petition for the protection of the court&rdquo; because, at that time, the examiner would not have been appointed.</P>

      <P>Section 3 (8) does not apply on the date of presentation &mdash; that, however, is a minor technical point &mdash; it does not apply until the appointment of the examiner.  How can one fire directors and hand their powers over to somebody who has not yet been appointed?  The <Col N="2281" /> point is, as Deputy Cowen made clear, that an examiner should find out.  If this is a contested matter where the application is made by, let us say, the creditors and not by the company or by the directors, they would be going in <i>ex-parte.</i> I think the court would not remove from office a board of directors on the say so of creditors at a time when the examiner has not gone in and carried out any examination and without hearing the directors in their own defence.</P>

One could never decide in these circumstances to do what the amendment suggests.  One would have to hear from the other people and the examiner.  I think it is perfectly reasonable as it is drafted here, that it is on the application of the examiner after he has looked at the matter.  He may discover, after a day or two in there, that many of the directors are a crowd of crooks and that he wants to get them out of the way and run the company himself.  If that is the case, it is appropriate for him to come back and tell the court that.  Let the directors come in and argue if they feel otherwise.</P>

      <P>This is in reply to the points made by Fianna Fáil Deputies and the Minister, Deputy O'Malley.  With respect, I think the Minister does not really understand what we are trying to achieve.  Under section 3, a petition may be presented by the company or the directors of the company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will deal with that in a moment.  Section 9 clearly states:</P>
      <P>(1) Where it appears to the court, on the application of the examiner, that, having regard to the matters referred to in subsection (2) ... of subsection (2) (1) are&mdash; The matters to which the court is to have regard for the purpose ...</P>
      <P>(c) that the company or its directors, have resolved that such an order should be sought, ...</P>
      <P>There can clearly be a situation where the person who is going to court presenting a petition is a director of the company, and the directors of the company wish that the examiner whom they are nominating would immediately take over complete control of the running of the company and that is provided for in section 9.  All I am attempting to do here is give the court the power to deal with all of this in one go.  Basically what section 9 is saying is that we can have the examiner appointed today, the next day he can go back to court and seek the powers provided under section 9 and get them, provided the court will have regard to the conditions outlined in subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments presented by both Deputies Cowen and Ahern are not accurate. If it was the case that the creditors were presenting a petition, then obviously the court would decide, based on the circumstances, and possibly would not agree <Col N="2283" /> to the examiner having these powers from day one.  That, however, would be the court's decision.  If the directors of the company who are nominating the examiner want the examiner to have immediate control, then the whole lot can be done in the one court hearing.  I do not see the problem.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make here is that this amendment is designed for convenience, to avoid expense and to avoid a further court hearing.  With respect, the points made by the Minister in reply to my argument are not <Col N="2284" /> valid because section 9 does make provision for the transfer of powers to the examiner immediately after his appointment.  The only thing that matters is that it requires a further court hearing which is quite ridiculous if the directors who are presenting the petition want the examiner they are nominating to take over immediate control.  Why should it not be done in the one court hearing?</P>
    <P>For those reasons I would ask the Minister to support this amendment and ask my colleagues on this side of the House to do likewise.</P>

      <P>To some extent, although not precisely on the same point, we have been down this road already.  This amendment seeks to deal with the matters to which the court must have regard when making an order on whether or not the affairs of the company should be handed over to an examiner.  The section, as it stands, provides that the court must be satisfied &ldquo;that the affairs of the company are being conducted, or are likely to be conducted, in a manner which is calculated or likely to prejudice the interests of the company or of its creditors&rdquo;, but there is no reference to the workers or the staff in that company.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister took up what I described then as an ideological position on the question of trade unions' and workers' rights being enshrined expressly in the legislation.  He argued then for the generic term &ldquo;employees&rdquo; or &ldquo;workers&rdquo; rather than turning it into what he described as a question of trade union recognition.  I hope in this case, where there is no reference to a trade union but merely to the rights of employees, that the Minister will agree that the matter should be included.  It is extraordinary that the court must have regard, in deciding, with regard to section 9 (1) whether or not the affairs of the company are likely to be conducted in a manner calculated to damage the interests of the creditors, for example, but not the interests of the employees.</P>
      <P>Already today I tried to explain that not always will the interests of the employees and those of the creditors or the members of the company be necessarily compatible or consistent in all cases.  Unfortunately, there are many workers tonight, employed by the Goodman organisation, who will feel they have got no more than a temporary respite. Their views have not been taken into account in terms of the situation that may face them coming up to Christmas.  It is imperative that the Minister acknowledges that workers have a vested interest in the future of the company in which a great many of them may have spent the greater part of their working lives.  That should be taken into account in framing this legislation.  I hope the Minister will acknowledge that this is a distinct and separate point from the discussions we had at the beginning of Committee Stage and that he will agree to take this amendment on board.</P>

      <P>I rise to support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment which is very much part and parcel of the discussion we had at the earlier part of this debate on Committee Stage.  It is interesting to note that the Minister, while referring to the right of workers to be considered as creditors of the company, has failed to respect of their rights.  I would say to the Minister, late and all as it is, that here is an opportunity for him to show that he is concerned and that he respects the right of workers in respect of the difficulties with which they will be faced in relation to any company which may seek to avail of this legislation.  The question arises as to which company and what company may want to avail of this legislation. I contend that as regards any company that seeks the protection of the courts, the workers have a distinctive interest, separate from the creditors, separate from the bankers, separate from the trade creditors, and they should be represented and heard.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this legislation is being passed in this hasty manner and that, while the rights of workers are being acknowledged in the context of others who are entitled to be represented in court and otherwise, the Minister is failing to respect and acknowledge that workers have their own distinct concerns and rights.  At an earlier stage in this debate it was argued that the workers are the most vulnerable and are least inclined to go to court on an individual basis.  In this instance it behoves the Minister to recognise that the employees should be afforded the same respect in law as others.  I would ask the Minister at this late stage to give an acknowledgement of that, which he failed to do at the passing of Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>This amendment refers also to the section I was speaking on during the debate on the last amendment. Basically, what is being asked here is that, when the court is considering whether it should transfer management powers or <Col N="2289" /> complete control from the directors to the appointed examiner, the court in making its decision would have regard to the interests of various people.  Deputy Rabbitte is asking also that it take into account the interests of the employees. This is a very sensible measure, because what we are asking here is that the court would decide who should take immediate control of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the directors of the company are those who are presenting the petition to the court for the appointment of an examiner.  It will be those same directors who will be recommending the examiner to take over control. It may be that it is in the interests of the company that straight away the company come under the immediate control of the examiner for, perhaps, reasons of bad management.  It is the directors who are asking for the examiner to be appointed and they may want their nominated examiner to take over immediate control.  It is a good thing to show in this legislation that there is concern about everybody involved in the company, and a vital part of the company are the employees.  In order for this to succeed one must get the co-operation of the employees.  If they withdraw their labour this will not work from day one.  Even if it is a means of expression of concern for employees we should take into account their feelings wherever possible.  For the life of me I cannot see how this amendment would in any way interfere with the running of the company after the appointment of the examiner.  As I said when speaking on amendment No. 2, it could be that on day one the directors who are presenting the petition want their nominated examiner to take over complete control straightaway.  From the information I have received in relation to this legislation from people who are involved in liquidations and receiverships and so on the big problem is that nobody is in absolute control from day one and that that can lead to a conflict of interest. It is always at the discretion of the court <Col N="2290" /> that these decisions will be taken.  In certain circumstances it may be in the interests of the company that an examiner is appointed straightaway and that he is given absolute control.  What Deputy Rabbitte is asking here is that the court would take into consideration the interests of the employees in making their decision.  I do not see how that could affect this legislation.  I support the principle of the amendment presented by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>

      <P>This is a very important issue because the examiner will find that the employee structure is a very complicated one in the Goodman company.  After all, it is about time we came back down to the plain facts that what we are talking about is Goodman International and the various companies and subsidiaries associated with it.  Most of the employees are on contract.  One group of contract workers have no idea what others are doing.  Some are contracted to do nefarious, secret jobs such as the job which was done at the Eir-Freeze plant to which I referred in the spring of last year, when I was accused by Larry Goodman of being a fringe TD seeking cheap publicity and undermining the credibility of his company.  That was supported by the Taoiseach at the time who accused me of national sabotage.</P>
      <P>I was at District Court No. 1 last month when the company were found guilty of precisely what I said, changing labels and putting on false labels.  The judge said that this was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The examiner will find that some of the contract workers will have to be discharged, such as those doing that type of nefarious work.  It is very important that the employees be <Col N="2291" /> considered by the examiner if he is taking charge of the company.  He must ensure that this type of activity does not continue in the company under the direction of the current directors.  That is precisely the point I want to make.  It is vitally important that the employees be included in this section and that their interests be looked after by the examiner when he takes over.</P>

      <P>Regarding these two amendments I have no objection, in this instance, to the words &ldquo;or of its employees&rdquo; being inserted.  It does not make sense as it is drafted but if the word &ldquo;of&rdquo; is inserted after &ldquo;or&rdquo; it would suffice. This relates to a question where the court will consider, on the application of the examiner, whether to remove the directors from office.  In all these circumstances it is reasonable to have the employees identified separately although I could argue, if I chose, that the existing phrases in the subsection &ldquo;the interests of the company or of its creditors as a whole&rdquo;, both include the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
