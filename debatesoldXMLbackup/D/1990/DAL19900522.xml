      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the question to refer to certain gifts made by George Bernard Shaw during his lifetime to Carlow Urban District Council. <Col N="2226" /> Carlow Urban District Council have sought legal advice on their freedom to disburse these funds for the benefit of the arts in Carlow.  Legislation was already enacted in 1945 to enable gifts such as these from Mr. Shaw to be accepted and disbursed by local authorities.  The need for further legislation is not, therefore, established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The difficulty is that when the arts Act of 1973 was passed it allowed rates to be used to help the arts, and George Bernard Shaw in his will specifically stated that he did not want any help to be given where rates were involved.  It looks as if Carlow County Council cannot disburse this money because they feel they are in conflict with the 1973 Act.  It appears to me that amending legislation is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is correct.  My advice is that amending legislation is not necessary.  I understand that Carlow UDC have sought legal advice on the matter and I would like to suggest that I keep in touch with the Deputy to see if we can have it all straightened out.  Neither of us would wish to have the wishes of the late George Bernard Shaw subverted in any way, I am sure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputies that the 17th Special Session of the UN General Assembly on 23 February last has already proclaimed the period from 1991 to 2000 as the United Nations Decade Against Drugs Abuse.  The Deputies might also recall from my statement in the House on 3 May that, at a special meeting here on 28 April, the European Council asked the Coordinators Group on Drugs to report with a view to submitting proposals to its next meeting in June that would form part of a vigorous action by the EC and the member states against drug abuse and the illicit production, distribution and sale of narcotic drugs.  I should also mention that EC Health Ministers at their meeting last week agreed a programme of activities on the demand side of the drug problem such as education, treatment and rehabilitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach for his reply but he has not answered my question.  Given that 1992 is the year when all barriers in Europe will disappear will he agree that, because of the massive problem drugs are creating in Europe, particularly among young people, it would be most appropriate to designate 1992 as the European Year Against Drugs?  Is the Taoiseach aware of an organisation known as Eurad, Europe Against Drugs, the first such voluntary foundation which is funded by the European Commission?  Is the Taoiseach aware that that organisation held a conference here in March and that to their grave disappointment he, as President of the European Councils, did not see fit to reply to their invitation to meet them and to address them?  I should like to ask the Taoiseach to use his position as President of the European Councils to see to it that 1992 is designated European Year Against Drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any knowledge of what the Deputy refers to about an invitation to Eurad but I know of their wish to have 1992 designated European Year Against Drugs.  I do not have a <Col N="2228" /> particular antipathy to that suggestion but the other proposals are infinitely more important, that is, positive action by the Council and by the member states against the abuse of drugs.  I assure the Deputy it is our determination in the Presidency to endeavour to have major action initiated in this area at the Dublin Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the view expressed by Eurad and many others in this field that Europe is in the grip of a growing epidemic of drug abuse?  Will he also agree that there is a need not simply to have Ministers of the Councils taking decisions but to mobilise as wide a section of the Community as possible in the campaign against the introduction of drugs into the Community?  Will he also agree that that is the single most important feature of any year being designated a year against drugs?  He must know that a designated year would help to build awareness of the problem and I ask the Taoiseach if in his Presidency, which is now coming to a close, he will initiate the process of designating a year for awareness about drugs soon after 1992 if that year is not so designated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Barrett, I do not have an antipathy towards it but I am not sure that designating a year in this way is of any practical value for the cause concerned.  I want to again assure the Deputy that at the Dublin Summit in April we made a very strong statement about drugs and we asked the agencies concerned, particularly CELAD, to put us in a position at the next summit to designate something positive and concrete for Europe.  The situation in relation to drugs will probably get more prominence and be more effective in that way instead of designating 1992 &mdash; or any other year &mdash; as the European Year Against Drugs.  As I also mentioned in my reply, the Ministers for Health are initiating their own programme so the Community is aware of the problem mentioned by the Deputy. In reporting to the European Parliament, <Col N="2229" /> I drew attention to the whole situation so the Deputy can take it that we are determined to be as active as is necessary and possible in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Taoiseach rightly chose to deem his Presidency as &ldquo;Green&rdquo;, will he agree there is nothing wrong with creating awareness of the drugs problem by designating 1992 as a year of awareness?  As President of the Council of Ministers and as Taoiseach, he should make strenuous efforts to see that this matter is at least given consideration because of the fact that Eurad have a correct policy of creating awareness of the need to guard against drugs, to educate people &mdash; including parents &mdash; in their use and to be aware of the first signs of drug abuse. With respect, there would be a benefit in having a European Year Against Drugs and 1992 would be as good as any because of the breaking down of barriers and the <Col N="2230" /> difficulties which the Minister for Justice will also experience during that period, if he is still about.  If he or the Taoiseach are not in office we will be there to implement the policy.  In the meantime I ask the Taoiseach to take the initial steps in this regard.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that in 1988 his Department paid RTE £10,000 to prepare a film presentation on the Irish economy to be shown to the President of the Commission, Mr. Delors?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so. I can give the Deputy a quick run down of the video productions in 1988.  There was a video for display to visitors on artefacts in the Ceramics Room of the National Museum.  There was also a grant by the National Heritage Council for the production of a video on tree planting in the urban environment.  A communications course was undertaken by an officer of the Department and there was attendance by one officer of the Central Statistics Office at a course on media studies.  The total for that year was £9,780.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that footage from film presentation on the Irish economy prepared for the visit of President Delors was subsequently used by RTE as the introduction to a special &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme in advance of the budget, 1989?  Is the Taoiseach further aware that an independent commission having reviewed that film footage, regard it as being potentially manipulative?  Does the Taoiseach not think it wrong that RTE would use, as the introduction to a current affairs programme in advance of the budget, a piece of film originally paid for by the Government?</P>

I will look into it further but I have given the Deputy all the video productions in which my Department were involved in 1988.</P>

As I indicated to the House on 25 October and 12 December 1989, the question of providing further staff and equipment will continue on a phased basis but must have regard to the severe limitations on public funds and staffing.</P>

      <P>Proposals are now complete for the development of the Irish Genealogical Project.  The project will essentially involve putting genealogical information on computers in a significant number of local centres largely on a <Col N="2235" /> county basis and throughout Ireland both North and South.  It will also involve providing a genealogical service to people of Irish extraction abroad and to Irish people at home.  This service will be marketed internationally and here in Ireland as a fully comprehensive service because it will have all the relevant records on computer access.</P>
      <P>The proposals I referred to have just recently been approved in principle by the International Fund for Ireland, which has already generously earmarked £500,000 for the first phase of this important all-Ireland project.  Work will, accordingly, commence very shortly on the computerisation of the local genealogical centres.  This will include, <i>inter alia,</i> forming a computer users group so that all centres will be involved in the process.</P>

Has it come to the notice of the Taoiseach that, in the northern part of this island in recent years, there has been greatly increased interest on the part of both sections of the community in finding out more about their common roots, which has been a great unifying factor particularly at local level?  May I ask the Taoiseach in this regard whether he recognises the efforts of an organisation <Col N="2236" /> in County Tyrone, in the town of Dungannon, known as &ldquo;Irish World&rdquo;, who have been making a great contribution? I hope that in the file in front of the Taoiseach there is reference to that organisation and the good work they have been doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 10, 11, 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>My discussions here on 9 May with the Czechoslovak Prime Minister, Mr. Marian Calfa, focused on EC/ Czechoslovak relations, bilateral relations between Ireland and Czechoslovakia as well as the unfolding pace of developments in the EC and in Europe generally.  The Prime Minister was accompanied by a number of his Ministers, Deputy Ministers and senior officials who had separate discussions with their Irish opposite numbers in a whole range of areas such as economic issues, foreign trade, industry, environment and social affairs and health matters.</P>
      <P>As a result of these discussions, arrangements are being made to identify concrete areas of bilateral co-operation and projects covering training, communications and public administration and to co-ordinate joint efforts in the G24 context.</P>
      <P>My meeting here on 10 May with the Austrian Chancellor, Dr. Franz Vranitzky, concentrated on EC/EFTA relations, Austria's application for EC membership, developments in Central and Eastern Europe and the CSCE.  As I indicated at the joint press conference which we gave following our meeting, Austria's case for EC membership is a very strong one on economic, geographical and cultural grounds but it would be inappropriate for me to comment on this at this stage, pending the submission of the Commission's opinion in accordance with the provisions of Article 237 of the EC Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions to the Taoiseach: the first deals with his latter remark in relation to Austria and <Col N="2238" /> their proposed application for membership of the EC.  I would not consider it inappropriate for the Taoiseach to comment on the possibility of their application, but is it not a fact that the Austrian Chancellor made it very clear that because of the magnitude of the preparations for 1992 Austria will not be putting forward their formal application until after that date?  Second, in relation to the visit of the Czechoslovak Prime Minister, does he foresee discussions taking place &mdash; as he outlined &mdash; in the various areas of foreign trade, industry, social affairs and so on, at an early date between representatives of both Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of Austrian application, the Deputy is quite right, the Austrian Chancellor indicated that he fully understood the position in the Community and that negotiations proper on the Austrian application would not begin before the end of 1992.  We had wideranging, fruitful discussions with the Czechoslovaks.  These meetings will take place, but it emerged fairly clearly that at this stage the best contribution we can make to the Czechoslovak nation is on the personnel side, that we should try and help out either by sending our people over to Czechoslovakia or bringing people from Czechoslovakia here and giving them appropriate training.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Taoiseach's meeting with the Austrian Chancellor, Dr. Vranitzky, can he say whether the question of neutrality arose in the course of those discussions; whether it is clear that the main obstacle to consideration of the Austrian application for membership of the EC is the clear Austrian statement that neutrality is not negotiable; and that they will not under any circumstances become involved in military commitments within the EC?  Would the Taoiseach indicate whether our Government support that position and the Austrian Government in the maintenance of their neutrality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in answer to Deputy Spring &mdash; which he accepted &mdash;<Col N="2239" /> it is not really appropriate at this stage for me to comment on the merits of the Austrian application for membership because we have not received the Commission's report in accordance with Article 237 of the EC Treaty.  Austria's position on neutrality is well known and it would not be for me to comment on that.  There is no question of my supporting or not supporting Austrian neutrality; that is entirely a matter for the Austrians.  I am sure I could say, without any breach of propriety, that is, as I understand it, there is no particular question at this stage of Austrian neutrality being in any way detrimental to their application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Taoiseach's discussions with the Czechoslovak Prime Minister, can he say whether he agrees with the proposals put forward by President Havel in Strasbourg on 10 May to the effect that a northern security zone should be established encompassing the territories currently covered by both the Warsaw Pact and NATO countries, in particular that a European Commission on Security should be established with its headquarters in Prague?  Has the Taoiseach had any discussions in regard to these proposals?  Can he say whether he is well disposed towards them or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not in fact arise because we were concentrating mainly on bilateral issues but I have often given my own view which is that the best possible forum in which the security and stability of Europe as a whole can be discussed is the CSCE process.  That is still my opinion.  In so far as President Havel's proposal would be counter to that, I would not be in a position to support it because I think the best possible avenue for achieving progress in this area is through the CSCE process which is well established and being expanded now into the economic and human rights areas.  I really see that as the way in which we can create a new structural framework for security in Europe.</P>

      <P>May I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that Chancellor Vranitzky in statements to <i>The Irish Times</i> made it clear that he believed some member states regarded Austrian neutrality as an obstacle to their joining the European Community? Would the Taoiseach put it on the record of the House that the Government do not see Austrian neutrality as an obstacle to joining the European Community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no objection to doing that but I do not wish to do so because to that extent I would be <Col N="2241" /> beginning to enter into a discussion or dialogue on the merits or demerits of the Austrian application.

      <P>That is not quite the reply I am seeking.  It is obviously a matter for the Austrians but it is also a matter for the European Community and the member states of the European Community who must judge the application of the Austrians.  It is clear Chancellor Vranitzky believes their neutrality is an obstacle and they do not want to give up their neutrality.  I am seeking a statement from the Taoiseach of the Government of a country which is neutral that they do not regard Austrian neutrality as an obstacle to their joining the Community.</P>

      <P>May I take it from the Taoiseach's reply in relation to discussions that neither he, nor any representative of his Department, has had discussions with the trustees on changes to the deed of trust having regard to the fact that his Department participated in a fairly substantial financial settlement recently arrived at?  Am I to understand that that settlement was independent of any suggested or proposed changes in the way in which the library might be run or in the way in which the trust might be constituted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.

May I take it that taxpayers' money was used, with the full consent of the Taoiseach, to resolve an internal problem which was referred to on previous occasions in this House and that notwithstanding the fact that a substantial amount of taxpayer's money was being used no opportunity was taken by the Taoiseach's Department to correct or modernise some of the conditions of the deed of trust which some people might consider contributed in part to the original problem?

If the Deputy wants to ask me any questions about the deed of trust or proposed alterations to it I will certainly answer them but at the moment this discussion only dealt with the current staffing situation in the library.

      <P>Media 92 is a programme of action of the European Commission.  In implementing it, the Commission deal directly with distributors and producers in each member state.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 29, 40, 48, 53, 115 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind Deputies, that my primary and indeed statutory duty as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements.  I must, therefore, respect the right of insurance firms to make their own underwriting decisions including the acceptance or rejection of any risk in the light of their particular underwriting experience.  No legal obligation can be placed on an insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote at any particular premium or in any particular manner.  I am not responsible for the day-to-day running of insurance companies or the exercise of business acumen on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £32 million on their motor portfolios.  These losses increased to £48 million in 1988 and are expected <Col N="2249" /> to be even higher for 1989.  Confronted with losses of this magnitude and in order to maintain their viability some insurers have considered it necessary to increase their premiums in line with their claims experience and-or to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken. This more selective approach tends to apply to new business rather than to existing policyholders.</P>
    <P>Cases of inability to get motor insurance cover can be dealt with under the Declined Cases Agreement.  This is an agreement between the authorised motor insurers and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Declined Cases Committee, established under the agreement, examines cases referred to it by my Department where motorists have been declined cover by five or more insurance companies, and nominates a company to quote for the risk involved. Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration it is necessary for my Department to have copies of written refusals from five insurance companies together with details of any previous insurance held in the last three years.</P>
    <P>Experience to date suggests that the Declined Cases Agreement is a reasonably satisfactory way of dealing with cases of inability to obtain motor insurance.  In effect this agreement provides a mechanism for distributing high risks amongst insurers, including the insuring of young drivers.  I do not, therefore, consider that there is a need for the proposed quota arrangement.</P>
    <P>I am aware that when an insurance company quotes in respect of risks for young people, the premiums may be regarded by those concerned as excessive. The cost of motor insurance for young drivers, however, tends to reflect the claims experience of motor insurers. While I sympathise with the situation in which young drivers find themselves, statistical evidence has shown that they are more likely to be involved in accidents, and, therefore, to cause claims. The cost of these claims can only be met by insurers if a realistic premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved and one <Col N="2250" /> cannot expect the cost of insurance to come down when the number of accidents claims and the cost of those claims are going in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>Many young drivers get insurance as additional drivers on their parents' policies. Motor insurers give these drivers some credit for their years as additional drivers in that, when they take out policies in their own name, they are given a 10 per cent to 20 per cent no claims bonus if they have been named drivers on their parents' policies for two years or more, have a full licence and are claims-accident-free.</P>
    <P>The fundamental cause of high motor insurance prices in Ireland is the high claims rate, which regrettably is on the increase, allied to the high cost of individual claims which is also rising.  These factors bear on the level of insurance premia quoted to young drivers as well as those quoted to more mature motorists. One cannot reasonably expect the price of motor insurance to reduce, or even stabilise, when the claims rate and the cost of claims is increasing.  The international comparisons that are available suggest that this country has a very high accident rate and that the claims rate here is considerably above that in other European countries.</P>
    <P>Unless and until the claims experience here mirrors that obtaining in other European countries there will be divergences between motor insurance premia in Ireland and those applying in other European countries.</P>
    <P>I would add that statistics are not available to me that would enable an assessment to be made of the overall cost of running a family car as indicated by a recently published survey.</P>
    <P>I, and my colleagues in Government, will continue to do what we reasonably can to improve the environment for insurance.  I am, of course, aware, that despite initiatives already taken, for example, the Courts Act, 1988, motor insurance premia have continued to rise. The ultimate decisions, however, rest with society itself.  Are we prepared to tolerate a high accident rate and abnormally generous compensation for victims <Col N="2251" /> of accidents or do we want to see a real reduction in the cost of motor insurance? I propose to stimulate public debate on the question of which alternative our society wishes to adopt and also to suggest for discussion and implementation where possible initiatives which may assist in the attainment of the adopted alternative.  Thus, for example, my recent references to the need to give consideration to the establishment of a tribunal for personal injury claims.  My Department will be examining the feasibility of such a tribunal in conjunction with other Government Departments and the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>I have already recently suggested that the insurance industry itself should propose and support a road safety campaign in conjunction with the Government and am encouraged at the response I have had from the Irish Insurance Federation in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us a very detailed reply but unfortunately he has not replied fully to the question that I asked him in relation to his proposals for the setting up of a tribunal. Would the Minister agree that it is just not sufficient for him to say that his main responsibility is to see to it that underwriters remain solvent because the public are required by law to insure their motor vehicles?  It, therefore, goes beyond the question of solvency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would he agree that as long as premiums are allowed to increase at the rate they are increasing there is a likelihood of having more and more uninsured drivers? Would he further agree that the estimated figure for uninsured drivers is between 80,000 and 100,000 at present? Does he agree there is a problem in relation to the laws that exist for provisional licence holders in that if you fail your test the first time, you may drive unaccompanied on the second provisional licence?  I find that extraordinary. It is also extraordinary that 50 per cent of those sitting their test, fail it.  In 1988 uninsured drivers were involved in accidents at a cost of £31 million.  Would the <Col N="2252" /> Minister agree that this is unfair to those who pay their premiums?</P>
    <P>While we can talk about tribunals and discuss their merits, would the Minister agree that the law as it stands is not being enforced and that there is a need for change in many areas?  Would he further agree that there is a need for a co-ordinated effort on the part of the Government to effect change, because many of these changes involve other Departments?</P>

      <P>It seems to the Chair that an inordinate amount of time is now being devoted to Question No. 17, clearly to the disadvantage of the three remaining Priority Questions, especially having regard to the fact that a very rigid time limit applies in respect of questions nominated for priority.  I ask, therefore, for brevity if we are to deal with the remaining questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so, I am afraid that is not correct.  I cannot get away from the fact that of all the potential horrors, what I least want to see happen is a repetition of either of those two horrors.  That should be borne in mind.  Subject to that, as I have made it clear, I and my colleagues in Government will do what we can to improve the situation, but there is the basic question that the people of this country have to ask themselves and I posed it in my reply &mdash; Are we prepared <Col N="2253" /> as we are at the moment to tolerate a high accident rate &mdash; the highest in Europe &mdash; and abnormally generous compensation for victim of accidents &mdash; the highest in Europe &mdash; or do we want to see a real reduction in the cost of motor insurance? This country, so far, has been answering that question in the affirmative, that is we want to tolerate the highest accident rate in Europe and we want to tolerate the highest level of compensation.  If we get down to normal levels of compensation then we will get down to normal levels of premiums, but so far the people have not really faced up to this question and I am trying to stimulate a debate in which they might.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a number of areas where he felt the law was not being enforced or that it might be enforced differently.  That may well be the case, and I think changes could be made particularly in regard to provisional licences but the Deputy will understand that I am not trying to evade the question when I say that I am not answerable in this House for those matters.</P>

      <P>I have already informed this House on 15 February 1990 and again on 22 March 1990, that when all the reports of the Fair Trade Commission's wide ranging study into the rendering of certain professional and analogous services are to hand I will then be in a position to take whatever action, including introducing legislation, is found to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have since received the report on the <Col N="2254" /> commission's study on architects, surveyors, auctioneers and estate agents. This is the final report on the professions that I have been awaiting from the Fair Trade Commission.  When it has been fully considered, I will be in a position to take whatever action I deem to be necessary.</P>

      <P>Of the reports to hand which the Minister has had the opportunity of examining, may I ask him if he intends seeking the co-operation of the various representative bodies to implement changes on a voluntary basis, or is he satisfied there is a need to bring about change by way of legislative measures?  Is he satisfied that we cannot effect change for example in the area of the fixing of fees or the prohibition of advertising on a voluntary basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that until all the reports have been published and studied by the interests concerned.  My experience was that it was difficult to get voluntary agreement on matters of this kind.  I recall in the early seventies that I had to take legislative action in regard to auctioneers' fees, after I had said that would be done if there was not voluntary agreement to change the system.  When the voluntary agreement was not forthcoming, I introduced the legislation.  I hope, given that background, that a number of professions will change their methods of operation on the basis that it is better that they do it voluntarily than the changes being imposed on them by statute.  It is, therefore, my hope &mdash; as I presume it is the Deputy's &mdash; that various changes which clearly will be seen to be desirable might be voluntarily adopted by the various bodies concerned.</P>

      <P>As indicated in a public statement issued by the Government Information Service on my behalf on 30 April 1990, I decided, in the due exercise of my powers under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987, to refer the proposal whereby Bord Telecom Éireann will acquire 60 per cent of the issued share capital of Cablelink Limited for investigation and report by the Fair Trade Commission.  I asked the commission to have particular regard to the criteria in the legislation relating to the likely effects on competition, the interests of the consumer and the interests of shareholders in the enterprises concerned.  In making the referral, I also had regard to comments by the commission in an earlier 1986 report in a study by them into cable television systems in the greater Dublin area.  This report was presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas (P1. 4295) and published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Costs <Col N="2257" /> Monitoring Group have noted a significant improvement in the cost competitiveness of Irish manufacturers in recent years across a range of cost factors, including in particular public utilities such as electricity and telecommunications. This, combined with restrained wage levels, lower inflation and interest rates and a stable currency within the EMS, has provided the basis for the considerable turn-around which has been experienced in industrial job creation.</P>
      <P>Despite the cost improvements which have been achieved, there is no room for complacency.  The group have identified the weakening of sterling as a factor which will tend, in the short-term, to restrain the rate of growth of exports to the UK.  Beyond the immediate short-term effects, however, the considerably higher inflation, interest rates and wage rate increases in the UK will aid the competitiveness of Irish companies relative to UK competitors on both domestic and overseas markets.</P>
      <P>The Government are determined to do everything possible to maintain our competitiveness; our hope is that economic decisions in the UK will assist the achievement of currency and economic stability there also.</P>

      <P>I would recommend that the Minister change his script a little from the continuous statements on favourable interest rates and remind him that interest rates have risen by 4 per cent in the last 12 or 18 months.  Is the Minister aware of a recent survey carried out by the Small Firms Association which clearly indicated a lowering of confidence as a result of high interest rates and a failure to tackle the problem of fluctuation in currencies?  Is he also aware that we are still not getting the benefits of the improved position of the Irish punt against other currencies in the area of retail outlets and indeed in some wholesale outlets, one example being the yen which has dropped to the June of 26 per cent but there has been no sign whatsoever of any benefit being passed on to the consumer?</P>

      <P>I propose to take oral Questions Nos. 21, 25, 36, 37 and 54, and written Questions Nos. 117, 118, 119, 120, 121 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in this House on 1 November 1989, it is lawful for the ESB to engage in electrical appliance retailing under the provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.  I also indicated that I had been informed that the ESB operate their appliance retailing business in a normal commercial manner.  There was one area that raised concerns, namely, the ESB's use of their billing system in this regard and whether this conferred an unfair advantage to the detriment of other electrical appliance retailers.  I, accordingly, decided to ask the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to examine this aspect in the context of the Restrictive Practices Acts, 1972 and 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received the report of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade on 8 May 1990.  In the course of his investigations, the director examined in detail the appliance selling activities of the ESB and the use of the billing system in relation to those activities, considered <Col N="2261" /> observations from all relevant sources, and considered established principles of competition law and policy.  In the event, the investigation proved to be quite complex and the director cites this as the reason for the longer than anticipated period to complete his report.</P>
    <P>The director has concluded that the ESB are not operating unfairly to the detriment of their competitors in using their billing system as a means of collecting repayments on credit purchases of retail goods.  The director found no reason in principle from a competition policy point of view that the ESB should not be allowed to use the billing system outside the area of their statutory monopoly, or that all parties in the marketplace should be of the same size, should start from the same point or should have an equality of resources or assets.  The director found no principle of competition policy to support the proposal that the ESB's billing system should be made available to other retailers and not confined exclusively to the ESB, or that the ESB should not be allowed to sell brown goods.  The director confirmed that in his view the ESB do not subsidise their appliance sales and that these sales make a fair contribution to the cost of the billing system and other services or facilities provided by the ESB as a whole.</P>
    <P>The director identifies some aspects of the ESB's practice in relation to their appliance selling activities which concerned him and he has made the following recommendations in this regard: (i) the ESB should take steps to allow customers to distinguish more readily between debts due for electricity supplies and debts due in respect of the sale of appliances; (ii) the ESB should amend their system for checking the creditworthiness of prospective purchasers of appliances on credit, so as to make it easier to identify those whose electricity bills are paid by welfare organisations; and (iii) periodic monitoring of the appliance selling activities of the ESB should be carried out in order to ensure that these activities continue to be profitable and that there is no abuse of any dominant position that the ESB might attain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2262" /> I am considering the measure needed to give effect to the director's recommendations. As the report does not appear to contain any particularly sensitive commercial information I propose to lay it before the House within the next few days.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister for his very detailed and comprehensive reply.  It would take a little more time than we have now to go into this matter in depth.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade does not believe there is any advantage to the ESB but I do not accept that.  I have received numerous complaints from people in the electrical retail business who feel that the ESB have an unfair advantage and I am sure the Minister would accept that.  What measures will the Minister take to ensure a level playing field for people in the electrical retailing business?</P>

In so far as the very minor recommendations which have been made are concerned, that is a matter between the director and the ESB and no doubt the director will consider that aspect.  When the report is published, interested parties will probably wish to study it and no doubt will then wish to comment on its contents.</P>

      <P>The report on the second triennial review of national industrial performance is currently being finalised. While the report will be primarily concerned with the performance of industry over the past three years, it will specify areas where further changes in industrial policy and the availability of State supports should take place.  I would prefer at this stage not to go into details until the report has been formally laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas which I expect to do shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether in making his statement he is in favour of reducing the grants support available to industry, that he is taking into account the anticipated, indeed the current new competition from eastern European countries and whether he is familiar with the statement of a leading trade union official in which the IDA acquiesced that between five and seven <Col N="2265" /> plants have been lost in recent months by this country to eastern European countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it clear at the time I made this speech that I was conscious of the fact that we are in competition with other countries and that whatever changes might be made could only be made in the context of the European Commission controlling very carefully the level of State aids in the Community as a whole.  I drew attention to the fact that, in my view, State aids should be confined to the peripheral regions of the Community.  I was somewhat startled to find in a recent Commission survey that they concluded that 43 per cent of all State aids were paid in Germany and France which are the two richest states in the Community.  It does seem that the competition directorate of the Commission are anxious to tighten up on the whole State aid regime within the Community.  When that is done, and I hope it will be soon, then I think we will be in a position to act in the terms I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that the Minister is in favour of a shift in industrial policy towards what might be termed tax driven rather than the emphasis being on grant aids and whether this is one of the reforms we can expect in the triennial report?  Can he give the House any indication when the triennial report, which I understand is now overdue, will be published and laid before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I anticipate it will be available in some weeks.  It will go to the Government and it will be published at that stage.  I have always made it clear, and the Government have always made it clear, that it is our desire to reduce the undue reliance, which has been traditional in this country, on upfront grant aid.  Good progress has already been made in the past few years in pursuance of that policy and I hope that policy can be further accelerated in the years to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>May I specifically ask the Minister about his reference to the fact that he is unhappy about a situation where member countries seem to be unnecessarily outbidding each other in a situation which he described as being manipulated by the multinationals and whether he thinks action at a European level, as distinct from at a national level, would be necessary to make any impact in tackling that phenomenon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I feel.  We cannot do anything at a national level, it has to be done at an international level because it is different member states and the regions in different member states who are outbidding each other at present.  What I said in regard to multinationals is that they are the main beneficiaries.  On some occasions there have been some instances where one might conclude that there has been a manipulation of the system as between two or more member states, where the losers are the member states concerned and the beneficiary is the company concerned. That is undesirable.  I would prefer to see the Community as one and not to see either countries or regions within it contesting with one another for the benefit of third country multinationals.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Minister outline his view on excise duties on petrol and diesel, dealing in particular with his view of the harmonisation process of excise of fossil fuels?  Perhaps he would outline Government policy on differentiation between the treatment for excise purposes of leaded and unleaded petrol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to give effect to an excise duty reduction of 1.1p including VAT, on a litre of unleaded petrol, which is the equivalent of 5p per gallon including VAT, and to give effect to an excise duty reduction of 43p, including VAT, on a gallon of auto LPG motor vehicle gas.</P>
      <P>These measures which came into effect on February 1990 will have the following estimated Exchequer effects: the cost of increased rebate for unleaded petrol &mdash; £6.5 million in 1990 and £7.9 million in a full year; cost of reduced rate on LPG &mdash; £0.8 million in 1990 and £1 million in a full year.  The increased rebate for unleaded petrol doubles the price differential in favour of unleaded petrol from 1.1p per litre to 2.2p per litre or the equivalent of 12p a gallon.  This should provide a considerable incentive to motorists to switch to the unleaded product. Unleaded petrol is not included in the base used to determine the consumer price index.  The CPI effect of reducing the duty on auto LPG is estimated at 0.017 per cent.  In the budget we doubled the differential in the price of unleaded petrol from 5p to 10p a gallon and reduced LPG.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 101:</P>
      <P>In page 72, before section 86, but in Part II, to insert the following section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2395" />  86.&mdash;(1)  Regulation 8 of the Disabled Drivers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 340 of 1989) is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;10 per cent&rdquo; for &ldquo;30 per cent&rdquo; in each place where it occurs in paragraph (1).</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 92 of the Finance Act, 1989 is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;10&rdquo; for &ldquo;30&rdquo; in subsection (1) (b) (ii).</P>
    <P>(3)  This section shall come into effect on the date of passing of this Act.  </P>
    <P>This amendment deals with tax relief for disabled drivers or disabled people who are seeking transport.  I acknowledge that the Minister made some improvement in the situation last year.  The position prior to that was that a person had to have both lower limbs disabled in order to qualify. Therefore, anomalies arose in certain cases, for example, in the case of Mr. Gerard O'Brien who had no arms and only one leg but who was precluded from the scheme.  I am glad to be able to say that Mr. O'Brien is now receiving this car tax relief.</P>
    <P>Every time we rewrite the rules people get caught on the wrong side of them.  I should like to highlight two cases.  Like other Deputies I have had considerable correspondence with the Minister about one of these cases which relates to people who are so disabled they cannot drive cars themselves and have to travel as passengers.  With regard to the conversion of cars for disabled passengers, the regulations state that 30 per cent of the value of the car must be the expenditure on the modifications to meet the disability.  With regard to, say, front seat disabled passengers I understand there is a widely available scheme for about 30 per cent of the original value of the car before taxes are added and that this does not relate to the total value of the car when it is sold from a garage.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting amendment No. 101 which seeks to reduce expenditure on modifications from 30 to <Col N="2396" /> 10 per cent of the value of the car.  If the Minister believes that a figure of 20 per cent would meet the problem we will not be unreasonable about this.  In view of the fact that last year the Minister acknowledged in principle the difficulties imposed on people in such circumstances perhaps he will consider accepting this amendment.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another anomaly which has come to light since I tabled this amendment, that is, people with club-legs are eligible for the relief while those with club-feet are not.  To all intents and purposes the regulations deal with legs as opposed to feet.  I ask the Minister to also consider these people sympathetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Yates's amendment.  There seems to be inexplicable anomalies in the existing code.  The acceptance of this amendment would be greatly appreciated by the Disabled Drivers' Association and by others who have made representations to us all for some alleviation and a more generous interpretation of the code, as is envisaged in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is appropriate to mark again what the Minister did last year.  He took the Finance spokesmen of all parties into his confidence and had discussions with them before he brought amendments to the Floor of the House and provided us in advance with copies of the statutory regulations by which he implemented the scheme.  We appreciated that very much.</P>
      <P>Anomalies are being brought to our attention all the time.  Last year, too, Deputy Yates was particularly interested in the anomaly his amendment seeks to deal with.  I should like the Minister to consider this amendment.  It might be more appropriate for the Minister to amend the regulations rather than the section.  I think he is aware of Deputy Yates's intention and I should like him to consider this amendment between now and tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies <Col N="2397" /> for their recognition of what I did last year which, of course, was done only after consultation with all the Finance spokesmen.  There was agreement at that time that the scheme should be reviewed in a year from its inception and I intend to have this review carried out during the autumn.  I will be prepared to look at how the scheme here operates during the first year.</P>
      <P>With regard to passengers, the percentages referred to in the amendment can be reviewed.  The figure of 30 per cent in the Finance Act refers, of course, to the pre-tax price of the vehicle before adaptation, that is, the initial price of the vehicle before VAT or excise duty are charged.  This is a significant improvement on the previous scheme under which it was required that the adaptation would exceed 30 per cent of the higher tax inclusive price of the vehicle after adaptation.</P>
      <P>There may well be other aspects which require modification.  I have no doubt that anomalies exist &mdash; we never see them all the first day &mdash; but I believe all of these should be taken together rather than changing the agreed scheme in a piecemeal manner as envisaged in the amendment.  I will be happy to again consult the Opposition spokesmen on Finance when the review is being carried out in the autumn.  If the Deputies look at the 30 per cent figure in detail I believe they will see that it opens the gate pretty wide in relation to what can and cannot be done.  Basically what we set out to do in the present scheme was to prevent abuse in so far as possible while widening the scheme to give disabled people the best possible deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give plenty of examples, if the House want to hear them, of what would happen if we were to adopt this proposal. For example, by putting in a passenger seat people would get away with murder. That is the type of abuse we set out to take out of the scheme so that we could give the people who are entitled to such benefits the best deal possible.  I will leave it at that for now.  I hope this is acceptable to the House.  As I have said, I will involve all the Opposition spokesmen in <Col N="2398" /> the review.  This should be a non-contentious and non-political issue.  We are trying to do the best we can and I do not think anybody is interested in opening the doors to abuse.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Yates about the inclusion in the scheme of people with club legs and the exclusion of people with club feet I do not recall any such provision either in the legislation or in the regulation.  Perhaps the problem arises with the medical interpretation of the provision.  I am surprised at what the Deputy says in that regard but I take the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that whatever amendment is made to the regulations there will be people who will seek to benefit from car tax relief but who will not be able to do so.  I am thinking of people, for instance, who have had their hands amputated.  This significant group were excluded last year and I have not sought, by way of amendment to have them included.  I have tried to lunge in on what I consider to be the most deserving of cases.  I accept the Minister's bona fides in the matter in view of what happened last year and I will not be pressing this amendment to a vote.  However, I ask that the review to be carried out in the autumn will be comprehensive, sensitive and sympathetic and will take account of the copious correspondence the Minister has received about individual cases which have, to date been rejected since the regulations were amended.</P>

The medical people gave a description of the disability and I am concerned that the regulations prevent that person getting relief under the Bill.  I understood the intention of the legislation was to cover people who find it impossible to drive a conventional car because of some disability in their legs or their feet.  The Minister has said that he intends leaving this matter until the autumn but I appeal to him to ask his officials to look at the regulations with a view to amending them.  The medical <Col N="2400" /> officer, quite rightly, applies the regulations as he or she reads them but the case I referred to is not covered.  The disability of the lady I have referred to cannot be included under the term &ldquo;legs&rdquo;. In my view the regulations need to be changed.</P>

      <P>I will have a look at the issue raised but, as I said, I do not agree with carrying out a review piecemeal. It is our intention to have a review after the scheme has been in operation for 12 months.  We would then be in a position to know the adjustments that are required.  We want to ensure that we do not leave the provision open to abuse.  I should like to stress, for the Deputy's information, that the scheme is not a general mobility scheme for disabled persons. The general question of mobility for the disabled is a matter for the Minister for Health.  I am no expert on this matter but I understand that the chief community officer is the certifying officer.  That officer is in a better position than anybody to certify such people for inclusion in or exclusion from the scheme.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I understand that this arises from the Eighteenth VAT Directive from the EC Council and deals with the sale of horses chargeable to VAT.  Will the Minister explain the provision in more detail?  I understand that the 2.3 per cent rate will apply to horses, as it does to other livestock.  What will be the position of pure bred horses? Are we talking about the supply of all horses from any source or are we talking about the breeding of horses on farms being liable to 2.3 per cent VAT as is any other animal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This section amends section 1 (1) of the VAT Act and inserts &ldquo;horses&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; thereby applying to the supply of horses the 2.3 per cent rate applicable to livestock generally.  Livestock is liable to VAT at a special low rate, currently 2.3 per cent.  At present livestock is defined for VAT purposes as live cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and deer.  From 1 January 1991 horses will be included in the definition of livestock.  The supply of live horses is currently exempt from VAT.  The exemption was provided for by way of a derogation from the terms of the Sixth VAT Directive adopted in May 1977 which established throughout the Community a common system of VAT.  On 18 July 1989 the Council of the European Communities adopted the Eighteenth VAT Directive.  The terms of this directive provide for the abolition of certain derogations allowed under the terms of the Sixth VAT Directive.  One such derogation relates to Ireland's exemption of supply of horses which under the terms of the Eighteenth VAT Directive has to be abolished from 1 January 1991.  Horses were taxable at the livestock rate on the introduction of VAT on 1 November 1972 until 3 September 1973 and the supply of live horses has been exempt since then.  With the Sixth VAT Directive, as adopted by member states in May 1977 Ireland secured that derogation from the terms of the direction on a transitional basis which allowed the continued exemption of horses from VAT. The Eighteenth VAT Directive involved <Col N="2402" /> a review of all derogations granted and member states were obliged to justify the continued existence of such derogation.</P>
      <P>Horses are at present taxable in 11 member states.  The continued exemption of horses in Ireland proved impossible to defend and, accordingly, the derogation is being ceded as agreed under the terms of the Eighteenth Directive with effect from 1 January 1991.  The supply and importation of horses will become liable to VAT from that date. There are no provisions in VAT law governing sales made by one registered farmer to another and the sale of horses between unregistered farmers will not attract VAT.</P>

      <P>Is he doing well?  The purpose of the flat rate is to compensate those farmers who choose not to register for VAT in respect of the VAT they pay on taxable purchases for their farming <Col N="2404" /> business.  Farmers bear VAT at 10 per cent on fuel, electricity, machinery, repairs, etc.  They pay 23 per cent on agricultural machinery and transport costs and they may recover this tax in their returns if they register for VAT.  If they choose not to register, compensation for the tax burden is available to them by means of the flat rate addition to prices of agricultural produce sold to VAT-registered customers such as co-operatives, livestock marts and so on. These VAT-registered customers, in turn, recover the flat rate addition through their VAT returns as an offset against their own liability.  Whether farmers register makes little appreciable difference to total VAT yield, as the major agricultural inputs and outputs are zero-rated.  Consequently, from the point of view of administrative efficiency, it is preferable that farmers should not be obliged to register.  This option of non-registration for farmers applies in all EC countries with the exception of the United Kingdom and Denmark.</P>

      <P>My fear here is that we are buying a pig in a poke, as somebody has said.  To save me rising later may I make the point &mdash; seeing that it has arisen at this stage &mdash; I remain unconvinced about the fairness of this mechanism. The Minister and his advisers agree now that it is a macro-guesstimate from which unregistered farmers benefit. It seems to me that one can automatically conclude that a very great deal of the farmers concerned do not pay tax of any kind.  We had a long debate on another Stage of the Bill about the fact that, now that farmers are being brought on to a current year basis of assessment, they should receive the same allowances as PAYE workers and so on.  Notwithstanding our having been watched carefully in the gallery on the evening <Col N="2411" /> in question, I suspect that most of the farmers on whose behalf a plea was being made are not liable to tax at all.  I suspect that there is a major overlap here in the sense that unregistered farmers, or a large proportion of them, would not be paying tax of any kind.  For example, Deputy Cotter adverted to the anomaly I highlighted in my contribution in the House on budget night, which is, as compared with unregistered businesses, for example, that there is no similar facility available to unregistered businesses.  The Minister replies, quite rightly: let them register and we will deal with them.  It seems to me there are two different laws applicable here.  I am afraid I cannot be convinced of the equity of our making this kind of refund when we really do not know what will be the circumstances of the individual unregistered farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put on the record that what Deputy Rabbitte is saying does not represent the facts at all. Members must realise that a farmer buys, let us say, a tractor, equipment, has repairs done and he is paying VAT &mdash; I am talking about an unregistered farmer &mdash; in all those areas.  The fact that he gets a 2.3 per cent refund only covers portion because there will be winners and losers. The fact remains that he is paying VAT in all the areas in which he buys and, if he is unregistered, he has no means of reclaiming it.  If he is registered, that is different.  Let us take the example of a small business, a small businessman will have a level of turnover in respect of which he can exercise a choice as to whether he wants to register or not.  If we were to bring all of the small farmers into the administrative net for refund purposes or otherwise, I would hazard a guess they would be in refund circumstances most of the time.  It would be a total administrative nightmare.  That is my honest opinion.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Minister explain from his section notes the significance of this section? Would he also outline briefly what is the general position at present with regard to VAT on services supplied from abroad? For example, if somebody is engaged in the denture repair business and that service is conducted in Liverpool rather than Dublin, in what way does it work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that a recipient of certain foreign services for business purposes &mdash; who has an establishment in the State and his principal establishment in the supplier's country, and who would not otherwise be chargeable with VAT on such services &mdash; is made so chargeable in the State where <Col N="2413" /> the services are for the use of his establishment here.  The provisions of this section will be applicable from the date of passage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The place of supply of many services is the place where the person supplying the service is established.  The supplier is legally responsible for payment of the tax to his authorities.</P>
      <P>A lacuna in our present law has been identified by a number of accountancy firms.  This present amendment is to remove an incentive to have services carried out by foreign companies in circumstances where there might not be any VAT payable.  The problem arises where the recipient of taxable Fourth Schedule services is a branch of a company and the principal establishment of that company is in the same country as that of the supplier of the services.  The conditions of section 5 (6) of the VAT Act are not met and the services do not, therefore, constitute received services liable to Irish VAT.  A practical example of this would be where a Dublin branch of a UK insurance company is in receipt of services from an accountancy firm in Manchester. Such services do not come within the provisions of section 5 (6).  Consequently, in so far as Irish VAT is concerned, the general rule applies and the place of supply is Manchester.  However, as regards UK VAT, our understanding is that since the services are for the use of the company's Dublin branch this would qualify the accountancy services as a zero-rated supply in the UK.  Thus the supply escapes VAT liability in both countries.  This could give rise to complaints about distortion of competition since it is clearly advantageous for an exempt insurance company, or bank, to avail itself of tax free services whenever it can do so.  This amendment closes the loophole.</P>

      <P>The VAT Act, which is based on the Sixth VAT Directive, states in section 5 (6) to which I have referred that certain specified services which are received for business purposes tax free from abroad by persons established in Ireland are taxable in Ireland.  These include services which are commonly referred to as Fourth Schedule Services.  Such services include the services of acountants, lawyers, advertising agencies, consultants, etc.  All persons, including exempt bodies, irrespective of whether they are registered for VAT, who receive taxable Fourth Schedule Services for business purposes from abroad are liable, subject to threshold limitations, to pay Irish VAT on these services.</P>

This present amendment is to remove an incentive to have services carried out by foreign companies in circumstances where there might not be any VAT payable.  The problem arises where the recipient of taxable Fourth Schedule Services is a branch of a company and the principal establishment of that company is in the same country as that of the supplier of the services.  The conditions of section 5 (6) of the VAT Act are not met and the services do not, therefore, constitute received services liable to Irish VAT.  A practical example of this would be where a Dublin Branch of a UK insurance company &mdash; I have read this out before &mdash; is in receipt of services from <Col N="2417" /> an accountancy firm in Manchester.  Such services do not come within the provisions of section 5 (6).  Consequently, in so far as Irish VAT is concerned, the general rule applies and the place of supply is Manchester.  However, as regards UK VAT, our understanding is that since the services are for the use of the company's Dublin branch this would qualify the accountancy services as a zero-rated supply in the UK.  Thus the supply escapes VAT liability in both countries.  This could give rise to complaints about distortion of competition since it is clearly advantageous for an exempt insurance company, or bank, to avail itself of tax free services whenever it can do so.

He will ask for the invoice which will have to be produced.  When the VAT man comes he will go through the list of invoices and he will see these invoices with no VAT.

      <P>Whatever it might be, if an invoice issues from one source and there is a copy that can be checked, it can be discovered if invoices are being withheld.  There would not be any need for the VAT people in the Minister's office if what the Minister is saying was happening every time.  However, people make mistakes whether deliberate or otherwise and there is a way within the present system of checking it out.  A VAT inspector can go into a business, remove a number of invoices and check the source. For example, an individual could be getting a book of invoices printed for himself, writing them out and putting them into his files and a VAT inspector could take those out and go back to source to find out if they were genuine invoices.</P>

I have no doubt fraud does take place but I think the number of cases is quite small and the sort of firms that this section would be intended to cover are most unlikely to be involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should clarify our minds on the <i>modus operandi</i> of the thing.  I must admit I am still not clear on that.  I do not profess to be an expert on this, but it seems that the ultimate cheque for the VAT will come from the London firm or the Manchester firm or whatever.  It <Col N="2423" /> seems it would work by the London firm sending an invoice to their Dublin subsidiary on which VAT of 23 per cent would be added; they would be obligated under the section to collect that 23 per cent with their bill from the Dublin subsidiary and, in turn, to remit that to the Irish Revenue Commissioners.  I cannot see how it could possibly operate in any other way.</P>

      <P>In page 73, before section 91, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;91. &mdash;Section 8 of the Principal Act is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  in subsection (3) (inserted by the Act of 1978) by the substitution&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  in paragraph (b) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1982) of `£30,000' for `£15,000' (inserted by the Finance Act, 1989),</P>
      <P>(ii)  in paragraph (c) (inserted by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1981) of `£50,000' for `£32,000' (inserted by the Finance Act, 1989), and</P>

      <P>(b)  in subsection (3A) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1982), by the substitution of `£30,000' for `£15,000' (inserted by the Finance Act, 1989), and</P>

    <P>(c)  in subsection (9) (inserted by the Act of 1978), in the definition of `farmer' (inserted by the Finance Act, 1982), by the substitution of `£30,000' for `£15,000' (inserted by <Col N="2424" /> the Finance Act, 1989) in each place where it occurs.&rdquo;.   </P>
    <P>I had tabled a similar amendment last year, the spirit of which the Minister accepted.  On Report Stage, the Minister increased the thresholds for liability for VAT on small businesses.  Again, I have put down an amendment, the spirit of which is to suggest to the Minister that the thresholds at which small businesses are caught for VAT should be raised substantially. I do not know what the appropriate threshold should be, but I believe that it should be higher than it is at present especially in the case of one-man operations where the operator is involved in activities such as upholstery, making of curtains and so on, because a lot of the turnover is effectively the cost of the material which has been bought in to carry out the service.  The present ceilings are too low.  For example, in an upholstery operation the breakdown between the cost of material and labour is 60:40 in favour of material.  Such a person is getting no more than a wage and a fairly inadequate wage at the point where he is caught for VAT.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this to see if he can raise the ceiling at which the small businessman is caught for VAT.  It seems to me that the collection costs are probably more than the revenue gained from a lot of these small businesses.  I would like the Minister to introduce a more realistic ceiling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have finally sorted out this point: if an exempted body, such as a bank, is buying in a service from abroad, they in turn will be more inclined to take the service from abroad because they are exempt, whereas if they were registered, it would not matter.  In effect what happens is that the recipient of the service raises the charge and also claims a refund so it has neutral effect; it is only used to stop distortion of trade.  It goes into the recipient's books on one side and out on the other.  Basically it has a neutral effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment briefly <Col N="2425" /> on the amendment that Deputy Noonan, <i>(Limerick East)</i> has just proposed.  I am particularly interested in raising the thresholds for registration for VAT because I feel it could be used as a mechanism for making life a bit easier for people trying to trade in Border areas. We have tried everything, as the Minister well knows, to try to alleviate the difficulties that they are experiencing in those areas.  They have come up with all sorts of imaginative schemes which were unworkable, indeed we have had discussions on how they could be assisted. While the Minister has made some attempt to tackle the problem by reducing the rate of VAT from 25 per cent to 23 per cent and by reducing the excise duty on selected items, I am sure he is aware that the position in the Border towns is far from satisfactory.  The difference between the price of goods North and South is still far too great and in fact traders have to apply much lower profit margins than their colleagues in the South for example.  Traders in the Border area are very conscious of the price of goods and have very keen profit margins.  In his amendment Deputy Noonan is seeking to raise the threshold of traders to £50,000 per annum but when you consider that a profit margin of 10 per cent applies to that turnover, a turnover of £1,000 a week brings in less than a normal week's wage for the individual.  Persons with that level of turnover cannot afford the services of a person to do their books, and in addition they would have an inadequate income.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that if the Minister increased the threshold at which VAT is payable he would be putting a few extra pounds in the pockets of those living along the Border areas and this would be extremely welcome.  I ask the Minister to take Deputy Noonan's suggestion on board and raise the thresholds to a meaningful level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes, in effect, that the annual turnover thresholds for VAT registration purposes should be increased from £32,000 to £50,000 in the case of suppliers of goods <Col N="2426" /> and from £15,000 to £30,000 in the case of other traders.  The amendment is opposed on the following grounds: First, by providing for the exclusion of certain traders from the VAT system the amendment imposes a cost which is broadly estimated at £1.5 million in a full year. The higher the level of turnover threshold for registration purposes is pitched the greater are the tax advantage effects accruing to unregistered traders below the thresholds as against registered traders above the thresholds.  Such advantage must lead to distortion of competition. The latest adjustment in thresholds occurred as recently as 1989 when the annual turnover thresholds were increased, in line with inflation, from £25,000 to £32,000 in the case of the supplier of goods and from £12,000 to £15,000 in the case of other traders.  Our thresholds, along with those of the United Kingdom are far higher than those in other member states of the EC. The high level of our thresholds is not viewed with favour by the other member states and I have received no demands from traders or business that the threshold should be further increased.  Certainly I have received pleas from the traders in the Border areas to do something to alleviate their problems, but their problem will not be solved in this manner as it is much more wide-ranging.  Indeed the first step in trying to alleviate some of the cross-Border problems was the reduction of VAT and by continuing along that road we will solve that problem. A small increase in the threshold of exemption from VAT will not make any material difference to them.  We also have a very low rate of inflation this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the 48 hour rule was another step along the road to try to alleviate some of the problems experienced in the Border areas.  Indeed it was successful, but it is under court threat at present.  We expect to receive a decision on it during August or September this year but I believe that it will be the harmonisation of taxes so that there will be little or no difference in the level of taxes <Col N="2427" /> on each side of the Border that will ultimately be the solution to the problems the Deputy has raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is conscious that there is a serious problem in the Border areas.  Having listened to the Minister's response it appears that he agrees that there will be some advantage to the traders in the Border areas if he accepts this amendment.  They would be at the advantage that they could sell their goods more cheaply because they would not have to apply the 23 per cent rate of VAT to the higher price.  My reading is that there would be a cost advantage to the retailer if this amendment were accepted, and the cost to the Exchequer of £1.5 million as mentioned by the Minister, is insignificant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It will make very little material difference to the hundreds and thousands of traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact the Minister would be telling the retailers in the Border areas that he was trying to improve things for them.  The Minister should consider that everybody on the main street in Clones would be removed from the VAT registration net if he raised the threshold to £50,000, and in addition he would be telling those people that they would not need to employ somebody to do the books.  In addition the traders would be a little bit more competitive.  I was the first person to indicate that this amendment was a possible mechanism to help those in the Border areas and once I mentioned this I got a great response from the business people.  They would like a little assistance, which would not cost the Exchequer very much.  The threshold has a different meaning in towns like Clones, Castleblayney or any other town in my county from that in the rest of rural Ireland.  To raise the threshold to £50,000 would exclude many people and if they then wanted to register they could do so on a voluntary basis.  I would appeal to the Minister in view of the small cost to <Col N="2428" /> the Exchequer to consider implementing this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EC law I am not entitled to raise the threshold to £50,000.  I can just make a little marginal adjustment in relation to inflation and the benefit to the people the Deputy is talking about would be infinitesimal.  The Deputy said that if I raised the threshold to £50,000 it would make a material difference to the people in the Border areas but EC law does not allow me to do that; it only allows an inflationary adjustment, which is a very small adjustment in relation to the figures we are talking about &mdash; £32,000 or £33,000.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 102a:</P>
      <P>In page 73, paragraph (a), lines 19 and 20, to delete subparagraph (ii). </P>
      <P>Basically this amendment proposes the excision of the provision in the Finance Act, 1988, which provides for VAT on electricity at 5 per cent.  The Minister now proposes to increase that to 10 per cent. I cannot understand the arguments that the ESB should be treated differently from any other company.  If my memory serves me right, the Minister proposed that this amendment would take £11 million from the ESB in the current year and £18 million in a full year.  My understanding of the position in the ESB is very different from the Minister's if he thinks there is leeway to take that money out of the accounts of the ESB, who recorded a profit of £5 million last year and who still have a serious debt equity problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second aspect to this matter. I cannot understand how the Minister can continue to maintain that this will not impact on the consumer.  In the context of the ESB balance sheet, it must impact on the consumer.  The costs must be <Col N="2430" /> passed on indirectly to the domestic consumer. I presume the industrial and general commercial user can reclaim the VAT but in the case of the domestic consumer they must ultimately pick up the tab.  I recall the Taoiseach saying on budget night that it would not cost the consumer a penny but, against the background of the ESB balance sheet, that cannot be the case.  The purpose of the amendment is to excise that reference in the Finance Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to look at the whole question of taxation of fuels and so on, I suggest we would have to do so against a much broader canvas.  There may indeed be an argument for assisting those who purchased consumer friendly fuels as compared with fuels that help to destroy the environment.  At least at the point of use, electricity is a consumer friendly source of energy.  Therefore, for all these reasons I hope this amendment is acepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.  It proposes to deal with what amounts to a clever little device for tapping into profits the ESB are making and accumulating which, I believe, is entirely wrong.  We should not operate our industrial base, so heavily reliant on electricity and power supplies, <Col N="2431" /> on the basis that the ESB's profits should be tapped into directly by the Minister. If, as is the case, the ESB make appreciable profits, those profits ought to be passed on to the consumers of electricity, domestic and industrial, in the form of lower prices.</P>
      <P>The cost of electricity in this country is among the highest in Europe.  This is making things increasingly difficult for our industrialists and it prejudices employment.  If the ESB make profits, the most advantageous thing that could be done for the economy would be to use some of that additional funding to reduce the price of electricity to industrial and domestic users.  It is a fact that in my constituency and in that of Deputy Rabbite the price of electricity impacts very hard on many households.  Both of us have people coming to our clinics who have their electricity cut off because they cannot meet the electricity bills.  They are terrified when the ESB bill arrives, and the ESB apply tough standards of collection of those funds.  Yet, here we see that their profits are being allowed escalate, not to the benefit of the consumer, who is entitled to it, but to the benefit of the Minister in a rather strange way of collecting taxation which is not up front.</P>
      <P>He is saying he will increase VAT on electricity but it will cost the consumer nothing because the increase will be absorbed by the ESB.  It should not be absorbed by the ESB.  The proper course to adopt would be that the Minister should raise his taxation in whatever way is appropriate, in a fair way across the board, and the prices of electricity should be kept to an absolute minimum in the interests of employment and in the interests of people who very often have great difficulty in meeting those bills and whose living standards are adversely affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. a102b in my name and that of Deputy Noonan reads:</P>
      <P>In page 74, before section 96, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2432" /> 96.&mdash;The Second Schedule to the Principal Act is hereby amended in paragraph (vii) by the insertion of `except greyhounds' after `dogs'. </P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to bring some relief to the greyhound industry. As the House is aware, I hope, feed for greyhounds is the only form of animal feed subject to value-added tax &mdash; it suffers a value-added tax rate of 23 per cent. Feed for race horses is VAT free.  Feed used for cattle, sheep and other animals is also VAT free.  In this Finance Bill we have had a proposal from the Minister that the rearing of greyhounds and horses should no longer be exempted from VAT.  The Minister links the greyhound industry and the bloodstock industry because, following the enactment of this Bill, they will be subject to value-added tax.</P>
    <P>When it comes to applying value-added tax to the feed used in the production of these animals the Minister does not see the greyhound industry and the horse racing industry, or other horse rearing industry, in the same light.  He applies no value-added tax to the feed used in the horse industry but a 23 per cent value added tax to the feed used in the greyhound industry.  This only aggravated the deep sense of annoyance among those working in the greyhound industry when they saw how the Minister divided up a recent allocation of £3.5 million, which is a proportion of the 10 per cent off-course betting duty proceeds, between the two industries.  Out of that total of £3.5 million he allocated £3 million to the Racing Board and a mere £500,000 to Bord na gCon.  In addition to levying a higher rate of value-added tax on feed used in the greyhound industry and not levying it on the horse industry he gives a disproportionate amount of the allocation of the funds from the off-course betting levy to the horse industry as against the greyhound industry.  I have nothing against the horse industry by any means.  It is one of the most employment-intensive uses of agricultural land that exists if not the most employment-intensive use of agricultural land.  I do not wish to take from <Col N="2433" /> any of its privileges but it is fair to say that it is the sport of those who are relatively well off.  It requires a certain amount of money to become commercially involved in the horse industry. However, for somebody who is of modest income and who wishes to supplement their income by the breeding of animals, entering into the greyhound industry is a much easier and less expensive method of becoming involved in what will in the future be off-farm commercial income for those living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has referred in a number of his pronouncements about rural development to the potential importance of the greyhound industry as a means of creating additional income for those living in rural areas in view of the fact that the income from strictly farming activities is liable to be constricted as a result of developments in world trade and at EC level.  If that is the case &mdash; I have no doubt the Minister for Agriculture and Food is sincere in what he says &mdash; he should get help from his colleague, the Minister for Finance, who should treat feed used in the greyhound industry in the same way as feed used in the agricultural industry is treated for VAT purposes; in other words a zero rating.  That is the purport and purpose of amendment No. a102b.  I hope the Minister and the House will be prepared to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I support this amendment.  It is difficult to understand when all food including animal feedings stuffs are exempt from VAT that food for greyhounds is not exempt. Greyhounds are very important in the economic life of many parts of rural Ireland.  I think it was an oversight that food for greyhounds was not exempted in the past.  This is an appropriate Finance Bill in which to exclude VAT on greyhound food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already dealt with the issue of the Minister applying VAT to horses and greyhounds; in effect he has defined horses and greyhounds as livestock for livestock purposes under the VAT Acts. It seems to me that it follows that he <Col N="2434" /> should also define greyhound food as an exempt food &mdash; animal feeding stuff &mdash; in the wider sense now in which he is using the term &ldquo;livestock&rdquo;.  I have no doubt whatsoever if his colleague and close friend, Deputy Collins, were Minister for Finance he would accept this amendment immediately because he lives in a part of the country where the greyhound is very important to the economy.</P>
    <P>I recommend this amendment to the Minister.  I doubt very much if there would be a serious loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  If there was a loss it would be unquantifiable.  The breeding of greyhounds is becoming increasingly a source of revenue to small farmers.  It would be consistent with the policy of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who has advocated to Brussels that the breeding of greyhounds be treated as a off-farm activity for certain purposes. Also he is aware that Bord na gCon has <i>in pectore</i> proposals if not open proposals to close down many of the tracks throughout the country.  Rationalisation is taking place in the greyhound track industry at present which is a matter for serious concern. There is an extensive export business in greyhounds.  It does not have the high profile or the glamour attached to it which the horse industry has.  It is the small man's sport.  We see the fellow walking out with the two dogs on a lead early in the morning with a cap pulled down over his head, he is a very unglamorous figure.  As Deputy Bruton said, he will not figure in the Angela Phelan column.  He will never be on the first line saying that such-and-such a Minister who is interested in greyhounds was not at Harolds Cross.  I do not think we will have that introduction in the greyhound industry.  It is an important facet of Irish life and will become increasingly important in the economy of rural areas.  It is particularly important as another source of income for small farmers who are increasingly coming under pressure as a result of the depletion of their main activity income because of the fall in the value of milk, calves and beef.</P>
    <P>While I am on my feet I would like to indicate support for Deputy Rabbitte's <Col N="2435" /> amendment.  He has made a very good case.  I think there has been an extremely unhealthy sweetheart arrangement between Fianna Fáil Governments and the ESB.  The rules which apply to state companies were stated very firmly by ourselves when we were in Government and particularly by the then Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, who had to take some very hard decisions to sort out the State sector. You cannot have the Government and a State company hand in glove, there cannot be sweetheart arrangements, it must be all above the line.</P>

Deputies like Deputy Taylor talked here about the ESB making profits and said the profits should be used to reduce the price of electricity rather than be used for extra revenue.  That would be fair enough if they were a profitable company, but the ESB borrowings &mdash; I was going to say atrocious &mdash; are colossal, massive, out of proportion even to the turnover and asset value of the company.  If they were not a monopoly company and had to trade in <Col N="2436" /> the normal world they would be declared insolvent.  They are technically insolvent.</P>

      <P>There is no pretence, no piggy bank, nothing.  The ESB had a net surplus of £11.6 million under the legislation as they are set up.  I am sure all Deputies are well aware the ESB were not set up to make a profit, they were set up to break even.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not allowed to make a profit.  That is the main reason for the legislation.  Secondly, the ESB have been allowed from the very start to apply double depreciation.  No other outfit in this country, commercial or otherwise, can do that.  We are talking about running State bodies on a commercial basis and I would have no quarrel with the ESB if they now wanted to revert to normal commercial practices and forget about double depreciation. Double depreciation was put into the legislation as a vehicle to allow them to accumulate money to provide for their development programmes.  We are all fully aware they are at the end of their major development programmes so if they want to revert to normal commercial criteria, as I hear from the other side of <Col N="2437" /> the House and with which I agree, then let us see the ESB in a different light.</P>
      <P>I was criticised last year when I did nothing in relation to harmonisation of taxes in starting the process.  We all know the ESB and Telecom are not going to last at their present rates, so there has to be a move.  Deputy Noonan and Deputy Taylor suggested that this is not the way to do it, that we should come in here and raise taxes for that £11 million.  That is a new approach but I heard none of them say where I was supposed to raise that £11 million.  However, we started the process this year and it is right to continue it and show to the Community member states that we are serious about accepting in principle the approximation of taxes.</P>
      <P>This area along with Telecom and others will have to be tackled and in that process there will be winners and losers. Why not do it when there is a surplus there to take it on board?  If we wait until next year and then there is no surplus, what will happen?  It will have to be passed on to the consumer.  Consequently, the consumer is getting the benefit of the surplus at the moment.  The consumers' bills have been sent out.  Most people in the House said when this provision was announced, &ldquo;Wait till the time comes and the additional 5 per cent will be added to the cumtomer's bill&rdquo;.  It was not, because the surplus was there to take it.  That is why the amendment is opposed.</P>
      <P>On the question of introducing a zero rate for greyhounds I am precluded from creating any new zero rate.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 103 not moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a general comment on section 97 before it follows <Col N="2441" /> the inevitable path of previous sections. I have reservations about some aspects of the section but I will confine my remarks to a general comment on the provision which imposes a levy on the banks.  This highlights the weaknesses identified in the earlier discussions concerning the general corporate tax area and the fact that this levy was really only introduced as an acknowledgment that the banks were managing, through the use of one tax avoidance measure or another, to avoid paying any signficant amount of tax.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It was really due to the Government's embarrassment at the infinitesimal take in taxation which caused the levy to be introduced in the first place.  I would prefer it if the tax did not have to be levied on the assets but rather on the profits but, of course, the situation is that this represents the only significant amount of tax the banks yield. Unfortunately, as I understand it, it is restricted to deposits within the State.  Of course, banks including our major banks, are effectively multinationals which can afford to transfer funds abroad for &ldquo;good commercial reasons&rdquo;.  I should like to say again that the banks' published accounts in this area usually contain a provision for tax, and is no more than that, and the actual cash tax payments returned are usually very significantly less.  For that reason I am unhappy with section 97.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It was roughly £15 million in each case for the AIB and the Bank of Ireland; the rest was among the smaller banks.  With regard to the bank levy, the income from corporate tax relief from the banking sector has been disappointingly low for some years past, for example, in 1986-87 it was only £24 million. We are trying to increase this amount all the time by reducing the accelerated capital allowances and tightening up and phasing out section 84s.  In 1988-89 the corporate tax paid by the banks was £50 million, plus the levy of £36 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we continue to phase out section 84 and capital allowances, naturally there will be more corporate tax to be paid by the banking sector.  Section 84 is the real tax shelter for the banks and it is the area where they have managed to evade paying most tax.  It is a bit early to be definitive about what will happen in levy <Col N="2443" /> in the early part of the nineties when the Single Market comes except to say that if one were to look very broadly at the competitive aspects of banking one could perhaps argue the case that it puts them in an inferior position on it is a distortion of competitive positions or whatever.  No definite decision has been taken on that but we will continue to tighten up on section 84s and on the phasing out of capital allowances.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2445" />&ldquo;undertaking' means an undertaking the main objects of which include the collective investment, in any property, of capital raised from the public and the units of which may, at the request of the unit holders, be repurchased or redeemed, directly or indirectly out of the assets of the undertaking, and includes a unit trust, UCITS or other similar investment undertaking which, in the case of a similar investment undertaking is, in the opinion of the Commissioners an undertaking to which this section applies notwithstanding that such undertaking is a company which issues shares to the public, whether or not those shares may be repurchased or redeemed directly or indirectly out of the assets of the undertaking;&rdquo;. </P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of undertaking to which this section is to apply is one established on the lines of a unit trust or an investment company.  It is not intended to apply generally to investment by members of the public in ordinary plcs, and, particularly, not holding companies. Concern has been expresed since the publication of the Bill that as then defined an &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; could include such investments. It is not possible to comprehensively define in a statute the kind of undertaking to which the levy applies although its nature is easily described and ascertained.  Accordingly, the amendment to the definition of &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; gives authority to the Revenue Commissioners to reach a conclusion in any case of doubt.  This is likely to be a rare occurrence.  Any such decision by the <Col N="2446" /> Commissioners, however, will be subject to the usual appeals mechanism for stamp duty.  What we are talking about are mutual funds that are managed on behalf of unit trust holders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the proposal for rationalisation of stamp duty, which is contained in section 99 and the Ninth Schedule, eight of the major headings in the First Schedule of the Stamp Act, 1891 have been altered.  One of the headings dealing with duplicate or counterpart instruments was omitted from both section 99 and the Ninth Schedule.  This is now being rectified.</P>
      <P>At present the maximum charge for a duplicate or counterpart instrument is £5. The intention is to increase this maximum charge to £10.  The charge for a duplicate or counterpart has always been in line with the charge for collateral, auxiliary or additional instrument which has been increased in this section from £5 to £10.</P>
      <P>The £10 is a maximum charge of £10. If the duty payable on the original instrument is less than £10 the charge payable on the duplicate or twin instrument will be the same as the original.  The Financial Resolution, No. 26, made provision for the amendments to the First Schedule Stamp Act, 1891.  I have been advised that a further resolution is not required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The levying of funds in this way on counterpart or duplicate documents is unnecessary and should not be done.  The stamp duty appropriate to the original instrument should be assessed and paid.  However, we are talking about applying the full stamp duty to a duplicate of the original document.  Traditionally, the duplicate was stamped for £5.  We have been told that charges should be increased in line with inflation but the Minister is imposing an increase on 100 per cent which is wrong.  The stamp duty on the documents can be varied from time to time but the Minister is proposing to increase the charge for a copy of the original.  It should be left at £5.  The doubling of the cost will place a burden on many people.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment which has arisen out of the rationalisation of stamp duty rates contained in section 100.  The First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891 has been substantially amended.  Under various charging headings a number of paragraphs have been deleted.  In some cases, in the interest of clarity, some paragraphs have been given paragraph numbers and in addition some paragraphs have been moved.</P>
      <P>There are references to specific paragraphs in the First Schedule in existing legislation which must be changed to take account of the new paragraph numbers contained in the Ninth Schedule.

      <P>This section changes the manner in which stamp duty is applied to houses.  Previously, when a house or apartment was acquired from a builder, it was the practice to acquire the site at a certain value &mdash; or sometimes to impute a certain value to its acquisition &mdash; and then to enter into a building contract.  If somebody bought a site for £20,000 it was regarded as a contract and stamp duty was paid on that amount.  They then entered into a contract for £80,000 to build the house and no stamp duty applied.  On a house of that composition costing £100,000, stamp duty was paid on the sum of £20,000 and that is how people operated for a long time.</P>
      <P>I know there was an element of tax avoidance in it at times when; even when the site cost less, people would impute a higher proportion of the value to the cost of building it.  As the stamp duty only applied to the contract on the acquisition of the site &mdash; and not to the building contract &mdash; they paid stamp duty on the smallest possible amount.  The Minister has moved to close that and, while it is very hard on people who have entered into contracts, the Minister introduced an amendment between the day of the budget and the introduction of the Finance Bill to say that if their business is completed by 1 September they will be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to discuss the circumstances in which somebody acquires a site but does not build on it for a long time.  An American or German tourist visiting Ireland sees a half acre of land on which he thinks he would like to build a house and buys it for a sum of £10,000.  Up to now he paid stamp duty according to the Schedule which the Minister recently amended. As matters stand now, there will be an imputed value of an aggregated consideration ten times the value of the site. Therefore, the purchaser, instead of paying stamp duty on the site which he acquired for £10,000, will pay it on an <Col N="2451" /> imputed value of a house which will subsequently be built on the site &mdash; plus the site &mdash; of £100,000.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When the aggregated consideration cannot be ascertained at the time of the signing of the contract, the duty will be charged on a figure equal to ten times the market value of the land.  That is the meaning of the section.  It is fine if the acquisition of the site and the building of the house are only separated by a short interval but we all know people who acquired sites and held on to them for many years without building on them.  This particularly applies to the site acquired by a tourist living in Hamburg who intends to reside here when he retires.  Indeed, there can be four or five transactions over ten or 12 years in relation to sites of this kind.  It is clear from the section that in a case of this kind the purchaser will be paying stamp duty on ten times the value of the site.</P>
      <P>If there is a different interpretation it badly needs to be clarified because it goes on to say that this ten times value can be decreased by negotiation with the Revenue Commissioners but that it cannot be decreased to a figure more than five times the value.  A German &mdash; or an Irishman &mdash; may buy a site for £10,000 but does not build on it.  The Revenue Commissioners will say that the aggregate value of the house which he intends to build in future on the site is ten times the value of the site so his stamp duty is based on the sum of £100,000.  He can negotiate with the Revenue Commissioners a figure between £50,000 and £100,000 for the purposes of assessment for stamp duty.  That is a daft provision and I should like to see it changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>No, my queries were from Ireland.  We all know what is involved here.  Sites were bought from a builder who had about 100 of them in an estate.  Stamp duty was paid on the sites but not on the houses which were subsequently built on them.  This is a matter of equity, apart from anything else.  How do you tell a person who buys a secondhand house costing £100,000 or £150,000 that they should pay stamp duty based on £150,000 when it does not apply across the board?  If somebody in a rural area buys a site from a neighbour or farmer and then negotiates with a different person to build the house they are not caught by this section.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) deals with the multipliers which the two amendments seek to reduce.  It must be emphasised that this subsection is not a tax charging section.  It can only come into operation where a house is being built or will be built on the site but, in addition, where it is not possible to determine the consideration for the house when the instrument is presented for stamping.</P>
      <P>The range of multipliers, a maximum of ten and a minimum of five, provided for in subsection (3) is intended to provide flexibility in the application of the section.  It recognises that situation will exist where information regarding the cost of building the house will not be forthcoming.  Depending on the information available to them, the Revenue Commissioners may feel it appropriate, in certain cases, to apply a higher multiple than in others.  The area and location of the site and the size of the building will be among the factors that will determine the choice of multiple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on the past experience of the Revenue Commissioners it is felt that multiples within the range of five to ten times the value of the site realistically reflect the true proportion which exists between values of sites and of completed houses.  A range of two to four times the <Col N="2453" /> value of the site is considered far too low and could lead to the deliberate suppression of information in order to have stamp duty assessed on a low multiple rather than on the real cost involved.</P>
    <P>To express it in another way, if the multipliers are too low there will be serious loss of revenue as individuals will tend to use these multipliers rather than the real or higher consideration of the house.  The section has been inserted to meet the case of the purchasers who genuinely do not know or cannot ascertain the consideration of the house he or she will have built.  It is not the intention to open up possibilities for avoidance schemes.</P>
    <P>If too much stamp duty is shown to have been paid as a result of using the multipliers, the section provides for a refund of the overpaid duty with interest at 1 per cent per month or part of a month.  This interest is tax free.</P>

      <P>No, unless there is a direct link between the seller of the house, being a builder, for instance, who has the site; those kinds of circumstances. I think the Deputy knows what we are trying to get at.  We are trying to stop builders who are using the loophole to avoid paying stamp duty on a house, say, costing between £150,000 and £200,000 by imputing the site value only. When circumstances arise in which there is no direct link, then that will not attract stamp duty more than that payable on the site itself.  If there is a link established, in those circumstances, the multiplier effect would be employed by the Revenue. For example, if no house is built on the site over a period of two years then there will be a total refund of the imputed stamp duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 114a:</P>
      <P>In page 87, lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;by either spouse into the joint ownership of both spouses.&rdquo;  and substitute the following:</P>
      <P> (a)  by either spouse into the joint ownership of both spouses, or</P>
      <P>(b)  by either spouse into the ownership of the other spouse arising from marital separation or breakdown.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>This section provides for transfers of property by a spouse into the joint ownership of both spouses, so that any such transfers will be exempt from duty from the date the Act becomes law.  I am seeking in my amendment to provide for circumstances of a marital breakdown.  Let us suppose the spouse who seeks to have her name put on the deeds of the family home finds that the only name on the deeds prior to that has been the name of the other spouse, her husband, so that currently she is liable to stamp duty in attempting to have her name inserted on the deeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor advises me that his amendment No. 115 meets the same objective more economically than mine, since his refers specifically to &ldquo;the property in a family home&rdquo;&mdash; seeking that no stamp duty should be payable on any instrument where &ldquo;the property in a <Col N="2456" /> family home&rdquo; is transferred to the other spouse in the circumstances I have described.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might inform the Minister of the kind of circumstances I am endeavouring to cover here.  I am asking the Minister for a concession on this since we have worked long and hard on this Bill.  Let us suppose a husband and wife are separating and the house is in the husband's name only.  Let us also suppose it is a small house costing, say, £25,000.  When they break up the arrangement is that the wife is to get the house, that is part of the deal on the break-up of the marriage.  The husband agrees to transfer it to her.  Without this amendment she would be caught for stamp duty on that transfer.  In most cases about which Deputy Rabbitte and I are speaking they just could not afford to pay the stamp duty.  Putting the property in joint names means it would be exempt but when the property is to go into the wife's name only it is caught.  This is causing considerable difficulty for people in standard, working-class, houses and so on.  The stamp duty might amount to, say, £300 only, but they just cannot cope with that imposition.  I would ask the Minister for a concession on this one.</P>

      <P>I have been looking at the position.  In my last budget I made joint ownership exempt from stamp duty in order to encourage such transfer.  I had one worry about this, that is that as a consequence, it might encourage single party ownership of a house by one spouse.  I am almost satisfied we can meet Deputy Taylor's request.  I will see what I can do between now and Report Stage but I am fairly satisfied we can meet his request.  The Deputy is really saying that in circumstances of marital breakdown where the family home becomes part of the overall settlement, rather than that being subjected to stamp duty, it should be exempt.  Is that what he is saying?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2458" /> That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P> (a)  recognise the present crisis in Irish agriculture with particular reference to the present GATT round negotiations;</P>
    <P>(b)  acknowledge the serious income crisis now affecting thousands of Irish farmers;</P>
    <P>(c)  implement measures that will help to alleviate some of the problems associated with the present crisis in the areas of milk, beef and store cattle, cereals and sheep; and</P>
    <P>(d)  make low interest loans available to finance beef production. </P>
    <P>The Government is therefore called upon to arrange for the funds to be borrowed on the German market, cover the exchange risk, arrange for the funds to be on-lent by the Associated Banks with a modest handling charge, the lending rate to be kept at or below 11 per cent. </P>
    <P>This motion presents me with the opportunity this evening to bring to the floor of Dáil Éireann the many and varied problems besetting agriculture and to propose certain measures that will be of immediate benefit to farmers.  I know of no other period during the past 15 years when there has been such a sudden, sharp deterioration in the fortunes of agriculture and all independent observers agree that the future is far from bright.</P>
    <P>The present difficulties in themselves would present major problems for the future prospects of thousands of small farmers who are currently struggling on deplorably low incomes.  However, the implications for agriculture of the present round of GATT negotiations are frightening to say the least.  The signs are ominous. Previous rounds of GATT negotiations centred largely on the liberalisation of industrial world trade with very little impact on agriculture.  Many decisions on world trade liberalisation policies have greatly affected agriculture in recent years but it is also true to say while their overall effect applied to what <Col N="2459" /> one might call the peripheral areas which resulted in great pressure being brought to bear on some sectors of the industry, notably the cereals sector, they did not greatly affect incomes overall.  I think everybody in the House will acknowledge this.</P>
    <P>In relation to the present GATT negotiations, there is no doubt we will be in serious trouble if the Americans get their way.  If the United States proposals to phase out all subsidies for Irish and European agriculture succeed, not alone will the goalposts have been switched since the time we joined the EC but the match will be played on an ice rink.  If Irish and European farmers have to accept world prices, as suggested by the United States, then a gallon of milk will be worth no more than 60p, beef cattle about 55p per pound while lambs will be worth about £20 less than they are now.  If anyone doubts this horrendous scenario, all they need to do is look at the position of New Zealand lamb in world markets at present.  Frozen lamb from this far distant country can appear on Irish supermarket shelves at prices 20 per cent below those being charged for fresh Irish lamb.</P>
    <P>For farmers and rural communities the outcome of the present round of GATT talks is of paramount importance.  The people in general and farmers in particular saw great opportunities in an expanded European Community and voted accordingly in the early seventies. The provisions of the Treaty of Rome gave new hope to a food exporting nation like Ireland and presented opportunities to export food to a market of over 250 million people in Europe.</P>
    <P>Under the Common Agricultural Policy farmers were guaranteed that they would secure a reasonable income from their labours while, at the same time, consumers could expect top quality food even at times of great scarcity at reasonable cost.  Border taxes were gradually dismantled and farmers began to compete in the real sense of the word in the marketplace.  No one will deny that costly mistakes were made.  Because prices <Col N="2460" /> were guaranteed farmers began to produce food of a kind that consumers did not want.  Meat processors, given the availability of intervention, found it easier and much more profitable to dump up to 100 per cent of their throughput into this safety net system, putting little effort into marketing.</P>
    <P>Nor could anyone claim that the benefits of such a price regime were evenly spread.  The number of small farmers throughout the European Community declined at an alarming rate.  What the critics of the Common Agricultural Policy do not realise is that because of the uncertain nature of farming, depending as it does on many factors outside the control of man, there must be some safety net to protect producers.  Of course farm produce must be consumer-orientated and market led at all times but provision must also be made to protect the livelihoods of as many farmers as possible.</P>
    <P>Let the consumer also be wary of the perceived panacea that world market prices may bring.  They would want to be very careful.  Consumers always say that what they are looking for is cheap food but natural disasters, such as diseases, have and will continue to dictate the volume of produce.  It is important that emergency provisions be made to ensure that there will be no food shortages. It is important that there is a system in place to enable us to secure supplies of food in the event of an emergency and to ensure at a time of shortage that consumer prices will not go out of hand.</P>
    <P>I have always accepted that the Common Agricultural Policy must be tightened.  We have been treated to some austere measures to curb unwanted produce during the past five or six years. However, the principle of the Common Agricultural Policy which is enshrined in the Treaty of Rome must be retained. The undoubted industrial muscle of the United States cannot be underestimated but surely two million American farmers should not be allowed to dictate the future for nine million European farmers. In essence, the United States proposals to GATT represent an attempt to merge two entirely different and incompatible <Col N="2461" /> farming systems.  I believe such a marriage would not be successful and such a system would not work for us, the more vulnerable partner.</P>
    <P>Millions of European farmers voted in favour of the principle of the common agricultural policy as contained in the Treaty of Rome.  I see little evidence of farmers, not alone in Ireland but all over Europe, wanting this to be replaced by the treaty of Washington.  Because of our small size, Ireland would stand little chance of influencing the ultimate outcome. However, in the EC there are powerful countries who could put real pressure on the USA and on the CAIRNS group of countries which seem to favour the world low price regime.  Can we be sure here that there is a firm resolve on the part of all the EC member states to oppose the US?  Recent changes in the European bloc countries, and in particular East Germany, may well mean a major shift in financing arrangements of the EC budget.  As the House is aware, Ireland are net gainers with West Germany, the main losers as far as the EC agricultural budget is concerned.  Some experts predict that West Germany may not be too unhappy about the prospect of lower agricultural product prices.  The President of COPA who was in the gallery last week also referred to this matter when he was in Dublin and I sincerely hope that the cohesion we hear so much about in the European Parliament will be maintained because if the Germans decide on any line of action other than the one we hope all countries in the system are on then obviously we will be in great peril here.</P>
    <P>Several bad periods spanning a number of decades are etched into the minds of farmers.  Older farmers still shudder when they remember the effects of the economic war in the thirties.  The forties and fifties were generally depressed. In recent times what farmer will forget the disaster that was 1974 when cattle and sheep could hardly be sold?  If the US get their way the decade of the nineties will overshadow anything that has gone before.</P>
    <P>Why can we in this Chamber here not <Col N="2462" /> debate the problems associated with Irish agriculture and the GATT negotiations? I have asked for such a debate on no fewer than four occasions and, for whatever reason, the Taoiseach and the Cabinet decided to say no.  I would have thought that no other topic would have been as important in this decade.  We should have a one or two day debate in this House and we cannot get it.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the domestic scene which is very depressing.  I am sorry to have to say in the House that the Minister for Agriculture is obviously out of touch with reality as is the Minister for Finance. I will come to him in a moment.  The Minister for Agriculture announced, with what I can only describe as a fanfare, his achievement at the price-fixing talks in Brussels.  Depending on what humour he was in on the particular day it was either £60 million, £70 million or £80 million he had secured and this was taken up and reported by the press.  What became of those so called benefits in the following two or three weeks?  Let me tell the House what became of them.  Anybody attending a mart anywhere in Ireland in the last few weeks or who was unlucky enough to have to sell cattle or sheep at our factories would certainly have an answer for the Minister for Agriculture. Since that day prices have nosedived all around.</P>
    <P>The decision to get intervention beef paid for at 45 days instead of 120 days is something I have been calling for under the Fine Gael plan for the last three or four months.  We did not get it to 30 days but we got it to 45 days.  We were told that would mean a 3p per pound automatic increase at the factories but not alone did producers not get the 3p prices were 8p on average less this very morning than they were on that day when the Minister came home with the goodies.  Two days ago Ireland looked for intervention facilities for about 8,000 tonnes of beef and my understanding is that we got intervention for 2,000 tonnes, one-quarter of what we looked for.  I believe the factories are working in concert with each other because all the quotas this morning from the ones that were actually quoting were <Col N="2463" /> remarkably similar.  I would regard this week as the blackest in 1990 for beef producers.  I am also informed that in the next two or three weeks the EC Council of Ministers are about to allow the importation into their territory of 198,000 young cattle and about 50,000 tonnes of beef for processing at a time when we cannot sell ours.  I hear not a single word from the Minister for Agriculture and Food against that.  I know of several farmers this week who have beef cattle to sell and cannot get rid of them. Against that background, where are the magnificent results the Minister claimed he has achieved?</P>
    <P>The present scare about mad cow disease illustrates the Government's shortsighted approach to marketing.  What an opportunity it would be for Ireland now if we had a branded product in Britain where we have been used to selling and where there is no language barrier whatever. Taken in that context we can see just how shortsighted was the Government's decision to halve funding for CBF two years ago.  The Government's record on the entire beef processing industry is pathetic.  There are no fast lanes opening up, despite what the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Walsh said when he launched the abortive Goodman package a couple of years ago.  There is a rumour that Commissioner MacSharry wants beef prices to continue to fall.  Maybe this is to ensure that there will not be a huge difference in price between the EC and the US at the end of the year when the GATT negotiations are scheduled for completion.</P>
    <P>The milk price is rapidly falling and at Question Time last week the Minister was absolutely at sea in the midst of it all. The assertion by the Minister for Finance here last week that some 60 acre dairy farmers earn incomes of between £40,000 and £50,000 annually would be laughable except that if this view were shared by his colleagues farmers could expect very little help.  I have about 60 acres of land If I thought I could earn £50,000 on it I would not be here.  I do not know where the Minister got details of any 60 <Col N="2464" /> acre farmer who earned £50,000.  It may have been an off the cuff remark but in my view it was a silly rumour to put around.</P>
    <P>Minister Reynolds has little good to say for farmers as far as taxation is concerned. He dismissed out of hand any suggestion that farmers should be allowed the special PAYE allowance enjoyed by PAYE workers.  Indeed he implied that farmers had means available to them to claim for expenses that other taxpayers' had not.  I resent that.  Generally speaking the Minister was quite hostile to the farming community on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The negative approach by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the problems of Irish farmers can be summed up in his answer to a Dáil question here last week when the beef crisis was being discussed. His only contribution on that occasion was to say that cattle prices were no worse than they were in 1987.  Input costs such as fertiliser and machinery increased dramatically not to mention the cost of borrowed money.  It appears that the Minister has more or less accepted there is nothing he can do for Irish agriculture. If this inferiority complex is seen in the same light in the EC as it is seen here in Ireland, we are in big trouble.</P>
    <P>The Minister was equally evasive on the funding of the disease eradication scheme.  The board of ERAD have stated publicly that this round of testing will identify a much greater number of reactors. Obviously there will have to be a supplementary budget for animal disease eradication, as the 1990 estimated provision of £35 million approximately will not cover the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I hear rumours &mdash; I admit they are rumours, but rumours are usually right &mdash; that the Government may expect farmers to increase their disease levies from the present £6.90 per animal to about £10 and for milk producers from 1.2p per gallon to 1.7p per gallon.  Given the general dissatisfaction with the entire TB and brucellosis scheme and with the major decrease in farm incomes I see this proposal sinking like a lead balloon. <Col N="2465" /> There will be a great deal of trouble if this proposal is floated.</P>
    <P>There are many and varied ways, even in the present difficult environment that farmers can be helped and without any great cost factor.  Last January Fine Gael launched a ten point plan which if implemented quickly would bring great relief to thousands of farmers both large and small.  I will list the points so that they are on the record.  In order to overcome the seasonality factor for winter beef producers and thus ensure that there will be an even distribution of animals going for slaughter throughout the year, farmers who fatten cattle should know at the time they are purchasing them that there is a minimum price level below which they will not go at the early part of the year.  That is most important.  The suggestion by some commentators that this would help only the big farmers could not be further from the truth, because the store producers, whom I know more about than I do beef producers, suffer if the beef producers are not in the market at the back end of any year.  It will benefit everybody to get this right.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, we call for the reduction in the payment period from 120 days to 30 days.  I can say that the Minister has worked on this and it has now been reduced to 45 days.  I genuinely believe that the meat processors are pocketing the money in the interim.  It is time the boot was put into them for not passing this on to the producer.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Government seriously consider supplying farmers with loans at low interest rates for very specific purposes under certain conditions.  I was around during 1981-82 when the concept of a Euro loan was introduced but I am now talking about a different type of regime.  It is now possible for me as an individual, as it is for everybody else here, to borrow in Deutsche Marks at nine per cent per annum.  Naturally the associated banks would have a handling charge, which is normal enough, but I would not be prepared to give them the level of handling charge that they would like.  It should be possible to arrange to borrow money for <Col N="2466" /> certain productive purposes at an interest rate of around 11 per cent at no cost to the Exchequer.  All the Government would have to do is underwrite the exchange rates.  I fully understand that the risk of exchange rate fluctuations is very great when the loan extends over five or six years but short-term loans of six to 12 months should not encounter this difficulty.  This period would tie up with the normal cycle for cereal, beef, and pig producers.  The benefit would not be confined to big farmers.  I know of many small farmers who would be much better off if they could borrow for this purpose at a rate of 11 per cent rather than at the rate of 15 or 16 per cent which they have to pay at present.  I am asking the Minister to consider that suggestion immediately.</P>
    <P>The EC headage scheme should be used in a different way.  At present we hear a great deal of talk about extensions. I cannot comment on them because I do not know the degree of the extensions, but any extension is welcome.  However, there will be thousands of farmers all over Ireland in the non-designated areas who will not be able to avail of any headage payments.  The vehicle is there.  I see no reason farmers are not pinpointed on a farm basis.  I envisage no problems in doing this.</P>
    <P>Capital acquisition tax is stalking the land at present.  Many farm fathers and mothers are afraid to think about farm inheritance.  The proposal in the budget was totally inadequate.  Obviously, the thresholds will have to be increased to take account of property values since 1978.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have asked the simple question in this age of computerisation: why can a farmer not get his lifestock grant on the day that it is due?  Why do people have to wait for three, four, six or eight months for a payment that is rightfully theirs?  It is nothing short of scandalous that there are farmers waiting for various grants for six, seven or eight months just because something went wrong somewhere along the line.  We need to effect change in this area immediately.  The costings for farm <Col N="2467" /> buildings should be changed immediately. I had understood that the Minister was about to announce this a few months ago but he seems to have gone cold because obviously he was not able to push it through in Cabinet.  If this was to be announced, it should have been done a couple of months ago.</P>
    <P>Small milk producers countrywide should get an additional milk quota.  I will speak at greater length on this point on another occasion.  We also believe that Teagasc should be given the leading role in integrated rural development programmes. It is vitally important that Teagasc have a say.</P>
    <P>Finally we must have a land authority. I have spoken at length over the past five to ten years on this topic.  We are further away from it now than we ever were.  The Minister of State does not seem to be making any noises about a land authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>At least I set up the principle of the authority but the Minister does not appear to have run with the idea at all.  I know that it is a hot potato from which the Minister has backed off.  This is a pity because the authority is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other points that I wish to refer to before my time runs out. Cereal producers are under threat.  I had occasion to meet ten or 12 of the biggest and best farmers on a deputation a couple of months ago.  They convinced me that, despite the fact that the asset value of their farms would be in the region of £250,000 to £500,000, they have lost money for three years on the trot.  I have not the slightest doubt but that many of them will go out of business entirely if a new regime is not put in place.  I put the idea of a supply management system to the Minister last week during Question Time &mdash; he seemed to agree with it &mdash; but I have never heard him talk about it where it counts most, in Brussels.  In <Col N="2468" /> other areas where the EC have tried to regulate the market, they have failed for the reason that there will be over-production in the more favourable cereal growing areas of Europe.  For that reason I can see no hope for Irish grain producers unless we introduce the management supply concept.  I am asking the Minister to take that on board.</P>
    <P>If this motion does not achieve anything else it can serve to highlight what the Government could do.  I fully accept that there are matters that are outside the control of the Government and the Minister, but most of the points I have raised tonight are internal matters which could alleviate some of the problems.  I do not understand how any Minister could get himself hyped up to say to Irish farmers that they are now £70 million better off when in fact they are experiencing a nose dive.  I do not agree with this negative stance that farmers would be £70 million worse off if the Minister had not achieved this.  That is a negative way of looking at the problem.  It is time we were more honest about these matters.  I accept there are things that the Minister cannot help.  No matter who is sitting in that chair he will have trouble but it appears that the Department have been on autopilot for the past 12 months. I have seen no really new initiative that would lead me to believe that the Minister understands what is happening.  I do not like to be too critical because we have to accept there are certain things which the Minister can do and cannot do.</P>
    <P>It is one thing for an Opposition to come in here and criticise but it is another matter to come in and signal where the agricultural industry should go. I do not pretend to have all the answers &mdash; I am sure I do not have &mdash; but if the ten points I have mentioned were at least tried out in the next year, particularly in the next six months, people would be better off and the agricultural community could begin to breathe again.</P>
    <P>Above all else we should take the GATT negotiations seriously.  Until recently people regarded this matter as a big yawn but it will come back to haunt us.  It is incumbent on Fianna Fáil, Fine <Col N="2469" /> Gael, Labour and everybody else to bring the facts home to the people.  This is the greatest problem that has confronted us for many a long day.  I sincerely hope that the Government will do much more to educate the people of the enormous implications involved.  We in Dáil Éireann should give a good example.  It is very difficult to organise information sessions all over the country if we cannot initiate one on the floor of Dáil Éireann. I would ask the Minister to let us have a one or two day debate on this matter. Certainly from the Government's point of view there can be no embarrassment because every Government has been faced with this problem.  Every Deputy should come in here and say what is on their minds.  There are only four or five weeks left in this session and I hope the Minister will take my suggestion on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, for sharing his time with me.  I support his motion.  The crisis in Irish agriculture today is one of the major problems facing our economy.  The whole fabric of rural life is threatened, the future of thousands of Irish farmers is at risk and the hope of many family farm units is dashed.  Irish agriculture is at a cross roads and its future can be protected only, first, by recognising that the crisis actually exists &mdash; and we hope to convince the Government of that in this debate &mdash; and second, having recognised the crisis, by ensuring that immediate measures are taken to rescue the declining income of thousands of farmers.  Another problem is that the percentage of the CAP allocated to dairying has fallen from 30 to 16 per cent.  The crisis is all the greater in that all types of farm enterprises are affected and this can be proved by a very simple comparison. Milk prices are down by 15p to 17p per gallon since last year; lamb prices are down by almost £25 per head since last year; calf prices are down by almost £100 per head since last year, and cereal prices are falling by almost 3 per cent every year.  Thus every farmer, whatever his <Col N="2470" /> enterprise and/or size, is experiencing a severe decline in income.</P>
      <P>In the last few weeks sheep farmers have faced an unprecedented income crisis.  That crisis is even more difficult to comprehend when, at a time when Irish lamb has reached its lowest level in the past ten years, we continue to import New Zealand lamb.  Since spring 1987, prices have declined by almost 30 per cent in Ireland and yet in other EC countries the price of lamb has either declined marginally or has actually increased.  Compared to this time last year the sheep farmer is receiving about 45p per pound less for his product.  The failure of our sheep enterprise is a severe blow to many young farmers starting out on a career in agriculture.  For them, sheep farming was an attractive enterprise when they were prevented from going into dairying because of the quota system.  There is room for expansion in sheep farming.  There is capacity for good production and capital input is manageable. The real problem is that today, in comparison with a few years ago, we export up to 75 per cent of our sheep production.  This problem must be tackled by identifying the causes.  One reason is the price paid for imported New Zealand lamb.  The second cause is poor marketing in an effort to get the best price for our lamb on the French market. These two areas must be investigated immediately because Irish sheep farmers have a future here if corrective steps are taken.</P>
      <P>Farmers in the dairying sector, having experienced two or three profitable seasons, are now facing a severe drop in their incomes.  The reduction of 15p per gallon of milk means a drop of £90 per week in the gross income of a 30 cow herd owner.  Why has there been a decline of 17 per cent in milk prices in Ireland while in Holland there has been a decline of only 9 per cent and in Denmark, only 3 per cent?  We export 47 per cent of our dairy products, mainly butter and skim milk powder, outside the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1988 the butter export refund has been reduced by £257 per tonne while skim milk powder refund has been <Col N="2471" /> reduced by £485 per tonne.  The effect of all of these factors has been a very weak dairying sector.  Along with the declining milk prices, dairy farmers are faced with an alarming increase in the cost of inputs and interest rates were never higher, all of which contribute to a massive attack on the income of the dairy farmers. The future is even bleaker for our farmers because, when Europe expands, we will be faced with a major threat to the price support system and its effectiveness will further diminish.  Our future lies in changing from a product that is dependent on support to a market-orientated product and the sooner that change is brought about the better.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Connaughton said, the income of cereal farmers is another major concern.  That has continued to fall since the mid-eighties, leaving up to 30,000 grain growers trying to survive on alarmingly declining incomes.  The major cause has been the use of stabilisers, leaving no incentive and no reward for increased production.  The effects of the use of stabilisers in cereal production must be reviewed immediately, particularly for the benefit of the Irish cereal grower.  We must accept that the cereal policy has been disastrous for the Irish cereal grower and has been totally unfair. Another problem is the import of 18 million tonnes of substitutes taking the place of our cereal production at home.  This is a ridiculous policy while there is overproduction at home.</P>
    <P>As I have said, all sectors of our agricultural industry are affected by declining incomes.  The beef crisis, caused by a variety of factors is of major concern. Beef prices within the EC have held firm in the past 12 months.  For example, prices increased by 5 per cent and 4 per cent respectively in the United Kingdom and France from November 1988 to November 1989 whereas in Ireland they dropped by 10 per cent.  The overall supply and demand for beef within the EC is favourable.  Self-sufficiency in beef in 1989 was 97.8 per cent.  We must ask: what is the problem in our beef industry. <Col N="2472" /> Is it seasonality of supply, poor marketing, poor quality cattle or just simply a lack of effective competition between meat factories at home and no live exports to provide competition abroad?</P>
    <P>If I had the time I would like to put forward what I consider to be solutions to the crisis in the beef industry.  Much of the problem is caused by the total reliance of the beef farmer on the dairy farmer for calves.  The low percentage of dairy farmers involved in suckling highlights the continued dependence of the cattle farmer on the dairy farmer for his supplies. This has caused calf prices to increase since 1982 by almost £160.  Yet, during the same period beef prices have remained almost static.  The net result of this is a total decline in the profitability of beef.</P>
    <P>The problems in Irish agriculture are not recent.  They have been with us for the past few years.  The solutions are long-term and the quicker we provide a strategy on a long-term basis for the future of Irish agriculture the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Leonard and to allow him about ten minutes.  I propose to deal with the points raised by Deputies and to show that this Government have been extremely positive in dealing with agriculture despite the negative statements from Deputies Connaughton and Ahearn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The GATT negotiations are aimed at liberalising trade in agriculture by reducing support and protection.  The Common Agricultural Policy is the mechanism for supporting and protecting Irish and Community farming and underpins the prosperity of agriculture throughout the EC. This support continues to be necessary because Community agriculture is structurally weak and extremely diverse by comparison with our major competitors. For example, there are about ten million people employed in this sector in the Community and the average farm size is about nine hectares, whereas, in the US <Col N="2473" /> there are about two million farmers and the average farm size is 184 hectares.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, Community agriculture cannot be left entirely to market forces and will continue to require support and protection measures in the foreseeable future.  Because we are committed to developing the value of our agricultural production and ensuring that farm incomes are kept at a reasonable level we can support the Community's policies in relation to agriculture in the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Community's proposals are comprehensive, realistic and consistent with the aims of the negotiations.  They are also in line with the reform measures which have been taking place within Community agricultural policy over the past number of years.  In the GATT negotiations we must ensure that the Community gets tangible credit for these reforms.  The main issues in the agriculture negotiations were discussed at the Council at the end of April and the Community's position was strongly re-emphasised. These issues were also discussed at an informal meeting of European Agriculture Ministers and senior civil servants at Innsbruck earlier this month.  These were not all Community representatives but most of the EFTA countries were represented, as was Poland.  The communique issued after that meeting was useful in that it showed that the EC has considerable support for its position on agriculture in GATT.</P>
    <P>In the communique Ministers agreed that agriculture could not be discussed exclusively on the basis of commercial considerations.  It was also agreed that credit should be given for reform measures taken since the beginning of the Round and that some countries would need balanced external protection and the maintenance of dual price to re-establish balanced markets.  These are all issues of importance to the Community on which we obviously have the support of other European countries.  We will continue to press, within the Community, for maintenance of the present line and I have no doubt we will succeed in that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton in his opening <Col N="2474" /> contribution made reference to the fact that if Americans get their way Irish prices will drop to world levels and disaster will strike.  I am afraid Deputy Connaughton is surrendering before negotiations have even begun as regards agriculture in the GATT Round.  His contribution will give heart to the United States and other interests opposed to the EC and the Common Agricultural Policy. Defence of the Common Agricultural Policy is the firm determination of the Ministers of the Twelve Community countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past three years farmers have benefited from strong and steady income increases bringing total farm income in real terms to the high point of the decade in 1989.  Up to the present the farm sector, as a whole, has enjoyed some very good years, a point underlined by the household budget <Col N="2475" /> survey which showed that farm households have had, on average, a higher level of disposable income than either urban households or rural non-farming households.</P>
      <P>Over many years we have seen cyclical trends in farm incomes where economic forces operated to bring about income increases during a period of several years which would be followed by a period of slowdown in growth.  There are some indications that we are currently at the high point of a period of income increase but that is not to say that farmers are facing serious difficulty, nor yet indeed a crisis.</P>
      <P>The recent reduction in the price of cattle and sheep took place against a background of record price achievement in 1989 while a reduction in cereals prices reflected world market trends.  However, during this year volume increases in cattle, sheep and cereals should largely offset the effect of these price reductions. Furthermore, we have sought to ensure in Community negotiations that the basic supports necessary to underpin a successful agricultural sector are secured. The recently agreed prices package will make an important contribution.  For beef, intervention prices should improve. There is a commitment from the Commission for better support for internal market prices and improved export marketing opportunities.  In the case of the cereals sector the various elements of the prices package should more than offset the constraining effects of the stabiliser mechanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The outlook for farming is very hopeful.  The record achievements of the past few years may not be reached but, in the face of some downturn in prices, support mechanisms and volume increases will ensure that very reasonable income levels will be sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the current difficulties being encountered by Irish lamb producers due to a fall in market prices but <Col N="2476" /> I am glad to note some recovery has occurred in the last week.  The drop in meat prices is due to a number of factors including the advantage to British lamb exports to the French market caused by the drop in the value of sterling <i>vis-à vis</i> the French franc, the lower level of clawback on British lamb exports and increased slaughterings both here and in Britain.  Wool, skin and offal prices have also shown a drop in prices over the corresponding period last year due to the increase in supplies and difficulty in export market outlets to China.</P>
    <P>The 1990 ewe premium will however compensate producers for the loss in income sustained this year, for example, the difference between the basic price and the average market price adjusted to take account of the stabiliser and the technical kill out co-efficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The ewe premium for 1989 was fixed at £17.75 at the sheepmeat management committee on 4 May.  Payments of the 1989 premium will be made when inspections are completed in early June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated total value of the 1989 premium will exceed £80 million and this benefit to Irish producers should maintain confidence to the sector and assist farmers in dealing with the present difficulties.  In addition to the payment of the 1989 premium, two instalments, each representing 30 per cent of the estimated 1990 premium, will be paid later this year.  Total ewe premium payments this year should exceed £130 million.  In addition, headage payments will amount to approximately £14 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention that, as part of the EC prices package which we recently negotiated, an additional premium of £3.40 per ewe will be paid from 1991 onwards for all eligible ewes to beneficiaries in disadvantaged areas.  This <Col N="2477" /> would amount to an additional £9 million to sheep farmers in a full year.</P>
    <P>The common organisation of the market for sheepmeat sector provides for private storage aid arrangements.  Monthly tenders have been in operation since the beginning of this year for those regions of the Community where prices fall below the 70 per cent benchmark level.  The private storage arrangements should provide an important safety measure for the sector.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, CBF's export market development and promotion programme in 1990 will continue to be concentrated on moving more of our lamb sales into higher priced outlets. Promotional campaigns will continue to emphasise the grass-based method of production and the improvements in quality which have taken place since the introduction of the code of practice. A campaign to promote lamb on the home market was launched recently.  This campaign highlights lamb as a natural product which is now of particularly good value.</P>
    <P>Under GATT arrangements third country suppliers of sheepmeat have free access to the Community market subject to a 20 per cent duty.  On the setting up of the market organisation on sheepmeat in 1980 the Community negotiated agreements with all the main suppliers, including New Zealand, under which they agreed to limit their supplies in return for a reduction in the duty to 10 per cent.  The agreement concluded on 25 September 1989 between the Community and New Zealand was a renegotiation of that agreement and was the culmination of protracted negotiations which has an impact on other commodities and has implications under GATT arrangements. During these negotiations we were successful in ensuring maximum protection for the Irish producer while at the same time respecting our international obligations.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Voluntary Restraint Agreement with New Zealand, Ireland and France have been designated sensitive zones whereby quantitative <Col N="2478" /> restrictions apply.  Under these arrangements New Zealand may issue Voluntary Restraint Agreement export certificates up to a maximum of 450 tonnes in 1989 and 540 tonnes in 1990.  However, in 1989 the total volume of New Zealand imports into Ireland amounted to only 30 tonnes and to date, export certificates for 1990 amount to 86 tonnes.  As Ireland's production of sheepmeat in 1989 exceeded 58,000 tonnes, the limited quantity of imports from New Zealand did not affect price levels here.</P>
    <P>In the overall Community context, New Zealand agreed to reduce its annual quota by 40,500 tonnes to 205,000 tonnes and, within that quantity, for the first time accepted a ceiling on fresh meat exports. In return, the Community agreed to reduce the import levy from 10 per cent to zero.</P>
    <P>As far as the dairy sector is concerned, prices for the main commodity products in the sector have declined since late autumn 1989 and they are now at or below intervention levels.  However, this downturn in market conditions follows a prolonged period of market buoyancy throughout 1988 and most of 1989 when the Irish dairy industry, in particular, enjoyed exceptional market conditions. Irish dairy exports reached record levels during that period and producer prices increased, on average, by well over 20p per gallon.  This market buoyancy, coupled with an extensive Community programme of stock disposal, enabled the Community's stocks of butter and skim milk powder to be virtually eliminated.</P>
    <P>The decline in the market necessitated the reintroduction of intervention purchasing of butter by tender in January 1990.  Since then about 88,000 tonnes have been taken off the Community market.  Under the rules governing the intervention purchasing of skim milk powder, the purchasing period did not commence until 1 April and so far about 51,000 tonnes of skim milk powder have been taken off the Community market. However, this level of purchases must be put into its proper context &mdash; as recently as January 1987 Community stocks of <Col N="2479" /> butter and skim milk powder stood at 1,252,000 tonnes and 770,000 tonnes, respectively.  The elimination of these large stocks overhanging the market means that the market is now in a more healthy position and, therefore, more responsive to improvements, at Community level, in market management measures.</P>
    <P>As soon as the decline in market conditions became evident, we approached the Commission seeking readjustment to several of the aids and disposal schemes. applicable in the dairy sector.  The Commission has since acceded to a number of our requests including, in particular, increasing export refund levels for a number of dairy products, restoring the maximum storage period under the scheme for private storage of butter to 210 days and introducing a new scheme to aid the disposal of butter for use as concentrated butter for cooking.  The Community has also aided the export of butter to Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that action of this type has helped to offset the effect of the market downturn.  I am of the view, however, that further action needs to be taken to strengthen the Community's internal disposal measures and we have recently again requested the Commission to readjust the conditions under a number of its aid schemes.  In this context, the Commission's commitment in the recent farm price negotiations to maximise the disposal opportunities for butter and skim milk powder and minimise sales to intervention must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The successful outcome of the farm price negotiations, including the green pound devaluation and shortening of the intervention payment delays of course, will also help to firm up the market. Commodity prices for the main dairy products have already increased as a direct result of these measures.</P>
    <P>Our traditional dependence on commodity products, however, means that we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in market returns for these products.  We have stated on a number <Col N="2480" /> of occasions that, in the longer term, the protection of dairy farm incomes will depend on the extent to which the industry succeeds in developing a more diversified product mix and on more effective promotion and marketing of the unique attributes of dairy products.</P>
    <P>Government action in other agricultural sectors is continuing to underpin farm incomes.  On the horticulture side I would like to mention the passing by the Oireachtas of the Bill which set up An Bord Glas as a statutory body.  We will be announcing the membership of the new board very shortly.  That board will then take over from the interim Bord Glas which has done an excellent job over the past three years.</P>
    <P>The chief task of the new board will be to put into operation the excellent development plans for horticulture published by the interim board.  That development plan foresaw that over a five year period the industry would be brought to a stage where imports would be replaced by home products to the tune of £31 million a year.  As well as that there would be an increase in the value of horticultural exports of £27 million a year.  The achievement of those targets would result in the horticulture industry providing an additional 1,800 full-time and 1,500 part-time jobs.  I am very glad to be able to tell the House that there is every reason to believe that these figures for employment will be exceeded.  In 1989 alone a total of 700 new jobs were created in horticulture; of these 40 per cent were full-time and the remainder part-time.</P>
    <P>As was set out very clearly in the development plans which I have already mentioned, the greatest problem facing Irish horticulture in general is that of marketing.  Producers must keep quality and presentation in mind.  Good marketing means that individual producers will set about producing crops only when they have a very good idea of where, to whom and when their produce will be sold.  Producers must constantly have in mind the needs of the final consumer. This means, above all, attention to quality and the determination to see to it that only very good quality, very well <Col N="2481" /> presented products are put on the market.  In modern conditions there is far more to good marketing then the work of the individual producer, important and all though he or she is.  Producers must learn to work in groups.  This is a gospel which I have been preaching for some years now, as have the interim Bord Glas. I make no apology for saying it again because I am quite confident that if the principles of good marketing were put into operation by Irish horticulture producers the forecast for the industry in the development plans would be well exceeded.</P>
    <P>We must remember that up to 60 per cent of all our consumption of fruit and vegetables is marketed through the main supermarket chains.  Producers must be able to match these outlets with their marketing arrangements.  Where producers are not yet at a stage where they feel that they can set up a producer group, they should, if at all possible, work very closely with wholesalers.  Everybody in the production and distribution chain has much to gain through co-operation with others in the business.  This can only lead to better profit for all those involved and a better situation for the whole economy.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to mention the new unit for the development of organic farming which has been set up in the Department of Agriculture and Food. This unit will have the task of developing all aspects of organic farming.  This is an area which must not be neglected.  We are living in times when the importance of the environment is becoming more and more a factor in the attitudes and decisions of people.  Traditional farming and horticulture, as we know them, will continue to be for a long time to come the main suppliers of food.  However, people are becoming more sensitive about the use of chemicals and fertilisers. We must maintain a balanced view on these matters but we must recognise that there is a growing interest in organic production.  This country is in a particularly advantageous position to benefit from this growing interest.  It could become an important element not <Col N="2482" /> only in home trade but also on export markets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of everybody being out of step with our Johnny. The most relevant point was made by Deputy Ahearn when she said that the problems were not recent.  Certainly there are long-standing problems in agriculture. Problems will arise from time to time due to such factors as weather conditions, demand and supply.  We have to face this in a positive way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton mentioned beef, milk and lamb but there is an answer on each of those points.  Beef production is a matter of efficiency.  A positive improvement was made by the Minister in July 1988 when he secured the pollution grants.  Undoubtedly some of our biggest losses were incurred because 50 per cent of cattle were wintering out, while the rest were kept in slatted houses. I attended a meeting where a person said that seven applications for slatted houses had been made in one townland.  Never before was there such a flood of applications. This must be compared with the position in the early eighties when all grant aid was completely abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2483" /> There is much criticism of slaughtering plants.  They seem to cash in when there is any downturn in prices.  It is time the farmers formed producer groups.  They cannot expect the State or anyone else to deal with this matter for them.</P>
    <P>My county is the premier producer of poultry.  We produce eggs, broilers and turkeys.  People there set up their own efficient structure and it did not cost the State a penny.  The only cost to the State was for the creation of jobs in processing plants.  A massive number of jobs were created for a reasonably small IDA and FEOGA investment.  The ball is at the foot of the producers and if they could do for beef what farmers in Monaghan have done for poultry they could regulate the market very nicely.</P>
    <P>When we entered the EC our full concentration was on securing increases.  A couple of pence on the gallon was an achievement.  We should have been concentrating on more efficient production, improving the presentation of our products and marketing.  The co-operatives were committing the same kind of error by dumping their produce into intervention instead of seeking new markets. During a by-election campaign in Tipperary I could not get cheese in a certain hotel, although it was the best milk producing area.  At the time the co-operatives in the county were loading 56 pound boxes of butter into cold storage and drawing their cheques.  Following our EC entry we moved quickly from a supply and demand market to an intervention system, under which massive amounts had to be paid for storage facilities.  Intervention killed initiative.  Co-operatives and others who did not use these facilities should have been recognised and given a bonus.</P>
    <P>It has been said that nothing is happening in agriculture.  Let us examine developments in the past few years.  I have already mentioned the excellent anti pollution grant scheme.  There is also a suckling grant for small milk producers who have to dispose of cows.  Grant aid was given by the Minister.  The cattle <Col N="2484" /> headage grant has been payable since last January irrespective of means.  I believe there will be a real upturn in cattle numbers within two years.  The annual payment of £47 for 20 years for forestry will give a great boost to that industry.  The amount payable is the equivalent to the income gained from grazing livestock on the land.</P>
    <P>I spoke many times about the monopoly operated by the Dublin District Milk Board.  They could send milk to every town and village throughout the country but a provincial co-operative could not send a gallon of milk to Dublin. This was the position for years but the system was changed shortly after Fianna Fáil's return to office in 1987.</P>
    <P>No area has shown greater success than horticulture, with great developments in fruit, vegetables and potatoes.  Unnecessary imports will be greatly curbed in coming years as a result of the Minister's plans.</P>
    <P>There is a supposed crisis in regard to lambs but there has been a very big increase in sheep numbers.  This has had an effect on prices.  The continued weakness of sterling has provided cheaper lamb for the French market from the United Kingdom.  This has had an effect on our prices.  The ewe premium, increased for the disadvantaged areas as a result of Commissioner MacSharry's proposals, makes up for the loss of income.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the mushroom industry. I was a bit concerned by the Fine Gael Deputies who were in great voice about the drop in sales and the loss to the producer due to the weakness of sterling. However, no reference was made to this point in the motion before us tonight. The depreciation in the value of sterling has had a serious effect on the incomes of people involved in the mushroom industry.  What action could the Government have taken to put this matter right? The Minister for Agriculture and Food, An Bord Glas and the Industrial Development Authority, together with mushroom producers and exporters, have been very active in considering the ways and means by which the mushroom <Col N="2485" /> industry can improve its position as a result of the depreciation in the value of sterling.  The answer they have come up with is that the solution lies in the hands of the producers and marketers.</P>
    <P>If a study was carried out we could see that the reduction in the value of sterling has meant a drop of about 6p per pound for mushrooms while at the same time producers who produce a higher quality produce can get up to 20p per pound more for their mushrooms.  Reference should have been made to this point in the motion before us in view of the concern expressed about it over the past few months.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>

      <P>and further aware that the present investment policies of financial institutions are unsuitable to the nature of agriculture investment and capital return, at the terms which reflect the long pay back period of farm investment calls on the Government to ensure that long-term credit facilities corresponding with the investment requirements of Irish agriculture are made available to farmers, and in particular to</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (a)  statutorily require financial institutions (banks, insurance and <Col N="2486" /> hire-purchase companies, investment houses, pension funds), to invest 10 per cent of their new annual investment portfolios in Agricultural Development Bonds</P>
    <P>(b)  ensure the moneys arising from the purchase of these bonds to be advanced as loans to farmers at fixed long-term (e.g. 15 and 20 years), low interest rate terms (e.g. 5 per cent p.a.) for commercial development of their enterprises</P>
    <P>(c)  ensure the interest accruing to the financial institutions from the bonds to be tax-free.  </P>
    <P>That such loans to be made available:</P>

    <P>&mdash;switching to import-substitution production in horticultural and tillage sectors</P>

      <Col N="2487" /> that these Agricultural Development Bonds and loans to be supervised by Teagasc and the Agricultural Credit Corporation as part of a long-term agricultural developmental plan designed to create jobs in the food production and processing sectors of the economy and to increase the number and incomes of family farmers participating in agriculture on a full-time basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was struck by the Minister's contribution in so far as he seemingly could not find any serious fault with the contribution made by the Fine Gael speaker. The similarity of the positions of the two main parties in the House is striking.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party amendment to the Fine Gael motion indicates our regard for the primacy of agriculture, the importance of farmers and their families and the importance of the workers and their families in the spin-off industries. Our amendment also recognises the malaise in the whole industry and the potential for wealth and job creation, a good clean environment and the development of our rural economy.</P>
    <P>Our amendment effectively rejects the band aid-type philosophy which is evident in the Fine Gael motion before us tonight.  This is a catch-all, meaningless motion with only one specific objective &mdash; selective assistance for ranchers and beef barons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not listening to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I was listening to the Deputy but I did not accept what he said. I did not interrupt the Deputy and I will seek the protection of the Chair if I have to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the Fine Gael motion unacceptable for that reason.  I am well aware of the type of people who finish off our beef and of how wealthy they are.  They live all around me in my constituency &mdash; I only have to look out of my window to see them &mdash; and I can assure the House that the Government do not need to assist <Col N="2488" /> them in any way at all.  Their incomes might be somewhat reduced but they are the one sector in farming who can well afford to bear a reduction in the massive incomes they have accrued over the years.  They only ever employed a man with a dog and a stick whom they put into a bad cottage and, when he was finished, and could not follow cattle any more, they threw him out on to the road.  I will not seek any support in this House for the beef barons and ranchers who live in the midlands.  I represent a midland constituency and know these people very well.</P>
    <P>Following prolonged and intensive study of our agriculture and its problems &mdash;I was happy to be involved in this study &mdash;and discussions and consultations with farmer organisations and unions, the Labour Party produced an agricultural policy document which has been widely welcomed by farmers and unions.  I believe we are the only party in modern Dáil Éireann to have produced such a document and put our cards on the table. Indeed, I would welcome such proposals from Fine Gael or the Government parties.</P>
    <P>What we found was a history of disastrous neglect over a long period of what should be our primary industry.  We found a series of <i>ad hoc</i> decision-making, a Band Aid crisis without any structure or clear policy position being held.  We found widespread rural poverty, a lack of transport, extremely bad roads &mdash; a Minister for potholes could be employed forever in improving our roads &mdash; a lack of health services where women and children simply cannot get to health services and frightening isolation of women and old people.  We also found a land structure which is a major obstacle to a modern agricultural sector where only 20 per cent of farms are categorised as modern, only 16 per cent of farmers are under the age of 35, up to 50 per cent of farm holdings in the west are fragmented, and 25 per cent of agricultural land is owned by only 5 per cent of farmers.  That is the type of land structure we found.</P>
    <P>The only response to this problem from the two conservative parties tonight and <Col N="2489" /> previously was when Fine Gael, in Government, nearly battered the Land Commission to death and the promise by the Taoiseach in the House &mdash; I heard him say this &mdash; to provide the burial details for the Land Commission.  I was delighted to hear the Fine Gael spokesperson say he is now in favour of a land agency.  This is good news.  We need a land agency to correct the situation we found.  The Government produced an excellent White Paper on this issue which was so radical that I was afraid to put it into our policy document because I thought the Labour Party would reject it as being too radical.  Obviously the Fianna Fáil Party rejected the White Paper at some stage because they now believe there should not be any land agency at all.  However, all they have put in its place is the cheque book so that the fellow with the biggest bank balance can buy the most land.  This will have the effect of again concentrating land in the hands of fewer and fewer people.  Failure to promote a land policy which puts land into the hands of young and expanding farmers, limits the land holding of larger farmers &mdash; all of which was proposed by Fianna Fáil and then jettisoned for some reason &mdash; and promotes a family farmer profile, has created considerable poverty and inefficiency in Irish farming.</P>
    <P>We also found farmers who were caught in a vicious economic trap.  The inevitable reduction of CAP subsidies &mdash; whether both sides of the House like it or not, it is inevitable &mdash; means that the farmers must produce more to maintain their present standard of living.  To produce more they must increase their use of petro-chemical fertilisers, pesticides, hormones and antibiotics.  They cost the farmer more while endangering the consumer, the farmer and the food worker.  The farmers make less by producing more dangerous food of which in many cases there is a massive surplus such as grain mountains and wine lakes even though there are many people hungry.</P>
    <P>Unbridled capitalist agriculture robs farmers of their land, the soil of its fertility and consumers of their health.  It is <Col N="2490" /> a frightening tale of chemical dependence by farmers, of health risks to consumers, of the destruction of the soil, water supplies and the environment, of risks to food processing workers and the elimination of family farms.  That is taking place in the name of profit for a handful of farmers, food processors and petro-chemical companies.</P>
    <P>We found in our study an incomes policy for farmers which is called the price support scheme, or the CAP.  That policy directed 80 per cent of subsidies from the EC to the top 20 per cent of farmers.  I submit they did not need any subsidy and that the subsidies went to the wrong people.  On several occasions the Minister agreed with me on that point but the Minister of State tonight expressed support for the system.  The CAP policy decimated the rural economy.  It reduced the number of people active on the land from 180,000 in 1970 to 90,000 full-time farmers in 1990.  Tens of thousands of farmers, and their families, have been forced into economic deportation by a prices policy that benefits only the already rich farmers, the large ranchers and the big farmers.  That policy has created not just poverty in rural areas but mountains of beef and grain and lakes of milk and wine, produce that many cannot afford to buy because of the artificially high prices set for them.  It must be remembered that that occurs because of the subsidies of the ordinary taxpayer.</P>
    <P>We have a scandal in my constituency where a colossal building is full of intervention beef and other produce.  In front of that building there is a council housing estate that has 80 per cent unemployment. Those people receive beef from those sheds once each year on a give-away basis through the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  Is somebody serious in suggesting that such a policy is good for farmers, for consumers, for workers or for anybody?  The original concept of the Common Agricultural Policy was excellent but it has run out of control and created the greatest scandal in this century, excluding the holocaust. It is scandalous that we should produce mountains of food and permit people to <Col N="2491" /> starve.  It is scandalous that we should produce grain for cattle when they, in turn, will be turned into beef mountains. The CAP gave rise to that great scandal. It was all for the sake of enriching the already rich sector of farming, often to the neglect of agriculture as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that finally the penny has dropped and it is now accepted that this madness cannot continue.  It could be said that the CAP is now on a life support machine.  The plug should be pulled and the patient allowed to die.  The IFA are desperate to reverse the tide and are campaigning against the GATT talks.  They are late, they should have thought of this when they were reaping the profits, when they were putting all their produce into intervention and when prices were set at figures that people could not afford.  They are trying to turn back the tide in the interests of their rancher members, the people who gained substantially from the CAP.  There is evidence of the death throes of the CAP.  I welcome the practical positions put forward by the new united farmers organisation in today's newspapers.  They represent a breath of fresh air in the farming community.  I have already praised the ICMSA on the positions they have adopted on various issues.</P>
    <P>What has been the response of Fine Gael to this crisis, to this scandal?  Fine Gael, who proudly call themselves the farmers' party, have put forward a catch-all meaningless motion before the House, a collection of <i>ad hoc</i> band aid proposals which are unstructured.  They have thrown a sop to their friends, the beef barons and the ranchers, and they want the general taxpayer to subsidise those friends.  In the west of Ireland we have a saying that there is no need to rub a fat pig with lard.  The Fine Gael proposal in my view represents an attempt to rub the fat pig with lots of lard.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the amendment by the Labour Party recognises the need for an alternative to the CAP.  It examines the incomes of the farming community and recognises that many farmers are below the poverty line.  It examines upward <Col N="2492" /> price fixing, disastrous land structures and damaging farm practices.  The Labour Party recognise the investment policies of banks and financial institutions as not being suited to agricultural investment. Those fast buck, quick turnover policies do not allow for long pay back periods required in agricultural investment. Those policies led to the problems in Leitrim where the banks have taken control of large tracts of land.  They have left the farmers in that county &mdash; I would love to see a grid map of the county which coloured in blue the farms the banks control &mdash; as caretakers, nominal owners, but effectively employees of the banks.  They are there for a particular reason, so that the banks can avail of the grants for forestry. When that takes place the farmers will be put off the land because the banks will acquire the land for the original loans they made available to the farmers.  That type of investment is not suited to Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The banks and the financial institutions not only have a responsibility to their depositors but also have a responsibility to the community at large.  Agriculture being the primary Irish wealth producer, must have favourable long-term capital available to it.  The banks and the financial institutions must have a social conscience as well as looking to their profits. At present banks are the only practical source of loan capital for farmers since other financial institutions are not willing to invest in projects which have such a long pay-back period.  Over the decade banks have been reducing their commitment to the agricultural sector.  In 1983 more than 16 per cent of their borrowers came from the agricultural sector and in 1989 this was reduced to 10 per cent, a drop of more than one-third.  It could be argued that the banks were shifting their loans-investment profile into other productive areas such as manufacturing to create jobs but that is not the case.  In 1983 more than 20 per cent of borrowers came from the manufacturing sector.  In 1989 this was reduced to 15 per cent, a drop of more than 25 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 117a:</P>
      <P>In page 91, before section 114, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;114.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may make regulations under this section providing for the assimilation of the treatment under the Principal Act afforded to parties to a non-marital relationship to that which would be afforded to a husband and wife.</P>
      <P>(2)  Regulations made under this section may provide for such consequential, supplementary and ancilliary provisions, including provisions modifying any provision of the Principal Act as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section two persons shall be regarded as being parties to a non-marital relationship if they prove, in accordance with the regulations, that they have entered into a voluntary union which is intended to endure for their <Col N="2494" /> joint lives to the exclusion of all other persons.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the Minister proposes to make regulations under this section a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.   </P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment as it deals with the situation where a husband and wife have separated either by signing a separation agreement or under the Judicial Separation Act.  It is regrettable that cases of marital breakdown are running at a very high level and that judicial proceedings under the new Act are increasing.  Indeed, I was speaking to one of the senior officials of the Circuit Family Court.  I asked him how things were going under the new Act which is not all that long in force.  He said that, unfortunately, marital breakdown and judicial separation proceedings are one of our growth industries.  There is a very substantial number of cases of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>The State recognises that it happens and grants judicial separations under the Act.  Appreciable numbers are involved and we must face the fact that in many families the husband and wife separate and that a new permanent relationship is entered into by the husband or wife &mdash; or both &mdash; with another partner.  Many of these relationships are permanent and stable while some of them have lasted for five, ten or 20 years.  There may be children of those non-marital relationships. For all practical purposes it is a family unit in all respects except in so far as the pure technicality of the situation is concerned.  Under the capital acquisitions tax legislation, in the event of the death of the male partner to such a union the other partner &mdash; the woman &mdash; and her children would be faced with a capital acquisitions tax imposition as if she was a &ldquo;stranger in blood&rdquo; and without the benefit of the allowance provided in the case of a husband and wife.  In a modern context &mdash; and in the practical situation <Col N="2495" /> which we have to face today &mdash; that is grossly inequitable and unjust.</P>
    <P>The effect of the new Judicial Separation Act is that the parties to it are divorced in so far as full divorce legislation in England or any other jurisdiction is concerned in every single respect except one, the right to remarry.  Apart from that the parties are divorced, indeed the old description was divorce <i>a mensa etthoro.</i>  It is divorce in all respects except for the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>If we do not adopt the thrust of this amendment very many family units &mdash; I advisedly refer to them as family units because that is what they are &mdash; on the death of one of the partners will be left in a disastrous situation which could involve the forcible sale and loss of their home. The allowance given to a &ldquo;stranger in blood,&rdquo; which would apply here otherwise, is extremely low &mdash; I think it is only £10,000 which is to be slightly increased &mdash; and even a modest family home could be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>We must face up to the fact that family units of the kind to which I referred exist in very high numbers and that we must treat them the same as any other family unit.  I am not talking about fleeting relationships; the introduction of the proposed new section is very carefully worded.  We are talking about non-marital relationships of a permanent nature. I fully accept and recognise that there are complexities involved in matters of detail and definition and that is why I took the careful step of not attempting to lay down detailed parameters in the amendment.  I left that to the Minister to do by regulation.</P>
    <P>By moving this amendment I hope the House will accept the principle &mdash; no more at this stage &mdash; that permanent non-marital relationships of the type I described will receive exactly the same recognition as the legal family unit.  I hope the Minister will, in due course, avail of the powers which this section will give him to bring in regulations to put the flesh on the bones of the principle which I hope we can establish here tonight.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to exempt from capital acquisitions tax gifts and inheritances taken by one party to a non-marital relationship from the other.  At present this exemption applies only to inheritances taken by the surviving spouse of a disponer.  It is proposed that gifts taken by spouses will also be exempt from the date of the passing of this year's Finance Act.</P>
      <P>There are major objections to this amendment.  As a matter of policy the Revenue Commissioners should not be seen to be leading the general law in problems of this nature.  The provisions regarding the status of parties in non-marital relationships should be contained in the general law relating to marriage which would then be reflected in relevant tax legislation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in framing or effecting any changes in the tax code, there is a necessity to adhere to the precepts of the Constitution.  The Constitution binds the State to safeguard the institution of marriage, a requirement which the courts found to be applicable in tax law in the case of Murphy v. the Attorney General.  If I were to introduce a provision to allow for the assimiliation of treatment under the capital acquisitions tax legislation to parties outside the legal married contract this could cause similar constitutional difficulties.  In these circumstances it would not be desirable to make any special provision in the capital acquisitions tax legislation in respect of voluntary unions such as those identified in the amendment.</P>
      <P>From a practical point of view the difficulties which would be encountered by the Revenue Commissioners in administering such an exemption would be almost insurmountable.  For example, what evidence of residence, co-habitation and so on would be required?  Does the Deputy expect the Revenue Commissioners to ask detailed questions about the parties' private and personal arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, although it is not possible to estimate the immediate impact of the amendment on tax revenue it is likely <Col N="2497" /> that the cost to the Exchequer would be very considerable over a period of time. Accordingly, I must oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express very considerable disappointment at the Minister's response on this very important issue.  This amendment was advocated by the Institute of Taxation in Ireland, a very reasonable body to the forefront in seeking tax reform.  If I may be permitted to quote, they said at paragraph 2.2 of their recommendation on this issue of capital acquisitions tax thresholds:</P>
      <P>With the enactment of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the State has recognised the reality of the existence of marital breakdown.  The Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, requires to be amended to enable the stepchildren and spouses of a non-marital liaison to avail of the class I threshold. </P>
      <P>In my respectful submission justice requires that.</P>
      <P>The question of the Constitution does not enter into this.  The State has recognised &mdash; by passing the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act of 1989, which I think was eventually passed unanimously by this House &mdash; the reality that marriages do break down.  In other ways the State recognises the fact that non-marital liaisons exist.  I will say this much, local authorities, at least some, or at the very least the local authority of which I am a member &mdash; and I have no reason to suppose it is unique &mdash; recognise the fact of non-marital liaisons.  They will and do give local authority dwellings to non-marital unions of two people. They do so frequently in County Dublin; I know they do it in Dublin Corporation and I suppose elsewhere.  Are they offending against the Constitution?  That idea just does not hold water; that is just not borne out by the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why can we not face up to the practicalities of what is going on outside this House?  Why do we shut ourselves in here, pretending that some world is going <Col N="2498" /> on out there which is not at all in accordance with reality?  Life goes on out there. What is going on out there &mdash; and there are thousands of cases up and down the country &mdash; is that marital breakdown is taking place; separations are being granted by people entering into agreements to that effect, or by having judicial separations pronounced in the Circuit Courts which are kept extremely busy in this regard.  Non-marital liaisons have been set up, many of which have been in existence for 20 years or more, with complete loyalty of the spouses, one to the other, with children growing up, for all purposes being a permanent liaison/union otherwise than having the pure technicality.  Perhaps most of the people involved would marry if the law of the land allowed them do so.  Personally I have the deepest regret that it does not, that is no secret, I have advocated that position.  Unfortunately the referendum on divorce was defeated.  The only thing that stops such people changing their non-marital relationship into a marital one is that, legally speaking, they may not do so.</P>
    <P>Therefore when there are thousands of Irish people out there who have been living together for 25 to 30 years in the utmost loyalty to each other, who have children growing up, are we to say to them that our tax laws regard them as being strangers in blood, that the threshold allowances for capital acquisitions tax purposes given to a married couple are to be denied them?  It offends reason; it offends logic; it is unfair, inequitable, unjust and I am not a little disappointed at the attitude being adopted here.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision on this crucial issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reiterate that we are dealing with tax law.  It is a well established principle that tax law does not lead in this area.  Rather it is a matter for general law to lead in this area.  The Deputy may or may not be aware that the Revenue Commissioners have a statement of practice in circulation about cases in which there is hardship involved with regard to the application of capital <Col N="2499" /> acquisitions tax.  If the Deputy is not familiar with it, we will get him a copy.</P>
      <P>In the case of unions to which the Deputy refers, the capital acquisitions tax threshold applicable to children entitles them to the £150,000 because there is now no such person in law as an illegitimate child.  Therefore, there are no problems encountered in that respect.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware also, in the case of intestacy a spouse is entitled to a share of a deceased person's estate. The term &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; has been taken to refer to a person to whom the intestate person was validly married, cite the case of Gaffney <i>v.</i> Gaffney 1975 Irish Reports. The term &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; does not apply to any other person.  Again, only a spouse has a legal right to a share of the deceased person's estate.</P>
      <P>Those are just two examples in which, under general law &mdash; in the case of the Successsion Act 1965 &mdash; a &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; means a person who is lawfully married. I do not think I would be justifed in accepting an amendment which would put taxation law in such conflict with the general law.  As a legal practitioner himself I am sure Deputy Taylor appreciates exactly what I am saying.  It takes me back to where I began &mdash; that married couples are entitled to their treatment under the capital acquisitions tax legislation because they are married.  That is not the position in the case of cohabiting couples.  Therefore, it is a question of general law leading and tax law following, not the other way round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am very sympathetic to the concerns expressed by Deputy Taylor.  There is a problem of permanent relationships when people, in all circumstances, perceive themselves as having a permanent relationship being treated differently because they cannot organise themselves on a legal basis.  It is not their fault they cannot organise their relationship on a legal basis; the law does not allow them do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see the problem the Minister has with definitions.  I can see the problem of the Revenue Commissioners, whenever <Col N="2500" /> a proposition was put to them, in deciding whether it was a relationship of long standing, whether it was a casual relationship, or in ascertaining where they would draw the demarcation line between what was quite valid within the general context and what might constitute some avoidance measure.  I can foresee a big problem being encountered in its application.</P>
    <P>In circumstances in which there is a permanent relationship, where there are children, I take it that since the status of illegitimacy was abolished by this House, the thresholds which would apply in a direct transfer from parent to child would apply in the case of a transfer from the parent or parents of a non-regularised relationship to their children.  I take it that is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is the net point in the case of transfers between &ldquo;spouses&rdquo;&mdash; that is, spouses in quotation marks?</P>
      <P>There is a later amendment in my name which asks the Minister, among other things, to treat a lineal ancestor, in certain circumstances, in the same way as a lineal descendant.  I am confining it to inheritance tax.  If it were extended to cover gift tax it would be possible to cater for the problem Deputy Taylor has in mind in circumstances where there would be children.  There could be a double transfer, from parent to child and back to parent.  If the Minister cannot see any way of overcoming the technical difficulties he has described for us, he might consider what may be considered a tax avoidance measure but if there is no other way of fulfilling the objective it would be possible to transfer in that way &mdash; if the Minister follows what I am trying to say &mdash; rather than across the line.  It may be possible to get over the difficulty in that way while not putting the Minister in a position where he would be leading general law rather than following it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few general remarks on the question of capital acquisitions tax but I will refrain from <Col N="2501" /> doing so until we reach section 115.  As I see it, this section which purports to exempt from tax gifts between spouses &mdash; this is already the case in respect of inheritances between spouses &mdash; is elaborated upon by what is a very reasoned amendment from Deputy Taylor.  I wish to draw the Minister's attention to subsection (3) of the amendment which reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section two persons shall be regarded as being parties to a non-marital relationship if they prove, in accordance with the regulations, that they have entered into a voluntary union which is intended to endure for their joint lives to the exclusion of all other persons. </P>
      <P>I respectfully ask the Minister to tell us whether he considers it is possible to come up with a tighter definition of a life-long commitment outside the marriage contract than the one in that clause?  This appears to be the nub of the issue.  The Minister is essentially saying that he does not accept that marital breakdown is, unfortunately, a fact of life and reunions occur with the intention of there being a life-long relationship and that through no fault of their own the two people concerned must set up house and try to co-ordinate a family unit outside the law in the manner prescribed in this amendment.</P>
      <P>The State does acknowledge this reality in other areas.  For example, the Department of Social Welfare very speedily take action against one or other spouse in the event of cohabitation. Deputy Taylor has referred to the position which obtains in respect of local authority housing.  The local authority I am familiar with in the Dublin area accept that persons who find themselves in this position may make application as a family unit.  They frequently do and are accorded housing and charged rent on that basis.  We are turning a blind eye to reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many fine words were spoken at the time of the great debate on the referendum. We all accept that the people made their decision but we do not all <Col N="2502" /> necessarily accept that the people in all cases made their decisions freely having regard to some of the pressures applied. However, that is water under the bridge. This amendment merely seeks to address the reality.  If the Minister considers it necessary to introduce section 114 to extend the exemption to cover gifts between spouses, I cannot see why we would want to inflict any further unnecessary cruelty on two people who have the best of intentions and who, within the definition contained in subsection (3) of this amendment, do their best to pick up the pieces again and make a life for themselves in a country which does not admit legally that marital breakdown occurs.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to address the substance of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably unnecessary for me to remind Deputies and the House that the Constitution binds the State to guard with very special care the institution of marriage.  Consequently, it should be apparent that this amendment would not be acceptable to me in circumstances where general law leads and tax law follows.  Having said that, let us look at the problem presented. I am not unaware of the realities of life, that marital breakdown occurs and that there are people cohabiting.  However, let us look at the problem presented to see if any pragmatic solution can be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, if there are children involved the threshold of £150,000 passes on to the child or children concerned.  Deputies Taylor, Rabbitte and Noonan expressed concern in varying degrees about the position of the spouse involved.  I suggest that this difficulty could be resolved by providing the spouse with a life interest in the property concerned and by availing of the statement of practice by the Revenue Commissioners which indicates that hardship can be addressed in certain ways.  For example, instead of paying inheritance tax a mortgage could be taken out on the property.  Leaving that aside, let us consider the position of the spouse.  If a life interest in the property is provided for the spouse, once the <Col N="2503" /> spouse has passed away this will pass on to the child or children concerned with no tax payable.  Therefore there is a practical solution to the problem which can be availed of.</P>
    <P>Everyone accepts that there are difficulties with the definition of spouse and the constitutional requirements which bind the State to give special protection to the institution of marriage.  I have suggested a practical solution to the problem raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given me an answer but it is not a satisfactory one, I am sorry to say.  Let me say a few words on the constitutional requirements.  The Minister has indicated that we are presented with constitutional difficulties but I cannot accept this or that it is in accordance with the facts.  In that context let us consider for a moment the position of the non-marital child.  Under our law the non-marital child is put in the same position as a marital child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is general law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Be that as it may, that is the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No distinction is drawn between a non-marital child and a marital child.  I have never heard anyone suggest, that because the law equated the position, including the tax position, of a marital child and a non-marital child, this in any way constitutes an attack on the institution of marriage, which is to be protected under the Constitution.  If that constituted an attack on the institution of marriage there might be some force to the Minister's argument.  We know, however, that it is perfectly in order to equate a marital child with a non-marital child; there is nothing unconstitutional in that.  By the same token, if the Minister and the Government were minded to equate, for tax purposes, the position of a non-marital alliance and a marital <Col N="2504" /> alliance, it would be no more unconstitutional and no more offensive to the Constitution than equating the position of the marital child and the non-marital child.</P>
      <P>It is not entirely inconsistent for the State to take up the position that the non-marital child has the same tax benefit on inheritance as a marital child but that the mother of the child and the father of the child, as between themselves, count as nothing?  There is an inconsistency there. It is all very well to say that we are casting around here looking for tax avoidance measures.  Deputy Noonan suggested one and the difficulty there is that children under age cannot make dispositions at all by law and that presents an immediate problem with his tax avoidance method. The Minister suggested another tax avoidance method dealing with life interests and so on.  The people I am talking about, however, do not have the advice readily available nor can they afford the advice of the tax consultants and advisers as to how they should manage their affairs.  They are just ordinary down to earth people.  They are just faced with problems as working people for the most part; they do not have the benefit of that advice and they are not able to get advice on tax avoidance. Surely the net point is that if we recognise it as a problem that needs a remedy, instead of spending our time casting about here for tax avoidance methods we should just come up front and be honest with them, and with ourselves for once, and admit that there is a problem that we are going to try to do something about.</P>
      <P>I know the present law covers the position of a spouse and I know about the Gaffney case in 1975; that was 15 years ago.  We are not in 1975 now, nor in 1985.  We are in Ireland of the nineties and we should cop ourselves on and try to bring ourselves up to date and not hark back to 1975.  I know that is the present position.  The reason I proposed this amendment was to try to bring some equity and justice into the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes it helps if one gets away from the generalities and describes a <Col N="2505" /> specific case of marital breakdown.  The new couple have been living together for 30 years and have got themselves a very modest house valued at £30,000, the lowest end of the scale.  They have been together for 30 years; he is just a working man and she has looked after the children of the non-marital union, non-marital children who are fully recognised in every way.  They have no money put by, they have no assets and they do not consult tax advisers.  Tragedy strikes at them and he dies.  I have done a very rough calculation of what the unfortunate lady who is left behind has to pay in inheritance tax, somewhere between £4,000 and £6,000. People in that situation have as much chance of putting their hands on £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 as they have of getting £40,000 or £50,000.  This is an outrageous amount of tax for people who have nothing left but a £30,000 house and interest gets added on to that as time goes on and their home is literally put at risk. Does the Minister really want that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for saying no. I know the Minister does not want that. I know that he is a humane person and would not want a family in that situation to lose their home and have to resort to local authority accommodation when they have struggled all their lives to get their basic house.  But if we say no, we have to try to do something about it and that is the sole purpose of my amendment, to try to address a very real, human situation and, as I have said, unfortunately a very common one.  We all regret that marital breakdown takes place.  It is a very sad occurrence.  At the same time, we have to face up to it.  We have to try to cope with the situation and help people as best we can.  We all want to do that, so why can we not be realistic about it?  Just imagine a situation where the breadwinner has suddenly gone. What a trauma that is, and here are the children, their education, their maintenance, feeding and all the rest, and on top of that is added the burden of about £5,000 for inheritance tax.  It was never <Col N="2506" /> meant to cover that kind of situation but it does, so why do we not challenge it and say that we will look at it.</P>
      <P>I point out, with all the force at my command, that my amendment is not changing the law at all.  It goes no further than to try to bring a principle into our tax legislation, because it leaves all the details to the Minister to be worked out at the appropriate time by regulation.  If this was adopted and passed this minute there would be no immediate change in the law at all.  That was deliberate on my part because it is a new principle and until such time as the Minister brought in his regulations to amplify the detail of this there would be no change at all.  The Minister says this should be a matter for the general law rather than tax law. Sometimes one despairs.  There are times when one gets the feeling that one cannot win.  If there was an appropriate Bill going through the House on the general law and I attempted to bring in an amendment to such an enactment of the general law to provide for assimilation on capital acquisitions tax, I would be told very quickly by the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister that that was a matter appropriate to the Finance Bill, that it was a matter appropriate to tax legislation and that it was totally inappropriate in general legislation.</P>
      <P>That is as far as I can put it, a Cheann Comhairle.  We have debated it long and hard.  This is a very humane point which I would ask the Minister and the House to reconsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is humane.  Deputy Taylor is an experienced legal man himself. He knows that he does not have to amend legislation in relation to capital acquisitions tax.  The nub of the problem here is the definition of spouse and that can be amended in general legislation and then we have a different problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come back to the picture the Deputy painted and the question of compassion in regard to a relationship where there are children.  What Deputy Taylor failed to address and has totally ignored <Col N="2507" /> is the original spouse.  He makes no provision for that.  The original spouse has rights.  The Deputy talks about the second spouse where there is cohabitation and where there is a family but ignores the rights of the first spouse.  When the Deputy does that as glibly as he has done, then it is quite easy to present the picture in a simplistic form.</P>
    <P>What I addressed were the practical solutions to the problems that exist in that situation.  There are many ways around it. I accept that many ordinary people are at a loss for information, but many Members of this House provide that information.  I have listened to some of the problems that come out of the society that those two Deputies represent.  I am sure Deputy Taylor reads <i>The Irish Times</i>, and in the issue of 8 January 1990 a Revenue Commissioners official gave an interview in which he went into the detail of this.  It is not identical to the situation the Deputy has raised here but it is the case of two sisters living in a house where, if one of them died there would be hardship because of inheritance tax and capital acquisitions tax.  In that situation one can leave the house to the other or leave a life interest and let it pass on to somebody afterwards; they can apply to the Revenue Commissioners for postponement of the payment and let a mortgage be raised on it or whatever. In this situation, they could adopt the approach I have already mentioned, but another way of looking at it is that the spouse could leave the house to the children. The spouse could be appointed as the executor of the will and the guardian of the children.  The children could look after the spouse and the spouse could look after the children.  If we are arguing the legal point as to whether it should be general law or tax law which should address this problem, I can say that in tax law this has been tested in the case Gaffney <i>v.</i> Gaffney in 1975 where the definition of spouse was the critical point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor has carefully ignored the existence of another spouse and what will happen to that spouse.  One cannot trample on the rights of the existing <Col N="2508" /> spouse and just say that their rights do not exist.  Their rights exist and have to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address that point. However, I will deal with the Minister's first point now, the definition question. The Minister is inviting me to say that in some other measure I will propose the alteration of the definitions so that partners in a non-marital union will in some way become spouses.  I cannot do that. That does not make sense at all.  The partners to a non-marital union are not spouses and cannot be spouses because that is the law of the land, although they may wish to become spouses.  All the definitions in the world will not change that; spouses are spouses and people in a non-marital union are not spouses.  All I can try to do, which I am doing, is to seek to assimilate the tax laws so far as capital acquisitions tax is concerned as they apply to people in a marital union to people in a non-marital union, provided certain very stringent conditions are met and the Minister makes regulations to deal with it.  I can do not more than that, and that is all I seek to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister raises the question, and it is a very fair one, that I am ignoring the position of the original spouse. However, what the Minister is forgetting is that under the terms of the Judicial Separation Act, when orders for a judicial separation are made and likewise when these things are dealt with in separation agreements there is a permanent finish as between the property rights of the original spouses.  That becomes part and parcel of the judicial separation decree and the Judicial Separation Act which was passed unanimously by this House has specific provision to see that the mutual inheritance rights <i>inter se</i> of the original spouses can be and usually are severed and determined and even their mutual rights under the Family Home Protection Act are also mutually severed.  As I have said earlier, the effects of a judicial separation decree are identical in all respects to a divorce save only &mdash; and I mean only &mdash; the right to remarry.  Apart from that there is a <Col N="2509" /> permanent cut and a permanent separation between them.  In most cases their inheritance rights are gone and even the rights that a spouse would have under the Family Home Protection Act are gone.  I have not overlooked, if I may say so, the position of the original spouse.  I have borne it very much in mind.  What we are talking about now is a new permanent <Col N="2510" /> non-marital relationship and I have worded my amendment very carefully to cover those situations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 118:</P>
      <P>In page 91, before section 115, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;115.&mdash;Notwithstanding the provisions of the Principal Act, in any case where&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  the successor is a brother or sister of the disponer, who had lived on a full time basis with the disponer in the disponer's principal private residence for the period of 5 years ending on the date of the inheritance; and</P>
      <P>(b)  the inheritance consists of the disponer's principal private residence; and</P>
      <P>(c)  the successor is 55 years of age or more,</P>
      <P>then, for the purpose of computing the tax payable on the inheritance, the successor shall be deemed to bear to the disponer the relationship of a child.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This is the first of a series of amendments  in which I am seeking to change certain aspects of capital acquisitions tax.  Some of them apply to both gift tax and inheritance tax.  There is one amendment a part of which applies only to inheritance tax. Under the provisions of section 115 the Minister is proposing to index the thresholds for capital acquisitions tax purposes.  The thresholds have remained unchanged since 1978 and he is proposing that they will be changed yearly on the basis of the consumer price index at mid-November. That gives him a 4 per cent inflation rate this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has addressed the problem.  The section to which he seeks to make the amendment is welcome but I would ask him to look at a number of anomalies that arise in capital acquisitions tax.  My first amendment seeks to address one anomaly which was referred to in passing in the Minister's reply to Deputy Taylor's amendment which we have just disposed of.  It is the kind of circumstance in which two sisters or a brother and sister are living together and the property is in one name.  When he or she dies the house passes to the surviving sister or brother.  Because the tax threshold is so low between sisters or brothers he or she could be liable for inheritance tax on most of the value of the property. When we are discussing inheritance tax there is a tendency to believe that we are talking about the farming community <Col N="2513" /> because they lobby more about inheritance tax than others or, secondly, that we are talking about extremely valuable property but the basic threshold for transfers is £20,000.  If somebody in a town or village is living with her sister and the house worth £65,000 to £70,000 is in the sister's name when the £20,000 exemption is deducted from £70,000, the surviving sister will pay tax on £50,000 which amounts to a substantial amount.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has suggested tax avoidance measures that could be taken. If the sisters were sufficiently advised and were in a position to understand capital acquisitions tax and the legal implications of tax transfers they could, as the Minister said, arrange their affairs so that the surviving sister would have a life interest in the property.  Alternatively, if it caused great hardship the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; I understand from their statement of practice referred to by the Minister &mdash; would be prepared to accept a mortgage on the property and they would collect when the surviving sister died.  These are make-do suggestions. Frequently, the people who are hit hardest are those who are not aware of the way they can arrange their affairs to avoid the penalty or the liability to tax.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes that, where the successor is a brother or a sister of the disponer, has lived on a full-time basis with the disponer in the disponer's principal private residence for a period of five years ending on the date of the inheritance, where the inheritance consists of the principal private residence and nothing else, where the successor is 55 years of age or more, then, for the purpose of computing the tax payable on the inheritance, the successor should be deemed to bear to the disponer the relationship of a child.</P>
    <P>Where there is a lineal descent from parent to a child the threshold for exemption is £150,000.  As the Minister has now arranged, under the provisions of section 115 this will be indexed in the future to £156,000.  In the case of a transfer of agricultural land &mdash; to which my amendment would not apply &mdash; because agricultural land is valued at 50 per cent one <Col N="2514" /> can double everything, in which case we would be talking about £312,000 rather than £156,000.</P>
    <P>This amendment is confined to the principal private residence in a transfer between brothers and sisters where the survivor is over 55 years of age, where the residence is in the name of the disponer, where they have lived together for at least five years and where all that is at issue is the inheritance of the house in which the brother and sister have lived, in which the two brothers have lived or in which the two sisters have lived.  The purpose of this amendment is to try to organise a situation where such transfers would not be liable to inheritance tax because the same threshold would apply to the transfer from sister to sister the same as applies to a transfer from parent to child.  We know there is a precedent for this.  We are all aware in rural constituencies of the phenomenon of the favourite nephew or the favourite niece.  Without going into the intricacies of the favourite nephew clause the Principal Act says that the favourite nephew will be treated and shall deem to bear to the disponer the relationship of a child for tax purposes.  The actual formula for doing what I am suggesting is there already in the precedent of the favourite nephew or the favourite niece.  There is an unanswerable case.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will quote the interview with an official of the Revenue Commissioners in the financial pages of <i>The Irish Times</i> which was published after Christmas when this became an issue of public debate.  It was a very good article. I was delighted that officials were prepared to come forward and give public advice, that they were allowed to come forward and give public advice.  It was very helpful for anybody who would be advising in circumstances where that would arise.  Clever tax avoidance advice is not as good as the certainty of legal changes.  I am seeking a legal change for older people, brothers and sisters, at least 55 years of age who have been living together for a long time, so that a transfer could take place without the penalty of inheritance tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2515" /> It is customary when proposing amendments to ask what cost would be involved but we are talking about buttons here.  I think the amendment I am proposing is correctly drafted.  I would like the Minister to accept the principle of what I am saying and come back to us on this tomorrow if there is any technical flaw in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I know what the Deputy is saying.  Apply the principle of the favourite nephew to this and everything in the garden is rosy.  It is just not as simple as that.  Take the example the Deputy has given of two elderly brothers or sisters living together in a house which, taking the bottom range of the market, is worth, say, £40,000.  If one of them already owns half the house all that is passing for tax purposes is half of £40,000 which is £20,000 so there is no tax involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>From my knowledge that is rather uncommon.  It is more likely that two brothers, two sisters or sister and brother were left the house by their father or grandfather.  Take the Deputy's example of £60,000.  Half of the £60,000 is £30,000 with an exemption of £20,000. Now for the first time since 1973 I have indexed the thresholds from £150,000.  It is not the massive problem everybody tries to convince me it is.  Why did it last <Col N="2516" /> so long in every Finance Bill that went through this House since 1973 or whatever year it was and everything is a problem now?  I suggest that a house owned by two brothers and two sisters and valued at £60,000 would at a maximum attract inheritance tax of about £2,000.  If there is hardship in paying that, payment can be deferred until the survivor passes away.  There is a statement of practice by the Revenue Commissioners to advise people how they can deal with these problems in not alone such cases but in others as well.  I quote from the Revenue Commissioners' document <i>Capital Acquisitions Tax</i>&mdash;<i>Statement of Practice (SP-CAT/1/90)</i>&mdash;<i>Postponement of Tax and Registration of Charge:</i></P>
      <P> 1.  In cases where payment of the gift or inheritance tax due would cause excessive hardship for the beneficiary, the Revenue Commissioners will consider proposals for the postponement of payment of tax.  Postponement may include instalment or other arrangements for payment (including the waiver of interest) or the registration of a judgment mortgage or other charge over the property taken as a benefit. This Statement of Practice outlines the practice and procedures to be followed where the beneficiary, claiming excessive hardship, is prepared to allow the Commissioners to register a judgment mortgage or other charge over the property taken as a benefit.</P>
      <P>2.  An example of the type of situation envisaged is one where an elderly person, with limited means, inherits a house or apartment which is, or becomes, his or her sole residence and where in order to pay the tax due he or she would be obliged to sell the residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The postponement would apply during the lifetime of the successor while the property which is subject to the charge remains in the ownership of the successor.  In the event of a sale or transfer, or on the death of the successor the entire tax together with <Col N="2517" /> accrued interest would become payable and the arrangements for payment (including consideration of any claims for waiver or reduction of interest) would be considered with reference to the circumstances of the sale or transfer, or the circumstances of the eventual successor or successors as appropriate.  </P>
    <P>Therefore, there are plenty of ways of dealing with hardship if that is the problem.</P>
    <P>The other way of dealing with the problem is giving life interest to people in certain situations such as I referred to earlier in the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 8 January 1990.  When two brothers, sisters or whatever are together in those circumstances the survivor has a life interest in and full use of the property for his or her lifetime and the tax due would be signficantly reduced in many cases and would be eliminated altogether in many other cases.  There is plenty of information available.  The problem is not as I see it presented here.  My case stands on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister's reply to me is based generally on a false premise.  He is taking the example of two brothers or sisters living together who jointly own the house.  He is taking the house as worth £60,000, he is saying the survivor owns £30,000 worth of it already and all that is at issue is the inheritance of £30,000 which is the value of half the house, a £20,000 threshold applies and the person pays tax on only £10,000.  He is saying 20 per cent of £10,000 throws up a tax liability of £2,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Approximately. That is not so.  As is common in all our towns and cities, two old ladies are living together: usually the house has been left to the older one by the father <Col N="2518" /> or mother and the younger sister moves in to live with her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It would be in the name of the older sister or brother to whom it was transferred by the parent.  Quite frequently the other brother or sister is living there with no rights to the property.  In those circumstances the sum is different.  Then we are talking about £60,000 worth of property being transferred, a £20,000 exemption &mdash; I have not got the schedule in front of me &mdash; but 20 per cent applied to £40,000 is £8,000 rather than £2,000.  I am not standing over the figure, I am using it as an example working back from the figures the Minister threw out.  If you take the total value of the house and apply the threshold of £20,000, a significant tax imposition applies.  To come to people after the funeral and say, &ldquo;Is it not a pity you did not arrange your affairs differently?&rdquo; is not much consolation.  To suggest to an old lady that if her sister had given her a life interest in the property rather than leaving it in her will everything would have been all right is small comfort.  What I am talking about would be no great loss to the Revenue Commissioners.  The tax might not be paid until the next transfer.  I am talking about two brothers or sisters living together and usually they are single.  On the next inheritance the surviving sister or brother will be passing the property on to a nephew or niece or somebody further out.  The tax is collected on the next transfer on the full value of the property with the £20,000 threshold applying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should accept this amendment.  He is taking the &ldquo;best case&rdquo; scenario and applying good tax advice to that.  The more average case is where the property is in the name of one brother or sister who makes a will and leaves it to the other and the full value of the house, once the threshold is passed, is liable for inheritance tax.  I think there is a case to be met.  Why does it always arise that everything was grand for the last ten <Col N="2519" /> years, that only when this poor Minister arrives we make these demands on him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be 17 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> One reason is that property values over the last couple of years have risen and a very small tax imposition becomes a very serious tax imposition.  It is not a question of trying to preserve the value of inherited wealth.  In the circumstances I have stated where brothers or sister are involved the State will collect its tranche of inheritance tax anyway when the next transfer takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit to having a good deal of sympathy with the point Deputy Noonan argued.  It highlights something I find slightly strange in the setting out of the threshold.  I wonder how it ever came about that a brother or sister, which after all is a pretty close relationship, is treated in the same tax threshold as a nephew or niece, who is one degree further away.  One would have thought a brother and sister would have warranted being in a different category and would have been treated so much more favourably than a nephew or niece, but they are together in the one threshold category and I find that surprising. In both cases the tax is still double what it would be for a person living with another for 30 years and having three children with them.  That again highlights some of the inequities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of position enunciated by Deputy Noonan does arise but not very frequently.  There are a few people in my own area, elderly brothers or sisters who have been living together for a long time who literally do not have the resources available to look into tax questions.  We are talking about people in very modest circumstances.  Part of the trouble with the capital acquisitions tax code is that it enables the wealthy sections of the community to avail of tax planning and the services of tax consultants and experts to make up schemes which will substantially moderate their liability to <Col N="2520" /> taxes in one form or another, if not to avoid them alltogether.  On the other side of the coin, people of relatively modest means fail to deal with problems that will arise when one dies and they have not the resources to enable them to do so.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to respond favourably when specific certain limited cases are drawn to his attention. I would be inclined to support Deputy Noonan's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to put in context exactly what I have done in my approach to capital acquisitions tax.</P>
      <P>In my review of capital acquisitions tax this year I accepted that some degree of movement was desirable.  I am aware that problems can arise in this area.  I had, however, to balance this view against the fact that the yield from the tax was some one-third only of 1 per cent of total tax revenue in 1989, a considerably lower figure than that yielded by the old death duties regime.  I also had to bear in mind that substantial changes in this area would lead to a narrowing of the tax base and, consequently, to a limiting of the options available to me in the context of overall tax reform.</P>
      <P>While bearing in mind all these factors, nevertheless I included important reliefs in this Bill.  Gifts taken by one spouse from another will in future be exempt from tax and I have extended the scope of section 60 insurance policies which can cover these eventualities.  Also, I have introduced an important change under which the various thresholds will in the future be index-linked.  These changes will cost over £1.35 million a year which, relative to the yield from the tax, is a significant amount.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan's proposals to allow the parent and child threshold to apply in the case of certain transfers between brothers and sisters and to further increase the thresholds would cost over £11 million a year &mdash; a reduction in the present yield of some 40 per cent.  This is unacceptable and I am sure that Deputies will agree that my own proposals are sensible and realistic responses to the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2521" /> I dealt with the situation of an elderly brother and sister having equal shares in a house and I cannot see any real problem in that area.  Where a brother or sister is to inherit an entire house, a simple piece of tax planning will reduce the tax burden or eliminate it in some cases.  This has been brought to our notice by many people, including the Incorporated Law Society.  The Revenue Commissioners suggested to the Law Society, among others, that wills can be drawn up in such a way as to reduce substantially the amount of tax payable.  Instead of giving the house absolutely to a surviving sister the owner of a house may make a will giving the house to that sister for life, the house passing absolutely on her death to, say, a nephew.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>How are life interests dealt with?  Does it depend on the age of the person who gets it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is it a gift?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxable value can be reduced by doing this.  The life interest would give the sister full use of the property for her lifetime.  If she were aged 65 at the owner's death the effect of her taking a life interest instead of an absolute interest would be to reduce the tax from £3,500 to nil if the house were valued at £35,000, or from £14,000 to £4,865 if the house were valued at £70,000.  I have already outlined the avenues open to people where the payment of tax would involve hardship.</P>
      <P>The computation of inheritance tax is based on the relationship between a disponer and the successor.  Apart from the possible loss of revenue and the further narrowing of the already narrow inheritance tax base, I am reluctant to take on any further proposals which interfere with this base.  Accordingly, I must oppose the amendment, bearing in mind what I have said and the way in which many of the problems raised can be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it on the record of the House that in the hardship cases outlined <Col N="2522" /> by Deputy Noonan the Revenue Commissioners will never press for payment of tax.  I am specifically putting this on the record of the House so that everybody will know that they will not press for payment in the type of hardship case Deputy Noonan has raised.  They never have done.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 119:</P>
      <P>In page 91, before section 115, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;115.&mdash;Notwithstanding the provisions of the Principal Act, in any case where&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  the successor is a brother or sister of the disponer who has worked substantially on a full time basis for the period of 5 years ending on the date of the inheritance in carrying on, or assisting in the carrying on of the trade, business or profession or the work of or connected with the office or employment of the disponer; and</P>
      <P>(b)  the inheritance consists of property which was used in connection with such trade, business, profession, office or employment or of shares in a company owning such property,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>then, for the purpose of computing <Col N="2524" /> the tax payable on the inheritance, the successor shall be deemed to bear to the disponer the relationship of a child.&rdquo;.   </P>
    <P>Amendment No. 119, which is along the lines of the amendment we have disposed of, relates to a brother or sister of a disponer.  It proposes that, where the brother or sister of a disponer has spent five years, ending on the date of the inheritance, carrying on or assisting in the carrying on of the trade, business or profession or the work of or connected with the office or employment of the disponer and the inheritance consists of property which was used in connection with such trade, business, profession, office or employment or of shares in a company owning such property, then, for the purpose of computing the tax payable on the inheritance, the successor shall be deemed to bear to the disponer the relationship of a child.  I am applying the same argument I put forward in amendment No. 118 to cases where a brother or sister are carrying on a business &mdash; running a local pub or shop, perhaps &mdash; which is in the name of one of them and which will be left to the other when the owner dies.  I am talking here of property which is of greater value than house property.  I am again making the point that the higher threshold which is applicable to the transfer of property between parents and children should apply to such transactions where brothers and sisters or brothers have jointly run a farm, shop, pub, etc.  I think my intentions are clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure much could be said in favour of amendments Nos. 118, 119 and subsequent amendments from Deputy Noonan &mdash; anomalies exist within the capital acquisitions tax code which ought to be highlighted and corrected &mdash; but I have some difficulty in being expected to be sympathetic to an area of taxation where basically we are talking about the transfer of property and minimising the tax liability for the transfer of property, gifts and so on as against &mdash; we spent a great deal of the debate on <Col N="2525" /> the Finance Bill discussing this &mdash; what reliefs might be made available to people who have no property.</P>
      <P>Without impugning in any way the merits of the anomalies Deputy Noonan wishes to highlight, I would refer him to the view of the former Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, who made the point that in his view the capital acquisitions tax system, as it is now was intended by him to be accompanied by a wealth tax and that effectively the old estate duty would yield far more now than does the existing capital acquisitions tax.  Perhaps the Minister can contain his risibility.  I understand why wealth tax might be a touchy subject in this case but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am afraid that the only way a person who, has wealth in this society could end up paying any significant tax is if one was ignorant or stupid.  There are so many tax avoidance mechanisms available to people who have wealth to avoid paying tax that they could not be excused for paying a significant share of tax.  The old estate duty would, if it were still in existence, yield more. If the situation is otherwise I ask the Minister to say so.</P>
      <P>I know Deputy Noonan was not referring to this point.  There are three different categories involved.  The Minister has proved responsive to the question of raising the threshold.  For many years the Government and the trade unions have been discussing the question of various personal income tax allowances, tax bands and so on.  On occasion it has been necessary to argue that we could not contemplate indexation for all kinds of reasons &mdash; dimunition of revenue and so on &mdash; but it is possible here.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to have any sympathy with category one where I think the new threshold will be £156,000.  A millionaire with eight children, can, by managing his affairs prudently, contrive to dispose of the whole lot without being liable for any capital acquisitions tax.</P>

      <P>It would not matter in this case whether they were marital or non-marital children.

We have demonstrated the same flexibility on questions like, for example, the residential property tax.  We have also managed to introduce reliefs in respect of children which we could not possibly introduce for the PAYE earner.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to get very excited about the amendments in this area. Deputy Taylor referred to the only category who seem especially discriminated against within the code, that is, the living-in-sin category, for the want of a better description.  I am not denying that there may be anomalies within the code as it exists but I am not greatly moved by them.</P>

      <P>I thought there would be plenty of them paying it in Clondalkin.  I can tell the Deputy that it was introduced more in response to the PAYE earner than anybody else and I think it was very much welcomed by them.  I certainly believed in the equity of the argument which was put to me. The old death duty would have yielded more than is yielded under this tax.  The yield at present only represents one-third of one per cent.  I have introduced many changes and I am not disposed, without having compensatory payments somewhere, to look at other changes in this area.  The purpose of this amendment is to apply the threshold of £150,000, which is now indexed, instead of the threshold of £20,000, to an inheritance consisting of business assets taken from a disponer by a brother or sister who has worked on a full-time basis for the disponer in the five years preceding the date of the inheritance.</P>
      <P>There is already a similar relief given under paragraph 9 of Part I of the Second Schedule to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, to gifts and inheritances of business assets taken by a nephew or niece, provided that the nephew or niece has worked on a full-time basis for the disponer.  Clearly, what is involved here is to substitute the favourite nephew.  This relief takes the form of treating the nephew or niece as a child of the disponer, so qualifying for the £150,000 instead of the £20,000 tax threshold.</P>
      <P>This concession afforded to certain nephews and nieces was a recognition of what was perceived to be the special position of a childless proprietor who had taken a nephew or niece into his business or farm with a virtual guarantee of succession to that business or farm provided the nephew or niece effectively renounced an alternative career.  In a sense, the nephew or niece had been informally adopted and was, therefore, granted the relationship of a child as in the case of a legally adopted person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No such case exists for the extension of the relief to brothers and sisters. Indeed, it might be argued that by encouraging, through a tax concession, <Col N="2528" /> the handing over of a business to a person of the same generation, this proposed section would deny the inheritance of the business to a younger, more energetic and dynamic beneficiary, say a nephew or a niece, who might qualify for the existing concession.</P>
    <P>There are many ways of catering for this, such as insurance and so on.  There is no lack of information on the topic.  In fact the Revenue Commissioners have been very forthcoming on how to deal with this matter.  If the relief in respect of business assets is being sought for brothers and sisters, a case might be made for extending it to grandchildren, cousins and even the favourite stranger. However, extending the relief to others would lead to a loss of revenue at a time when I am being urged to broaden the base in connection with capital taxation. In the context of a tax whose rates are based on consanguinity, any extension of the relief would throw doubts on the equity and efficiency of the tax.  Accordingly, I must oppose this amendment, bearing in mind the way inheritance tax on business assets passing between brothers and sisters may be met, as I have outlined, by tax planning and by the use of section 60 policies.</P>
    <P>There are severe pressures on the tax base arising from the Government's commitment to reduce income tax rates and deal with the pressures arising from the EC proposals for approximation of indirect taxes.  We cannot afford to jettison any revenue for reasons which do not appear compelling.  In the budget, and the Finance Bill, it was all give and no take.  The few takes that are in the Bill will have to remain in place for another year.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We have a very high level of property ownership. In most circumstances where a principal private residence of a person is passed to a son or daughter tax does not apply because the threshold is £156,000, courtesy of the Minister this year, and the value of the normal family home does not go near that figure.  However, there are circumstances where the transfer is between a brother and sister and, in those circumstances, tax applies after £20,000. I accept that there are ways that one can make arrangements for such an event but very often the old and the not so aware do not put their affairs in order.</P>
      <P>If a farm is passing from a parent to a son or daughter the threshold of £156,000 could be doubled because the market value of the transfer would have to be obtained before the transaction is caught in the tax net.  However, if one takes a small shop in a country town, a pub or a business where a couple of people are employed, one does not have to have very much in one's favour at present to run up an asset value of £150,000.  To keep a small business together, so that the surviving brother or sister does not have to borrow unduly or dispose of part of the asset base of the business, is a different matter.  There is a case to be made for such transfers between brothers and sisters. It may be that, in asking that such a transaction should be treated in the same way as a transfer from a parent to children, I am moving too far, but I am prepared to accept any reasonable bid from the Minister.</P>

If the Revenue Commissioners continue as they are proceeding in giving the maximum possible information to the public, if they are prepared to enter into public controversy, to get involved in giving interviews to financial journalists so that their tax advice can be produced in the financial pages of newspapers like the article referred to by the Minister, they will be going part of the way.  If statements of practice are widely dispersed, if representatives of the Incorporated Law Society or local groups of family solicitors are fully briefed by the Revenue Commissioners through letter, brochure or in person, the news will get around and the local family solicitor will be properly briefed.  If that takes place there is a good chance that the information will be applied but there are a lot of &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; involved in that.

      <P>I was slightly amused to hear Deputy Noonan say that local family solicitors should be properly briefed on capital acquisitions tax.  There are not too many family solicitors who are in any way familiar with the complexities of the CAT system.  Is any consideration being given by the Department to dealing with the outlandish complexities into which the system has wound itself?  It has got totally out of hand.  I am not talking about yields or amounts &mdash; I generally agree with Deputy Rabbitte's comments on that issue &mdash; I am referring to the complexity of the system.  I wish to compliment the Revenue Commissioners in respect of two things: their officials are always extremely helpful and go out of their way to assist people in dealing with the complexities of the capital acquisitions tax system and they produced an excellent explanatory booklet on the subject. However, &ldquo;booklet&rdquo; is not the word to describe it because it is a book.  I do not know how many Deputies have seen it but it is a very complex text and not too many Deputies &mdash; let alone solicitors &mdash; would be able to fathom it without very considerable study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many critical dates in the system such as 1978, 1982 and 1984. There will now be a change in 1990 and it has gone out of control.  Any system of taxation &mdash; income or capital tax &mdash; should produce an adequate yield but it should also be fairly readily understood by ordinary people, especially by the people who have to pay it.  Simplicity &mdash; or even relative simplicity &mdash; is of great <Col N="2532" /> merit and the old amounts are still relevant when it comes to matters of aggregation going back to the late seventies and early eighties.  If the system is not revamped and brought up to date with new thresholds and critical dates it will become so hard to follow that it will be unworkable.  Indeed, it is fast approaching that already.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few comments.  Deputy Noonan said that his concerns might be eased if the Revenue Commissioners were more forthcoming with information in relation to capital acquisitions tax.  In this regard the Revenue Commissioners have conducted training seminars for approximately 2,000 solicitors, so the local family solicitor is fairly well up to date on this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputies have received clearcut information on a very cheap consultancy basis here tonight and I will impart more now. Deputy Noonan asked how the fact of leaving a business to a brother would be affected.  Instead of leaving the business to the surviving brother the owner could make a will leaving a life interest in the business to his brother.  The value of the business will depend on the brother's age. If he is around 65 years of age its value for tax purposes will be 0.6 per cent and if he is older it will be even less.  During his life the profits will accrue to him and, after his death, it would be desirable, to hold the business intact, to pass it on to a favourite nephew who will continue the business.  Of course the favourite nephew will be treated in the same way as a son or daughter and he would have the threshold of £156,000.  Practically all the tax would be eliminated in a small business.</P>

    <P>This is a long amendment but it is really a transcription of a section of the Schedule with a new threshold applying to all the different degrees of consanguinity. People might wonder about the basis of the figures.  The base here is 1978 and I have tried to take half the consumer price index from 1978 to the end of 1989 which works out at an inflation rate of slightly less than 40 per cent.  I do not think to fully index along the lines of the consumer price index would be appropriate because, when the section was drafted in 1978, there was an expectation that it would have a gradual effect and that the <Col N="2535" /> 1978 take was not the intended take of the policymakers at the time.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a property index would have inflated as rapidly as the consumer price index since 1978.  There were various rises and falls and for much of the eighties there was no movement in property and I doubt if the movement over the last two years &mdash; which has now plateaued &mdash; would be anywhere near the CPI level.  However, the Minister would have far better information in that regard than I have.</P>
    <P>The basis of the figures is half the CPI on the best information in that regard that I can find.  It runs slightly under 40 per cent, so that is purely the technical basis of the amendment.  A long time ago I found that simply pulling figures out of the air did not lend itself to making a good case and that there must be some basis to the figures.</P>
    <P>In the amendment, in paragraph (a) of the Schedule, I have slightly altered the original wording.  I have added a little bit at the end of paragraph (a) which says &ldquo;in respect of inheritance tax, a lineal ancestor limited to parents of disponer&rdquo;. I want to refer to the case where a transfer has taken place from father to son and, a short time later, the son is driving home and is killed in a car accident.  There have been circumstances in which this has happened and if it reverts to the parent the threshold of £20,000 &mdash; not the £156,000 &mdash; will apply.  In the lineal descent you get the benefit of the £156,000 but, if it reverts, a very serious problem can arise.  I do not think that the circumstances in which that would arise are very frequent but most Members know of cases where it happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to raise this matter this evening. After requesting permission to raise this matter last week I was approached by a number of Deputies on all sides who indicated that they have received complaints about this matter.  The reason I raise it this evening is that I wish to ask the Minister to make representations to the United States Government to have procedural matters looked into and see to it that United States law is reviewed.</P>
      <P>I very much regret having to raise this issue here as I have always felt that the United States have been reasonable towards Irish people in the past, although it should be said that Irish people have contributed a great deal to the development of the United States' economy down through the years.  I am amused when I hear criticism about the number of illegals in the United States at present. It should be remembered that many of these illegals are well educated young Irish people who have been educated at the Irish taxpayers' expense and who are contributing to the growth of the United States economy.  It is not the problem of this country if people are there illegally but rather the problem of the United States system which allows people to work without having the proper documentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening here is that because of the number of illegals in the States ordinary people seeking visitors' visas to the US for various reasons, weddings, funerals, holidays etc. are being treated rather harshly when they approach the US Embassy here for their visitors' visas. I would like to quote what is contained in some correspondence to me.  I will not <Col N="2541" /> disclose the names of individuals but this will give some idea of the type of thinking in the US Embassy at present as a result of obligations imposed on them by US law.</P>
    <P>As you are probably aware, under United States law, every non-immigrant visa applicant must overcome the burden of a statutory presumption that he or she is actually an immigrant. An applicant's intention to return to a permanent residence abroad generally is established by the demonstration of compelling family, social, economic and other ties in another country which will oblige the individual to return there after a temporary stay in the United States.  Since visitors to the US are not permitted to seek employment an applicant's economic position in another country as well as personal financial resources are important factors in determining whether an applicant has compelling economic ties abroad.</P>
    <P>Under these circumstances Miss X was unable to overcome the legal presumption that she is an immigrant. Therefore the Consular Officers have no choice but to find her ineligible for a visa.  Ineligibility under section 214b is not permanent and can be overcome by submission of additional evidence.... </P>
    <P>The United States always boasted of being the home of democracy and the bastion of the civil rights of ordinary individuals.  I understood that in any decent democracy the rule of law was that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  Under this section of US law a person is guilty until they prove they are innocent and I find this rather objectionable.</P>
    <P>I have another example:</P>
    <P>Miss X's application has been reviewed on several occasions.... Unfortunately she was unable to overcome previous findings of ineligibility under section 214 (b).  This lady is employed at a relatively low wage.  She has not been able to provide evidence <Col N="2542" /> that she has the personal financial resources to finance her proposed trip. </P>
    <P>The lady was going to a wedding.  I have here a copy of the wedding invitation, a copy of her bank statement, a letter from her employer saying that she is in a managerial position and is a very reliable individual, a copy of her passport and a letter from the family she was to stay with in the US quoting their telephone number and their address and accepting full responsibility for this lady.  The most important thing here was that her fiancé who had a better job in this country, was given a visa but she was not because they thought that she was not earning enough money.</P>
    <P>I would hate to think that any American visitor coming to this country on a holiday would be treated in the same fashion.  I have to say in defence of the officials here in the US Embassy that they claim they are applying US law and I do not think it would be fair of me to suggest that they are deliberately behaving in an irresponsible way.  The law is there and they have to apply it.  However, trying to get a visa is now like going into a court particularly for a young person with a reasonable job.  They have to prove all sorts of things and more and more Deputies are being approached by people outlining their circumstances and asking us to write to the US Embassy on their behalf.  I do not think that we, as elected public representatives, should have to make representations to the US Embassy so that somebody can get a visitor's visa. It is time the Minister made representations to the US so that Irish people seeking to visit the US for genuine reasons will be able to get their visitors' visas and return home here to their places of employment.</P>
    <P>I and my colleague who shares the office with me are aware of a number of such cases at present as are quite a number of other Deputies.  Irish people have done a great deal to build the US economy.  The Irish people there, unfortunately, are our loss.  I should like to see them return to this country to use the talents they have and the education we <Col N="2543" /> have given them to build the Irish economy. If they are in the US and working, they are contributing to the US economy, so we should not have to apologise for ourselves.  We should not tolerate a situation where Irish people are being discriminated against when seeking visitors' visas.  One can go over the Border to Fermanagh or Tyrone or over to London without going through any such hassle. American politicians go out of their way, when there is an election of course, to court the Irish vote.  Once the election is over, so far as I can see, the good wishes that are expressed towards Irish people disappear fairly rapidly, with the exception perhaps of a few instances.  It is time we appealed to those American politicians to see to it that Irish people are treated properly and that there is a review of this section 214 (b) of their law which says that a person is guilty until he proves himself innocent, so that Irish people can get their visa, go on their holiday or to a wedding without having to ask us to make representations on their behalf to get them visitors' visas.</P>
    <P>The lady I am speaking of here is genuinely going to a wedding.  Another girl was going on holidays and I have evidence here to show that she is coming back, including a letter from her employer.  Let me give one more example of how they are being treated.  The reply I got back dated 17 May is as follows:</P>
    <P>According to Miss X's application she returned to Ireland in April 1989 having spent the previous 12 months in London.  Although she claims to be living in Ireland she presents an employment letter from a company in London.  It was not clear whether she resides in the UK or in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have here a copy of correspondence that this lady sent to the US Embassy and it includes a letter from her employer which says she has been employed for the past two years in their Irish office.  The embassy people obviously did not read the correspondence.  They saw from the letterhead that this was a British company. I get a letter back from the embassy telling me that this is not clear <Col N="2544" /> because she has a letter from an employer who is in London, despite the fact that the letter says she has been working in their Irish office for the last two years and will be returning there.</P>
    <P>I really appreciate the Chair giving me the opportunity to raise this matter because I feel I am doing it not just on my behalf but on behalf of all the Members of this House who I understand have had occasion to deal with the same problem from time to time.  I again say that any time I telephoned the US Embassy I was treated with as much courtesy as one could expect so I have no quibble or complaints in that regard.  It is quite obvious, however, that because of this section 214 (b) of US law these people are being put under pressure in the embassy here to say that if things do not look right they will not give a visa and then people who want to get a visa have to go through all sorts of rigmaroles and approach public representatives to try to get their visitors' visas.  In some cases these unfortunate people are in danger of losing the deposits they have paid on airline tickets.  I appreciate that the Chair has been very liberal on time.  I thank the Minister of State for attending this evening.  While I appreciate that he is not directly involved I ask him, through his good offices, to make representations to see to it that Irish people are treated properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy's valid concerns led him to put down this motion tonight and provided the House with an opportunity to discuss this acute problem.  As Deputy Barrett has rightly stated, many other Members of the Oireachtas have expressed similar concerns and have given examples of similar cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs have in recent months received a number of representations from the public and from elected representatives regarding certain difficulties encountered in relation to visa applications made at the US Embassy.  Deputy Barrett is probably <Col N="2545" /> aware that a parliamentary question on this issue was answered in March of this year.  In his reply the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out that the US Embassy had indicated their willingness to deal directly with any complaints which individual Irish citizens may have about the attitude of personnel in the US Embassy and to have such complaints fully investigated.  On that occasion it was suggested in this House that the US Embassy should nominate a senior official to deal with complaints and representations. In fact, I understand that all written complaints are referred to the US Consul for his personal attention. Perhaps Deputies and Senators might note this provision and avail of it.</P>
    <P>I must point out, however, that the issue of visas &mdash; as Deputy Barrett quite rightly pointed out &mdash; by the US Embassy is entirely a matter for that embassy and that visa applications are dealt with by the embassy on the basis of US immigration law.  I have noted the extract from the legislation which Deputy Barrett quoted this evening.  I understand that US immigration law allows relatively little discretion to US consular officials and that the officials must have a legal basis for all decisions.  I have also taken on board his point that somebody in the North of Ireland with a British passport may automatically go on holiday to the US.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has asked for clarification as to whether there has been a change of policy, particularly in relation to certain classes of visas.  I would point out that the statutory basis for non-immigrant visas, to which I assume the Deputy is referring, has remained unchanged for many years.</P>
    <P>In summary, a Cheann Comhairle, I am aware of the complaints to which the Deputy and indeed others have referred, but can only stress again that the decision as to who should receive a US visa remains, in the final analysis, a matter for the United States authorities.  However, I assure the Deputy that I will put the very strong case he has made to the US consular officials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter here this evening.  The matter has already been discussed here a number of months ago. It was raised on a number of occasions by way of questions and during Private Members' time.  Unfortunately there is still a major crisis in the Land Registry which has been caused solely by Government cutbacks, in particular by the Government's early retirement scheme. The consequences have been the virtual collapse of the services offered by the Land Registry with enormous delays in house and land transactions.  In fact, the most recent information I could get is that the backlog of work now stands at 50,000 cases to be processed, the highest figure ever.  It has risen by 10,000 over the past number of months, an increase of almost a quarter on the previous year.</P>
      <P>The average delay in transferring a site is now two years.  Occasionally there are mapping difficulties and this arises particularly in rural Ireland.  There is an additional delay of about 20 months because a site transfer should take place within a four month period given normal working practice.  There are also 12,000 Land Commission vestings in arrears and it takes approximately 11 years to complete any such vesting.  The figures speak for themselves.  Urgent action needs to be taken if we are ever to come to grips with these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Department of Justice's own figures the Land Registry have lost 75 staff since 1986, which is approximately 17 per cent of the staff complement. There is provision in the 1990 Estimates for an additional 25 new staff and perhaps the Minister could outline if they have been taken on, and if not, why not?  Why is the provision for the 25 additional staff in the Estimate being offset by a cut of nearly 50 per cent in the overtime provision?  It is 17 months since the Land Registrar retired.  I believe a replacement has just been appointed.  Experienced staff are leaving in frustration and morale is at an all time low.  In fact there is a sense of desperation <Col N="2547" /> in the office at present.  Given the present staff complement and the systems in practice, there is no possibility of the staff getting to grips with the outstanding 50,000 cases and Land Commission vestings awaiting attention.</P>
    <P>Even if new staff were appointed tomorrow &mdash; and I would like the Minister to clarify the appointment of the proposed additional staff &mdash; it would take at least six months to perhaps one year before they would be competent to do the work of the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry have been seeking computerisation for a number of years but, to the best of my knowledge, only a very rudimentary system has been provided. Perhaps the Minister would outline the up-to-date position on computerisation of the system in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>One of the most ludicrous problems in the Land Registry is the fact that the Land Registry is more than capable of standing on its own feet.  This year the office is expected to contribute £10.3 million to the Exchequer through Land Registry fees and other sources of income.  This represents a profit in the region of £1 million to the Exchequer.  If I may anticipate the Minister's response for a moment, I think he is likely to inform us that he has provided extra resources for the Land Registry in this year's Estimate but I strongly urge him to look at the situation on the ground and to talk to the small and dedicated staff who, as things stand at present, will not be capable of resolving the enormous difficulties that exist under the present system.  Akin to what Deputy Barrett mentioned in relation to a very different problem is the fact that it is a well established common practice that 90 per cent of the times that solicitors contact the Land Registry they include in their letters to the client a request to make sure that they contact their local TD or public representative.  This, of course, contributes to the clogging up of work in the Land Registry by virtue of the number of telephone calls or future correspondence involved.  It is unfortunate <Col N="2548" /> that we have put ourselves into this position.  It would be of assistance to the clients who are paying, what I would say are exorbitant fees &mdash; even by today's standards they are expensive &mdash; for transactions in relation to the purchase or transfer of land.</P>
    <P>By today's standards the Land Registry is an expensive service in relation to the purchase of or dealings with land.  In 90 per cent of cases the dealings relate to the transfer of sites for houses.  This can be expensive and people are entitled to a better service.  Perhaps in the short-term the Minister will not be able to attend to the wider aspects of land registration but, in the long term, there should be a whole updating of land registration to the extent that the exchange of an ordinary semi-detached dwelling on a site which has been properly registered can be effected with the same efficiency as the taxation of a car.  There is no justification for having to go through so many procedures.  The work should be able to be done in the local registry office rather than clogging up the system as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>When this matter was raised in the House on 10 October last suggestions were made for reform of the Land Registry to the effect that it could operate more efficiently and effectively if it was not subject to the bureaucracy of the Department of Justice.  I would urge the Minister to reconsider that matter.  The Land Registry is capable of standing on its own feet.  It earns money for the State.  It should provide a basic service for which people pay and for which they should not have to wait years.  In many cases severe hardship is caused because loans cannot be processed until the title is in order.  On the last occasion this matter was raised, I recollect that the Minister for Justice did not demur unduly at the proposition that responsibility for the Land Registry should be taken from the Department of Justice, a case which has been made for many years.  As we have seen in recent months the Department of Justice have their hands full dealing with many other matters.  I urge the Minister this evening to take immediate action to provide a <Col N="2549" /> basic service for which people are paying and to which they are entitled.  I hope we do not have to come back here again in six or seven months' time seeking an improvement in the service.  I suggest to the Minister that the target for the year's end should be to reduce those dealings to 20,000 or 25,000, which would be a welcome achievement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept fully the Deputy's concern.  He will be aware, as I am, that the concerns of the Department of Justice about this issue did not arise for the first time in 1989 or 1990; they go back more years than either of us would like to remember. We have debated this issue in the House and a motion on the matter was tabled by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on 14-15 November last.  I do not propose to dwell at length on the general position in the Land Registry.  I am glad, however, to have the opportunity of outlining to the House the steps I have already taken to remedy some of the problems in the registry that have been raised by Deputy Spring and to improve the service being provided.  I indicated in the House during the course of the debate on the Private Members' motion on 14 November last that I am very concerned that the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds should provide an efficient and cost-effective service to all who use them.  I expressed my concern at the level of delays being experienced by members of the public and by the legal profession in dealing with the registries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic upturn in recent years and the consequent increase in the number of property transactions in the State have placed considerable pressure on these offices.  Briefly I will give some indication of the additional workload involved and perhaps it might be helpful if I mention some figures.  The total number of applications annually exceeds 250,000 and this has increased steadily since 1985.  Dealing applications, which comprise the bulk of the Land Registry work, increased by 18.7 per cent in 1989 compared with 1988 and the overall volume of the main categories of work <Col N="2550" /> lodged in the Land Registry in 1989 show an increase of 4 per cent when compared with 1988.</P>
    <P>Shortly after taking office I initiated a general review of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds.  I visited the registry offices on two occasions and had discussions with the management and staff with a view to gaining a first-hand understanding of the office and the problems being experienced there.  While I have not yet fully completed the review, I have taken some steps which I hope will bring about some definite improvements in the service.  Firstly, the Government have agreed to provide money in 1990 for an additional 35 staff, 13 of whom have already been recruited and have taken up duty, and every effort is being made to have the remaining staff recruited as quickly as possible.  As a short-term measure, because I was very conscious of the backlog of case work currently in the Land Registry, some senior staff have been diverted from other work to help deal with cases where the worst delays are occurring.  These measures, together with the appointment of additional staff, should make a substantial impact on the arrears.  I accept fully what Deputy Spring says, that the position regarding arrears is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Deputies will of course be aware that there has been a vacancy in the post of Registrar of Deeds and Title for some time.  I am glad to say that a registrar was appointed by the Government about a month ago.  In addition, I obtained agreement from the Minister for Finance for the appointment of a number of staff at senior level whom I hope to have appointed within a matter of weeks. These measures should considerably enhance the management structure, which is very important, in the Land Registry.  I am also pleased to be able to inform the House that the Government have acceded to my request for a greater investment in computerisation, a matter which was highlighted by Deputy Spring. In 1990 in this area alone there will be an increase in expenditure of the order of 32 per cent over 1989.  A programme of computerisation of the abstracts in the <Col N="2551" /> Registry of Deeds will start this year and, when completed, this system will provide for immediate access and fast, accurate search facilities.  The computerisation programme in the registry which is already well under way will be extended considerably in future years.  On the matter of computerisation, I am considering a number of alternatives to the computerisation that is being carried out within the registry because I believe that is the only way forward in the longer term.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with the newly appointed registrar during which I expressed my concern about the delays being experienced in dealings with the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds. I have asked for an assessment of the additional steps that need to be taken to relieve the arrears situation and to provide an efficient and speedy service to the registry.  I am expecting that response very shortly from the new lady registrar. I can assure the House, subject to adequate finance being provided for which I will fight very hard as Minister for Justice, that I will do everything I possibly can to improve the unacceptable level of delays in the Land Registry.</P>

As I have said, I am waiting for the registrar, who was appointed only about a month ago, to come back to me with her ideas as to the way forward.  Her views together with my observations and the proposals which I have in mind in relation to computerisation will point the way forward.  I accept fully the concerns expressed by all Members of the House last November in Questions and again by Deputy Spring tonight in relation to the unacceptable level of delays in the Land Registry.  I hope that, with the new registrar and the expanded management team, we can come to grips with the problem in the registry.</P>

Indeed, over the past two years the Government have increased the council's grant-in-aid by 80 per cent so as to strengthen their work in this area.  These additional resources have not only copperfastened existing services but have enabled the council to introduce a new innovative programme aimed specifically at developing the capacity of our firms to meet overseas competition on the domestic market.

      <P>I would have to point out that both of these factors are subject to variation and that the macro-economic assumptions in particular may not necessarily coincide with Government forecasts or indeed, with projections put forward by other economic forecasting organisations in relation to growth, inflation, interest rates or corporate profitability.</P>

      <P>So far as the Dublin region is concerned, I am satisfied that the Government's general policies of restoring order to the public finances, introducing pro-employment tax reform and selectively targeting State aid to encourage the development of a competitive, export driven industrial sector will succeed in reducing the present high levels of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 47 together.  I understand from the director that he has undertaken an investigation into aspects of the operation of the national lottery under section 14 of the Restrictive Practices Acts, 1972 and 1987.  Following the investigation he formed the view that the requirement by the national lottery that retailers who act as agents for them may not act as agents for any other lottery constitutes an unfair practice as defined in the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>He communicated his opinion to the company and asked them to take such steps as would be necessary to remove or amend their exclusive agency rule and effects.  The company did not agree with the director's view and indicated that they would not take the action requested of them.</P>
      <P>The director has not submitted a formal report to me and is not required to do so.  However, he has, as a matter of courtesy, informed me of his investigation and actions to date.</P>
      <P>The director has advised me that he is considering what further action might be available to him.</P>
      <P>For the present I await the decision of the director on the option he chooses.  He will no doubt give consideration to the various options open to him, including, <i>inter alia,</i> the provisions of section 8 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1987.</P>
      <P>Finally, I must make it clear that the forming of an opinion by the director that a practice is undesirable and anti-competitive does not of itself mean that the continuation of the action complained of is in breach of Irish law, as it now stands.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out in reply to Question No. 1 on 22 March 1990, (Vol. 397, No. 4: Cols. 947-949), these moneys represent the first direct Exchequer subvention to the association for over 20 years.  As I also indicated on that occasion, in the past two years the Minister for Health provided the association with funding from the national lottery which, in turn, assisted them in securing substantial funding from the European Commission.</P>

    <P>There is easy access to the ground floor.  However, there is no lift to the first floor.  </P>
    <P>National Gallery</P>
    <P>There are 14 different levels in the National Gallery which pose obvious problems from the point of view of access.  Two thirds of the exhibition space in the gallery is accessible to those in wheelchairs at present.  Plans are in train to adapt the entrance portico with a specially constructed ramp to facilitate disabled access.  As part of the £5 million refurbishment scheme, which is due to commence shortly, provision is being made to increase access and to provide appropriate facilities, such as access to toilets.</P>
    <P>National Archives</P>
    <P>Access to the reading room in the head office at the Four Courts is difficult as members of the public must pass up a flight of four steps at the front door. There is a small reading room in the State paper office which is on the first floor so that members of the public must climb a flight of steps to get to it.  The National Archives is being provided with a new head office in Bishop Street where the principal reading room will be relocated; it already has satisfactory access by ramps and lifts.  The present reading room in the State paper office will be closed.</P>

      <P>In February 1990, applications were invited from females wishing to enlist in the Permanent Defence Force.  It was indicated that successful candidates would be employed in a variety of appointments such as drivers, clerks, grooms in the Army Equitation School and military policewomen.  A substantial number of candidates who applied had equestrian experience and expressed a preference to be employed as grooms in the Equitation School.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is proposed to assign nine of the 30 recruits to fill existing vacancies for grooms in the Equitation School.</P>
      <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force is kept under constant review in the light of current requirements and the overall budgetary situation. It is not possible at this stage to state when the next intake of female recruits will take place.</P>

      <P>The case to which the Deputy refers is that of an Irish citizen who was arrested in Canada in 1984 on a charge of killing a Canadian citizen.  He stood trial in June 1985, was found guilty of first degree murder and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.  He has since appealed his case, through the Canadian judicial appeals system, but without success. He is currently seeking a review of his case by the Minister for Justice of Canada under the terms of the Canadian legal code.</P>
      <P>The Irish Embassy at Ottawa has been monitoring this case since the arrest of the citizen in question and has maintained contact with him and his legal representatives throughout the period.  The Embassy, at the citizen's request, has made representations to the appropriate Canadian authorities regarding aspects of his prison conditions.  In addition, an officer of the embassy attended the appeal court hearing of the case last May.</P>
      <P>The Embassy will continue to stay in contact with the citizen in question and offer him appropriate consular assistance and advice.  I do not think, however, that it would be appropriate for me to comment on the evidence presented to the courts in Canada in this case.</P>

      <P>The ongoing rationalisation of the State's office accommodation needs involves the surrender of leasehold interests, including a large number of car parking facilities, in certain Dublin properties. This has created a need to provide <Col N="2295" /> replacement car-parking facilities, particularly for staff required to use their private cars in the course of their official duties.  As an alternative to the expenditure of substantial sums on renting privately owned car parking facilities, areas of State owned property such as the plot of ground to the rear of 17-19 Harcourt Terrace, where the required car parking facilities might be provided, were examined.</P>
      <P>While no process of consultation was statutorily required, the Office of Public Works approached the adjoining residents to advise them of proposed developments.  These include the replacement of a number of existing sycamores by semi mature trees around the perimeter walls.  The maximum number of other existing sycamores consistent with the use of the area as a car park will be retained.</P>
      <P>Consultations are in progress with Dublin Corporation and the Minister for State at the Department of the Environment. The Minister for Energy has not been consulted.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to an 11 year delay in the provision of an extension to Drumcliffe Graveyard, Sligo, because of the insistence of the Office of Public Works on an archaeological excavation of the 1.8 acres of land acquired by Sligo County Council for this purpose; that the Office of Public Works will not provide the funds for the excavation work it is demanding; that the county council does not have the money to fund the excavation itself; and the action he proposes to take to solve the problem arising out of the demands of the Office of Public Works which, after 11 years, results in the present situation where there is no extension to the graveyard and no archaeological excavation in progress or planned.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that the area for the proposed extension to the graveyard, adjacent to the Church of Ireland church at Drumcliffe, County Sligo, is part of a very important ancient monastic site founded by St. Columcille in the 6th century.</P>
      <P>Accordingly no ground disturbance can be carried out there without prior archaeological investigation.  It is the statutory responsibility of Sligo County Council, under the National Monuments Acts, to protect the archaeology of sites in its ownership.</P>
      <P>In 1980 the county council engaged an archaeologist to carry out exploratory excavations, as a result of which a full excavation of the graveyard areas was deemed necessary.  The Commissioners of Public Works agreed to make a contribution and paid the archaeologist approximately £45,000.  A further £4,600 will be payable on the post excavation aspect.</P>
      <P>The commissioners notified the council, on a drawing, of the part of the site which had been archaeologically cleared for burials as a result of the excavation carried out.</P>
      <P>They have further advised the council that an alternative site should be found for the graveyard in view of the rich archaeological potential of the Drumcliffe site and the expenses which would be involved in excavating the remaining portions of it.  This still remains their view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 106, 107 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>Since January 1989, 19 cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy have been confirmed.  Five were imported animals and investigations into the remainder suggest an association with imported meat and bonemeal.  The disease was made notifiable with effect from 1 April 1989 and affected or suspected animals are slaughtered immediately and their carcases destroyed.  Routine monitoring is carried out at our meat plants and suspected cases are referred for diagnosis. In all instances, that diagnosis has yielded negative results.  My Department have also purchased the progeny of affected dams.  This is simply a precautionary measure as there is no evidence that the disease is transmitted from animal to offspring.</P>
      <P>The BSE situations in the UK and Ireland are not comparable.  There have been 19 cases here out of a total cattle population of seven million as opposed to over 13,000 in a British cattle population of 12 million.  These figures indicate that the UK has an indigenous source of the disease whereas we do not.  This is reflected in the fact that while the EC has imposed restrictions on the export of cattle from the UK, similar action has not been deemed necessary in the case of our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor developments closely.  The research undertaken in the UK links it to the Scrapie problem in their sheep population and its possible onward transmission through infected meat and bonemeal.  The absence of a sheep Scrapie problem here, together with the use of different rendering practices, and a prohibition on their import of meat and bonemeal from the UK, provide us with safeguards against this possible source of infection and as a result it has not been considered <Col N="2307" /> necessary to restrict the feeding of home produced meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>The question of trade with the UK in live animals and animal products is governed by EC legislation.  In this connection the export of live cattle from the UK, subject to certain exceptions, has been banned since July, 1989 and the export of beef offal has been similarly banned since March, 1990.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to allay any possible public health concerns.  There is no evidence whatsoever that BSE is transmissible to humans.  I am satisfied that the measures which we have taken here such as the destruction of affected animals, the purchase of their progeny and the routine monitoring at our meat plants guard against any possible risk.</P>

      <Quest>the efforts which have been made to establish new markets for Irish produced goods in Eastern Germany, having regard to the political changes that have taken place in that region in the past six months; if new markets have already been established or if consideration has been given to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Total Irish trade with East Germany in 1989 amounted to only IR£13.2 million, of which Irish exports accounted for IR£4.4 million.  In common with the other countries of Central and East Europe, East Germany has been a difficult market for Irish exporters.  Lack of convertible currency has been a particular problem.</P>
      <P>The advent of German unification, however, should greatly improve opportunities for Irish exporters.  The prospect of developing trade, based on a hard currency with which the punt has already enjoyed a stable exchange rate over several years, is both real and significant. With Irish exports to West Germany amounting to IR£1.6 billion in 1989 and based on estimates made by the Federal Ministry of Economics in Bonn that the East German economy is about one-tenth the size of West Germany, the potential for profitable and sustained market expansion, following on unification is clear.  In this respect, however, the shape of whatever transitional arrangements are worked out for German unification, particularly in the trade area, will be an important influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, CTT have, through their <Col N="2314" /> Dusseldorf office, stepped up their monitoring of the East German region.  At this stage, the organisation feel that Irish exporters' best approach to that region is through existing West German distributors or business partners.</P>

      <P>Media 92 is a programme of action of the European Commission. In implementing it, the Commission deals directly with distributors and producers in each member state.  We expect Ireland to get its full share of resources available.  We have already benefited by the location here, in the Irish Film Institute, of the EVE project under Media 92.</P>
      <P>The Council of Ministers responsible for cultural affairs met on 18 May, 1990 under the chairmanship of Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  An <i>ad hoc</i> group to advance this programme beyond the pilot stage has now been established under the Irish Presidency. As a result of this development, it is now expected that the full programme will commence later this year.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is very detailed and, in the absence of detailed price control measures and price monitoring arrangements, is not readily available in my Department.  My Department, however, has been in touch with both the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Finance for information on the consumer price index and VAT and excise duty rates, respectively.  The information, as supplied, is set out in the tabular statements which are being circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to note that <Col N="2316" /> when the National Prices Commission was in operation, it produced monthly reports, which, <i>inter alia,</i> included information on specific drink price increases. These reports were presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In general, however, it can be said that increases in prices from 1975 to 1985 inclusive would have been sanctioned.</P>

      <P>My Department is accommodated in nine separate offices. The following four offices do not have independent access for wheelchair users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Patents and Trade Marks Office, 44/45 Merrion Square: this office grant patents and register trade marks and is mainly used by professional agents rather than members of the public.  The building <Col N="2320" /> is an old Georgian house, the design of which makes it difficult to modify for improved access.</P>
    <P>The Patents and Trade Marks Office, Holbrook House, Holles Street: this section of the Patents Office does not receive visits from the public.  As my Department is not the main tenant in Holbrook House, I would not, therefore, be in a position to comment on the feasibility of improving access.</P>
    <P>The offices of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, 13 Hume Street: this office has statutory powers and functions relating to the registration, general regulation and supervision of co-operative societies, credit unions, friendly societies and trade unions.  The office is visited to a greater extent by professionals than by members of the public; 13 Hume Street is also an old Georgian building which offers little scope for modification.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission, 50 Upper Mount Street: the Commission investigates possible unfair trading practices in the supply and distribution of goods and in the provision of services.  While 50 Upper Mount Street is another Georgian building which cannot be modified, the staff of the Commission are due to transfer in the near future to modern accommodation which will have suitable facilities for wheelchair users.</P>

      <P>Under current legislative provisions an application for family income supplement must be made by the claimant, i.e. the employed person, before payment of the supplement can be made. Where the claimant is unable to make the application on his/her own behalf, however, it is possible, as in the case of other social welfare payments, to appoint some other person to apply on behalf of such a claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person entitled to a social welfare payment may also nominate his spouse to receive the payment on his behalf. I have been concerned for some time, however, about the position of families dependent on social welfare payments where the claimant does not provide the <Col N="2324" /> spouse with sufficient money for ordinary household expenditure because of personal problems such as gambling, alcoholism or drug addiction.  Under the `separate payments' arrangements the adult and child dependant portions of the payment may be paid directly to the dependent spouse of the claimant.  I will shortly be introducing arrangements which will enable a greater proportion of the overall social welfare payment to be made to the dependent spouse in these circumstances.  In this context, I am also examining the possibility of paying a portion of the overall FIS payment directly to the spouse.</P>

      <P>An injury benefit claim made by the person concerned was disallowed by a deciding officer on 9 November 1989 because inquiries by a social welfare officer had not established that an occupational accident had happened as claimed.  The claimant appealed against the decision on 28 November and the appeal was duly referred to the appeals office which requested that further inquiries be made.</P>
      <P>These inquiries have now been completed and the appeals office has stated that it will hold an oral hearing of the case, probably during the week commencing 4 June.  The appellant will be notified of time and venue of the hearing as soon as the arrangements are made.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was originally awarded an old age non-contributory pension in December 1983.</P>
      <P>Following a review of his means it was decided in September 1989 that he was no longer entitled to pension as his means exceeded the statutory limit of £54.00 per week.</P>
      <P>In October 1989 an appeal was lodged in which he cited the transfer of his land to his son as the basis of his appeal.  No copy of the deed of transfer was supplied and this was requested to enable the appeals officer to finalise his deliberations.</P>
      <P>The deed of transfer was made available to the Department in early May 1990 and as a result a social welfare officer was asked to reassess the means of the person concerned.  On completion of the necessary inquiries his case will be reviewed and he will be advised of the outcome.</P>

      <P>Arising from contentions raised by the two persons concerned in connection with their appeals, it was necessary to refer their cases to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.  These inquiries, which proved to be protracted, have just been completed and their appeals have been referred to an appeals officer for determination.  Following an examination of the papers in the cases the <Col N="2327" /> appeals officer has decided to hold oral hearings to allow each claimant a full opportunity to present his case in person. It is expected that these hearings will be heard in early June.</P>

The person concerned was qualified when he reached 66 years of age and is, therefore, entitled to dental benefit under the treatment benefits scheme.</P>
      <P>Previous dental claims received from the person concerned were approved, and appropriate payments made to the dentists concerned.  The most recent claim was received in June 1989.</P>

      <P>In each of the years 1988, 1989 and 1990 the Government allocated £750,000 to my Department from national lottery funds for once-off grants to projects being undertaken by voluntary organisations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In addition, in 1989, an allocation of £50,000 was made available for a special pilot scheme, known as the voluntary work option, to assist voluntary organisations providing opportunities for unemployed people to become involved in their activities.</P>
      <P>Details of projects funded in Dublin city and county which have so far been funded from these funds are set out in the attached tabular statement.</P>
      <P>In 1988 a sum of £100,000 was allocated to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to enable the society to undertake a major programme of personal development and home management courses around the country.  Over 5,000 families were catered for in these courses which provided practical advice and assistance to people with whom the society are in contact. A further sum of £100,000 was provided towards the setting up of a loan guarantee fund to assist people who are in debt to moneylenders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>An underlying principle of the social insurance scheme is that, to establish entitlement to benefit, persons must have been insurably employed and paid appropriate rates of PRSI for a certain length of time.  The requirement in the case of treatment benefits, for persons aged 23 years, or over, is a minimum of 208 weeks.</P>
      <P>However, recognising that younger claimants may only recently have entered insurable employment, an exemption is made for persons under 23 years of age. Such persons can qualify for benefit after only 39 weeks of insurable employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed dental benefit on 23 March 1990.  She had reached 23 years of age before that date and, as she only had 79 reckonable PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurance, her claim could not be approved.</P>

      <P>In so far as the offices used by the headquarters of my Department are concerned, purpose built facilities of the kind in question are available in all cases except at the offices at 72/76 St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2.  Here, however, wheelchair access can be gained via the car park.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other offices and buildings throughout the country the use of which comes within my Department's area of responsibility, for example, Garda stations, courthouses, prisons and places of detention, but the compilation of the information sought in relation to all these buildings would involve a disproportionate amount of staff resources which could not be justified. It is the policy, however, to make provision for access facilities for disabled persons, so far as this is feasible, and this is borne in mind particularly where new premises are being acquired and when new office building or major refurbishment of existing premises is being undertaken.</P>

A Garda motorcycle is provided for the station party there to enable them to patrol and service outlying areas and the service they provide is supplemented as necessary by mobile patrols operating from the divisional headquarters at Portlaoise. These arrangements will continue to be kept under review in the light of changing needs and circumstances.</P>

      <P>Radio communications systems are not secure systems.  By their nature they are susceptible to interference or being overheard by accident or deliberately at any time.  Most radio communication system users are &mdash; and all should be &mdash; aware of this and bear it in mind when using such systems.</P>
      <P>Devices designed to receive or overhear signals &mdash; which can have legitimate use &mdash; are most unlikely to cause interference or interruption to radio communication transmissions.</P>
      <P>Under section 11 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, it is an offence to improperly divulge the contents of radio transmissions.  The maximum penalty on summary conviction for an offence under this section is £1,000 or six months imprisonment or both and on conviction on indictment, a fine, of £20,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months or both.</P>

    <P>Listening into or divulging the contents of any telecommunications message transmitted by Telecom Éireann &mdash; e.g. on Eircell &mdash; without the agreement of the person on whose behalf the message is transmitted is an offence under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  The maximum penalty on summary conviction is a fine of £800 or 12 months imprisonment or both and on conviction on indictment, a fine of <Col N="2345" /> £50,000 or five years imprisonment or both.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that approximately 80 per cent of the world's cars are in OECD countries; if the rest of the world achieves comparable levels of car ownership, emissions of CO2 from transport would increase at least four-fold and twice this amount again if the world's population doubles; and the steps he has taken within the EC to deal with this problem.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that a worldwide growth in car ownership could give rise to an increase in CO2 and, indeed other vehicle emissions.  At EC level, standards for various vehicle exhaust emissions have been progressively tightened up, on an optional basis, by way of various directives.  The <Col N="2346" /> most recent directive (89/458/EEC of 18 July 1989), which applies to new cars with engines below 1.4 litres capacity, imposes on a mandatory basis very strict US style emission standards.  In relation to CO2 emissions, this directive commits the Council to decide on measures to limit CO2 emissions from motor vehicles on the basis of proposals to be prepared by the European Commission.  At the March meeting of the Council of Environment Ministers, at which I presided, the Commission indicated that it would have those proposals ready for submission to Council early in 1991.</P>
      <P>A consolidated draft directive, which aims to extend the requirements of Directive 89/458/EEC to cover all new cars, was submitted by the Commission in February 1990 and was the subject of an initial policy debate at the Council meeting in March.  I intend that the directive will be brought before the Environment Council again at its next meeting on 7-8 June with a view to agreement on a common position.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 26 April 1990 to Question No. 79 regarding proper effluent management practices and environmentally acceptable disposal methods for pig slurry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions on environmentally acceptable spreading rates for slurry depend on many factors including soil type, hydrogeology, land slope, climate and soil moisture deficit.  Accordingly, it is not possible to determine a single spreading <Col N="2354" /> rate which would be appropriate for the entire country.  Similarly, there may be conditions under which spreading at rates above those recommended by Teagasc could be undertaken without damage to the environment.</P>
    <P>The Teagasc recommendations are intended as general guidelines.  Farmers would be well advised not to exceed them unless there are good grounds for believing that pollution will not result.</P>
    <P>Should water pollution occur because of excessive slurry spreading, or spreading when ground of weather conditions are unsuitable, the person responsible would be liable to prosecution under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.</P>

      <P>There are no regulations under the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, relating specifically to the matters referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1986 Act, dogs generally are required to be licensed, and to be kept <Col N="2356" /> under effectual control.  The need for effective enforcement of the relevant provisions has repeatedly been brought to the attention of the local authorities concerned.  The 1986 Act also introduced new provisions about the liability of dog owners for injury or damage done by a dog and provisions under which the District Court order dangerous dogs to be kept under proper control or destroyed. The special problem of guard dogs was dealt with in the Control of Dogs Act, 1986 (Guard Dogs) Regulations, 1988.</P>
    <P>The question of what further measures may be necessary for the control of dogs, either generally or with respect to particular categories, is being kept under review.  However, since the reported incidents of attacks by dogs seem generally to involve breaches of the existing law, it may be that progress could be better achieved by more effective enforcement of existing provisions than by adding new requirements.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 101 of 14 February <Col N="2358" /> 1990, in relation to local authority housing. Since then formal proposals for the provision of four houses at Navan have been received in my Department.</P>
      <P>The submission of additional reports and documentation from the county council is awaited in relation to a number of water and sewerage schemes.  Tenders from the Kells-Oldcastle water supply scheme were received in my Department on 6 February 1990 and approved on 13 March 1990.  Contract documents for the East Meath regional water supply scheme were received on 20 June 1988 and approved on 15 February 1990.  Both of these schemes will provide a guaranteed supply of good quality water to their respective areas and are intended to go to construction in the current year.</P>
      <P>Details of the road grants available for payment to Meath County Council in 1990 are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Draft contract documents for item 1 (b) were received in my Department on 21 May 1990 and are presently being considered. Items 1 (c), 1 (d), 1 (f) and 1 (g) are ongoing schemes which were approved in previous years.  Item 3 (b) does not require the submission of documentation. Proposals for expenditure of the remaining grants are awaited from the local authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received representations on behalf of the Irish Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society concerning the need for a <Col N="2366" /> stillbirth register.  Under existing legislation the registration of births by the Registrar General is confined to live births only.  I have asked my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy to conduct a review of the legislation governing births, deaths and marriages. The question of the registration of stillbirths will be considered as part of this extensive review.  The establishment of a stillbirth register is a development I would support, particularly in terms of the solace it may provide to grieving parents.  The manner of its implementation and the amending legislation which may be required will require careful consideration. In the meantime, I have asked my Department to examine whether it would be possible to devise some interim arrangement which would be of assistance to parents until the necessary legislative changes have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the tremendous interest that has been generated in the adoption of children from Romania and I share the Deputy's concern that the matter be approached with caution and sensitivity.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in Irish law to prevent Irish people going abroad to adopt.  The first essential for persons wishing to adopt from abroad is to satisfy the requirements of the foreign country.  While adoption law varies from country to country, most countries require a home study report i.e. an assessment of the prospective adopters suitability undertaken by an appropriate agency in their home country.  I understand that the Romanian authorities require such reports.</P>
      <P>While the registered adoption societies and health boards undertake assessments of persons wishing to adopt in Ireland, they have no specific role in adoptions outside the State.  It is a matter for each adoption society to decide whether to undertake home study reports for foreign adoptions as there is no obligation on them to do so.  I understand that some of the societies have decided not to become involved in this work.  As regards the health boards, there is a question mark over their authority to deal with foreign adoptions but, in any event, their social work staffs have a heavy workload already and they could not take on additional work in this area.</P>
      <P>Where, however, an adoption society decides to undertake home study reports for foreign adoptions, the adoption board expects that the standard of assessment would be the same as if the persons were being considered for the adoption of an Irish child.  The board is concerned to ensure that foreign children are not regarded as second class children and has made the point that they require adoptive parents with skills and qualities above the ordinary.  I have to say that I agree entirely with the adoption board on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Department of Justice that the position with regard to <Col N="2369" /> bringing a child into the State is that a child under the age of 16 years adopted abroad by Irish citizens does not require a visa to enter the State and would in the ordinary way be admitted provided he/she is travelling in the company of his/her adoptive parents and the parents are in possession of the foreign adoption papers and a passport in respect of the child for presentation to the immigration officer at the port of entry.</P>
    <P>On arrival home, there is no requirement under Irish law that the child be adopted here.  However, some foreign countries attach a condition to that effect to their adoption decree.  In other cases, the adopters themselves seek to have the child adopted under domestic law so as to avoid any future difficulties about their parental rights in relation to the child. This is because there is no statutory procedure yet in place here for the recognition of adoption orders made abroad. I am advised that an adoption order made abroad is entitled to recognition here only if the adopters were domiciled in the foreign country at the time the order was made.  This would not be the situation in relation to Irish people going abroad to Romania or elsewhere for the sole purpose of adoption.</P>
    <P>Where an application is made to adopt under Irish legislation, the adoption board must process the application in accordance with the usual requirements of the Adoption Acts.  The same consent procedures apply irrespective of the nationality of the child.  The natural mother or guardian of the child must give consent to the making of an adoption order under Irish law in the prescribed form and must also complete a questionnaire with a person authorised by the adoption board.</P>
    <P>The question of the child's eligibility for adoption under Irish law may also arise.  Generally, a child may only be adopted here if he/she is an orphan or was born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>The adoption of children outside these categories is governed by the Adoption Acts, 1988.  This permits in limited circumstances the adoption of children whose parents are deemed by the courts <Col N="2370" /> to have failed in their constitutional duty to care for them.  It appears from reports that some of the children being offered for adoption in Romania are neither orphans nor were they born outside marriage. It is uncertain whether such children can be adopted under the 1988 Act and the question will not be clarified until it comes before the courts for decision in a particular case.</P>
    <P>I hope that this clarifies the position for the Deputy and I would urge persons thinking of adopting abroad to carefully consider the life-long implications for themselves and the children involved before entering into any firm arrangements.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to convert and <Col N="2380" /> renovate the convent buildings at Mountmellick to accommodate the proposed new community school there.  No new buildings are required.</P>
      <P>Arising from a recent review of the projected pupil numbers, it is necessary to revise the existing architectural plans. The accommodation to be provided for the revised pupil numbers will comprise a full range of facilities for the courses to be conducted in the new school.  My Department has arranged a meeting with its design team to consider the revisions to be made.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at this stage to indicate precisely when building work will commence on the site but it is my intention to ensure that there is no undue delay with the project.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that as regards railway stations and similar areas maintained by the State bodies involved in the provision of transport services, real improvements in access for mobility handicapped persons are already being introduced in line with the priorities established by a special interdepartmental committee which is chaired by my Department.

      <P>The only offices used by the Department of Tourism and Transport in Dublin city which are not accessible to wheelchair users, because of the lack of a ramp or lift from ground level, are those in Scotch House, Hawkins Street, Dublin 2, which houses staff dealing with air traffic, engineering and aviation and marine communications services, and the corporate affairs of the Air Navigation Services Office.</P>
      <P>The question of improving the accessibility of Scotch House is a complex one, because of the particular location and structure of the building, and is currently being addressed in the light of usage of the building.</P>
      <P>With the exception of premises used by the Meteorological Service at Dublin and Cork Airports and by the Air Navigation Services Offices at Cork Airport, other specially equipped premises used by the Meteorological Service and by the Air Navigation Services Office at airports and elsewhere do not allow wheelchair access via ramp or lift.  By virtue of the particular requirements of the services being provided there, no need has arisen or is foreseen for the provision of access to wheelchair users.  In fact, none of the Department's total staff of about 950 is a wheelchair user.</P>

      <P>with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 232, 233 and 234 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that public expenditure on roads and car parks does not fall within my direct area of responsibility. I understand, however, that details of public expenditure on roads (including car parks) from 1960 to 1986 are published in the annual Central Statistics Office publication &ldquo;Ireland: Statistical Extract&rdquo;.  Expenditure in 1987 and 1988 totalled £283 million and £265 million (provisional outturn) respectively.  Final returns for 1989 are not available.  The question of the taxation of company cars is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Cumulative State support for essential public transport services between 1960 and 1989 amounted to £1,284,948,000.  In the same period, the real increase in CIE fares has been of the order of 2.6 per cent.  Information is not readily available on trends in the real costs of motoring to the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by CIE that between 1960 and 1989 rail and road public transport use as measured by passenger kilometres increased by 115 per cent and 46 <Col N="2384" /> per cent respectively.  I am advised that official statistics are not compiled in respect of bicycle use.</P>
