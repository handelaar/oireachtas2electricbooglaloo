      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Taoiseach if he would arrange to make some time available this week, or perhaps next week, to allow this House consider the implications of the GATT talks going on at present and the difficulties which now appear to be arising? I would remind you, Sir, that over a period of several months, we on this side of the House have been trying to have that issue debated in the House because of the important implications for the agriculture and textile industries.  I find it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a Private Members' motion on the Government's economic performance and the Deputy will have an opportunity to talk about it on that motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it has far-reaching implications for trade and the economy. It has more to do with the Government's non-performance than with their performance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I refer to a matter which we briefly discussed last week, namely, Anglo-Irish affairs?  Even though statement were made last week, I refer the Taoiseach to a request I made many months ago relating to the possibility of a private briefing for the leaders of the Opposition parties.  This is all the more necessary now, given that it appears the talks about talks and arrangements have broken down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your advice but I ask the Taoiseach, again, given that we <Col N="751" /> will not have an opportunity to discuss it in the House, to indicate, if he would brief the leaders of the Opposition parties on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has made his point.  It is strictly not in order now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be constructive. I think this would be of help.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he or a member of the Government will take time in the House to advise us of what progress has been made with regard to the securing of the release of Brian Keenan?  This is a matter we are all concerned about and, if possible, we should be advised as early as possible of developments in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to rule out the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing particular to add to what the Deputy already knows except that we are still hoping for a satisfactory outcome.  We are making appropriate preparations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters. First, I seek permission to raise on the Adjournment the failure of the Government to respond to the report of the Law Reform Commission on foreign adoptions.  The second matter I seek your assistance on relates to priority questions for today.  I had a letter delivered to your office which you may not have seen yet as it was only delivered a few minutes prior to the taking of the Order of Business. I sought in a priority question to ask the Minister for the Environment to explain the reason the European Environment Agency was not established during the course of the Presidency.  I should say that in the past the Minister has responded to a number of questions on the European Environment Agency. I received a letter this morning stating <Col N="752" /> the Minister for the Environment had transferred that question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I received your communication as I was walking into the Chamber this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I was unable to have a look at it.  In any event, the matter to which you refer is outside my control.  I have no control over the transfer of questions.  If the Deputy requires any further elucidation, my office will be glad to assist him in the matter but it may not be raised now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, apparently, has not objected to Question No. 64 on the Order Paper which also relates to an environmental protection agency.  The only point I wish to make is that I presume no objection is being raised as there is no possibility of supplementaries arising. Is there any possibility of you using your good offices to contact, again, the office of the Minister for the Environment to ascertain whether this priority question will be reinstated before 2.30 p.m. this afternoon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to facilitate the Deputy but it has never been a function of the Chair to dabble in matters of the transfer of questions.  That is essentially a matter for the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy, I have not had a chance to look at your communication. Please do me the courtesy of <Col N="753" /> consulting me in my office or consult with my office in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be disorderly but if you will bear with me for a moment I will conclude.  The reason I am raising this matter now is that if this question cannot be reinstated on today's Order Paper it cannot be responded to before the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  The Minister appears to be hiding behind the Minister for Foreign Affairs and evading his responsibilities to this House, as he well knows.  He has constantly sought publicity throughout the Presidency with regard to the European Environment Agency but he has done nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment or the Minister of State with responsibility for environmental protection or anybody on the Government benches, where is the text of the environmental protection agency legislation which has been promised repeatedly for the last six <Col N="754" /> months?  We know we will not have the Bill debated in this session.  Will we see the text between now and the end of this week?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if there is the possibility of a constitutional amendment to coincide with the presidential election?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like some clarification in relation to item No. 8 on today's Order of Business regarding the sittings and business.  It was understood by the Whips that votes in relation to Estimates would be grouped and that a vote would be taken on each Estimate at two appointed times &mdash; at 11.45 p.m. on Wednesday and 7.45 p.m. on Thursday. I notice that the motion circularised in today's Order Paper states:</P>

      <Col N="757" /> where a division is demanded on an Estimate or Estimates, such division shall be taken forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to register my abhorrence at the use of the guillotine on this very important Bill.  As the Minister himself has acknowledged it is an extremely complex and detailed Bill requiring as many as 14 pages of an explanatory memorandum.  Time is clearly needed to tease out all the issues so that no mistakes will result from rushing through this Bill and we can be guaranteed a good Bill.  It is not acceptable that we should guillotine such a complex Bill so that we can only cover the bare minimum on the sections.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that this Bill is addressing the organising and regulating of £10 billion worth of funds in pension schemes, which are accumulating at the rate of £500 million per annum.  We are talking about huge sums of money and there is no reason not to give it as much attention as it is entitled to in the Houses of Parliament.  Having registered that objection, I will move on to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that Deputy Jacob, in a report of 31 May on this same Bill, said that far from being a watered down <Col N="770" /> exercise, as suggested by me, this Bill was a model of the democratic procedure with which this House should feel very comfortable and satisfied.  I see nothing democratic about a Bill only a small fraction of which will be debated and voted on in this House.  Maybe Deputy Jacob will take the opportunity to eat his own words at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The preservation of benefits is a very important part of the Bill.  It is important that we recognise that when the National Pensions Board produced their report in 1987 they made certain recommendations. We have also to recognise that the recommendations they made were not decided overnight.  There was a lot of serious discussion with various professionals right across the board from trade unions to pension scheme managers, to the financial institutions and they deliberated for quite a long time before they made their recommendations. It is, therefore, very unsatisfactory that the Minister should have produced such a watered down Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me refresh the Minister's memory about what was actually said in 1987 by that very competent 20 person committee that comprised the National Pensions Board.  My motion is in essence reiterating what they said at that time.  At page 56 of their report, under section 5 (12) (c) they said that in the cases of members under age 25 at leaving the minimum qualifying service should be five years; for each year over 25 years of age the minimum qualifying period should be reduced by one year to a minimum of two years.  For example, a member aged 28 or over at leaving should only require two years of qualifying service to qualify for preserved benefit.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will produce arguments to say that this would create knock of effects for the funding of the scheme if these recommendations were to be suddenly implemented but we are not asking for anything to be suddenly implemented.  This report is three years old at least.  The insurance and financial institutions knew about, and were party to the debate that has been going on for longer than three years.  We are talking <Col N="771" /> about adding a five year qualification period, two years of which would have to be two years after the date of the intended implementation, 1 January 1991.  Three years have gone by since the report of the National Pensions Board was produced and we are talking about another two years after 1 January 1991 which brings us to five years, and I am not sure how long prior to the printing of this report these deliberations had gone on.  It is safe to say that in a six year period the industry had had time to make any minor alterations that might have been needed in order to implement what was being recommended by the National Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at what has happened in England.  The National Pensions Board in their report said that in the UK they introduced compulsory preservation of pension rights in their 1973 Social Welfare Act.  That is quite a while ago.  That became effective in 1975.  This made it compulsory for approved pensions schemes to provide preserved benefits calculated in accordance with the normal scheme formula for members who leave after completing five years service and are over 26 years of age &mdash; that was in 1973.  Subsequently further legislation removed the age stipulation and the five year period has now been reduced to two years.  All this had happened in England three to four years ago. I see no reason for not accepting this amendment to section 27.  It clearly conforms with what was expressed by the National Pensions Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to answer the point made by the Deputy about the Bill and how long it is being considered.  The Bill is in the House since 29 May.  We could go on for a long time discussing every minute point at very great length but Deputies will be aware of the urgency of getting the essence and the main elements of this Bill into legislation to protect the 600,000 workers who are depending on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out first that, as <Col N="772" /> Deputy Byrne rightly said, the report was published in 1987.  Deputy Byrne is, therefore, quoting from a 1987 report. That report was made available to all the organisations involved and they have given their views on what the committee said.  What we are talking about now is not just the original report but the thoroughly considered and quantified views of all the different groups and bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I decided to go ahead with the report relating to the self-employed. We implemented that and it is now up and running.  We had the same sort of arguments here in relation to this. We could have been at this for another couple of years if people had had their way in the House when they wanted to discuss every angle <i>ad nauseam.</i> Deputies made their views clear when the Bill was published and when it came in here on Second Stage.  I have taken these views on board and have put down amendments in accordance with them.  Some of these are minor, technical amendments.  There is more substance to some of the amendments which arose from the discussions which took place since the Bill was presented to the House and as a result of the views expressed by Deputies on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I am very happy that the Bill is going through before the summer recess.  I would have been quite happy to spend all the time Deputies wish debating the points at great length but now that all the essentials are in place in the Bill and the views of Deputies in particular as well as outside bodies have been considered, it is important to get the Bill onto the Statute Book.  As Deputies know, there is a long procedure in preparing all the detailed regulations so that the different aspects of the Bill can come into operation as quickly as possible.  We have scheduled 1 January next for the implementation of major sections of the Bill but there are other elements which can come into force in advance of that time if all the preparations are made before then.  I am certainly very happy there is agreement on all sides of the House to put the Bill through before the summer recess.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> In relation to Deputy Byrne's amendment, one of the main objectives of the Bill is to provide for the preservation and protection of the pension rights of members who change jobs.  The reality is &mdash; and this is why I have referred to the discussions which have taken place since 1987 &mdash; that 90 per cent of pension scheme members who change jobs settle for a refund of their contributions, which in many cases is well below the value of the pension entitlements they have foregone.  In addition, of course, the persons concerned at retirement, or in the event of death, their surviving dependants, may end up with a very inadequate pension.  This arises because up to now there has been no statutory obligation on schemes to make adequate provision for the preservation of members' pension entitlements.  As a result, few schemes make such provision as employers are not normally concerned to preserve the pension rights of employees who leave their employment, perhaps, in order to go to work for a competitor.  The lack of adequate provision in this regard is also a major obstacle in the way of employees who wish to improve their prospects by changing jobs.  It is important that we remove such obstacles to the mobility of employees, both in the interests of the persons concerned and society as a whole, which clearly benefits from people being given every opportunity to develop their potential by moving to jobs which are more satisfying and rewarding.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased, therefore, that with enactment of this Bill one of the major shortcomings of the existing occupational pensions arrangements will be removed.  Section 27 provides that a person who has been a member of a scheme for at least five years, of which two years are after the appointed day, will have a statutory entitlement to have his pension entitlements preserved. These preservation rights will apply to future pension service, that is, service after 1 January 1991, which I intend will be the commencement date for this Part. I am particularly keen, as I stated in the debate on the Second Stage, that employers follow the lead given in the <Col N="774" /> Bill and provide, in addition, for preservation in respect of past pension service, that is, service before January 1991, where this is the wish of members.  A leading actuary has estimated that the additional cost of preserving pre-1991 pension rights, on the basis of the conditions set out in the Bill, may not amount to more than 0.5 per cent of pensionable salaries.</P>
    <P>One of my aims in opting for the five years qualifying service condition is to facilitate arrangements being made for the preservation of pre-1991 pension rights.  The five years condition is in line with current practice in public service schemes and in the best private sector schemes, which provide for preservation. It will be less costly to finance than the qualifying condition recommended by the National Pensions Baord and proposed by Deputy Byrne in amendment No. 21.  Provision for that condition would result in members over age 28 qualifying for preservation after just two years membership of the scheme.  This would mainly benefit new members of schemes who stayed in an employment for a very short period, but it could do so at the expense of existing scheme members of long standing.  The cost of financing preservation based on the two years condition could be such that it would not be possible to finance the cost of providing for the preservation of pension rights in respect of pre-1991 service.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, employees who are present have been members of schemes for ten, 15 or 20 years could end up paying more, either directly or indirectly, to finance preservation for new members staying in the employment for as little as two years, without in effect receiving any real benefit in return themselves.  This would arise because lack of provision for the preservation of their pre-1991 pension rights on cost grounds could force them to remain with the same employer, as moving to another employment would result in their having to forego substantial pension entitlements.</P>
    <P>I am confident that over the next few years most schemes will make provision for the preservation of pre-1991 pension <Col N="775" /> rights, and the requirements laid down in this Bill will greatly facilitate this process. When this has been achieved the possibility of introducing more liberal requirements on the lines proposed in the report of the National Pensions Board and in Deputy Byrne's amendment can then be considered.</P>
    <P>I might add, finally, in this regard that the question of making provision at EC level for the preservation of occupational pension entitlements for people who move to employments in other member states was one of the main topics I chose for discussion at the recent informal meeting of the Council of Ministers for Social Security.  It was agreed at the meeting that priority be given to this matter in the run-up to 1992, as it is an essential element in facilitating freedom of movement of workers in the context of the single market.  Occupational pension entitlements represent a significant proportion of the overall pension rights of many workers, particularly those on higher incomes.  The EC Commission was asked to expedite work on the matter and it is acknowledged that the position paper prepared by the Irish Presidency and the exchange of views by Ministers which it occasioned will greatly assist the Commission in bringing forward proposals for appropriate measures at an early date.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the exchange of views also revealed that with the enactment of this Bill &mdash; copies of which were made available to Ministers at the meeting &mdash; Ireland will be well ahead of a number of member states in relation to preservation. For example, in Germany a person has to be a member of a scheme for at least ten years and have reached age 35 before entitlement to preservation of pension rights is acquired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has answered some of the queries I wished to raise.  He has opted for a longer period than that recommended by the board.  I am anxious about this matter, and I know my anxiety is shared by some of our colleagues on the Press Gallery who are at present facing a very critical situation. <Col N="776" /> Perhaps, at a time when their own security is in question, they feel there will not be sufficient protection for them.  Perhaps they would prefer to see compulsory preservation retrospectively included rather than the way proposed here.  Does the Minister's response indicate that those involved in the pension fund industry believe the finance necessary to comply with the shorter period would be better spent providing for retrospection?  Has the Minister any information as to what percentage of the industry would be inclined to consider the issue of retrospection? Will it be just the pension schemes where relations are good?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, all of us on this side of the House share the Minister's concern in ensuring the Bill is passed as speedily as possible.  We have an obligation to our constituents who have made representations to us to correct anomalies. We have done a lot of work on amendments but now find we have a very limited time to debate them.  That is nobody's fault but is due to what has happened in regard to other legislation.  It is in our interests to debate this matter in as much detail as possible, and if we have not sufficient time to debate it here, which is quite likely, it will have to be continued in the other House.</P>
      <P>In regard to this section, we have received extensive representations from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Employment Equality Agency. There are anomalies as regards women in particular who, having achieved an important status in the workforce before leaving for family reasons, return perhaps at a lower grade.  Will the Minister clarify whether pension will be based on income at the time of termination of employment or on the average income over the total working life of the woman?  An anomaly could arise in this regard in the preservation of pensions <i>vis-à-vis</i> age group, and pensions for women, particularly.  As Deputy Flaherty said, certain sections of the community have suffered because this legislation was not in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that preservation <Col N="777" /> is the priority but the five year period is the standard in the public service at present.  I believe that is a very reasonable standard.  I know of people who have been in the public service for many years who do not have any preservation and are in a much worse position.  Anomalies still exist in this area but the five years provision is a reasonable norm.  It is important to make the preservation a priority.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the preservation and revaluation of pensions. Theoretically, on a statutory basis, the first period would have to be preserved and revalued in accordance with the statute and the second period would have to be taken separately.  A company could, under their own terms, make other arrangements.  This would depend on how healthy the fund is, how the trustees of the fund regard it and the terms of the fund.  The basic statutory provision is for preservation and revaluation which are provided for here.  The first pension could be preserved and revalued and the second could be a separate entitlement. However, some schemes could have terms which would allow otherwise.</P>

      <P>If we had more time available to us I would press this amendment to a vote but I will not do so in the circumstances.  The question of the pre-aid day preservation has been addressed by the National Pensions Board.  They dealt with the implications of making compulsory preservation retrospective or applicable to a pre-aid day service.  In view of the potential cost implications of the new requirements on schemes for which advanced financial provision would not have been made they decided that this should be avoided.  They believe that this matter should be reviewed at a later date, for example, ten years after aid day, to assess whether the requirements should be extended to include pre-aid day service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister indicate whether it would be possible to include a provision for such a review in the legislation?  The Minister said that these preservation rights will apply to pension service after <Col N="778" /> 1 January 1991.  Does he intend including a provision in the legislation for the carrying out of such a review at a later date to assess the implications of pre-aid day service?</P>

      <P>I will be asking the National Pensions Board to make whatever arrangements can be made to cover the pre-aid day service.  As I said, I am anxious to include such a provision in the Bill and, in fact, the five year condition facilitates this.  As it was considered that the other arrangements were a bit complex, it was decided to apply the five year simpler arrangements across the board.  I will certainly be raising this matter at an early stage so that preservation can be introduced as early as possible.  I am anxious to get the board up and running so that they can address this problem.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment.  The option referred to in section 28 (2) (b) related to that provided for under section 28 (5).  In the event of the death of a member with an entitlement to a preserved benefit before he or she reaches normal pensionable age a capital sum equal to the actuarial value of his or her preserved benefit shall be payable to his personal representative.  However, where the rules of such a scheme provide for a dependant's pension in the event of the member's death while in service, the trustee may opt to provide an accrued preserved dependant's pension instead of the capital sum.  This amendment will ensure that this will be possible.</P>

      <P>In page 18, subsection (4), line 19, to delete &ldquo;to his personal representative&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;in accordance with the rules of the scheme&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The members of the Irish Association of Pension Funds and the association of pension lawyers believe that the definition of &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; in the Bill is unduly restrictive and might cast some doubts on the current practice where it is possible for them to pay pensions to dependants.  The definition of &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; seems to refer only to the lawyer or estate of the person. This would prevent them from adopting the current practice of ensuring that the dependants can occasionaly be the beneficiaries. They believe that if the intention of this definition is to prevent the newly created statutory benefit from exceeding revenue maxima it is reasonable but that otherwise it would be better to state that the lump sum actuarial value of the preserved benefit should be paid in accordance with the rules of the scheme as this would allow maximum flexibility.  The definition of personal representative in section 28 (4) is unduly restrictive in the context of current practice. Will the Minister clarify the definition of &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo;?  Will it preclude the current practice of paying such funds to dependants, which is a desirable flexibility in the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is proposing in her amendment that the capital sum payable in the event of an early leaver's death prior to retirement should be payable out of the funds in accordance with the normal scheme rules.  The section, as drafted, provides that such a sum be <Col N="780" /> payable to the personal representative of the deceased member.  In practice the rules of a scheme normally provide for death benefits to be payable out of the fund to the member's dependants.  The disposal of these benefits invariably involves the exercise of the trustees discretion in determining which dependants qualify to receive the payment.  This will require the trustees to be fully briefed with regard to the deceased member's circumstances prior to his or her death. Such information can normally be obtained from either the employer or the member's co-workers who will be familiar with his or her circumstances.  Generally speaking, therefore, there is no difficulty in disbursing these benefits. However, it is considered that practical difficulties could arise for the trustees if the capital sum provided under section 28 (4) and section 29 (3) were to be disposed of in a similar manner.  For example, it could prove almost impossible for the trustees to determine the dependency of a member who had left the scheme for, say, ten or 20 years.  It could result in a substantial proportion of the capital sum being used by the trustees to find out who the member's dependants are.  Having considered the option, on balance the practical approach is to have the benefit paid to the personal representative rather than being dealt with by the trustees.</P>

      <P>The Minister has obviously given us food for thought.  He has decided that the current freedoms should not be continued but I am not convinced that his reasoning is essentially sound because there should be very valid reasons for making life more difficult and putting dependants into a straitjacket which might make the situation less responsive to their needs.  Does this definition prevent the current practice of paying benefits to dependants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To go via the representative is the more logical way to deal with this matter.  As I said, there could be practical difficulties now that we are <Col N="781" /> introducing this whole area of preservation and going back over a number of years.  There are statutory entitlements involved now which was not the case previously.  It was possible to make some sort of arrangement and there was always extra money coming in from one quarter or another because people were leaving schemes and, as the Deputy knows, lost considerably as a result.  The arrangement to the personal representative could, in some cases, cause additional inconvenience for the personal representative but, in general, now that we are introducing statutory requirements, it is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the beneficiary, not the personal representative.  If the net effect involves additional costs and slows the process by which dependants would get pensions sorted out.  I need to be convinced that the reason for doing it is sound.  We are, generally, regulating a voluntary area but we are trying to develop it, not to restrict it.  We also hope that the pensions scheme will do a great deal more than the minimum requirements which we are establishing here.  Has the Minister any final thoughts in this regard as I presume he has had representations from the bodies concerned?</P>

      <P>The two major bodies who sent submissions to me raised concerns in relation to this area.  As it is specifically defined in the legislation, if it <Col N="782" /> goes through today the board will not have any flexibility to change it.  I do not know whether the Minister has regulatory powers to change it in future if there is a problem.  It is a fairly technical area but it is obviously less flexible than the current practice and could have a real impact on people's entitlements.  I do not know what groups advised the Minister but the industries associated with the Irish Association of Pension Funds and the recently formed group of the Irish Association of Pension Lawyers both expressed concern.  The only justification they could see for it was that the Minister was trying to prevent the newly created statutory benefit from exceeding revenue maxima.  Unless the Minister was doing the job of the Minister for Finance, certainly in the context of improving the scheme for the recipients and &mdash; in the event of the death of a member, his dependants &mdash; he is disimproving the situation in relation to current practice.</P>

      <P>One is a paternalistic system but this is a statutory requirement and we are advised by some of the major trustees that this is the preferable way.

I am happy that, in practical terms because of some of the difficulties that could arise otherwise, it is preferable to do it in the way outlined in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back to what I said at the beginning but really it is because of the new circumstances which have arisen, the entitlement to preservation of benefits, going from one job to another and carrying the preserved benefits.  There is also the fact that arrangements will have to be made for someone who has left the job for ten, 20 or even 30 years.  It is simple at present because there is no requirement to do that but it will not be simple when all the preserved benefits <Col N="783" /> are involved, the movement between jobs and the passage of a number of years.  That is essentially what changes the nature of the administration which would be involved.  The most practical approach would be to have the benefit paid to the personal representative rather than having the matter dealt with by the trustees.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25a:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (2), lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;the accumulated value on that date of the appropriate contributions&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the actuarial value of the net fund&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment because it hits at certain problems in pension schemes, for example, Deputy Seán Barrett intervened in the debate to illustrate a case in his area where a firm in liquidation were being purchased and the new buyer bought the pension fund.  On discovering that the pension scheme was extremely healthy, he wound it up, paying the members the value of the frozen benefit at that time and collected a cool £200,000 profit, which was entirely legal, the amount over and above that required to provide for the benefits of the members.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that the definition in the section at present does not do what it intends to do; that an employer could exclude the build-up of the pension fund in respect of contributions paid; and that &ldquo;the accumulated value ... of the appropriate contribution&rdquo; is very narrow and that the &ldquo;actuarial value of the net fund&rdquo; would be a better definition and would ensure that anything earned by members' contributions would be retained for the benefit of the members concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> I am not clear that we have done anything to prevent the fly-by-night people interfering with pension schemes, which I know is not all that common, but nevertheless occurs.  Once somebody has provided for the minimum requirements I am not sure that the additional value accumulated in the fund will be guaranteed for the benefit of members or that we have sufficient restrictions to deal with the disposal of assets, particularly when we do not have member trustees.  In fact, the way in which trustees will be appointed has yet to be defined by the board.</P>
    <P>While my definition may look rather technical, it may be more substantial than it seems and the lawyers dealing with this area have made the point that my definition is preferable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 29 provides for the preservation of benefits in defined contribution schemes as distinct from defined benefit schemes.  This section, dealing with defined contribution schemes, sets out how preserved benefits are to be calculated in such schemes.  The preserved benefit in such a scheme will be the accumulated value of the appropriate contributions, that is contributions paid in respect of the member after the commencement of the Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty's amendment would delete the reference to &ldquo;appropriate contributions&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the actuarial value of the net fund&rdquo;.  This would mean that defined contributions schemes would have to have preserved benefits in respect of service prior to the commencement date.  The whole thrust of the provisions relating to preservation in the Bill is to preserve benefits in respect of service after the commencement date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we previously discussed when dealing with preserved benefit schemes, we will be trying to make arrangements to have the past service covered at a future date and this is a matter which the board will be taking up right away.  There will be considerable safeguards of the fund once the Bill is passed and the commencement dates come into operation. However, the Deputy raised a question <Col N="786" /> about a fund where all the legal safeguards were observed but the extra money in the fund was creamed off.  It would obviously require a preservation of the total benefits from before the commencement date to deal with this situation. I cannot accept the amendment because the Bill deals with preservation after the commencement date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand why the general provisions of the Bill do not come into effect until 1991.  It is possible that even within a two-year period the earnings on the contributions can realise more than the net contributions and that seems to be where the problem lies, and the Minister should take a further look at this whole question.  In the interest of making progress, I will reconsider my position, but I think it is a very important issue and with regard to defined contributions it may be the way of achieving a desirable objective, that is that the return on moneys set aside for a pension scheme cannot be siphoned off by anybody else other than for the benefit of members of the scheme.  It is possible at present to siphon off the return and I am concerned that after the enactment of this Bill it will still be possible to siphon off moneys over and above the minimum requirements.  This amendment would prevent this in the case of a defined contribution scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other aspects of the Bill which govern this, such as the winding-up provisions; the priority orders in winding-up; the quantification in relation to winding-up.  However, there is no preservation before the commencement date at this stage, and that is a general feature of the Bill as the Deputy knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about this because it seems that it is open to the employer to seek to exclude the build-up of the fund in respect of the contributions paid.  I think the exclusion post-1991 deals with it, but whether the two or five years will be applicable I do <Col N="787" /> not know.  However, I am very anxious to have this amendment accepted.</P>

That is one of the reasons I want to have the board in operation urgently so that any member of a scheme who feels the fund is in danger will have the board immediately to pursue that matter on his or her behalf. One thing we discussed earlier was the difficulty of members of the schemes pursuing any issue because of the need for expertise and the expense involved.  The board will be able to provide those for members of schemes immediately.  That is one reason I want to see those provisions come into operation at the earliest possible date and in that regard the position would be well safeguarded.</P>

      <P>I suppose the two amendments essentially follow the same flow and are the same.  On this section, I would like to remind the Minister of something he said. He outlined in his speech his reason for not accepting the National Pensions Board's formula which at this stage is gospel according to the Opposition here. The Minister has his team of advisers and we have the National Pensions Board. We have great faith in the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister will not listen to what they are saying.  We are going to use their words to ask the Minister to amend this Bill.  The Minister said that there are implications in accepting the National Pensions Board's recommendations. Let us hear what the board had to say and that will explain the reasons for our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> The board looked at the English experience and reported to the effect that they believed any proposal which hopes to achieve a real and a meaningful improvement in this area, that is the re-valuation of preserved benefits, should incorporate a provision whereby preserved benefits are re-valued between the date of leaving and eventual retirement.  That is a key element.  We are living in an era of job insecurity.  Some people are lucky enough to have a lifetime of full employment up to pension age but, unfortunately, a growing number are finding job insecurity a reality, as indicated by the increase of 5,000 in the dole figures last month. We must plan for their old age also, for pension rights and the value of pensions for men and women who might have only a quarter of a lifetime in gainful employment covered by occupational pension schemes and find themselves thrown on the streets, drawing the dole and growing steadily older.  As they approach the pension age of 65 years what have these people to look forward to?</P>
    <P>In this Bill, we have responsibility to try to guarantee in their old age that the years they worked and the money they paid into a pension scheme at least is preserved at a rate that will be of assistance to them in their old age.  In the report I have referred to the board said that some of their members felt that the concept should be further extended to protect the real value of pensions even during payment.  A person can retire and qualify for pension at 65 years of age and live, say, another 20 years to 85 and in that 20-year period the pension could be watered down to practically nothing. Therefore, it is right, the board argued, that the preserved benefit should be there also during the payment period. However, I am not pressing that point because there were complications.  I would like the Minister to take on board that the board debated that aspect, accepted the principle and recognised it to be difficult to ensure re-valuation of preserved benefits during payment periods at this stage.</P>
    <P>The report of the board goes on to say that in defined benefits schemes where <Col N="790" /> benefits are related to final salary the preserved benefit for an early leaver should be revalued having regard to any increase in the consumer price index in the previous 12 month period on the following minimum basis.  They say that where the increase in the CPI during this period is less than 4 per cent, preserved benefits should be re-valued by the full amount of such increase.  Where the percentage increase is greater than 4 per cent but less than 10 per cent an additional increase of half the excess over 4 per cent should be provided.  The maximum increase thus provided should be 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is the combined wisdom of the board of whom the Minister is so proud, as we are on this side of the House. The Minister attempts to argue down the findings by saying that many of the interested parties he consulted felt that the board's formula for re-valuation was unduly high and would in any event give rise to very real, practical problems for pension schemes.</P>
    <P>Whose word are we to take?  Are we to take the word of a National Pensions Board or these many interested parties with whom the Minister consulted?</P>
    <P>Earlier in his speech the Minister said that we were dealing with a complex task and that the drafting of the legislation had proved to be a much more complex and time-consuming task than those involved had anticipated.  Then the Minister said that considerable technical assistance had been given to his officials by some of the top experts in this country on occupational pensions, people who are or who were members of the National Pensions Board.  On the one hand the Minister said that he had advice from people who disagreed with the National Pensions Board and on the other the Minister has expressed appreciation for the contribution made by experts from the National Pensions Board.  There is a contradiction here.  The Minister in his speech suggested that the legislation was prepared mainly by officials of his Department with the assistance of former <Col N="791" /> or present members of the National Pensions Board, and then he said that he was speaking to other experts.  Who are these experts who have contradicated the research and serious work which has been done for years by the National Pensions Board?  It has to be a small lobby group of interested employers.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been watered down, as I said in my opening contribution, and in this instance it is clear that pressure has been put on the Minister by outside forces who are clearly not the members of the National Pensions Board who assisted in the preparation and drafting of the original Bill.</P>
    <P>It is worth putting on the record that pensions investment funds are extremely healthy.  I will leave it at that until I hear from the Minister and some of my own colleagues.</P>

      <P>My amendment deals with the problems outlined by Deputy Byrne, but in a more restrictive way than does his amendment.  To replace 4 per cent with 7 per cent and leave in &ldquo;whichever is the lesser&rdquo; would defeat the Deputy's argument.  Congress in their submissions to us, having had regard to the submissions of the pensions board were of the view that the revaluation proposals in the Bill are less favourable than those put forward by the pensions board, and they recommend that preserve benefits should be revalued in line with the consumer price index up to 4 per cent, and where the consumer price index exceeds 4 per cent but is lower than 10 per cent they suggested an increase of half the excess of 4 per cent, allowing for a maximum of 7 per cent.  Legal advice to congress and to me encouraged us to favour the formula set down by the pensions board because it provides a much more realistic revaluation and makes compulsory preservation much more acceptable to scheme members.  That is why I have suggested my amendment.  If we left in the words &ldquo;whichever is the lesser&rdquo; in the section without qualifying it as suggested by my amendment, 4 per cent or less will be paid.  My amendment <Col N="792" /> would mean that the payment would exceed 4 per cent if the CPI exceeded 4 per cent and there would be still a maximum on it.  My formula is reasonable and I hope the Minister will take it on board.</P>

      <P>Like my colleagues, on my first reading of the Bill I would have rushed to put down such an amendment. This Bill is supposed to be something of a balancing act and we are dealing with a voluntary sector.  The funding requirements to meet the requirements of this Bill, particularly in relation to preservation, will not substantial demands on pension funds.  In other legislation my colleagues on the left have rushed in to put certain amendments which had unseen consequences.  Last week we had the Clinical Trials Bill back in here because the legislation had a very severe impact on people in that it had driven research out of the country.  We must remember that we are dealing with a live industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we have driven the research out of the country.  We must respond to what the industry can take.  If pension funds cannot fund this requirement, the only way they can comply with the Bill is to reduce the benefit for members.  I am concerned about the issue raised.  It seems to be a straightforward issue, that if a preservation is to have any value it should be in line with inflation.  As I researched for this Bill I was surprised to find that those involved in pension schemes felt that the proposal in the Bill was reasonable and that section 6 would give the Minister flexibility in a period of very high inflation, and that it also related to current inflation rates.  At the time in 1987 when the board met there were higher inflation rates, and had the board ment in 1982, 1983 and 1984 there would have been different inflation rates.  We have to have section 6 which allows the Minister to respond to varying situations. We must have flexibility.  We must take <Col N="793" /> into account what funds can take having regard to inflation.  This issue has not been of major concern to me, having considered representations made to me and the points made by congress.  The major issues that concerned me related to member trustees and the problems with disclosure.  However, I would be interested to hear the Minister's reason for not going for straight indexation of preserved benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined earlier at some length in my comments on amendment No. 20 the general approach I have adopted in the Bill in relation to laying down statutory requirements for preservation. There is nothing against having an arrangement above the statutory requirement.  I am opposed to requirements that are unnecessarily costly, particularly having regard to what is needed in relation to the preservation of the entitlements of the vast majority of scheme members, especially current members of schemes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ferris, in amendment No. 29, proposes in effect that provision be made for the revaluation formula recommended by the National Pensions Board. As I stated during Second Stage debate on the Bill many of the interested parties which I consulted felt that the board's formula for revaluation would give rise to real practical problems for pension schemes.  It is not possible to make proper funding arrangements for benefits which are to be revalued in relation to a variable rate of inflation.  We either fund for benefits at the lower limit and risk underfunding or fund for benefits at the higher limit which could lead to costly overfunding. Such overfunding could mean that money tied up in this way would not be available to finance the preservation of the pre-1991 pension rights of current members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would also not be possible for trustees to purchase a deferred annuity contract from insurance companies which would meet those requirements, as insurance companies are only geared to providing such contracts at fixed rates of inflation.  Accordingly, to ensure that <Col N="794" /> they met their statutory obligations in this regard schemes would have to purchase annuities at the maximum rate of 7 per cent in all cases.  This would mean that in times of low inflation the pension rights of the early leavers concerned would be revalued at a considerably higher rate than those of members who remained in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of the revaluation formula, proposed by Deputy Ferris, could be to benefit new members of schemes at the expense of current members, many of whom are concerned to have provision made for preservation of pre-1991 pension rights.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne with amendment No. 28 at least recognises the problem which making provision for a variable rate of inflation would give rise to for pension schemes.  He has proposed that the ceiling be set at 7 per cent.  However, at a time when inflation is running at 3.5 per cent &mdash; it may be lower this year &mdash; an upper limit of 7 per cent is far too high. As I have pointed out already it would result in early leavers at times of low inflation as at present and in respect of whom annuities were purchased, having their pension rights revalued at a higher rate than those of members who remained in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The revaluation formula set out in section 32 is easy to administer and is aimed to fully match any increase in inflation up to 4 per cent.  Provision is also made in subsection (6) to vary by regulations the 4 per cent ceiling if this is found to be necessary &mdash; this was referred to by Deputy Flaherty &mdash; as a result of a substantial increase in inflation.  This situation will be kept under constant review by the new pensions board who will advise me as Minister if any such change in the ceiling is necessary.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the fact that in accordance with subsection (1) revaluation will not commence until five years after the appointed date, that is the year beginning January 1996.  This is fully in line with the recommendations of the National Pensions Board in this regard, which was based on the need to give schemes time to make adequate funding <Col N="795" /> arrangements for revaluation.  I would like to explain exactly what this will involve.  If a person leaves a scheme in the year 1993, the first year in which members will actually become eligible for preservation under the terms of the Bill, he will be entitled to have his pension rights in respect of the two year period 1991 to 1992 preserved, provided, of course, he has been a member of the scheme for a total of five years.  Revaluation of this preserved benefit will commence just three years later &mdash; from 1 January 1996.  If a person leaves the following year, in 1994, revaluation will commence two years later, and if he leaves in 1995, revaluation will commence just one year later.  Revaluation will commence straight away for members leaving from 1 January 1996 onwards.  Accordingly, the five years waiting period will not have a significant impact either in terms of the amount of pension involved or in terms of numbers affected. However, the National Pensions Board considered that this five years waiting period was essential from the point of view of funding and this has been confirmed by the representations I have received from pension experts in the period since the report was published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In essence, we are debating whether the funds of pension schemes are sufficiently healthy to allow the Minister to accept my amendment.  I do not agree with the Minister's figures.  Will the Minister agree that in order to keep a pension fund healthy investment returns should at least match wage growth rates?  If he agrees with that assessment then a more realistic target should be that in the long term investment return should exceed wage growth rates by at least two percentage points per annum.  If we look at how healthy investment returns have been for the period 1983-89 we will to some extent explode the myth that somehow or other the funds are not available to permit the Minister to accept our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The removal of exchange controls in the last two years means that the future <Col N="796" /> looks even brighter for investment returns.  The effect of a sustained bull market, coupled with the removal of exchange controls, has meant a stready growth in the percentage of funds carried in equities and an increase in the spread of equity investment.  Both are healthy indicators for the future growth in investment for pension funds as gilts have traditionally underperformed equities.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the rate of return on investment and compares it with wage growth in the years 1983-89 one will see that the investment returns per annum on, for example, mixed management funds, between 1985-89 was 22 per cent. If one looks at the investment performance schemes in that same period one will see that they represent 21 per cent.  The average industrial earnings in the same period equalled a 5 per cent increase.  If one compares the investment return growth over and above wage growth with the mixed managed funds one will see that it represented a total of 14.4 per cent in excess over the period between 1983-89.  The investment performance schemes in that period was 13.8 per cent over and above wage growth.  It can be shown that in the five year period between 1985-89 the investment return growth over and above wage growth per annum was higher when compared with the period between 1983-89.  It was running at 14.4 per cent between 1983-89 and at 17 per cent between 1985-89.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is an incredibly healthy fund of £10 billion out there and there is incredible growth potential for the future.  That gives the lie to the statements about funding.  It is extremely healthy and capable of absorbing the extra few bob involved in accepting our amendment.  That amendment is exactly in line with the recommendation of the first report of the National Pensions Board.  I cannot accept any argument against that recommendation and I feel so strongly about this issue that I will push my amendment to a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The formula I have suggested does not take from the section.  It leaves the Minister all the options he <Col N="797" /> wants.  My amendment sought to change only one option, that relating to the 4 per cent.  However, I included a proviso that the 4 per cent would be changed only if the CPI exceeded that figure.  My amendment does not disturb the Minister's argument. I suggest that if the CPI exceeds this figure of 4 per cent this should be taken into account.  I have also recommended a maximum compensation figure.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill relating to preservation and revaluation will only come into effect following a very long lead-in period, much longer than the one recommended by the board.  The representatives of the pensions industry on the board think we are being extremely cautious.  Therefore, our amendment is not out of line with what the pensions industry, who have a vested interest in this matter and who control between £6 billion and £10 billion of workers' money, have suggested.  They think that we are being cautious in our approach and have suggested that we should strike a balance between being too cautious and being unrealistic.  If the CPI exceeds the figure of 4 per cent this should be taken into account.  I do not consider this amendment to be unreasonable and I am disappointed the Minister is not prepared to concede on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have mentioned, this matter can be taken into account under the provisions of section 6, but there is one other matter we need to bear in mind.  The Deputies keep referring to a great fund of money which they insist <Col N="798" /> exists but I should point out that while some funds may be described as very strong, others are not.  One of the reasons for this is the absence of preservation.  As I mentioned earlier, 90 per cent of those in schemes cash in and leave without preserving their benefits.  This is of no benefit to a scheme as no money is left in the fund.  I wish to achieve preservation.</P>
      <P>This section will come into effect in 1996.  The pensions board will have plenty of time between now and 1996 to examine the operation of schemes, the progress made on the preservation of pensions and to make recommendations, if adjustments need to be made.  The percentage to be laid down will always be a matter for debate and discussion.  I have mentioned the elements to be taken into account and nothing which has been said alters these. These will be considered in the light of experience.</P>
      <P>Given that it is our objective to achieve preservation at the earliest possible date, the advice I have received is that we have adopted a reasonable and balanced approach.  Let me make it quite clear to Deputy Byrne that a person will not be able to take money out of the fund. Therefore, he need not be unduly concerned about that matter.  However, benefits have to be provided and improvements need to be made under such headings as equal treatment.  Those issues also need to be considered.  We have adopted a reasonable approach and it may be considered between now and 1996.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29a:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before section 33, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;33. &mdash;All members on leaving employment shall be entitled to a written statement outlining&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  the amount of preserved benefits, both for the member and his or her dependants,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> (b)  the provision for increases of these benefits,</P>
    <P>(c)  the date or dates on which these benefits become payable and the procedure for claiming the benefit,</P>
    <P>(d)  the name and address of the scheme, its trustees and those persons responsible for the payment of benefits, and</P>
    <P>(e)  a clear description of all rights and options available at the time of leaving and subsequently accruing, including the amount of any transfer value.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>I was anxious that this amendment be included.  It refers to entitlement to transfer payments.  Whenever a person is leaving a scheme it is extremely important that both they, their dependant or dependants and the trustees of the scheme should know where they stand. This amendment is cogged directly from the report of the pensions board.  It should be included in the Bill, rendering its provisions all the stronger, when everybody would be much clearer with regard to where they stand.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be familiar with the problems encountered even between his Department and the Department of Finance, through the Revenue Commissioners, even in maintaining track of people's PRSI contributions; indeed we are aware that some £1 million of those have gone astray.  We are talking about creating circumstances, within a private voluntary industry, in which persons with mobility of employment may move a number of times in the course of their careers and at pension age, will be endeavouring to put together or trace their general entitlements.  That means they may have to go back and trace their annuities, preserved benefits in two or three employments.  It is absolutely essential that they have easy access to their entitlements at that stage; that on leaving employment, on taking a transfer payment for one reason or another &mdash; at the various stages of that process &mdash; this written statement be made available to <Col N="802" /> them.  Indeed all such persons will benefit therefrom, particularly in the case of the death of a member when it will be the dependants, perhaps a wife, who will be endeavouring to ascertain what are her entitlements or those of the children.  This will mean they will not have to go through a laborious procedure, writing to where they remember the deceased person had worked, perhaps ascertaining the name of a pension fund and writing to the trustees to ascertain their precise entitlements.</P>
    <P>One of the key elements which will determine the success of this Bill will be access to information and the protection that will afford people.  Perhaps this written statement will constitute the most vital information of all a member can carry with them, outlining what they have earned and their entitlements arising out of their membership of a scheme at any given time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no disagreement with the point the Deputy is making.  This is a matter for regulations; it is one of the matters that will be covered in the regulations.  The amendment would require members leaving employment to be given a statement of their entitlements to preserved benefits.  The issue is one of disclosure of information rather than preservation, as such.  It is envisaged that statements of this kind would be among the pieces of information schemes would be required to make available.</P>
      <P>I should say that section 53 (1) gives the Minister power to prescribe the types of information which schemes will be required to make available to members. Such items of information relating to early leavers will be included in the proposed regulations concerning disclosure. I know that this was an issue in respect of which the pensions board made a recommendation.  I can assure the Deputy that it will be included in the regulations.</P>

      <P>In page 21, subsection (2), lines 28 to 30, to delete from and including &ldquo;equal to the actuarial value&rdquo; down to the end of the subsection and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;equal&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  in the case of a defined benefit scheme, to the actuarial value of the preserved benefit on the date on which the relevant application under subsection (3) is received by the trustees, and</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of a defined contribution scheme, to the accumulated value on that date of the appropriate contributions under the scheme in respect of the member: </P>
      <P>Provided that where benefits under such a scheme are secured under one or more policies of assurance, the accumulated value of the appropriate contributions shall be the proportion of the proceeds of every such policy applicable to those contributions.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is of a technical nature. It is necessary to draw a distinction in this section between a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.  In the case of a defined benefit scheme the transfer payment shall be equal to an amount calculated by the actuary of the scheme having regard to age, length of service and pensionable salary of the <Col N="804" /> member.

      <P>This amendment simply places the onus on the member to provide the trustees with the necessary information to enable them to effect a transfer.

      <P>We come to amendment No. 32 in the name of the Minister.  I note that amendment No. 34 is related and that amendment No. 33a is an alternative to amendment No. 34. It is proposed, therefore, for discussion purposes, to take amendments Nos. 32, 33a and 34 together.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 21, subsection (3), lines 36 to 40, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) in the making of one or more payments falling to be made under policies or contracts of assurance that are effected on behalf of the member with one or more undertakings (within the meaning of the Insurance Act, 1989) and that are approved of by the Revenue Commissioners under Chapter II of Part I of the Finance Act, 1972.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is partly a drafting amendment being made on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman's office.  In addition, it provides that a transfer payment may be used to purchase policies of assurance as well as annuities.  This would provide the member with more flexibility with regard to the payment of the benefit.  In regard to the member who may wish, for example, to opt to have a portion of the benefit taken in a lump sum, if it was purchased strictly in the form of an annuity this option would not be available to him.  It is basically to provide more options for the member.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32a:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 22, line 24, to delete &ldquo;in such circumstances as may be prescribed&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;where membership has <Col N="806" /> not exceeded 8 years or where such preserved benefits apply to more than half of the scheme's members&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The power given to trustees in section 34 allows them to by-pass a number of the commitments in the Bill without the permission or consent of the member. Another one of our amendments refers also to the dependants and the spouse because it may be their entitlements that are being changed in their form without their permission.  It is quite a significant power to give to the board that, instead of operating a reserved pension, they can purchase an annuity.  It may have the same net value but if it is in the interests of the member I do not see why the member would not agree to it.  I know the concern of the industry is that they could end up with a scheme that has more members with preserved benefits than active members at any one time, and that is a valid point.  I believe, however, that there should be some limit on this power because it is possible that someone who has given 20 years service could, without his permission or, if he has died, without the permission of his dependants, have the form of his entitlement changed overnight.  My suggestion is that this power be restricted along the lines of my amendment which is to delete &ldquo;in such circumstances as may be prescribed&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;where membership has not exceeded eight years or where such preserved benefits apply to more than half of the scheme's members&rdquo;.  That may not be the best definition but it meets some of my reservations in relation to this. There should at least be an obligation to get consent where there has been membership of the scheme for at least eight years.  Such members deserve more than that change in their situation should be implemented without consultation with them or their dependants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is similar in intent to Deputy Flaherty's and some of the questions she has posed are questions I would like to pose also.  It seems a rather strange but, in a sense, understandable, section.  I would like to tease <Col N="807" /> it out a little, if I may.  My first question is in regard to the power to transfer without consent.  Why would consent not be sought?  There are dangers in the fact that somehow the trustees of a scheme can just transfer without the member possibly even knowing because, presumably, if the member's consent has not been sought the likelihood is that he will not know the transfer is to go ahead.  Why would the trustees wish to transfer without consulting with the member?</P>
      <P>The answer to that might be that the member is not in the country or has gone missing.  How is it intended to keep records of the movements of over half a million workers in these schemes, especially those in relatively short-term employment for five, six or seven years who might be made redundant or be emigrating? The Minister will be aware of the suddenness with which many people, depending on their job security, take the decision that they have no option but to emigrate.  Who will keep tabs on all of these people moving between Ireland, America and Europe and even from rural to urban areas?  There will be a considerable movement of people and I would like to know what tabs are to be kept on these people.  Take the example of a man or woman who is relatively young and has been either sacked or made redundant from a company in which they have contributed to a pension scheme and has left the country.  What becomes of their pension?  How is their preserved benefit to be kept in safe keeping for them?  Rather than the trustees having the power to effect transfer payments, such a move should have to be agreed by the board.  I cannot see any case the Minister might make against that.  Surely, at the end of the day, the board should authorise these transfers of payments, particularly since the members themselves will not be contacted about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Byrne's point, the regulations to be made under section 34 will be made after consultation with the board and this should <Col N="808" /> meet Deputy Byrne's concerns.  This will apply mainly to small schemes.  There will be an opportunity, for instance, to apply a limit to people who have left the scheme with fewer than five years service.  This is what is done in the British scheme.  The same provision is here, but for people with up to five years membership.  That is the kind of thing for which we want to provide this power.  I can assure the Deputy that this is something that will be done in consultation with the board and he need have no fears about what is in mind in that regard.</P>
      <P>The section enables the trustees of an occupational pension scheme, in certain circumstances to be prescribed, to affect a transfer payment without the consent of the member.  This provision is designed to reduce the workload on schemes administering an ever-increasing number of small preserved benefit entitlements &mdash; this is where the five year limit could apply.  Otherwise, unless those leaving requested a transfer payment, records would have to be kept for most leavers.  In employments with a high turnover of staff, records of leavers could exceed those in respect of stayers.  It is proposed, therefore, that in the case of small preserved benefit entitlements &mdash; for example, of those with less than five years' service, the trustees would be free to transfer the liability to an approved annuity bond.  Another example of the type of circumstance in which this power could be exercised by trustees would be in the event of a winding-up of a scheme. In such a case, the trustee could secure the members' entitlements through the purchase of appropriate annuities.  The power is included to cover cases such as that.  Are we discussing amendment No. 35 in conjunction with the other amendments?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 35 in my name is to provide, as in the case of section 33, that where the trustees of a scheme effect a transfer payment through the purchase of an insurance policy or an <Col N="809" /> annuity bond, it will be discharged from all obligation to provide the member with a preserved benefit.</P>

      <P>As regards young workers who may move from one job to another or emigrate, the last thing on their minds would be their pension rights.  Will the board have access to the files of everybody who is eligible for some form of cover?  Will they be the central data bank who hold everybody's name and address? We as politicians deal with cases of people who have worked in England. Much work has to be done as regards their entitlement.  Will the board have all the information to which people will have access so they know what they are entitled to, especially in the case of transfer of payment without the consent of the member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The more the Deputy says about this matter, the more he indicates the wisdom of having it dealt with in regulations.  A lot of aspects need to be considered and it is intended that the regulations will deal with those.  The board will have a register of all the schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but what they do beyond that will be a matter for themselves. They will have to consider cases such as the Deputy raised whereby people are coming and going.  In simple terms, what happens is that a policy is taken out in the name of a member and that will be to his benefit.  Obviously the guidelines will have to cover the manner in which such people are to be informed if there is a benefit accruing to them and whether the information is to be available on a long term basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but it is <Col N="810" /> something that will have to be considered. The board will have an obligation to preserve information about all the schemes.  If we agree to what the Deputy suggests it would mean a further workload for them, and that is something they would have to consider.  There will be residual cases where the person receives his insurance policy, annuity or whatever and that is the end of the matter but there will also be cases such as the Deputy mentioned where people leave for one reason or another and may not know the benefit is there for them. Obviously that would have to be dealt with by way of regulations and in the administrative operation of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>That obviously indicates the desirability of including the previous amendment I proposed.  There should be some way of keeping people informed of these matters.  There are about 25,000 schemes, and I cannot understand how the board will have the names and addresses of all the people involved.  Obviously there would be a certain obligation on the individual to retain his own records and, as the last amendment proposed, to make information available to the board.  It is a two-way process.  Where an annuity is purchased in the name of a person, as Deputy Byrne has said, this would usually be payable up to five years after the person leaves and that person may not be at the same address then as when he left the employment.  Would there be an annual return on an annuity, and hence an annual communication from the investment company concerned?  If so, the person would be able to keep in contact in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on the nature of the insurance or the approved annuity bond.  There would be different payment methods and different returns. In most cases when people leave, their whereabouts will be known but, as Deputy Byrne suggested, people may leave without leaving a forwarding address or a home address, and obviously there would be difficulties in such cases. <Col N="811" /> The main thing is that a benefit will be preserved for them.  We are getting into the administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Many complications may arise in this regard.  Obviously it is important that there be regulations to deal with these matters.  Is the decision to transfer payment without consent made shortly after the person leaves the employment? My concern is that if somebody leaves an employment or is sacked, his benefits may be transferred without his consent. The person should be informed on the day he leaves the employment as to whether the money is being transferred. This is quite a complex matter and will have to be teased out in the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is about the power to transfer a payment without the consent of the member, whereas section 33 gives power to transfer with the consent of a member.

It is in the area where you need consent rather than where you do not need consent.  In this section, we do not need consent but the Deputy is trying to ensure that the trustees must have the consent of the member concerned or his spouse or dependants when purchasing annuities from one or more insurance companies, but in this section, this will be happening without their consent.

      <P>In page 22, before section 35, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>35. &mdash;Any provision of a scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  providing for the forfeiture of a preserved benefit, or</P>
      <P>(b)  enabling the employer of a member to exercise a lien on the member's preserved benefit, shall be disregarded for the purpose of this Part.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A benefit for the employee must be payable for his life as a minimum period, except that the rules of a scheme may provide for forfeiture in exceptional circumstances, for example, if the pensioner becomes bankrupt or attempts to assign his pension.  Section 35 of the Bill prohibits the forfeiture of any preserved benefit paid to a member.  The rules of the scheme may also contain a rule which enables the employer to exercise a lien on the member's benefits when they become payable.  Amendment No. 35a put forward by Deputy Flaherty provides that any such rule shall also not apply to a member's preserved benefit except where the debt to the employer arises out of a fraudulent act or theft by <Col N="815" /> the member.  However, my amendment, No. a35a goes further than Deputy Flaherty's amendment and provides that an employer shall in all circumstances be prohibited from exercising a lien on a member's preserved benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment deals with the problem of the definition and the question of an employer's lien on preserved benefit other than forfeiture.  However, my amendment takes up an angle, which the Minister has obviously decided does not need to be dealt with, and that is where a member has engaged in fraud or theft from the scheme.  I am told that this happens &mdash; I suppose they could pretend they were dead, but I do not know how they would defraud a pension scheme. However, where fraud or theft occurs, are the pension schemes being asked to preserve benefits that have been won fraudulently or illegally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Disputes and arguments can arise whether a situation was fraudulent, although I know there can be cases where it is clear there was fraud or theft. However I am providing that in all circumstances an employer will be prohibited from exercising a lien on a member's preserved benefit.  It is a pension entitlement and in the context of pension entitlements it is only right that we should make such a provision as a preserved entitlement which should not be open to be raided for any reasons.  I would go along with the Deputy, and I accept her point, but I would go a little bit further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister made two points.  First, he has gone very far on one side, the definition, and second that as a general principle the pension should be preserved without interference. However, if the scheme itself has been defrauded by a member, or if a member has been involved in theft from the scheme, is it reasonable that such a member should be paid a benefit?  I am not familiar with specific cases but I am <Col N="816" /> told it has happened and at present the practice is that the other members of the pension scheme are not put at a loss by payment of benefit to a member who has stolen from or has defrauded the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is trying to build a penalty into this section but we have provided for penalties of up to £10,000 or a term in jail for offences under this Bill.  One of the problems is that it can be difficult to decide on fraud and theft and it would be better to leave the scheme and the pension clearly separate. The trustees could have difficulty in deciding on whether there was a theft as distinct from their duty to provide the preserved benefit for the individual.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> In page 26, after line 43, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) In determining the benefits to be paid on the winding-up of a relevant scheme, the actuary shall, in addition to complying with section 47, have regard to such financial or other assumptions as he considers to be appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes the insertion of a new subsection (2) in section 45 and is a technical amendment.  It provides that in the event of the winding-up of a scheme an actuary shall, when determining the benefits to be payable out of the fund in accordance with the priority set down in section 47, be able to make assumptions about certain matters, such as the anticipated increases in inflation where increases in pensions and payment are provided under the rules of the scheme.  Section 45, as currently drafted, allows the actuary to have regard only to financial and other assumptions when completing an actuarial funding certificate.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 45, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the winding-up of schemes.  It is very annoying that because we have to conclude the debate in five minutes we will not be able to discuss a number of sections in detail.  This would have been of immense benefit to us.  There has been a great deal of movement in relation to equal treatment and what I consider to be the heart of the Bill, that is the disclosure of information in relation to schemes.  I referred earlier to schemes which are funded over and above the minimum requirements and what happens to them.  Have those schemes been protected for members in the context of this legislation?  Obviously it is highly desirable to do so as it will be still technically possible for a person to take over a scheme, wind it up and run off with the excess funds.  This type of situation has <Col N="819" /> not been adequately provided for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This type of situation is covered by the section on funding standards. The Bill lays down the minimum funding requirements, that is, sufficient assets must be held within the fund to provide minimum benefits in the event of the winding-up of a scheme.  This means that the current and future pension service rights of current members must be fully funded.  A ten-year period is being allowed to bring the level of funding in respect of certain past service rights of current members up to 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Flaherty is unnecessarily worried about these matters.  In the case of a defined contribution scheme or defined benefit scheme the benefits are clear-cut and will have to be paid at a certain level.  Deputy Flaherty referred to a situation where there is extra money in a fund and what will be done with it. This money will belong to the fund.  There will be many different factors involved and the main thing will be to know how the fund is, how it is provided for, the money in it and the obligations on the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are minimum requirements but the surpluses have not been regulated for.  Perhaps this is due to an oversight and I ask the Minister to address it before the Bill is debated in the Seanad.  These surpluses could ideally be used to improve benefits.  A case similar to the one outlined in the House by Deputy Barrett could arise after the implementation of this Bill where somebody could legally walk away with the surplus money in a fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that that will not happen after the implementation of the Bill.  The Deputy referred to the later sections of the Bill which we will not be able to debate in full.  I hope Deputies will recognise that I have gone a long way in meeting the points put forward by them.  I would have welcomed the opportunity to debate in <Col N="820" /> more detail the amendments I have put down and to say why I was doing certain things.  I can assure the Deputies that I have made very adequate, suitable and practical arrangements for equal treatment in the amendments I have put down.  The powers now being given to the Minister are in response to the points which were made by the Deputies.  For example, I have taken action in the Barber case by including an amendment in the Bill.  Power will be given to the Minister under this Bill to deal with the position of widowers, etc.  I said on Second Stage that I would deal with this issue in another way and I have taken the power, by way of regulation in the Bill, to deal with it.  When the Deputies have had an opportunity to consider my amendments they will see that I have responded to their views in that regard.</P>

      <P>We acknowledge that the Minister has acceded to some of our amendments, particularly in the area of equality.

We recognise that the long holiday is coming up but that civil servants will be working on the Bill. When the Bill is passed in the Seanad, will the Minister introduce, as soon as possible, the huge number of regulations which are anticipated?

      <P>I appreciate the time you are allowing.  I welcome what has been included by the Minister in Part VII but we regret that it was not discussed as it is one of the most important areas for amendment in the Bill.  On sections 68, I ask the Minister to give special consideration to amendment No. 65a to include part-time employees.  If it is not possible to include it in this Bill will it be included in the Bill dealing with part-time workers?  It is very important to include part-time workers.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Barnes said, it is unsatisfactory that we have not been able to look at the section dealing with equal treatment.  I am also very concerned about the section dealing with exemptions possible under disclosure which is at the heart of this Bill.  Because the debate has been guillotined we must <Col N="822" /> record our objections to the passing of this Stage.</P>

      <P>The finish of this Stage is by agreement of the House.  I should like to thank the Deputies for their very constructive approach and co-operation during the debate on this Bill.  It is complex and historic legislation and Deputies must agree that I recognised their views and included amendments to cover them. I am very concerned about part-time workers.  The pensions board are looking into their conditions, and there is also a separate study within the Department on part-time workers.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the amendments set down by the Minister for Social Welfare on Committee Stage, if not disposed of, are hereby agreed to in Committee; in respect of each of the sections undisposed of that the section or, as appropriate, the section as amended, is hereby agreed to in Committee; that the First, Second and Third Schedules, as amended, and the Title are hereby agreed to in Committee; that the Bill, as amended, is hereby reported to the House; that the amendments set down by the Minister for Social Welfare to the Bill on Report Stage are hereby made to the Bill; that Fourth Stage is hereby completed and that the Bill is hereby passed&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Government have no plans to amalgamate the Irish promotional agencies and Department of Foreign Affairs representations abroad.</P>
      <P>The Government are, however, pursuing a policy of accommodating State agencies abroad in a single building, an Ireland House, where feasible, including Department of Foreign Affairs representations. This concept is based on the ability of the agencies to provide a more co-ordinated, more efficient service and increase the impact of their presence when housed together in one location.</P>
      <P>An Ireland House, bringing together our State agencies, was opened in London in 1966.  A similar Ireland House was opened in Paris last year.  Efforts are being made to establish an Ireland House in New York that would include our Consulate General.  CTT and IDA are located in the same building as the Irish Embassy recently opened in Seoul, Korea.  CTT also occupy office accommodation in the Irish Embassies in Moscow, Beijing and Riyadh.</P>

      <P>I can express some disappointment in relation to the first part of the reply that there are no plans to carry out amalgamation as I suggested. Will the Taoiseach accept that there is a danger of duplication in terms of personnel and resources, where we as a small country are trying to maximise our representation? We have in the US, in New York, for example, numerous agencies effectively attempting to do the same business.  Will the Taoiseach also accept that many countries have their representation headed up by their foreign affairs personnel who co-ordinate their sales and promotion agencies, and that it would it be in our best interest to attempt <Col N="829" /> to have this done through the same agency?</P>

      <P>It is a concept very dear to my heart.  It is something that I have been pressing for over a period of years. New York is a good example.  Sometimes I get the impression that there is a certain institutional resistance in different places to this concept, but I fully agree with the Deputy that it is very desirable that we should in all major centres promote a location in which all our agencies would be combined, which would give a very real Irish presence.  In addition, anybody wishing to do business with Ireland could do it all in one place.  The idea has everything to recommend it but unfortunately it has proved a little difficult to achieve so far.  I assure the Deputy that it is something on which I am very keen and I will continue to press for it.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider, while he is attempting to bring about this amalgamation, if savings are made as they will be if amalgamation takes place, the possibility of expanding our representation in other Eastern European countries.  It would be very important in relation to trade promotion to have representation in more East European countries than at present, notwithstanding the fact that we are opening a representation in Warsaw in the near future.</P>

      <P>I agree.  We have made a first move to expand our representation throughout Eastern Europe and to try to create at least a semblance of structure there.  It will clearly become a region of major significance and importance politically, economically and other ways.  It is necessary therefore that we should try to extend our presence there as much as possible.  We will continue to do that and we will to some extent have to rely on State agencies to exhibit a presence there. As the Deputy knows for instance, Aer Rianta are very progressive in that regard and we hope to encourage others to be the same.</P>

      <P>Revised procedures for the provision and acquisition of houses by local authorities are effective for the 1990 local authority housing programme.  Under these procedures, the sanction of my Department is generally not required for tenders for schemes of 12 dwellings or less or for the acquisition of individual dwellings, subject to any expenditure arising this year being met from the capital allocation notified to each housing authority on 22 February last.  The 1990 programme is, however, well advanced and will yield in the order of 1,200 starts and about 50 purchases/acquisitions.</P>
      <P>There is no question of a housing emergency arising.  In this regard I would refer the Deputy to my contribution to the debate on Local Authority Housing in this House on 13 March 1990, as reported at column 2420 of the Official Report.</P>

The Deputy will recognise that £33 million has been allocated this year under the housing construction programme.

      <P>The capital allocation for their housing programme notified to Dublin Corporation on 22 February last included £1 million for the rehousing of tenants from the complex.  In response, the corporation identified the commencement of work on housing schemes at Oriel Street (25 units) and Portland Row (35 units) and the purchase of ten existing dwellings as the manner in which they proposed to utilise the allocation.  These proposals have been approved by my Department. When the decision in regard to the flats was announced in May 1989 the corporation were requested to prepare an outline plan in relation to the rehousing of the tenants.  A response in this regard was received in my Department on 26 June 1990 and is being examined.  My views on the submission will be conveyed to the corporation as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for housing authorities to take action appropriate to their individual circumstances, to give effect to the provisions of the Housing Act, 1988, and the guidelines issued by <Col N="836" /> me in regard to the accommodation needs of the homeless.  The guidelines, <i>inter alia</i>, provided for an assessment by housing authorities of the scale of homelessness in their area to which the authorities may have to respond and for the establishment of effective liaison arrangements with appropriate statutory and voluntary bodies working on behalf of homeless persons.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation, in common with all housing authorities, carried out a comprehensive assessment of housing needs as at 30 September 1989 in accordance with the provisions of section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988.  This assessment had regard to the need for the provision by the authority of adequate and suitable accommodation for persons who are homeless and who require or are likely to require accommodation from the authority. I understand that Dublin Corporation have continuous liaison with the homeless persons unit of the Eastern Health Board and also with voluntary bodies such as Focus Point, Threshold, Women's Aid, the Simon Community and so on.  The corporation have therefore, in place a framework to enable them to assess the scale of homelessness and to comply with the provisions of the Act and the guidelines.</P>

I expect that the housing authorities will do so.  The Deputy is correct when he says that the figure for homeless persons according to the assessment carried out under section 9 is 582.  I understand it was carried out in a complete way.  I also understand that voluntary bodies, the Eastern Health Board and others were consulted.  They feel that is a genuine assessment of the present position but obviously a number of variables might need to be adjusted.  All these matters will be taken into consideration in the review.</P>

    <P>In accordance with EC Directive 83/189 EEC, which requires member States to consult the Commission in relation to any proposed technical regulations and standards, a draft of the building regulations will be forwarded in the near future to the Commission. Under the directive, the Commission and other member states are allowed three months to consider the proposals.  When <Col N="839" /> the necessary consultation with the Commission has been completed, there will be no undue delay in making regulations under the Act.</P>
    <P>Further consultation in relation to the building regulations will shortly be arranged.  The establishment of a building regulations advisory body is also being considered.</P>

      <P>Would it be in order to compliment the Minister for a masterful reply of evasion as he has successfully evaded Question No. 7 and the question he co-joined with it, Question No. 34? No doubt the Minister will have a very interesting dialogue with the EC Commission but let me ask him two specific questions.  First, why he has not yet contacted the representatives of the building industry to discuss the establishment of a building council and, second, why have the building by-laws not been replaced by building regulations in the seven local authority areas, out of a total of 32, where this is required to be so done?</P>

A few days later, I received representations on behalf of persons who were endeavouring to have an Approved Driver Instructor Register compiled.</P>
      <P>On 14 May, I replied to the representations to the effect that officials of my Department had recently met a delegation from the Motor Schools Association of Ireland for a discussion relating to an approved register.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether the secondary phase of mineral prospecting, which can involve heavy machinery and major earth disturbance, should be included within the scope of the planning procedure and environmental impact assessment; and if he will outline the reason it is necessary that he retain the power to exempt minerals extraction from the need to submit an environmental impact statement.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no proposals to apply planning control or environmental impact assessment (EIA) to prospecting activities.  Such activities are, at present, controlled by the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, and prospecting licences under those Acts may be granted on such terms and conditions as the Minister for Energy thinks proper.</P>
      <P>Article 2.3 of EC Directive 85/337/EEC on EIA allows member states, in exceptional cases, to exempt a specific project in whole or in part from EIA.  This provision has accordingly been transposed into all of the procedures to which EIA has been applied by the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 and the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has admirably outlined the present position. However, I asked him to comment on the question of environmental protection given that the Minister for Energy has ruled that a person does not have to carry out an environmental impact assessment or seek planning permission or permission of any sort from him before engaging in prospecting.  Earthwatch and others have made the case that prospecting does result in considerable disturbance in areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is probably referring to the answer given by my colleague, the Minister for Energy, on 24 May in the House in which he indicated <Col N="843" /> he was satisfied, in issuing prospecting licences, that adequate account is taken of environmental concerns.</P>
      <P>Mineral prospecting in itself would not normally be expected to have significant environmental effects.  It usually involves the taking of small samples from streams, soil or rock.  Any related activity, such as the building of a road or a track, does require planning permission in the normal way.  I do not see the conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The conflict arises from those who have studied this.  Would the Minister not agree that they have made the case quite eloquently that there can be considerable disturbance in the course of prospecting?  There has been some evidence that that has occurred in certain instances.  Would he not agree that the only protection under the law would be that provided for under the Planning Acts because prospectors cannot know in advance what disturbances may occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of one example that might be quoted in this regard and it did involve the building of a road or the improvement of an existing track.  Planning permission should have been sought and subsequently was sought.  That caused much of the talk concerning this matter.  So far as the issuing of prospecting licences is concerned, mineral prospecting as such has always been regarded as an exempted development for planning control purposes.  I think the situation is adequately covered.</P>

The Minister can give a blanket permission to do exploratory work.

      <P>The most advanced traffic control system available is known as adoptive urban traffic control.  Phase 1 of such a system was installed earlier this year in Dublin on the initiative of Dublin Corporation and my Department.  This <Col N="846" /> phase incorporates 32 sets of traffic signals from Pearse Street through Tara Street, Beresfort Place, Gardiner Street and Amiens Street to Annesley Bridge. This work, which cost £1.7 million, attracted a grant of £1.2 million from the Department.</P>
      <P>Arising from discussions last month between the Department and the local authority, the authority have been requested to furnish a report containing an evaluation of Phase 1, and outlining proposals for an extension of the system on a phased basis.  The authority have been informed that the Department will be prepared to consider proposals for the extension of the system over a reasonable number of years, on the basis of 25 per cent of the cost being financed from local authority resources and the balance from the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally agreed that the existing system of Phase 1 is now fully operational and has led to a considerable improvement in the recent traffic congestion. An increase of approximately 10 per cent to 15 per cent in traffic capacity has resulted from Phase 1.  The Deputy is right in saying that a large number of traffic lights will have to be replaced eventually and the cost is substantial.  I think it will be in excess of £10 million. We are agreeable in principle that it should be put in place.  It is reasonable to say that a contribution of 25 per cent from the local authority is not that onerous in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister has not referred to the use of benzine in unleaded petrol, which is unique to this country as it is not used in Europe or the USA.  Is he aware of the danger to people's health by the use of benzine in unleaded petrol?</P>

At that stage he undertook to examine the use of benzine in unleaded petrol both by his own Department and, indeed, through the European Community.  Can he state what consideration has been given to that issue in the meantime?  To what extent is benzine used as an additive <Col N="849" /> in unleaded petrol?  What steps does he intend to take to try to deal with the problem?</P>

      <P>I have to say that I do not have a note on that issue.  Many other substances have been dealt with in detail but I do not have any note on benzine except that the increase in the use of unleaded petrol has now reached about 18 per cent of total usage.  I will ask the Department to communicate with Deputies Gilmore and Garland on the question raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it.  It has always been recognised in the House that I am quite an articulate person and it is not difficult to hear me.  In so far as heavy goods vehicles are concerned &mdash; buses and ambulances &mdash; they are subjected to a road worthiness test annually.  Indeed, the test results have shown that pollution and smoke are not among the most common defects in commercial vehicles tested.  As far as vehicle emissions in general are concerned, they are covered by EC directives going back as far as 1970. The directive with which we are now concerned is the one which has been mandatory since 1989.  We will have very <Col N="850" /> strict United States-style standards obtaining within the EC from the end of 1992.  This concerns small car emissions. We have been pressing to have the question of these emission controls applied to larger vehicles as well, that was pursued during the Irish Presidency.</P>

      <P>This is only the second question asked on this issue.  The Minister patted himself on the back and advised the House that he had taken initiatives during the green Presidency.  I put it to him that he has taken no initiative of any nature during the course of the last six months to reduce the polluting effects of motor vehicles on our domestic environment. I would ask the Minister to acknowledge that that is the case and to indicate to the House whether any initiatives will be taken now to provide incentives to people to instal catalytic convertors on the existing motor vehicles stock so as to reduce the polluting emissions coming from such motor vehicles.</P>

      <Quest>when he expects that the by-pass at Dunleer, County Louth, will commence; the expected cost; the level of EC funding which will be made available for the project; the contract time; the expected level of employment during construction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Cangy Bridge, which is part of the proposed Dunleer by-pass, was completed earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closing date for the receipt of tenders for the main contract for the by-pass <Col N="853" /> was 22 June 1990.  My Department are currently awaiting a recommendation from Louth County Council regarding the appointment of a contractor.  Subject to the acceptability of the local authority's recommendation and subject to the provision of the usual performance bonds, insurances and a valid C2 or tax clearance certificate by the contractor, I would expect work on the main contract to commence in September and to take about three years to complete.</P>
    <P>The level of employment on construction works will be a matter for the contractor.  It is expected that the proposed by-pass, which is 10 km in length, will cost £24 million, in 1989 prices.  The Community Support Framework adopted for Ireland for the five-year period to 1993 provides for assistance at a rate of 75 per cent for improvement works on national primary routes.  The proposed by-pass is expected to qualify for this rate of EC assistance.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give the House an undertaking that his Department will contact Louth County Council in advance of their contacting him to ensure that, notwithstanding the holiday period, the finalisation of an acceptable contractor out of the tendering process would be secured and that the starting-up date, as instanced by him in September will be met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that that would not be necessary in that, on the last day of May, we sanctioned the appointment of ten engineers and some draftsmen to act as supervisory staff on the project.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing law the following facilities are provided for voting by physicially disabled electors: a disabled person who is unable to go in person to vote at his polling station may apply for registration as a special voter and vote at home; a disabled person who has difficulty in gaining access to his own polling station may apply to have his vote transferred to another polling station in the same constituency; and a disabled person who requires assistance in marking his or her ballot paper may be assisted by a companion or by the presiding officer.</P>
      <P>These arrangements provide a reasonable opportunity for voting by the different categories of physically disabled and an extension of postal voting is not proposed at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped are very anxious that the postal vote be extended to people with mobility difficulties?  Would the Minister not accept that it would be quite possible to put in place a scheme to provide for such a postal vote, with whatever attendant protections are required, to ensure that postal voting is not abused? <Col N="855" /> Would he not agree to give consideration to examining this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time this was considered here we were all agreed that the extended system of postal voting introduced in 1974 &mdash; and used again in 1985 at local elections &mdash; had not been a good exercise.  Very grave disappointment was expressed on all sides of the House concerning the way that operated.  It is not contemplated engaging in another test as far as that is concerned.  I have noted what the Deputy says with regard to the special voting system.  That matter has been considered and I will be saying something about it in the immediate future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not agreed on the last occasion about the difficulties the Minister alleges he had with the extended voting system in 1974.  Why is it that a small number of disabled persons cannot be allowed to have the postal vote while the same facility is on offer to 20 times as many university graduates who vote in Seanad elections?  What is the difference between a disabled person who cannot now be extended the postal vote and the university graduate who can be extended the postal vote for Seanad elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The experience in 1974 and 1985 when this experiment was tried was not good.  There was a certain amount of abuse at the time.  What happened during the 1985 local elections gave rise, in 1986, to the introduction of the unique system of special voting for physically disabled persons.  I have had it carefully looked at.  The experience of postal voting in the past has shown that it is open to serious abuse.  That experience is shared by other countries that I checked with.  For that reason it is not contemplated having postal voting put in place.  There are some changes in the special voting system which I will be putting before the House in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the system of registration of <Col N="856" /> those who require the special vote, as he calls it, is extremely unwieldly and that one would have to anticipate, almost a year and a half in advance of a register being published, that one would be disabled when the time came?  Would the Minister not consider simplifying the procedures so that people who find themselves becoming immobile or disabled in the period after a register is printed could also register at short notice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Deputy has a point there, and having recognised that, I have taken some steps. Matters have already been adjusted to cater for that very point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that his failure to give a postal vote to the handicapped casts aspersions on their integrity when a postal vote is allowed to the Defence Forces?  Why should the Defence Forces be considered any more people of integrity than the handicapped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are about 4,000 people registered as special voters.  I have always found, in talking to disabled people, that they do not wish to be singled out as different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that this singling out of disabled persons by the requirement that people call to their homes under the procedure that is laid down, is part of the reason for the objection to the current system?  I would suggest that the Minister would again look at this matter.  It is not a matter of great difficulty to identify persons who are disabled and immobile.  In that context it is quite easy to put in place procedures to allow for a postal vote that would ensure that there would not be abuse.  I would ask the Minister to have a further look at this matter and not assume that we should continue with a system that was put in place only some four years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Deputies.  I must say the great advantage <Col N="857" /> of the special voting arrangements is that it provides the very same security and the same protection for the voter and his ballot paper as is provided in the polling station.  Those who do not wish to avail of that can transfer their vote if they find difficulty in getting access to a particular station.  Quite a lot has been done.  In so far as postal voting is concerned, that has not been a happy experience, and we should at least learn from the experience we had on two previous occasions.</P>
      <P>As far as Deputy Owen's point is concerned, it is well taken.  I will be initiating some changes in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that it is the Minister who is singling out disabled persons.  Since, so far, he has failed to explain why he considers disabled persons to be less honest in their use of the postal vote than university graduates or members of the Defence Forces, let me ask him if it is, therefore, his intention to discontinue the postal voting arrangements for university graduates in Seanad elections or members of the Defence Forces, and to introduce for those categories the same procedures as now apply to disabled persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The postal vote at present is confined to members of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and diplomats serving abroad.  I cannot repeat it any more often, that the experience was not a good one when we had an extended postal voting system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>A toll scheme for the West Link section of the Western Parkway was approved in 1986.  Dublin County Council have not sought my approval to a toll scheme for any other part of this route.</P>
      <P>In March 1989 the Department invited proposals for a toll franchise for the Dublin Ring Road inclusive or exclusive of the existing West Link toll facility. Dublin County Council was consulted on a draft of the invitation document.  The document, and the public advertisement, made it clear that the making of a toll scheme and any agreement with private interests relating to the charging and collection of tolls were matters reserved to the elected members of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four submissions were received in response to the invitation.  The submissions were assessed in detail by a steering group representative of my Department, the Department of Finance and Dublin County Council.  On foot of a recommendation from the steering group, it was decided, again subject to the statutory procedures, to enter into detailed negotiations with a consortium led by Manufacturers Hanover Ltd., and including also Cofiroute with a view to concluding an agreement under the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979 in <Col N="859" /> relation to the ring road.  In September 1989, Dublin County Council were advised by letter of this decision.  It was made clear to the local authority that any agreement reached with the consortium would be governed by the provisions of the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979.</P>
    <P>Formal negotiations have since been taking place between the Manufacturers Hanover Consortium and the steering group.  These negotiations are practically concluded.  When the negotiations have been concluded it is intended to put the draft heads of a toll franchise agreement before Dublin County Council for their consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm to the House that he has no intention of introducing any legislation to amend the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979?  Would he not accept that a steering group exercising the functions he has described is acting in breach of that legislation and that it should be a matter for the council itself and not his Department or any steering group appointed by his Department to decide whether tolling should be applied to any particular road or motorway in county Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated positively, and it is just as well to have the opportunity to do so now, that under the 1979 Act the making of a toll scheme is a reserved function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not replied to my question.  Has he any intention of introducing any legislation to this House to in any way, amend, repeal or modify the Act of 1975; and could the Minister explain the legal basis for the steering group conducting the discussions and negotiations he has referred to because this appears to be a function solely of the local authority?  It appears to be a function solely of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I have said.  The steering group acted only in so far as everything had been put in front of <Col N="860" /> them.  It was explicitly stated in every item of transaction, in so far as this business is concerned, that it is a reserved function and that Dublin County Council have the right, and will obviously take that right, to decide on the matter.  That is quite clear and I want people to understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What were the steering group doing muddling around with the issue in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The steering group were set up to undertake the negotiations and it was agreed between all parties that they would do that, but the matter has to be referred back to final decision by the elected members.  That is what will happen if and when an agreement is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House what expenditure was incurred by the steering committee on a job that it has not yet been agreed is a reserved function of Dublin County Council? Would he not agree the cart was put before the horse?  Would he also confirm to the House that it was on his instructions that Dublin County Council erected toll booths on this road, long before the council exercised their reserved function? How much has it cost the State to erect these booths?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister directed nobody in that regard, but I presume, as with all other matters, the responsibility finally rests with me.  The steering group consist of officials of my Department together with officials from the Department of Finance and Dublin County Council.  It was recommended by the steering group that preliminary works be undertaken and, as I understand it, that was done in order to avoid any possible closure of sections of that roadway if and when Dublin County Council made a decision to apply a toll.  Explicit provision to that effect was included in the draft heads of the agreement, and they are included in the heads of the agreement currently being negotiated, but it can only <Col N="861" /> be done as a reserved function by the members of the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that experience in many countries in Europe has shown that a substantial number of commercial vehicles will not use toll roads, and that the effect of these motorways will be completely negatived by commercial vehicles using the ordinary roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presuming something.  The roads are being built and Dublin County Council have not considered whether they will allow a toll on any part of it.  The only toll that is in existence is the one at the Strawberry Beds over the Liffey, which was agreed to by Dublin County Council.  If the negotiations are concluded and Dublin County Council receive a proposal in this regard it will be a matter for them to make a decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, Dublin County Council have not exercised their reserved function to apply a toll to the Dublin ring road.  Therefore, who established the steering group to which the Minister referred?  Secondly, what extent has the public purse been involved by the establishment of that group?  Have any commitments been entered into with the company concerned? If Dublin County Council decide, as is possible, not to apply a toll to that road, is there a danger of claims for compensation from that company, and who will be responsible for the public expenditure that has already been committed to this project, which has not been authorised by the appropriate body, namely, Dublin County Council?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the Department invited proposals in so far as the <Col N="863" /> toll franchise was concerned after consultations with Dublin County Council. They had a full draft of the invitation document.  In every advertisement and in all matters of consultation that has taken place, the steering group made it quite clear to all and sundry that this is a reserved function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say any more on the matter except that the negotiations went ahead with the full agreement of Dublin County Council.  The steering group are carrying out their business and in due course if they have something to put forward by way of a proposal to Dublin County Council they will do so, but in the end, as in all such matters, Dublin County Council will be the final decision makers.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin County Council have provided eight serviced sites of which three are from the programme of 30 sites referred to.  Further action on this programme was severely disrupted as a result of a High Court ruling of May 1988 which had the effect of suspending progress on the programme pending a variation of the development plan.  The variation was formally made in June 1989 and this allowed the programme to proceed. The present position is that one site is under construction, approval to go to tender has issued for three more and a fourth, for which approval to go to tender has issued, is delayed by court action. Dublin County Council have made limited temporary arrangements to improve the conditions of some travellers on unofficial sites and I understand that further work of this nature is envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the conditions prevailing and I am concerned that the housing authority, who are primarily responsible for the accommodation of travellers, should do their utmost to alleviate their plight.  Furthermore, the necessary capital finance is available for any proposals for halting sites brought forward by Dublin County Council and approved by me.  In the circumstances I do not consider it appropriate, having <Col N="866" /> regard to the council's overall responsibilities, to take up the invitation referred to in the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of slow progress being made on the 1986 plan, would the Minister accept that the revised plan of 1986, which was piloted through Dublin County Council by his colleague, the Minister for Communications, is now in tatters and has failed to settle travellers in the Dublin area?  Many of the sites which were identified in the plan are no longer available.  The time has come for the Minister to take overall national responsibility for the settlement of travellers. He should bring forward a set of proposals to deal with this long, outstanding problem on a national basis once and for all, in view of the failure of local authorities to deal effectively with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to agree with the Deputy and say I am disappointed at the pace at which the programmes are proceeding.  Court action has stalled many of these sites from being made available for travellers.  There has always been difficulty in this area.  However, some movement is taking place and, as the Deputy knows, responsibility rests with the local authorities.  I think there is a genuine willingness on the part of local authorities to do something positive, but they are being frustrated not only in Dublin but throughout the country.  This would apply no matter who is in charge. Councillors have a right to be involved in the process and I am satisfied that the vast majority of them take their responsibilities very seriously and I think we will see movement with regard to the provision of sites.  One must consider that money is available, the capital allocation is quite substantial and is enough to cater for what is required, but if any extra moneys are needed, I will make them available.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the local authorities and to all Members on local authorities to try to impress on their executives the need to do something about this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not <Col N="867" /> agree that part of the reason there is so much objection to the settlement of travellers is that the Minister has not made sufficient funds available to Dublin County Council and other local authorities to keep the sites in order?  Would the Minister reconsider the situation and make capital funds available for the maintenance of the sites after they have been set up thus fostering better relations between the settled and the travelling communities?  The reason so many legal actions are being taken is that people do not believe that the resources are available to keep the sites clean and tidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This point has been made on a number of occasions.  However, apart from the £3 million capital allocation that has been made available to local authorities to provide the appropriate accommodation for travellers, there is an additional £1 million for associated expenses, such as social workers.  I think that is a positive step.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the collapse of the 1986 plan and the faults inherent in the plan arise directly from election commitments given in the course of the 1985 local elections by his colleague, the Minister for Communications, and his other colleagues on Dublin County Council, whereby the previous plan was abandoned and a new plan introduced, which four years later has been shown to be totally ineffective and a failure as far as the settlement of travellers is concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan, which envisaged settlements on 30 sites, was adopted in 1986.  The matter was challenged in the High Court and action was suspended until 1988, because it was stated that it was contrary to the development plan. Only when the variation in the develoment plan was put in place, did the settlement plan have a chance of being effective.  It is not that long since that obstacle was cleared and since then, as I have stated, several sites have been constructed but a further site is being obstructed pending court action.  In fairness, it must be said that the plan was good but it was frustrated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these three questions together.  I am taking this opportunity to express in public, as I have done in private, my sympathy and the sympathy of the House with the families of the four officers who so tragically lost their lives last Saturday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I appointed Captain William A. Kirwan, marine surveyor in my Department, as inspector to report to me as soon as possible on the circumstances of this tragic loss and on the steps to be taken to prevent a recurrence. Captain Kirwan, as a duly appointed inspector under the Merchant Shipping Acts, has full powers of entry and inspection, may summon witnesses, may require and enforce the production of documents and may administer oaths.  I am confident that he has full statutory <Col N="872" /> authority and the expertise to carry out this inquiry fully and thoroughly.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that I would not wish to prejudge Captain Kirwan's inquiry by making statements based on preliminary reports or by responding to initial claims or assertions. However, I have been informed, that the board, management and fishery inspectors had total confidence in the boat and that it was crewed by experienced men. The most experienced officer on board, Mr. Haussmann, was safety officer.  I have been informed that all crew had recently undergone training, including basic sea survival, with the Naval Service at Haulbowline, County Cork.  Three of the four who died were wearing flotation suits.  I have also been informed by the board that the boat was fitted with a radio and that it was operating on the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Can he tell the House if there was flare equipment on board the boat and why some sign did not emerge from it before it sank?  Can he also advise the House of the qualifications of the skipper on board and whether any of the five men were fully qualified to operate the boat?  Finally, does the Minister intend to make public the full details of this report?  I believe the publication of this report and the details surrounding this terrible tragedy would be in the interests of the families concerned.  I should like to extend my sympathy to those families.  Does the Minister envisage in the longer term amending the legislation in relation to the use of monofilament net which caused this tragedy and other tragedies in the recent past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the supplementary questions <i>seriatim.</i> It is a complete mystery why no sign or signal emerged from the boat.  This will be one of the major points to be explored by Captain Kirwan.  I am convinced that the personnel on board were fully qualified to operate the boat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to making the details of <Col N="873" /> the report public, it has not been the custom to publish the details of such inquiries.  I believe that the relatives should be consulted.  In many cases the relatives do not wish details to be published. But if I get the full agreement of the relatives in this case I should like to publish the report.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that I have to reject the suggestion that the issue of the use of monofilament nets had anything to do with this accident.  The Deputy knows well that the use of nets for salmon, no matter what their material, is illegal at weekends.  Consequently if that was their mission, it had nothing to do with monofilament nets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister the section and Act under which the investigation will be conducted and whether the evidence which will be submitted will be sworn evidence?  Would he consider having a public sworn inquiry into this accident in view of the fact that the boat used by these fishermen had, for certain reasons, not been used for a considerable period of time, and in view of the apparent ineffectivenes of the men's survival suits and the lack of a rescue signal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The inquiry will be held under section 729 (1) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which states, and I quote:</P>
      <P>An inspector so appointed...</P>
      <P> (a)  may go on board any ship and inspect the same or any part thereof, or any of the machinery, boats, equipments, or articles on board thereof to which the provisions of this Act apply, not unnecessarily detaining or delaying her from proceeding on voyage; and</P>
      <P>(b)  may enter and inspect any premises, the entry or inspection of which appears to him to be requisite or the purpose of the report which he is directed to make; and,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  may, by summons under his hand, require the attendance of all such persons as he thinks fit to call <Col N="874" /> before him and examine for the purpose of his report, and may require answers or returns to any inquiries he thinks fit to make; and</P>
    <P>(d)  may require or enforce the production of all books, papers, or documents which he considers important for the purpose of his report; and</P>
    <P>(e)  may administer oaths, or may, in lieu of requiring or administering an oath, require every person examined by him to make and subscribe a declaration of the truth of the statements made by him in his examination.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Those are the conditions and powers &mdash; and they are pretty extensive and strong &mdash; under which Captain Kirwan will be acting.  If oaths are required he is empowered to take evidence on oath.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suits used by the fishermen, I will await Captain Kirwan's report on this issue.  As the House knows, one man survived &mdash; I spoke to him last night in Cork &mdash; and his evidence will be very important.  Mr. Haussmann was barely alive when he was taken on board and regrettably died immediately afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the Minister in extending sympathy to the families of this terrible tragedy.  The Minister said in his reply that there was a radio on board the vessel.  When a crew are on such a mission would there normally be contact between the vessel and land at all times?  Secondly, can the Minister say why the emergency beacon alarm, if there was one on board this vessel, which would have pinpointed the location of the accident failed to go off?  Can he indicate to the House why the boat's reputedly unsinkable ballast failed to maintain the boat afloat on this occasion?  Can he offer any explanation why three out of the four men failed to survive with the new survival units or buoyancy aids which had just been recently supplied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There was radio contact <Col N="875" /> between the boat and a mobile radio unit on shore.  The big mystery is why no radio contact was made.  No message came and the terrifying part of it is that what happened took place so quickly there was no time for any of the crew to make radio contact with the shore.  The general belief was that even if the boat turned over it would not have sunk.  However, it did sink and Captain Kirwan will have to investigate this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the flotation suits used were not adequate &mdash; it has now been conclusively proved that they were inadequate &mdash; what plans have the Minister's Department to introduce alternative equipment?  Are his Department investigating the possibility of a submarine being the cause of the sinking of this vessel given the fact that it was expected to float even if it capsized?  Will the Minister give an indication to the House why the officers were not wearing life saving jackets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Life saving jackets are not regarded as being as efficient as what the officers were wearing.  It seems to me that it was the length of time in the sea, rather than the quality of what they were wearing, which caused the deaths.  I am now speaking tentatively and I await the expert sifting of evidence by Captain Kirwan.  I had not thought of the possibility of a submarine causing the accident but both my Department and the Garda have asked the Navy to identify where the boat is and to recover it.  This will be very important in coming to a conclusion about what happened.</P>

      <P>Four people who were wearing buoyancy suits are now dead.  Has the Minister any indication why it took so long for emergency assistance to be made available to these four men?  One man was in the water for about five and a half hours.  Why was the lifeboat not notified earlier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to outline to the House the factual details of what occurred last Friday in the aftermath of the Leixlip bank robbery as relayed to me by the Garda authorities. At approximately 10.10 a.m. on 6 July 1990, two masked and armed men entered the Bank of Ireland branch at Captain's Hill, Leixlip, County Kildare. They held staff and customers at gunpoint and took approximately £2,000. <Col N="878" /> They left the bank and were seen by witnesses to get into a green car which sped off towards the city.  The alarm was raised and all Garda mobile patrols were alerted.  The car was spotted near the Phoenix Park by a garda in a patrol car and a chase ensued.</P>
      <P>The suspect vehicle was driven at speed through the Navan Road-Castleknock area and on to the dual carriageway on the new Finglas Road.  Other Garda cars had joined the chase at this stage and one of these attempted to stop the suspect car's progress by blocking the inward lane of the carriageway.  The passenger fired a shot at the member in the Garda car who replied by discharging a single shot. The suspect car then crossed to the incorrect side of the carriageway and drove against oncoming traffic pursued by a number of Garda cars.  At Claremont Court a garda sergeant managed to draw abreast of the car.  The passenger again discharged a shot at him and he fired a single shot in return.  The chase continued into the Glasnevin area where there was a further exchange of single shots.  At Richmond Road the passenger again discharged a shot into a pursuing Garda car but fire was not returned by the garda at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pursued car eventually drove into Upper Fairview Avenue where it collided with a parked car.  One person leaned out of the window and discharged a number of shots at gardaí, hitting the windscreen of a Garda car.  The suspect car then drove along the footpath and attempted to force its way through a number of marked and unmarked Garda cars.  It collided with one car and came to a halt. A number of shots were fired at gardaí who returned fire.  The two people in the pursued car were seriously injured and conveyed by ambulance to the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals where they were later pronounced dead.  Two gardaí were also slightly injured.  Gardaí recovered four firearms from the suspect car, including a double barrelled sawn-off shotgun, a pistol and two revolvers.  As is usual in such cases, a Garda chief superintendent from outside the area of command where the incidents occurred has <Col N="879" /> been appointed by the Commissioner to conduct an investigation into what happened.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of deep regret that two lives were lost in the aftermath of the bank robbery.  The loss of human life is always regrettable in any circumstances. It is, however, an unfortunate fact of life in these times that gardaí have to use their weapons to defend themselves in the performance of their duties.  The Garda are to be commended for their actions in cornering the pursued car at Fairview.  That the people concerned chose to shoot it out with gardaí is very unfortunate and they paid the ultimate penalty for making that decision.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that an inquest will be held into the circumstances surrounding the two deaths in question and, accordingly, it is not my intention to say anything here today which might, in any conceivable way, be interpreted as prejudging the findings of the inquest which is, of course, an inquiry provided for by law to investigate deaths such as these.</P>

I am sorry the robbers acted as they did and brought about their own deaths, but what were they doing there in the first instance? They were out on bail because our bail laws are the most lax in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister not agree that a constitutional referendum is necessary if we are to give back to the courts the necessary discretion to refuse bail where there is a likelihood of further offences being committed by an accused?  Does he not accept that almost 3,000 crimes will be committed this year by persons on bail?  Finally, does he not accept that a golden opportunity arises next November to coincide with the necessary referendum which I have proposed in the <Col N="880" /> past at nominal cost, namely the Presidential election?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The grounds on which bail may be refused were clearly set out by the Supreme Court in the case of The People <i>v.</i> O'Callaghan in 1966 and reaffirmed by that court in 1988 in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> Ryan.  The Supreme Court held that bail cannot be refused merely because there is a likelihood of the commission of further offences by the accused while on bail.  In regard to the numbers who committed offences while on bail, it is interesting to note that in 1983 the number of offences committed was 8,295.  In 1989 that figure had reduced to 2,647.  I believe that drop is due in some measure to the provisions in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 providing for consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail and extending the jurisdiction of the District Court in relation to such offences.  It is understood that the courts are implementing these provisions.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point about the concern in relation to the availability of bail.  The two people involved were out on bail, having been charged with serious offences.  I take note of the Deputy's suggestion of a referendum in the matter of the courts having discretion to refuse bail, but I would not like to mislead him by suggesting it would take place in November.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm that the inquiry of the Chief Superintendent of An Garda Síochána will be for internal purposes only?  Will he not agree that the coroner's inquest is very specifically constrained by the Coroners' Act, and that in view of the serious extent of the incidents here there is a need for him to <Col N="881" /> convene a more public and open inquiry into the circumstances?  Will he give regard to that?</P>
    <P>Secondly, has he addressed the fact that Leixlip town where the offence occurred is the largest town in Kildare and is the only one without a Garda station? Has he considered to what extent the absence of proper policing in the area is a factor that may have contributed to this crime being committed in the first place?  Finally, will he confirm that, so far as his information goes, only two people were involved in this from the outset? The number of weapons recovered would seem to suggest more may have been involved.  Will he comment on that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Garda investigation into the incident on Friday last, it is not the practice to publish reports of such matters.  Of course, such reports are given full consideration and the Deputy can be assured that any action considered appropriate is taken.  The inquest is public.</P>
      <P>As far as Leixlip is concerned, at the moment my Department are examining the suitability of a number of premises for use as a Garda substation.  It would be a substation to Lucan.  Deputies may be assured that there will be no delay in opening a substation in Leixlip once a suitable building has been located.</P>
      <P>In regard to the availability of a station and the effect that would have had, I suggest that the presence of a Garda station or a substation in itself would not have prevented the occurrence of a robbery such as that which took place in Leixlip last Friday, as these things happen in other areas all the time where there are stations.</P>
      <P>In regard to the number of people involved, the information I have given in the original answer is from the report I got from the Garda authorities and only two people were mentioned in that report, but there were four guns in the car.</P>

      <P>Let me draw the Minister's attention to the fact that among the similarities between the incident at <Col N="882" /> Leixlip last Friday and the unfortunate incident earlier in the year in Athy was that on both occasions the offenders were out on bail.  This is the key to the entire problem.  Does the Minister accept that thousands of crimes are being committed annually by offenders who are out on bail at the time the offence is committed? Does he not now accept that the time is right for the introduction of a comprehensive bail Bill that will set out clearly and unambiguously the circumstances under which the courts may grant bail to offenders?  Does he accept that we have perhaps the most lenient bail regime in Europe?  What steps does he as Minister for Justice intend to take to rid our streets of this &ldquo;Bonnie and Clyde&rdquo; activity?  How many more shootouts are we to have before the Minister is prepared to set out in detail the strict criteria laid down by the courts regarding persons who habitually appear before the courts and get bail when the fact that they are out on bail on a charge which is likely to attract, if convicted, a lengthy prison sentence is a further inducement to these people to have a final go and commit a final crime before being brought before the courts?</P>

Is he aware of <Col N="883" /> the number of robberies that have taken place in that general region over the past 12 months or so?  Does he propose to initiate any procedures to deter this activity?  Finally, will he accept that perhaps had a Garda substation been established in the area, though the lack of such was not particularly responsible on this occasion, the delay might not have occurred?  Would the Minister agree that a substation could have been provided there long before now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Garda authorities have already recognised the need for a sub-station in Leixlip.  Premises are being acquired for that purpose, but it would be ludicrous to suggest that the presence of a Garda station or substation in itself would have prevented the occurrence of the robbery.  Of course, north Kildare, like every other area, is constantly being monitored by the Garda in relation to how they can improve cover and prevent crime of every type, armed robbery or otherwise.</P>

      <P>However, I feel that policing in north Kildare is inadequate to deal with the spiralling population.  Armed robberies have become a regular occurrence in this area.  I just appeal to the Minister to take immediate action, and the type of action I would like to see is more gardaí on the beat and the provision of a full station in Leixlip.</P>

      <P>Policing problems are a priority with me and with the Garda authorities. I have acknowledged that there is a need for a Garda sub-station in Leixlip. At the moment my Department are examining the suitability of a number of premises in Leixlip for use as a Garda station.  Deputy Power can be assured that there will not be any delay in opening a substation once a suitable building has been located.  The new station will be a substation of the Lucan Garda station.  It will serve as a centre for patrolling the Leixlip area, including foot patrols in the town.  Normal station services will be provided there in relation to such matters as production of driving licences and motor insurance certificates, certification of passport applications etc.  On the question of additional gardaí for the area, the Deputy will be aware that in the 1990 Estimates the Government provided extra funding to increase the number of trainees to be taken on.  There are approximately 300 in training in Templemore at the moment.  I will bring the Deputy's concern about north Kildare to the attention of the Commissioner with a view to securing additional manpower for the north Kildare area from the present batch of recruits.</P>

Would he accept an offer from the Opposition, certainly the main Opposition Party, Fine Gael, to co-operate in getting any necessary legislation through, so that the necessary amendment to the Constitution can be made to coincide with the presidential election in November? It is very clear that a constitutional amendment is necessary.  It is very clear that the courts do not now have discretion. Would the Minister accept an offer of co-operation from Fine Gael to ensure that the necessary legislation is put through the House so that it can be put to the people next November, when <Col N="885" /> I have no doubt it would be carried by an enormous majority.</P>

      <P>In relation to the incident, when the information is available to us, will the Minister assure us that there was no other way of dealing with the raiders in the circumstances and that efforts had been made to confine the motor car, to avoid the escape and so on?

      <P>As I outlined in my original reply this was not just an incident that occurred at the fatal moment as it has been described by Deputy McCartan. This had been a chase right across the north city area &mdash; Castleknock, Navan Road, Finglas, and down through Glasnevin &mdash; with shots being fired at gardaí who were risking their lives to protect the citizens of this country.  The gardaí were doing their duty on behalf of our citizens and I have no intention of initiating a further inquiry.  A normal inquiry has already been set in train by the Garda authorities with a chief superintendent in charge.  As far as recent incidents are concerned, the Garda should be congratulated on what they achieved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I apologise for the Minister for Labour who was away on official business when the question was submitted.  I am glad to be here to answer on the Minister's behalf.</P>
      <P>The Irish Press Group of Newspapers employs over 700 people and is losing £1.75 million in the current year.  In an effort to turn around this loss-making situation management undertook a major rationalisation programme to ensure the group's future viability.  A major injection of funds was made earlier this year by Ingersoll Publications Limited.</P>
      <P>Proposals for over 200 redundancies among other requirements were put to the unions involved in April.  Negotiations continued without agreement and the company then set a deadline of eight weeks in which a package would be finalised or the company would close. That deadline runs out on 23 July, that is in just over a week's time.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court have made every effort to find a settlement and on 27 June issued a detailed 17-page recommendation concerning redundancy, fiveshift working, loss of earnings, annual leave and other claims.  The recommendation was voted on and rejected by the unions involved, with the exception of SIPTU whose workers accepted the recommendation subject to certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Management have set a deadline for closure in just over a week's time.  The Minister invited representatives of management to meet him today to discuss the present position.  It is clear that the situation is extremely serious.  Indeed, arrangements for the winding down of the company are already in train.  The management have informed the Minister that they would like to continue in the business of producing the three titles involved but they cannot see how this can <Col N="889" /> be done with such large losses without major restructuring.</P>
    <P>The situation as of now is that the group are now winding down.  Only days remain to reconsider the position.  The Minister appeals to the parties to get together for a last effort to save the three newspapers and the hundreds of jobs involved.  The Labour Court and its services remain available to the parties should they wish to avail of them.</P>

Does the Minister accept that the time has come in this critical dispute for the intervention of the Minister for Labour.  Will the Minister agree to avail of this opportunity to clarify some of the distortions that surround this dispute, like the fact that this is an asset rich company whose property is rapidly appreciating and that the company have a substantial income from their Reuter's shares?  Will the Minister accept that the drastic programme of redundancies agreed with the trade unions offers the company the prospect of an early return to profitability?  Will the Minister agree that this is part of a game plan by the new owners to break the unions in the company?  Will the Minister agree to communicate to the public that the distortion about five-shift-working will mean that employees will be working seven nights in a row followed by two nights off during which they will be on call?  Will the Minister accept that in 1990 they are effectively sweat shop conditions and that there is an obligation on the Minister for Labour, in order to protect the 500 jobs after redundancies and the three reputable newspapers, to make a clear statement apportioning blame where it should rest in this dispute?</P>

I told the Deputy that he had already gone on official business when the question was tabled.  The Deputy in pointing the finger at me was trying to denigrate me when I am doing what any other Minister would do when asked to stand in for a colleague, which is to deal with the issue as competently as possible.  The Deputy made assertions about asset piling and so on and I am not competent to respond to them.  I do not think any person would seek to answer those assertions in this forum.  The Deputy referred to game plans and distortions, words which I submit are dangerous to use in such a dispute; they do not do the case any good. The Minister, Members, the public and the workers involved are very concerned at the perilous stage the dispute has reached.

My remarks relate to the gravity of the dispute and for that reason I regret the Minister for Labour is absent.  Will the Minister agree that the time has come for the intervention of the Minister for Labour?  The Labour Court have failed to resolve this dispute and I should like to ask the Minister if she will agree that the intervention by the Minister for Labour ought not to be made on the basis of his chances of succeeding or not?  This dispute concerns the future of three newspapers and I would have though that the Minister, like us all, would have been anxious to ensure that they continue to publish.  It also concerns more than 500 jobs and only the personal intervention of the Minister at this stage, against the hard-nosed management who have taken over Irish Press Limited, is likely to guarantee the jobs and the future of the newspapers.</P>

      <P>The House has been discussing for a number of months the Industrial Relations Bill and I should like to ask the Minister if it is her view that at a time when we are endeavouring to update industrial relations legislation it is unfortunate that we have the type of information emanating from management indicating that the nub of the dispute is whether there should be a five day or a four day week, which is not correct?  Will the Minister accept that what is being offered to the workers puts back the hands of the clock many years, particularly when one takes into consideration that if the proposals of management are accepted it is likely that members of the staff will be asked to work 11 weekends without a break?  That is not acceptable in this day and age.  Will the Minister agree that the employees of the company have a just case and that there is a need for intervention by the Minister for Labour?</P>

Report Stage is Report Stage and nothing has happened that should alter what is required of Report Stage.

It is as I have indicated to the Deputy.  I thought the Deputy perhaps was going to ask in that regard whether, if two amendments were being taken together, the Deputy in whose name the second amendment stood would automatically lose his right to reply, which strictly according to Standing Orders he or she does.  We will proceed now with the <Col N="1047" /> debate in the fashion I have indicated to the Deputy.

Amendment No. 7 in my name has been rejected by the Ceann Comhairle in a letter to me.  Let me also state that no less than five of my amendments have been rejected.  I do not think this is in keeping with the spirit of the resolution we passed this morning, item No. 9, that there would be a bit of give and take and a broad view would be taken.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is well aware of the circumstances in which the Committee Stage of the Bill was taken.  The Committee Stage of the Bill was not dealt with in the normal way because of the way in which the Second Stage was dealt with. I appeal to the House to allow these amendments to stand.  They are all relevant although they have been rejected.</P>

      <P>Deputy Garland, the circumstances may change <i>temporamutantur,</i> they do not change in respect of Standing Orders &mdash; unless the <Col N="1048" /> House has changed Standing Orders &mdash; and that unfortunately is the position the Chair must maintain.  The Chair is not responsible for nuances or circumstances outside the responsibility of the Chair. The Chair is obligated to carry out the duties of the Chair in the fashion I have indicated.  Every day of the week Deputies have regrets that what they would wish for is not included but if the Standing Order does not allow it, that is it.  It is as short and as brutal as that.  Can we proceed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, line 6, after &ldquo;telegraphy&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and to enable the Minister for Communications to restrict by statute the revenue available to RTE, for <Col N="1052" /> the purposes of securing additional revenue for independent, privately-owned, radio and television stations.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The effect or the intent of the legislation is precisely to restrict by law the capacity of RTE to increase their premiums.  The Minister has already the power to control an increase in the licence fee and he has already indicated to the House that he will not allow RTE to increase their licence fee.  I have no doubt that that has certain political implications and for that reason he is not prepared to incur the wrath once again of the public in this regard.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the declared intent of looting RTE's revenue from any advertising is to benefit the new third television channel, without any strings attached.  What is even more important is the likely effect &mdash; this has been the subject of very lengthy and at times acrimonious debate in this House &mdash; of what the Minister is trying to achieve.  Something which must also be taken into account and which in the long-term might be far more damaging is the effect this will have on the introduction of a further programme for national recovery.  It is essential, as we face 1992, that there is another programme. I would see this as being potentially very dangerous by virtue of the fact that the Minister has now embarked on a situation where he will make people within RTE redundant.  It is being done under the provisions of the law by the Minister using his voting strength in the House.  Despite the outcry from the Opposition speakers he has insisted on going down that road and not heeding the warning shots that were fired at him across the Floor.  I would imagine this will be something akin to the rod licence dispute, it will be protracted and the long-term effects will be much more damaging. For that reason we feel compelled to move this amendment which is a statement of fact as to what the Minister is trying to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak on the amendment in my name on behalf of The Workers' Party, that is, that the <Col N="1053" /> title of this Bill should be altered in substance. On the face of it, it may appear to be a somewhat trite argument to be engaging in, that the Title of a Bill should be at issue at any stage in the debate.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the history of this Bill, in particular the fact that, in its original draft form, drawn to our attentiontion in April last in advance of the commencement of this session when we were circulated with a list of schedules, and when it was referred to as a miscellaneous provisions Bill, the Title as drafted by the Minister was, I suppose, apt.</P>
      <P>I made the point on Committee Stage that I had no doubt that the Bill, as originally intended by the Minister, would be substantially the Bill currently circulated running from section 5 onwards; that sections 2 to 4, inclusive, constituted issues that arose at a very late stage in this session, precipitated by alarm bells ringing in certain quarters in the independent private radio broadcasting sector backed-up by echoes of arguments the Minister had heard over his years in office from the print media, fortified by his particular hopes of an early birth of TV3. For all of those reasons sections 2 to 4, inclusive, were cobbled together and tagged on to the Bill when it was just about to be published.  That is my view of the history of this Bill.  I simply make the point again, acknowledging that that version has not been contradicted by the Minister at any stage and I believe it to be correct for all to see.</P>
      <P>In reciting that short history for what it is worth I should say that apparently the Minister overlooked extending the Title of the Bill because its Title, as it stands at present, in its primary statement is:</P>
      <P>An Act to make further provision in relation to broadcasting and wireless telegraphy and for this purpose...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It then goes on to recite the amendment of the other Acts passed by this House, those of 1960 to 1979, 1988 and 1926 to 1988.  I understand the purpose of a Title of a Bill to be to reflect its essence, what it is about.  I contend this Bill is far more <Col N="1054" /> than simply effecting additional miscellaneous additions to previous Acts.  It is for that reason I believe its Title should be extended to reflect its true import and intent, as eventually launched by the Minister.  My amendment proposes, in line 10, after &ldquo;1988,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    <P>To provide for a restriction on the capacity of Radio Telefís Éireann to raise revenue from advertising with a view to promoting the interests of privately owned broadcasting stations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then to finish the Title by adding the words:</P>
    <P>And to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>It would be grossly misleading for the Minister to ask this House to pass this Bill as simply a miscellaneous provisions Bill which is presented as something additional, tagged on to existing primary legislation, containing nothing new of primary instance.</P>
    <P>The concept of the capping of advertising is an entirely new one.  The Bill, as circulated originally, which talked about the restriction on the rights of RTE, as a broadcaster is an entirely new departure on the part of the Minister.  Furthermore its third, most pertenent aspect, the notion of positive discrimination in favour of the private, independent radio and television broadcasting sector is also a wholly new departure.  Because these features represent such a fundamental and wholly new departure in the history of broadcasting legislation, it is essential that its Title be amended to recite and acknowledge those facts.</P>
    <P>In saying what I have I am happy to support the amendment of the Title, as suggested by Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan on behalf of The Labour Party.  I should say The Workers' Party will be supporting that amendment, since it will be the first question to be put.  Equally we acknowledge Deputy Today O'Sullivan's attention to detail in his amendment No. 71, recommending that, in its short Title, the Bill should when enacted reflect the public view and be cited henceforth &mdash;<Col N="1055" /> and I contend it will be whether or not we change its Title &mdash; not simply as the Broadcasting Act, 1990 as is suggested in amendment No. 71 but as the Restriction of Public Broadcasting Act, 1990.  In essence that is what the Bill is about and will be if passed in its present form.</P>
    <P>There are two precedents to which I might refer in terms of how the Title of a Bill should be drafted.  I have to hand the Radio and Television Act, 1988, which was the legislation introduced in this House to establish the Independent Radio and Television Commission, to give it its powers, functions and ancillary authority.  It recites the various different Acts that are to be amended and added to.  Its title states at the outset:</P>
    <P>An Act to provide for the establishment of an Independent Radio and Television Commission, having the functions of entering into contracts for the provision of sound broadcasting services and television programmes.</P>
    <P>It then went on to talk about the Acts that would be amended.  The Title clearly states what that Act was about, the establishment of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  The Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, establishing the RTE Authority stated in its Title:</P>
    <P>An Act to enable an authority to be established for the purpose of providing a national television and sound broadcasting service...</P>
    <P>And then went on to recite various Acts passed before then needing to be amended.</P>
    <P>Therefore I contend that the Title of this Bill &mdash; if it is to properly reflect what it is all about &mdash; should now contain a statement of what the Bill is doing in essence, incorporating the new feature it introduces, that of positively discriminating in favour of the private independent sector, and then go on to miscellaneously add to and amend existing legislation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to introduce his own phrase, of pitch levelling or whatever else he likes to suggest, inelegantly, the <Col N="1056" /> Bill is all about, I have no objection.  He has no such amendment tabled.  Therefore I would invite him to accept the amendment in the name of The Workers' Party or indeed that of the Labour Party either of which would meet the primary principles involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be supporting amendments Nos. 1 or 2 because I contend that the second part of both is misleading.  The second part of amendment No. 1. reads:</P>
      <P>...for the purposes of securing additional revenue for independent, privately-owned, radio and television stations.</P>
      <P>I contend that the Bill, if enacted in its present state, will benefit nobody in this State.  Certainly, it will not benefit independent radio and television stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Title says that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It clearly implies that. While I have no difficulty whatever with the short title proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan, I think that the second part of the additional long title proposed is misleading. The fact of the matter, and it is worth repeating, is that the Minister has got himself into a major bind on this issue which will come back to haunt him and his Government within months.  It not only removes from RTE all incentive for enterprise but all discretion from the Minister to moderate things in the light of experience.  It is clear that in the absence of an alternative Irish TV channel, advertising leakage will be out of the State to stations based in Belfast and London and satellite stations based in London and elsewhere.  That is a central criticism of this Bill and of the Minister's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity, in this first contribution on Report Stage, to urge the Minister to go back a little more than he has and at least take discretion so that if he does make a hames of it, at least he has reserved authority to moderate the worst excesses of what he is proposing. The removal of all discretion from the <Col N="1057" /> Minister makes no sense.  That act alone will ensure that advertising will pour out to UTV, Channel Four, Harlech, Sky, Eurosport, Super etc.  It will also mean that many of the advertisements currently created in Dublin by Irish artists and film makers will be made elsewhere.</P>
    <P>To that extent the title as proposed to be amended by the Labour Party and The Workers' Party does not accurately reflect what will be the effect of this Bill if it is enacted unless further significant amendments are introduced by the Minister during the course of this debate.  I have no difficulty in amending the long title to enable the Minister for Communications to restrict, by statute, the revenue available to RTE.  That accurately describes what the Bill proposes to do.  The second part of the amendment would be inaccurate and it would be wrong of this House to pass it with that title.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to the protests at the effective downgrading of a very effective independent public service broadcasting station which is being done in a very arrogant, dogmatic way by the Government.  I hope the steps now being taken by the Government will not jeopardise the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> when discussions take place later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very surprised that the usually very vocal pressure groups in this country are relatively muted in their response to this Bill.  I met some members of the RTE unions recently and left them under no illusions that I felt that the response of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other sectors within our community such as the IFA and teachers' unions who have an interest in the protection of an effective broadcasting station was very muted compared with their response to other legislation introduced in the past.  It is a sad day for the democratic process when the Opposition is left on its own to protect the rights of a public service broadcasting station.  I wonder that the members of these organisations have not questioned the fact that their leaders have not been very vociferous in the protection of a vital <Col N="1058" /> service for the public.  In the past they have been very vocal on issues that did not even affect them, but on an issue that affects every sector of our community we are getting relative silence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, our spokesperson for communications, will indicate in a moment the view we have in the Labour Party which is that we do not feel much use is to be served by the grouping suggested, but we can come to that in a moment.</P>
      <P>At the moment I am speaking on No. 1.  On No. 1 and No. 2 which has been moved by Deputy McCartan, once again I would say that either of the formulations suggested by way of change of title to the Bill would be of great benefit.  Let me say, purely from a very conservative viewpoint, that there is, from the point of view of draughtsmanship, an absolute responsibility for a Bill to describe in its title what the main provisions of the Bill are.  As outlined by Deputy McCartan, in the case of the Broadcasting Act and also in relation to the Act which established the IRTC in so far as they were new matters envisaged in the legislation which could not be reasonably derived from the legislation that was referred to in the title, it was felt that it was appropriate both for the sake of clarity and of respecting the integrity of the legislation involved, that the clear intention of the Bill be established.</P>
      <P>Let us be perfectly clear on this.  If this Bill goes through with the title that it has it will be departing from established practice in relation to the existing broadcasting legislation that exists at present. Let me illustrate what I am saying.  In relation to the title as it is circulated in the Bill on Report Stage it is described:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Act to make further provision in <Col N="1059" /> relation to broadcasting and wireless telegraphy and for this purpose to amend the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1960 to 1979, the Radio and Television Act, 1988, and the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, of 1926 to 1988, and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    <P>Clearly what is proposed in the legislation before us cannot, under any interpretation, be regarded as making further provision in terms of the concepts that are the base of the Broadcasting Authority Acts 1960 to 1979 or of the Radio and Television Act, 1988.  For example, one could not make fit adequately either of these legislative instruments the concept of revenue capping, the concept of moving revenue to the independent sector, or the original proposals which were to seek a limit on an editorial function, or yet again the question which was proposed again in the Bill, mark 1, to interfere with the licence fee.  If it is not a further provision in relation to the bones of any of those enabling pieces of legislation one must then rely on the last few words which are &ldquo;provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is not reference in the legislation which has been quoted by me and by Deputy McCartan which would justify the principal measures that are being taken in this Bill.  None of the legislation referred to made any provision for the capping of advertising revenue.  I will not now go into whether in fact this entire enterprise is legal or constitutional.  I suspect that it is certainly in breach of the principles of the Constitution, a matter we intend to take up later.  What we are talking about in amendments Nos. 1 and 2 is the adequacy of the title.  The Labour Party amendment states: &ldquo;to enable the Minister for Communications to restrict by statute the revenue available to RTE,&rdquo;.  That is what the legislation does. It is the core of the Bill.  The amendment continues: &ldquo;for the purpose of securing <Col N="1060" /> additional revenue for independent, privately-owned, radio and television stations.&rdquo; That is indeed where the revenue which will be prohibited to RTE will be directed.</P>
    <P>Equally, The Workers' Party amendment, which I have no difficulty with, stresses the restriction on RTE to raise revenue from advertising, with a view to promoting the interests of privatelyowned broadcasting stations.  It is more than just being coy and simply being evasive, it is not merely being in any sense academic or pedantic that the Minister, in doing this, has not stated his intentions in the title of the Bill, as his predecessors did in regard to broadcasting.  He has not the courage to do so.  When the IRTC and the RTE Authority were established the Minister stated his intentions.  Why conceal in antique wrapping paper what is a most sinister intention?  I have no doubt that this is disreputable for the House.  It is cosmetic and is wrapping in an antiquated form something that has an immediate and definite effect.</P>
    <P>Before I stood up to speak I had an opportunity of looking across the road at members of Actors Equity, now members of SIPTU, elderly people who are very likely be fired from their jobs in RTE because of the capping of advertising. As if that is not bad enough, the Minister is seeking to do this by a legislative instrument in which he has not the courage to state his intentions.  This unique legislation, not only in terms of its consequences, does not even merit description of the Minister's primary intention.  When you consider all the sections, the sting is in section 2 in regard to advertising.  Most of the debate in this House was about the concept of advertising and the nature of the capping of advertising revenue.  Now that the Minister has, in a very macho way, decided that nobody shall budge him, irrespective of the consequences, his courage should extend to declaring his intentions in the Title, as any honest legislator would do.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I am concerned that we are spending so long on this part of the Bill we will forget to <Col N="1061" /> deal with the real meat of it.  While this matter is very important, I accept what my colleague Deputy Mitchell, has said, that the second part of the amendment certainly does not cover UTV or any of the other stations that will benefit from the capping of advertising, which is the core of the Bill.  I will give good example by not spending any longer on this amendment.  I hope some agreement will be reached.  In the long run it may be very important from a technical point of view but will not do much for RTE.</P>

      <P>I regret very much the Minister's response, but at this stage we have become accustomed to that type of evasiveness and curt response which has been associated with him.  The Minister insists on portraying himself as the quintessential tough man of this House, and as a result the legislation has suffered <Col N="1062" /> and broadcasting will suffer in the long run.  Once again the Minister is showing his complete contempt for the parliamentary procedures of this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the comments of those who participated in the debate.  I thank Deputy McCartan for his support.  He said he has no difficulty in accepting our amendment.  While Deputy Mitchell is prepared to accept the amendment as far as &ldquo;RTE&rdquo;, I fail to see why he cannot accept it in full.  We are trying to pinpoint the purpose of the legislation.  It is a blatant attempt by the Minister to hive off funds from RTE in the interests of the independent broadcasting companies. Effectively what has happened is that the Minister has been caught with his hand in the RTE till, and it is absolutely necessary to put on the record of this House that we do not want any part in it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne said he is concerned that we are spending so much time on the title.  The reason we are insisting on debating the title at some length is, to use an old adage, we are calling a spade a spade.  This Bill is an effort by the Minister to hijack the funds of RTE, and that has to be highlighted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> In page 3, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;advertisement' means a purchased radio insert or a purchased moving television insert but does not include any of the following:</P>
    <P> (i)  promotional material broadcast by the Authority within its own broadcasting service, for the purpose of promoting its own commercial activities,</P>
    <P>(ii)  promotional material for charitable, philanthropic or voluntary bodies charged for at a special rate,</P>
    <P>(iii)  passing references to a sponsor of a programme within programmes or programme interludes,</P>
    <P>(iv)  any coverage of a sporting or other public event where promotional hoardings are a feature of the event.</P>
    <P>(v)  giveaway gifts or prizes which are donated and which in any particular case are not a frequent occurrence in the same programme;&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are similar. Amendment No. 3 proposes the inclusion of a defintion of the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; in the Bill.  This is no mere ruse; it is important that a definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; is included in the Bill. If the Minister has any intention of providing RTE with any bit of leeway he may very well accept the definition proposed in my amendment.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes the exclusion from the definition of the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; any promotional material or announcements regarding programmes or services provided or to be provided by the Authority.  In other words an announcement by the Authority in relation to the programmes on Network 2, an article in the <i>RTE Guide</i> or programmes on any of their broadcasting services or any other service provided by them, would not be regarded as an advertisement.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the amendment proposes the exemption from the limit on minutage proposed by the Minister any advertisements by charitable, philanthropic or <Col N="1067" /> voluntary agencies which are charged at the special rate which applies to charities. Thirdly, it proposes the exemption of passing references to a sponsor of a programme within programmes or programme interludes, for example, the magnificent coverage of the World Cup which the Minister also praised.  As the House knows the commercial breaks during that coverage commenced and finished with a shot of the Italia 90 mascot together with the name of Bord Gáis who were the main sponsors.  I believe shots of that kind should be exempt from the limits on advertising.  It is ridiculous to think that such momentary slots could be totted up and included within the very tight and rigid limit which the Minister is seeking to impose.</P>
    <P>We seek to ensure that in the coverage of sporting and other public events advertising hoardings or balloons which are now featured at many matches in Landowne Road will not be included in the definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo;.  Will the coverage of the Carroll's Irish Open Golf Tournament be taken as an advertisement? Will the repeated mention of the title of the event and the film shot of Portmarnock showing Carroll's advertisements be included in the Minister's limitations on sponsorship?  I am seeking to ensure that it could not possibly be included.  There is a danger as the Bill stands &mdash; and as the present intention of the Minister stands &mdash; that the coverage of such sponsored events will be precluded or very severely restricted.  That would make an even bigger hames of broadcasting than the Minister is already proposing.  Will he clarify the position about sporting and other public events sponsored by companies?</P>
    <P>Of course this is not confined to sport. A sponsored ballet performance could be televised live by RTE and other cultural events, for instance, at the Guinness Hop Store, are sponsored by the Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks.  Will coverage of such sponsored events be precluded or restricted by the Minister's proposals in this Bill?  Section 3 deals with codes of practice to be laid down by the <Col N="1068" /> Minister relating to advertising and other commercial promotions.  It is very important that the House &mdash; and indeed the Minister &mdash; know his intentions, and it would be wise to accept a definition along the lines I proposed which would ensure that the World Cup coverage, which was recently praised by all sides of the House, can again be provided.  This also applies to the Olympics, the European Championships and other sporting events.  I know the Minister is a keen cricket supporter and very often major cricket test matches are sponsored.  It would be a terrible pity if the Minister deprived himself of the nice pastime of watching cricket on television merely because it was sponsored.</P>
    <P>It would be a gesture by the Minister to the House if he accepted a definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; along the lines of proposed. I have no objection to a similar amendment proposed by Deputy McCartan although it does not cover all the points included in mine.  In subparagraph (v) of the amendment, I asked the Minister not to completely exclude donated gifts which sometimes make a programme more attractive provided they are not a regular part of it.  I do not see any harm in Urney sending a box of Easter egges for an audience even if there is one for every member present. It is not wrong, occasionally, to mark an event covered by the Late Late Show or the Pat Kenny Show by having a donated prize raffled or given to the audience.  It would be a killjoy if sports and other sponsored cultural events are restricted in future, which seems to be what is envisaged in the Bill.  Programmes should not be banned from having an occasional donated prize for a quiz or other competition.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept that a definition along these lines is warranted. I should also like him to extensively define his intentions in relation to the codes of practice which are referred to later in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not enamoured of this amendment but perhaps it would slightly improve matters.  The problem <Col N="1069" /> about it is in relation to what is included in it by way of description and what is omitted from it.  I am not in any sense taking from the arguments in favour of the definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; made on Committee Stage, but they have not been adequately responded to.</P>
      <P>There is a real difficulty about the phrase &ldquo;a purchased moving television insert&rdquo;.  One of the more serious problems with the amendment is its omission of &ldquo;promotional material broadcast by the Authority within its own broadcasting service, for the purpose of promoting its own cultural activities&rdquo;.  For example, &ldquo;commercial activities&rdquo; are included but &ldquo;cultural activities&rdquo; which would include&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned &ldquo;cultural activities&rdquo; because if you want to take, for example, the promotion of video cassettes which have been made in relation to a cultural project by the station out of the quota of advertising, it really needs to be included here because the definition will apply to later sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The same question arises in relation to the inclusion of &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; and the non-inclusion of &ldquo;activities in relation to the Irish language&rdquo; which is handled in later amendments on the manipulation of the quota.  Section 5 presents a difficulty as regards the implementation of the amendment.  However, if I am wrong I should like to hear how you would define &ldquo;a frequent occurrence&rdquo;.  I will not quote the obvious parallel &mdash; in relation to giveaway prizes or gifts which are donated and which in any particular case are not a frequent occurrence in the same programme &mdash; about what some people think is frequent and what others regard as infrequent.  There is a problem in that regard in relation to drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are inclined towards the spirit of what Deputy Mitchell intends to do and we see it as an attempt being made against a stone wall of obduracy on the part of the Minister.  In disposing of amendment No. <Col N="1070" /> 1, there has already been a lack of flexibility in including any reference to &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; in even the Title of the Bill. It is the manipulation of the freedom to secure advertising and to secure revenue from it.  That is the core of the Bill.  In general I am inclined to support the principle of those who want to seek a definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;, but I have very strong reservations about both the structure of this amendment and the adequacy of some of the terms and particularly what I see to be the omissions.</P>
    <P>Let me say, lest there be any confusion about it, that what I mean by the advertising of cultural activities is not the announcement of them.  I am talking about video and radio cassettes &mdash; for example, of the &ldquo;Going West&rdquo; series &mdash; which are being marketed.  At the moment, under the Minister's proposals, all these activities on RTE will come out of their quota.  It is very interesting and I will speak at length about it later.</P>
    <P>Despite all the hypocritical blathering on about the Irish language from the main party in Government, there has been not a single concession in relation to the Irish language.  We will discuss that in a later amendment.  Even retaining the Minister's overall destructive vision for public service broadcasting, if you wanted to make any allowance for material in Irish you could have added on the advertising revenue plus what they got for Irish advertising plus what they got for promotional material in the Irish language and so forth.  Needless to say, that was not included.  It would be the very last thing that would occur in relation to many concessions.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are giving what Deputy Mitchell will understand as critical support for his amendment in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to indicate, in general, agreement and support for the amendment tabled by Deputy Mitchell. As he has indicated, it is in broad keeping with amendment No. 4 in my name, which we will debate shortly, and it follows on from a very useful debate we had in this House on Committee Stage in an <Col N="1071" /> attempt to address the question of what is or is not advertising for the purposes of the Minister's proposals with regard to the future funding of RTE and in particular to the capping of advertising or the arbitrary limiting of the time RTE, as a commercial operation, can give over to advertising and to raising money as a result.</P>
      <P>While there is an element of serenity present in the Chamber today as opposed to the very spirited debates that occurred on Committee Stage over the last couple of weeks and while there is a modicum of agreement reached in terms of the amount of time that might be available for Report Stage of the Bill, inadequate though it be, one has to recall that the amount of time we have was won after hard-fought positions taken by Opposition in the Chamber&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>While all those features exist, nonetheless they should not at all be taken as suggesting that the Minister has in any substantial way improved on his legislation or met in any serious way the representations made by us as Deputies of the Opposition on Committee Stage or representations from whatever quarter which may have been made to him in the period that has elapsed between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  There have been many of those, well-researched, well-reasoned and well-founded.  Capping of advertising still remains the overall import of what the Minister intends will be as drastic and profound in its effects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, all the essential features of this legislation exist as they were originally addressed by us here on Committee Stage.  For that reason we are forced to come back to dealing with this question of a definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; or &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo;.  On Committee Stage the Deputies in Opposition illustrated at length to the Minister the complications that would inevitably arise for the future operation of RTE as an essential public broadcasting authority if his proposals, as contained in the Bill as originally circulated and even as amended by him in his own intentions, went unaddressed or unrefined.  The very essential feature of RTE as a public service broadcasting organisation would simply be eroded, would not be capable of being sustained, and their central importance as an independent public broadcasting unit would be undermined. For that reason, on Committee Stage I proposed a very concise amendment to provide for the definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;, just to remind the Minister and the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can see that you are in severe agony.  The proposition I am attempting to address is the proposition in the first instance relating to the need to have a definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; in this section.  I am making that proposition because the Bill has not changed in essence since the Minister attempted to amend it in response to some representations and since we debated it on Committee Stage.  The scene has not changed.  The scenario for RTE is as it was outlined on Committee Stage.  There is a need for us to include a definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; in this Bill or to address the concept of advertising and how we understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said there was no need for such a definition, that the concept of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; was commonly known and required no definition in the legislation.  I would remind the Minister that on Committee Stage he suggested, in part concession, that he would consider by Report Stage an amendment in his own name to address the position of charitable promotions in broadcasting, in response to a case made by many of us in the House and probably made in submissions to the Minister by reputable well regarded charitable organisations.  These organisations said that if the Minister's proposal went ahead their position, <Col N="1077" /> privileged as it was in RTE, would be eroded and that they would find themselves in extreme difficulty in meeting what was of necessity required of them by the budgetary reorganisation within RTE.  The Minister said he would come back to us on that on Report Stage, but he has not done so.  Therefore the first portion of Deputy Mitchell's amendment is crucial.  That is that a definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; should include promotional material for charitable, philantrophic or voluntary bodies or that they be charged at a special rate if they are to be included in the definition or concept.  I understood that the Minister had accepted that argument on Committee Stage.  The Minister certainly gave us all to understand that he had, but perhaps he was simply playing to a wider audience and responding to the pressure of the other many representations made on this whole issue.</P>
    <P>I stayed in my seat to allow the Minister an opportunity to explain &mdash; and this is something that I may be able to come back to when dealing with my amendment No. 4 &mdash; but the Minister has not explained why he believes there is not a necessity to clarify the legislation.  I recall that when the Minister addressed this issue he did not fully understand what was going on in RTE.  Perhaps through a misunderstanding the Minister went further than many of us were arguing for, because the Minister expressed the view that charity should have a zero rate of charge, that they should be given a free rate of access and that he was certain that their position would be guaranteed once this legislation was in place.  In fact, the charities pay a very generous preferential rate and they are happy to continue to do so, as long as RTE are not forced into a budgetary arrangement that would require them to use up every available minute of their advertising time at the maximum premium rates so that they could maintain their revenue and, by definition, their social broadcasting functions. I need to know why the Minister has not introduced an amendment to protect their position.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage debate on <Col N="1078" /> this issue I raised a number of questions relating to services being supplied by RTE in discharge of their public broadcasting role.  Because Committee Stage allowed, I went back time and again to the Minister on these questions because they are of fundamental importance.  The Minister agreed that when we would arrive at the sections dealing with advertising he would answer these questions.  I was not here to remind the Minister, nor were the questions answered by the Minister although he had the floor exclusively to himself.  Deputy Mitchell's definition section is very welcome and opportune because it affords me and others an opportunity to raise the same questions and to invite the Minister to give us some assurance as to where the future of many of the promotional and sponsoring activities of RTE stand once this Bill is passed into law and once he begins to introduce the capping in the way he intends.</P>
    <P>The issues are covered in Deputy Mitchell's amendment which deals with the question of a passing reference to a sponsor.  On Committee Stage we referred to the transmission of the World Cup and asked whether the passing reference to the sponsor would render the entire programme an act of sponsorship, or amount to an advertisement.  We asked if the portion of the programme that carried a brief reference to the sponsor would be taken into consideration when considering the restrictions on time.  The same question arises in regard to the sponsor of the weather forecast. There are many instances of such sponsorship, more so on radio than on TV, and it is important that the position in regard to it and advertising is clarified.</P>
    <P>The coverage of sporting and other public events was referred to by Deputy Mitchell and we put a number of questions to the Minister in regard to them on Committee Stage but we did not receive a satisfactory response.  It is important that we should consider the question of giveaway gifts and prizes so that we can understand where RTE are going and what their potential will be.  I should like to remind the Minister of the services <Col N="1079" /> known as the &ldquo;Roadcaster&rdquo; and ask if it will be considered as advertising within his meaning of the definition. What will be the position if the radio station refers to the location of the &ldquo;Roadcaster&rdquo; and the functions it will be serving?  What will be the position of events like &ldquo;The Lark in the Park&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beat on the Street&rdquo;, the Dublin City Marathon, &ldquo;Beat Box&rdquo;, the Christmas food appeal, Daffodil Day and so on?  What will be the position of the educational programme, &ldquo;Zig and Zag&rdquo;?  I refer to that programme for the benefit of Deputy Cowen who found my comments on it amusing on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As I understand it Zig and Zag are the property of an independent company and not the creation of RTE.  The company are contracted through their proprietor who appears with Zig and Zag on television. How can the Minister differentiate between that type of contract work and promotional advertising of the activities of Zig and Zag?  We must remember that Zig and Zag are involved in a lot of work outside of RTE and their proprietor/owner appears with them around the country.  Will that contract work be considered as advertising?</P>
    <P>The problem is that in the Bill there is no definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; and the Minister proposes to curtail that activity in an arbitrary fashion.  It is important that we should know the scope of the common sense notion he says does not deserve any attention from him in the drafting of the Bill.  It should be remembered that in the course of his speech on Second Stage the Minister said he was attempting to fit in with the international movement and directives emanating from the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission. We have pointed out to him that the directives of the Council recognise the peculiarity of the concept of advertisement and advertising and attempted to define them for their purposes. However, the Minister did not do so, with the result that we are left with questions being put to us by those who work in RTE as managers or technicians and those in <Col N="1080" /> the community who rely on RTE.  The latter are concerned for the future of that organisation because any changes in their structure will have a direct impact on them.  It is important that the Bill includes a definition similar to that suggested by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister referred to practices existing in the Broadcasting Authority which he considered to be unfair and, in some instances, amounting to abuses.  I have asked him to outline the practices that amount to unfairness or abuse in regard to advertising but he has failed to respond.  When a statement as strident and as broad as that is made, particularly by the Minister responsible for the Bill, we should be given examples of what he is talking about.  The Minister should not allow such an accusation hang in the air, particularly if he is suggesting that there have been abuses.  Deputy Mitchell's attempt at defining the word &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; is to be welcomed and the Minister should accept all or part of his amendment.  I support Deputy Mitchell's amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage we spent approximately 13 hours trying to get the Minister to define the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; but he remained seated for most of that time and did not address the problem.  That was an indictment of him.  I support Deputy Mitchell's amendment part of which states:</P>
      <P>(ii)  promotional material for charitable, philanthropic or voluntary bodies charged for at a special rate,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped, to which 45 groups are affiliated, sent a circular to all Members trying to elicit support for maintaining the charity rate that prevails. The cut and thrust in a debate on the Bill tends to be technical and there is a danger that those who stand to lose most under its provisions will be ignored.  I am thinking in particular of those who receive charitable donations arising from advertisements on television and radio.  On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that he would give consideration to this <Col N="1081" /> issue but there is no evidence that he intends changing the provisions.  I was of the opinion that the Minister would introduce changes but on 29 June the Taoiseach at a press conference announced that there would be no amendments to the Bill.  That is not an indication that we have a caring Government. They are prepared to put a Bill through the House that will hurt those who depend on charity for their existence. I have no doubt that all Members support the work of the 45 groups and for that reason I cannot understand why the Minister does not include them in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party have put down this comprehensive motion because we believe the Government have become tired and complacent when it comes to economic affairs and the running of the economy. The amendment in the name of the Minister for Finance betrays not only a degree of complacency but also a worrisome tone of arrogance.  One would get the impression in looking at the amendment that all was well in the economy. Let me quote a body for which the Minister must have some degree of respect and should listen to, the Central Bank. They state on page 7 of their annual report, dated 17 May 1990:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the turnaround in recent years has been considerable, the economy continues to be beset by serious structural difficulties.  Despite the continuing increase in output and the resumption of private sector employment growth, the level of unemployment, at 17¾ per cent in 1989, remains very high both by historical standards and in comparison with the levels prevailing among our EC partners; emigration also remains high. Reflecting the lower level of economic development, living standards in Ireland are about one-third below the average EC level and substantially below the levels of the more prosperous regions of the Community.  In spite of the progress that has been achieved to date in reducing the fiscal imbalance, the level of indebtedness in relation to GNP, at almost twice the OECD average, remains among the <Col N="1083" /> highest in the EC.  The need to address these problems is all the more urgent in the context of the completion of the internal market and moves towards economic and monetary union within the EC.  Economic policy must, therefore, be directed at making maximum use of the opportunities presented by the current favourable economic climate and the expansion of the single market to reduce these imbalances over the medium term.</P>
    <P>It cannot be taken that that statement indicates a degree of complacency or that the Government have achieved their overall objectives; yet, in looking at the amendment one would think that was the position.</P>
    <P>In contrast with the approach adopted by Fianna Fáil when in Opposition, the Labour Party recognise that some progress has been made in some areas.  The NESC had this to say at page 566 of their report of August 1989, and we share their conclusions:</P>
    <P>The imperatives which gave rise to <i>Strategy for Development 1986-1990</i> are now joined by the imperative of competing in a unified European market.  The essential result of completion of the internal market is that the Irish economy will become more integrated into the European economy. Inefficiency will now be penalised as never before.  With the increase in mobility of goods, labour, investment and financial capital, all policies and activities must be considered in a new light.  Changes which increase the exposure of the economy to external forces must be complemented by measures which enhance the internal efficiency of the Irish economy.  This requires changes by all elements of our society.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that the council has concluded that there are two prime requirements for Ireland: first, a clear national strategy for European integration which will provide a guide to external negotiations and domestic <Col N="1084" /> decision making; and, second, continued consensus among the social partners, at national level and at the level of the firm, to ensure a swift and flexible response that is most conducive to the objectives of fuller employment, higher living standards and a better social framework. That document was published last August prior to the major changes in central and eastern Europe which have substantially altered the conclusions of the Cecchini report and the NESC report on Ireland's ability to benefit from an upturn in the economy.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a prospect of improved economic performance at international level.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16 May, Cliff Taylor had this to say with respect to the ESRI short and medium economic forecasts:</P>
    <P>The medium-term forecasters have adjusted their predictions for Ireland since last June, but the overall picture of much more rapid growth in the 1990s than the 1980-87 period is maintained, with economic prospects in the EC and the rest of the world remaining broadly favourable.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party contend that against this background of favourable international economic indicators on the one hand and the considerable turnaround from the position at the start of the last decade, certain sections of our people will not benefit from any improvement in overall economic performance and that in some cases we will go backwards.</P>
    <P>Our motion clearly outlines that there are problems in agriculture, health, education and housing, and it is quite clear from the political arguments put forward not only by the Labour Party but also by independent commentators that there is no guarantee that the country is going to do better or solve its problems simply because the rest of Europe is getting richer.  Paul Tansey had this to say in his report on a major study in the <i>Irish Banking Review, vis-à-vis</i> Ireland's experience of membership of the European Community over a long period of time, in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 14 May:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> In general terms, the experience of the years 1971-86 should induce a healthy suspicion of those who would promise a narrowing of the income gap between the rich and poor regions of the Community.  As 1992 approaches, we must beware of Commissioners bearing gifts.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government have attempted during the past year to suggest that because there will be an improvement in the economic wellbeing of the European Economic Community we will automatically benefit from such an improvement.  The historical facts and the evaluation of professional commentators, including that of Mr. Maurice Doyle, the Governor of the Central Bank, do not give credence to that conclusion and the Minister is aware of this.  Notwithstanding this objective analysis by the Central Bank, to whom the Minister might on occasion listen, the country and the Government are woefully unprepared to face the problems.</P>
    <P>We state in our motion that the domestic legislative programme of the Government is in disarray.  Let me explain what we meant by that.  The Government have repeated that they want to see a new <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> negotiated with the social partners, yet they included in the legislative programme for this session two Bills which are destructive in terms of the perception of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Broadcasting Bill and the Insurance Bill, and have insisted on pursuing policies which are totally opposed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and, indeed, the Labour Party. This attitude, which betrays a degree of arrogance, indicates, on the one hand, that they want to see economic progress but, on the other, they do not care what they do, for private or domestic reasons, to either RTE or Irish Life if it happens to suit some private agenda.  There is no rational public agenda that makes sense of what is happening in relation to either the Broadcasting Bill or Irish Life if this Government are serious about implementing the policy objectives of the <Col N="1086" /> NESC.  There is no rational explanation available but, perhaps when the Minister gets up to speak he will offer such a rational explanation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are proposing in our motion, a Cheann Comhairle, that the Government have an obligation and a responsibility to produce, as suggested in the NESC report of last August, a concerted programme by not only the social partners but by all those responsible for developing an economic programme which is realistic and coherent. Indeed, the need for such a programme was identified by Proinsias Breathnach, a lecturer in Geography, St. Patrick's College Maynooth, in an article in <i>Poverty Today</i> in which he states, among other things, that:</P>
      <P>The employment creation requirements of the Irish economy over the coming decade present a daunting challenge, not only because of the existing high levels of unemployment, but because of other rising annual number of new entrants to the labour force &mdash; a result of the demographic boom of the 1970s...</P>
      <P>There is no prospect for a quick-fix solution to this massive problem.  What is most important at this stage is that no such solution should be sought.  Shortterm solutions to long-term problems which have been tried in the past have helped get us into the situation we are in today.  It is vital that we now resolve to develop longer-term prospectives which emphasise the development of Irish-based exporting firms whose revenues and profits are spent to the maximum extent possible within Ireland.</P>
      <P>He states further:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This in turn requires some sort of public forum with executive authority, drawing its membership from both the political parties and the social partners, where these objectives and strategies <Col N="1087" /> can be thrashed out, agreed upon and put into action.</P>
    <P>The time for political rhetoric from which this House has suffered for so long must now surely be over.  Notwithstanding improvements in the short term indicators, be it in relation to inflation, world trade or our balance of trade, the reality is that this economy has historically failed, since 1922, to provide the levels of employment that its population requires. Notwithstanding anything the Minister will say, either today or tomorrow, this Government by one instrument of measurement alone, that of employment, stands totally and completely indicated and will remain so indicated.  It is, therefore, necessary to develop a coherent plan which has the support of as many people as possible in our society: that starts with the elected representatives in this Chamber and with those instruments of economic policy which are closest to us and over which we have maximum control.</P>
    <P>The IDA have laterally and belatedly adapted and implemented the recommendations of the Telesis report.  They are currently proposing that they want to grow successful Irish firms.  They have identified as two indicators a figure of 150 such firms with a minimum turnover of £5 million per annum but these are all private firms.  At a time the IDA are trying to grow such domestic firms to the size where they can actually have a significant impact on domestic employment the Minister for Finance is about to prepare Irish Life for slaughter on the international market, which is a firm of such size.  He is preparing to enable the Irish Sugar Company to be slid off into the private sector where it will be purchased out of the hands of this Legislature and out of the control of the people.</P>
    <P>If we are to confront the employment problem, which is real and which will not be solved overnight, we must retain &mdash; in the context of a united European market of over 300 million people &mdash; control answerable in some way or other to this <Col N="1088" /> Legislature, elements of the Irish economy which will be headquartered in our society, which will be based in our society and which will have a primary commitment to our society and to creating employment here.  It does not necessarily mean that they all have to be publicly owned but it does essentially mean that they all have to be Irish based.  This Government are displaying an extraordinary right wing ideological obsession with selling off successful, Irish publiclyowned companies for reasons which they refuse to state or articulate.  The Minister's speech on the Second Stage of the Insurance Bill is a clear indication of that covert Thatcherism that he is frightened to articulate in real terms the reasons why they want to bring Irish Life to the market.</P>
    <P>It is our view that there should be a clear programme worked out over a long period.  Not just another document produced and put on the shelf but a programme that evolves from the floor of this Chamber, that is consistently monitored by an economic committee, consisting of members of the Opposition as well as members of the Government, including Government backbenchers, a programme that has the support of people outside this Chamber, a programme that can attract the support of people in the employers' organisations and in the trade union movement, at all levels, and not just around the boardrooms or the private meeting rooms of some of those organisations.  Unless we get that kind of programme together we will not tackle the problems that stand today as a massive indictment of the failure of this economy over the last two to three years and certainly over the last few decades.</P>
    <P>No Minister for Finance can stand up tonight and say that the economy is basically doing all right when he has to say simultaneously that emigration is currently at the historically high level of 45,000 per annum and that unemployment is at the rate of between 17 per cent and 18 per cent of the labour force, depending on what measure or method of measurement one wishes to apply.  No <Col N="1089" /> other economic statistic or figure will obscure that fact.  All the objective economic studies and analyses we have available to us, whether it is this year's annual report from the Central Bank &mdash; an authority which we suspect the Minister might listen to &mdash; or the authorative NESC report, No. 88, clearly indicate there are short-term and medium-term strategies that have to be pursued, but they will have to be pursued together.  What we want to hear from this Minister is not a litany of economic successes that owe more to an upturn in the international economic indicators and less to anything that has happened here.  We want to hear this Minister, whom we hope is not as tired as the rest of the Government appear to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;responding to what is a constructive proposal from the Labour Party in relation to this.  It is time this Government came forward with a coherent programme as to what will happen in the mid-term over the next eight years or so that will take us into the next century. How will that programme be formulated? What sectors of growth will be identified in the Irish economy?  What targeted assistance from the Irish taxpayer will be delivered into food, tourism, transportation and into financial services?  The Labour Party are of the view that in three of those areas we have successful companies, that should be consolidated and grown with all the vigour that the IDA can command.  I am referring specifically to Irish Life in the financial services area, Aer Rianta with the Great Southern Hotels in the tourism area and the Sugar Company in the area of food.  They are three instruments of economic policy that could be used to consolidate economic growth in a manner that would ensure real, sustainable employment in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we have instead?  We have a right of centre Government playing with ideology, talking about privatisation and dancing to an ideological tune that is no longer being played either in Britain or <Col N="1090" /> in the United States.  This economy now faces a mid-term crisis that is represented in two stark figures.  One is emigration at 45,000 per annum, not only emigration of people who are destitute in economic terms but in many cases people who have received a good education and training from our society but who feel they cannot make a contribution within it.  The second is unemployment.  Our levels of unemployment are at the rate of 17 per cent with no indication that they are likely to fall below the figure of 12 per cent or 13 per cent for the foreseeable future.  We will be looking at that level of unemployment right into the next century.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are putting forward a constructive proposal to this House which the Minister has not rejected in his amendment.  I would urge the Minister to consider the benefits of such a proposal. The Minister has seen already, by way of the NESC study, what consensus can produce when shared by the social partners.  We contend that that consensus extended to this Chamber could ensure an economic strategy that would provide the levels of economic activity and employment creation that would dispel the horror of the figures I have just quoted.</P>
    <P>I should like to give Deputy Bell the remainder of my time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to second the motion in the name of the Labour Party which Deputy Quinn has covered more than adequately in his introduction.  I fully concur in everything he had to say. I should like to identify a number of areas warranting attention from the broad thrust of his introductory comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in London recently attending a Drogheda function, representing my town, at which I thought there would be a reasonable attendance but I was absolutely amazed when upwards of 1,000 young people turned up, all from the Drogheda area.  I gather that the attendance at another function held shortly thereafter by the Dundalk Association &mdash; which I was unable to attend &mdash; exceeded that number.  While I was there I could not help thinking of all the talk <Col N="1091" /> about the reduction in the levels of unemployment. The Minister and Members on all sides of the House know that this has become a somewhat farcical position since the figures being quoted do not take account at all of the many thousands of young people who continue to emigrate.</P>
    <P>If one takes the example of those two towns, Drogheda and Dundalk, and multiplies those figures right across the country, from Wexford to Galway to Tralee, and in respect of all the other urban and rural areas, then it is frightening to think of the numbers of young people working in cities such as London, Birmingham, Manchester.  Indeed, not alone in the United Kingdom but as far away as Australia, Canada and America.</P>
    <P>I listen to this massive public relations exercise about us endeavouring to create a good climate; one would think we were talking about the weather.  Since we are certainly not talking about factual employment position we must be talking about the weather.  All I can observe are more and more young people emigrating with fewer and fewer jobs for them at home.</P>
    <P>In addition we have entered an era &mdash; of which the Minister and at least two of his colleagues, particularly the Minister for Labour, will be aware &mdash; in which many young people working in the commercial sector do so for a pittance. The norm now is part-time, temporary workers.  If such people are to be included in these magical figures which are thrown at us constantly, as workers in gainful employment, we are merely trying to fool ourselves.  We are not fooling the young people who come to my clinic or those of any of my colleagues on the Opposition benches nor, I suspect, those who attend the clinics of members of the parties in Government.  Such young people will tell you that they work 40, 50 and 60 hours a week for a mere £30 or £40, employed by large stores such as Dunnes, or multinationals who pay them a pittance on a temporary or permanent part-time basis. They all feature in the statistics trotted out to us constantly by these professional <Col N="1092" /> public relations people who tell us what a good climate we have for employment.</P>
    <P>That is something about which very little has been done despite the fact that the Labour Party have consistently raised the issue in the House and requested Government action in relation to it. These young people continue to be exploited, many are forced to emigrate. It is an insult to them to have to work at that level for such reward.  In the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> it is contended that working class people, people on the shop or factory floor, have benefited therefrom.  What benefit has there been for the unorganised workers, virtual slaves, in employment?  Then we talk about poverty in relation to people in receipt of unemployment benefit, assistance or other forms of social welfare payments.  It should be realised that there is a hell of a lot of poverty amongst young people who are forced to work in these part-time jobs because of prevailing circumstances.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will be clearly seen that we are merely fooling ourselves when we endeavour to maintain that the levels of unemployment are being reduced, that the climate is improving.  Even the weather is not good at present but, when we talk about a good climate, certainly we are not talking about people employed in these part-time, temporary jobs or those not employed at all.</P>
    <P>Also within the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we observe that something in the region of 17,000 public service jobs have been lost. Those of us here &mdash; and there are many &mdash; involved in local authorities can observe it first hand, whether it be in Wexford, Wicklow, Kerry or elsewhere, where full-time workers, craftsmen, road workers and even administrators were allowed take early retirement resulting in almost 17,000 public service jobs having been lost.  As a consequence, the overall infrastructure of local government has virtually fallen apart.  Had we the requisite money to carry out the much needed work on roads and local authority services we would not have the people to undertake the relevant tasks; most of <Col N="1093" /> them have emigrated.  Most of them thought they could avail of early retirement or the redundancy package proposed by this Government and would get gainful employment afterwards.  That did not happen.  Those people are unemployed here or, alternatively, are working in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In the two main urban districts in County Louth there has not been one solitary local authority house built for four years.  Having spoken to my colleagues here I know the same obtains in other areas.  Never in the history of my county, and certainly neither my home town, has that happened.  Yet it is occurring in towns and cities all over the country.  The local authority housing lists are increasing weekly.  Again, just as in the case of unemployment, the safety valve has been emigration.  If all those young married people were at home there would be a revolution here; we would not have jobs for them, they would be on low levels of social welfare benefits, and we would have nowhere to house them.  Yet we talk about a good climate.</P>
    <P>I hear constantly of Government policy preparing for the so-called upturn. What kind of upturn can there be when private industry is no longer encouraged to create apprenticeships?  The level of apprenticeships nationwide has dropped by almost 75 per cent.  It is almost impossible for any young person to gain an apprenticeship now to any trade.  This means that, in the not-to-distant future, we will not have sufficient skilled craftsmen to cater for the present climate, never mind an improved one.  One cannot gain access to a FÁS training centre unless one is sponsored by private industry, whereas heretofore young people could spend an initial year in a FÁS training centre and progress from there.  That possibility has been eliminated.  They cannot gain entry to a FÁS training centre by way of apprenticeship. Employers in the private and public sectors are no longer sponsoring young people for apprenticeship.  Deputy Quinn, a former Minister for Labour, knows this.  He knows the encouragement he gave to people to obtain some <Col N="1094" /> form of employment when he introduced the social employment scheme, which was launched in my home town at a level of £70 weekly.  What happened?  The Government came into power and reduced it to £60.</P>
    <P>Look at what is happening in Waterford Glass where the employers tried to reduce the level of earnings.  Here the Government just came in and wiped £10 off £70 a week for a social employment scheme bringing it down to £60.  Then we heard the good news one morning that it was being increased by approximately £5, but that was only half of what it had been reduced by.  This is the type of public relations that gets right under my skin. How can the Minister tell a person on £65 a week that he is okay and can pay his way out of that?  How can he tell that person he is not living in poverty?  The Minister need not tell that to the young people I know.</P>
    <P>The local government scene is such that the normal programme of local government cannot now be carried out. We do not have the money, for a start, but even if we did we do not have the people to repair the roads or anything else.  Yet the Minister for the Environment tries to create the impression publicly that everything is okay with local authorities.  I, as a member of two local authorities know, and my colleagues know, as does everybody in this House, that the whole local authority scene has absolutely collapsed.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister try to tell a widow on £52 a week, or a single person living alone on something similar, that there is no poverty in the country, that the climate is good and the weather is getting better, and he or she will tell the Minister what to do and how difficult it is to even feed themselves, never mind indulging in any social activity at all.</P>
    <P>I want to wind up my ten minutes by reminding the Minister that in the Border area of Dundalk and County Louth as a whole where I come from, there is up to 30 per cent unemployment.  It is not even the 17 per cent on a national basis but 30 per cent, and that is not counting all the young people and not so young people <Col N="1095" /> who have emigrated.  If the Minister wants to make a positive contribution to the development of the economy he must start at the Border and bring tax harmonisation and get the VAT and excise duties down to the levels that obtain elsewhere in the UK.  Then we might at least be on a competitive footing and some of the garages and shops that have closed might reopen.  How can anybody tell me there is no poverty in the country when I am living in an area where there is 30 per cent unemployment?  When I read in <i>The Irish Times,</i> the <i>Irish Independent</i> or <i>The Irish Press</i> what the Minister for Finance has been saying I have to remind myself that I am awake and not merely dreaming.  It is about time that we were collectively honest with the public and admit that this is a massive public relations exercise, that we are only trying to fool the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a well known tenet on which the advertising industry is almost entirely based, that perception is more important than reality.  The writer Elmer Wheeler put it more succinctly when he said &ldquo;don't sell the steak sell the sizzle&rdquo;.  It has been obvious to me for some time that the Ministers must be reading Elmer Wheeler books and are graduates of the Elmer Wheeler school of economics.  Much of their policy is based on the dicta I have quoted.  That perception is the guiding rule of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scarcely a day passes without my reading in the papers or seeing on the television or hearing on the radio that we are living in a great economic climate.  There are all the cliches one could think of. Even Adam Smith did not have some of the cliches we hear tossed about every day.  The Ministers go around the country boasting about the wonderful miracle that has occurred here.  All kinds of rosy pictures are painted.  Every kind of cliche from &ldquo;bottoming out&rdquo; to &ldquo;upturn in the economy&rdquo; is trotted out.  There is talk about the need to create the right economic climate for recovery, lay the foundations for recovery.  Even the late Seán Lemass's old dictum &ldquo;the rising tide lifts <Col N="1096" /> all boats&rdquo; is tossed out when all else fails. I hear that on all sides of me.  Obviously the tide that has been rising here has not lifted very many boats, if we look around at the world we are living in.</P>
    <P>The main Government party one time coined the slogan &ldquo;Building on Reality&rdquo;. The document, bearing that title, glossy covered, was sent to every one of us by post.  Reality, however, must be measured by performance, not perception. The Government have been evading reality in the last three years. There has been no economic miracle in this country, and no economic success. There might be on paper, but not in reality.</P>
    <P>What does economic success mean? How does one measure economic success in human terms?  What is economic success all about?  Figures and balance sheets tell one story, but labour exchanges and poverty queues tell another.  How does one judge the performance of our society as a whole?  How does one measure success in that society?  Success is often measured here by the success of a small number of people who make money.  One must also measure the success of this economic miracle on the lives of ordinary people, the vast majority of whom live in ordinary circumstances.  We must translate economic policy into human terms and the Government have not done that. The success we are talking about is a mirage, an illusion that the Government have put before us.  We must look beyond these perceptions, illusions, hype, propaganda and PR work that are so common in the society we live in.  We must look beyond the cliches and relate performance to the reality of the world we live in.</P>
    <P>What is the reality?  Despite all the talk in the past few years there are still nearly 250,000 unemployed in our society; nearly one-third of our people are living in poverty and emigration has risen again to nearly 50,000 a year.  Tax inequality is the same as it was three years ago.  There are still hospital waiting lists for treatment and operations.  There are other adverse aspects of our health system. Wards have closed down in hospitals. <Col N="1097" /> People have to wait for hours for casualty treatment late at night.  Deputy Bell referred to low wages.  Many of the so-called training schemes are really cheap labour schemes.  There is exploitation of workers in many industries such as manual industries, catering industries, hotels, supermarkets, etc.  What Deputy Bell said about apprenticeships is true. Sometimes parents, and boys, are so desperate that they sponsor themselves in order to get an apprenticeship.  Much of the sponsorship taking place on FÁS courses is bogus; the apprentice receives no wages whatsoever.  Many FÁS people do not know this.  The desperation to find a place on an apprenticeship scheme is such that parents would stop at nothing, even paying their own son to go on a course.</P>
    <P>The technological education we hear so much about from the Government cannot be dealt with in isolation or in a vacuum.  Limerick University was the first university set up on technological lines.  It is a good thing, and I am pleased with the progress of graduates from that university.  But we must look beyond that.  Our graduates should not be used as fodder by the multinationals.  Our university and the graduates, lecturers and professors should also attempt to grapple with the problems of our society because economic success cannot be measured in terms of some graduates getting employment with multinationals.  Education, while it is a concept in itself, must also be related to the world we live in.  It is time our universities, Limerick University especially, got down to solving the problems of our society.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the building industry is experiencing a revival, a small revival.  The very fact of designating areas in the cities and urban areas, however, says a lot, that we have to give people tax breaks to invest in the building industry. That is the wrong way to go about stimulating the building industry.  The building industry should be given the green light to work on its own initiative, not merely in response to stimulation in certain areas.  What Deputy Bell said about fewer houses being built in urban <Col N="1098" /> areas is totally true.  Unfortunately we are paying the price of building houses in green fields instead of instituting a programme of building houses in the inner city, cutting down on crime and vandalism.  Instead we are exposing those people to such anti-social practices by putting them out to those places.  The building industry should be given the right to operate away from tax based speculation.  Too many building workers have emigrated, many of them, illegally, to America, some to Britain and some to Australia and many have not come back and will not come back.  In the area I come from &mdash; Limerick &mdash; the building boom has done nothing for the people living on the north side of the city or on the south side in Moyross and Southill. Those are the two largest housing estates in the city and unemployment is up to 80 per cent in these areas, five times the national average.</P>
    <P>As regards agriculture, Limerick is the capital of the Golden Vale.  Potatoes are imported from Cyprus and Israel and cabbage from Holland &mdash; a country which feeds 14 million people and has to send food to Limerick.  Recently, I went to have my shoes mended and the cobbler said the leather he used is imported from Belgium.  He said he cannot get Irish leather, and that is a tragedy in a country with plenty of cattle.  Surely no Minister can listen with complacency to these facts.  I know there has to be give and take and there have to be imports as well as exports, but surely an agricultural country should be able to produce food and leather.  You could go on, to use a bad pun, until the cows come home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was a very light-hearted occasion but there was too much hype, too many strokes and too <Col N="1099" /> many nods and winks, and it was slack on performance.

      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&mdash; welcomes the transformation of the economy since 1986 which reversed the economic stagnation and declining living standards of preceding years; improved the public finances following the record high current budget deficit of 1986; reduced the National Debt/GNP ratio following the virtual doubling of the debt in the four previous years; restored growth to the economy at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent; increased employment; reduced unemployment; enabled substantial real increases in social welfare benefits and significant reductions in income tax rates; brought about low levels of inflation and interest rates; and increased exports which brought the balance of payments into surplus; recognises the central role in these achievements of the policy strategy of the <i>Programme for National Recovery;</i> acknowledges the contribution of the various social and economic partners to its successful negotiation and implementation; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;urges the Government to maintain its successful efforts to promote economic and social progress, based on a further Programme of Development agreed between the Government and the social and economic partners; and, with the support of the European Community and the co-operation of the social and economic partners, to prepare the economy to confront successfully the challenges of the Single Market and Economic and Monetary Union. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I must say I have been accused of <Col N="1100" /> many things in my political life but some of the things I have been accused of here by speakers from the Labour Party, I have to reject straight away.  They accused me of being complacent &mdash; that is not true; confident &mdash; yes; arrogant &mdash; never; efficient &mdash; yes; performance &mdash; I will leave that to others to judge.  I am elected by the people of Longford-Westmeath and they can decide on performance when the time comes.  They seem to be fairly pleased with my performance up to now and when the next day of reckoning arrives it will be up to them to judge me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ruairí Quinn suggested the answer to the problems, and concentrated on three areas that he said would transform the economy and provide the jobs that we all know are badly needed and are not available in sufficient numbers.  I do not deny that and have never denied it.  I was never complacent about how far we have gone down the road.  We have gone a long way and we have a long way to travel.  He suggested that to leave Irish Life alone would solve part of the problem, but I cannot understand the logic in that.  He said he cannot understand my logic but it is simple.  Irish Life are a company that need access to new capital.  They need capital restructuring, and nobody argues with that.  I have had a number of discussions with the trade union involved, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and others whose priority it is to create jobs.  Not alone will all the jobs be retained in that company but indeed the numbers will be improved upon.  If that is not the right road to travel, I do not know what is.  That is my rationale and the rationale of the Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to Aer Rianta, they have diversified into many areas, and the more they diversify the better.  I would urge every semi-State body to diversify into whatever area they can run commercially and profitably.  The difference in this case is that the Government have no money and are not prepared to borrow more money to put into operations such as that. When they can be run and developed <Col N="1101" /> commercially, we are 100 per cent behind them.</P>
    <P>I will leave the future of the Great Southern Hotels to my colleague, the Minister for Labour, who will be participating in the debate.  Here again, it is a question of finding more capital.  Those hotels have come a long way and it is a question of what is the best way to improve them, but I have no doubt the Minister will bring his proposals before the Government in due course.</P>

      <P>From listening to the debate so far, one would have to ask: do the people who have contributed to the debate realise where we have come from in such a short period.  Do they want to forget and wipe the record clean?  When you find faults you have to correct them and then go on to build a future on the foundations you have laid.  There is no instant solution, and there never was an instant solution to this problem.  If the old, tired Labour Party policy of throwing money at problems to try to solve them is still their policy &mdash; I am not sure whether it is from listening to them tonight &mdash; it will not get us anywhere.  It was tried and tested for four and a half years, in conjunction with a larger partner, Fine Gael, in Government and we saw the results.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;GNP growth was actually negative; the balance of payments was in deficit; the Irish pound had been devalued twice within the EMS in less than 3½ years; our external competitiveness was deteriorating; the public finances were on an unsustainable course, with persistent overruns on the Exchequer borrowing requirement and a relentless rise in the national debt to GNP ratio; employment had been on a downward trend for the best part of a decade; investment, the foundation for future growth, was at rock-bottom levels; and national confidence was at a low ebb. Was all this really only three and a half years ago?  It seems like another era.  The reality is that on every one of these fronts the position has been transformed almost beyond recognition.</P>
      <P>It was a situation which demanded a well-founded strategy for stablisation and development.  The Government's response was set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was negotiated with the social partners towards the end of 1987.  It was reiterated in the National Development Plan in March 1989 and further developed in the Programme for Government adopted this time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ultimate objective of this strategy was the achievement of strong and above all sustainable growth in output and employment.  Key ingredients in this strategy were the improvement of cost competitiveness and a reduction in interest rates.  This was to be made possible by fiscal discipline, restraint in pay and a stable exchange rate for the Irish pound within the EMS.  This strategy gave a credibility to economic, budgetary and monetary policies that had been lacking for years.  For policies to be successful, they must above all be credible. The policies of the last three years have been credible because they have been forged from a consensus on what the country needed; they were realistic; and, as the record shows, they were not a delusion or a mirage, nor were they any <Col N="1103" /> of the fancy names Deputy Kemmy would like to put on them.  These are facts and not fancy tales.  The policy goals we set were achievable.</P>
    <P>By any standards, this strategy has been an outstanding success.  It has met its key targets for the public finances, jobs and growth.  Indeed it has even achieved them ahead of schedule.  I will mention just a few of the many examples that could be given: real GNP growth is set to average 3½ per cent in the period 1987-90. In contrast, growth in the first half of the decade was non-existent, averaging only ¼ per cent a year; the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been brought down from 13 per cent of GNP in 1986 to a prospective 2 per cent of GNP this year; the national debt to GNP ratio which had been rising inexorably up to 1987 was stabilised and is now falling.  It has come down from over 131 per cent of GNP at the end of 1987 to about 121 per cent at the end of 1989, and will be reduced further this year; and from April 1987 to April 1989, there was a substantial net increase in the number of self-sustaining jobs available; private non-farm employment grew by more than 30,000 in these two years.  The indications are that the rate of growth over the past 12 months has been even better, and we need to achieve even better still in the future because of our high unemployment.</P>
    <P>We are an open economy and our success is predicted by the performance of our trading sectors.  Over the past three years these sectors have performed outstandingly: Growth in the volume of manufacturing ouput averaged more than 12 per cent per annum in that period. This growth was widely spread and included both the modern high technology sectors and the sectors producing more traditional products; and expenditure on tourism and travel by visitors to Ireland has increased by an annual average of 15 per cent since 1987.  Our efforts to develop this key sector are being rewarded.  The policy of liberalising air transportation and creating a more <Col N="1104" /> competitive environment has also contributed to this growth.</P>
    <P>The performance of the trading sectors of our economy is reflected in export growth.  Over the past three years exports have grown by an average of 16 per cent per annum.  In 1988, for the first time in our history, the trade surplus exceeded £2 billion.  It was over £2.3 billion in 1989 and we expect a repeat performance in 1990.  Up to April 1990, the trade surplus is running some £140 million ahead of last year's level.  The balance of payments has been in surplus for three years running and a further surplus is in prospect this year.  Only a handful of OECD countries can match this performance &mdash; notably Germany and Japan.  Contrast this with the earlier years of the 1980s when we were running large current account deficits and covering them with unsustainable foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>Productive investment is the seed corn of economic growth and prosperity. Investment depends fundamentally on the expectations and confidence of business in economic policy and prospects. Investment in responding strongly to the opportunities created by Government policy.  There is now a willingness to commit resources to productive, employment-creating projects.  There has been a major turnaround in the building industry. This sector, which was in recession for most of the last decade, witnessed strong output growth in 1989.  The various indicators of building activity &mdash; planning permissions, loan approvals, housing starts and, most significant, employment &mdash; all point to buoyant activity in the sector.  Indeed, you have only to look at the skylines of our cities for evidence of the vibrancy of the building industry.</P>

      <P>The Government's general economic policy, as well as their targeted efforts in urban renewal and infrastructural investment have played their part in the regeneration of the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as building and construction activity, investment in machinery and <Col N="1105" /> equipment is growing strongly.  In 1989, the value of imports of capital goods increased by over a third.  They have continued to increase this year.  This is welcome evidence that business is devoting resources to the best available technology, a strategy which will increase productivity, secure competitiveness and create jobs.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are important determinants of economic activity.  The role of the Government is to provide the economic background conducive to maintaining interest rates which are as low as possible, consistent with the maintenance of a strong exchange rate within the EMS.  The success of our policies in the area of interest rates may be gauged by the improvement in the differentials between Irish rates and rates in other countries.  Since March 1987, to take the key three month rate as an example, the differential between Irish and UK interest rates has improved by nearly 8 percentage points.  The differential with the corresponding German rates has improved by nearly 7 percentage points. This represents a significant competitive gain to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>As regards the latest developments, domestic market conditions have shown considerable improvement in recent months.  Money market rates eased significantly during the second quarter of this year.  A general trend towards lower interest rates in most EC countries and a strengthening of sterling caused favourable market sentiment to prevail.  This facilitated substantial capital inflows and led to a significant recovery in the official external reserves &mdash; from £2,458 million at end-March, to £3,018 million at end-May. The improvement in domestic conditions led the Central Bank to reduce their short-term facility &mdash; STF &mdash; rate twice in June to 11 per cent.  These changes in the STF were followed by reductions in retail interest rates which brought the Associated Bank's prime commercial lending rate down to 11 per cent, a reduction of 1 per cent on their January 1990 level.</P>
    <P>I hope I do not need to remind this House of the evil of inflation.  Not many <Col N="1106" /> years ago we had double digit inflation. People's purchasing power and savings were being eroded and their standard of living was on a downward spiral.  We now have the sort of levels traditionally associated with countries such as Germany. The credibility of the budgetary and exchange rate policies of this Government and their predecessors, and the sensible pay arrangements in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> have combined to bring inflation down.  Inflation fell to an average of 3 per cent in 1988-89.  This was better than the average rate in the European Community and well below the rate in the United Kingdom.  By year end we will have one of the lowest inflation rates in the OECD group of countries.</P>
    <P>All of this progress in production, trade, investment and inflation would serve little purpose if it did not translate into more jobs.  Indeed, the ultimate goal of all Government policies is the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable job creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable job creation. Jobs are being created and sustained at an increasing rate.  The overall rate of employment growth has accelerated over the period of the programme to a projected 13,000 this year.  Contrast this with the net fall in employment of 76,000 in the seven years to April 1987.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> set a target of 20,000 extra jobs per year over ten years for manufacturing and internationally-traded services.  Detailed employment surveys conducted by the State industrial promotion agencies show that this target was more that met over 1988 and 1989.  Helped by a significant reduction in job losses, net employment in manufacturing increased by 6,000 in 1989.  Contrast this with the average annual decline of 4,000 in the period 1980-87.  Employment in the construction sector was up by almost 10 per cent in 1989 and the building employment index shows a continuation of this strong growth through to May of this year. Employment in services is also on an up-trend, with the number at work in <Col N="1107" /> banking and insurance rising by over 2½ per cent in 1989.</P>
    <P>One of the most dramatic manifestations of the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been the decline in job losses.  In 1989 notified redundancies were over 40 per cent fewer than in 1988.  This favourable trend is continuing into 1990.  Notified redundancies are 21 per cent lower in the first five months of the year than in the same period of 1989.  Sustainable employment is what we are after and that is what we are getting.</P>
    <P>Registered unemployment is falling, in contrast to the massive increase of 146,000 in the period 1980-87.  The number out of work fell by an average of over 8,000 per year over the two years 1987 and 1988.  We expect a further fall of 10,000 this year.  While last month's figure is disappointing, we should be slow to pass judgment on the basis of a single number.  I do not think it reflects the underlying trend of employment, and I feel sure that it will prove, in the event, to have been but a temporary aberration. I reject the suggestion that falling employment is simply a reflection of emigration. It is abundantly clear that there are more jobs coming on stream and the indications are that emigration has slackened considerably this year.</P>
    <P>Not alone have we got more jobs, fewer job losses and reduced unemployment under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> but workers' living standards have also shown substantial real improvement.  The combination of realistic pay increases, the tax reliefs granted in successive budgets and the low inflation rates achieved over the past two years and into 1990 mean that real take-home pay of workers with average industrial earnings will have increased by between 4 and 8½ per cent over the life of the programme.  Contrast this with a fall of between 7 and 11 per cent in real take-home pay over the period 1980-87. Gross earnings increases in double digit percentages figures gave the illusion and mirage of progress during the early part of the decade, but the plain fact is that <Col N="1108" /> money gains were eroded by inflation and taxes.</P>
    <P>The fact that real increases in living standards have gone hand in hand with moderate nominal pay rises is due in no small measure to the major tax reform measures which have been implemented over the past three years.  These in turn have been made possible by the progress achieved in containing borrowing and debt.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the public finance situation that has occurred over the past few years has been quite dramatic.  This has been crucial to the major economic and social advances of the past few years. Exchequer borrowing and debt had been careering out of control.  If this had continued it would have called into question our ability to provide essential public and social services, to create new jobs at home for our people and, ultimately, our ability to continue to remain masters of our own affairs.</P>
    <P>In this motion, I detect, once again, the familiar refrain that the &ldquo;cut-backs&rdquo; were not needed.  Do I hear a suggestion that, if only we had waited, the economy would have grown out of its difficulties? The plain fact is that the previous Government on taking office were confronted with a critical set of imbalances in the economy.  If these were not addressed, and urgently resolved, they threatened to undermine the very foundations of growth.  No less a body than the National Economic and Social Council, with their widely-representative and well-informed membership, had concluded that the debt problem &mdash; and its rootcause, the unsustainable level of borrowing &mdash; was the first priority.  This meant to all and sundry that public expenditure had to be cut.  Putting up taxes, the solution employed by the Coalition Government in 1983-87, put taxation through the roof.  I hear calls tonight to dismantle immediately the high taxes imposed during that period in both direct and indirect taxation.  I have started to do this, but it cannot be achieved overnight. If that Government had not put <Col N="1109" /> them up, I would have not have to take them down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Putting up taxes was not the solution, which it was thought it would be.  In fact, previous attempts to curb borrowing through bringing taxes up to meet spending had become part of the problem, by undermining the economy's capacity to &ldquo;grow out of debt&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Far from causing a slowdown in econmic activity and job creation, as some had suggested it might, the reduction in Government borrowing and debt has been the essential catalyst for a period of sustained economic growth and increased employment.  This is so because the position of the public finances is at the very heart of confidence in the management of the economy.  Without such confidence investment and expansion by business, on which jobs depend, are simply not possible.</P>
      <P>Those who claim that we could have turned the economy around without pruning public expenditure are perpetrating a cruel hoax on those people who inevitably suffered some discomfort from the cuts.  However, I do not believe that they are fooling anyone.  The Irish people are not short of common sense. They have a healthy scepticism for the &ldquo;free lunch', especially when nobody is willing to put the menu on the table.  Are they prepared to say now where they would have made economies?  Since, presumably, it is not in the areas they criticise the Government for acting, maybe they would specify what programmes would have borne the drastic cuts that would be involved in a more limited field.</P>
      <P>Our annual borrowing requirement is now in line with the average borrowing of our partners in the EMS narrow-band. This is a useful pointer to the progress we have made.  Moreover, this has been achieved at the same time as we have been making unprecedented progress in reducing direct and indirect taxes and in providing significant improvements in living standards for those on low incomes, including social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> Nevertheless, we must be realistic in our assessment of our present position. We have a huge overhang of debt which is roughly twice the average for EC countries.  This is a major burden on the economy, for two reasons.  In the first place, the servicing of this debt is pre-empting a huge amount of our resources that could be put to much better use for other purposes.  The cost of interest payments on the debt comes to £2.1 billion in the present year.  Secondly, our economy remains exposed to the trend of interest rates, at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>An essential part of our strategy, therefore, must be to maintain downward pressure on debt and, to this end, on borrowing.  This is why, having already achieved the earlier targets, I announced new medium-term objectives for the public finances in this year's budget.  Over the period up to 1993 the Government's aim will be to maintain a significant rate of progress in reducing the Debt-GNP ratio towards 100 per cent.  We intend, as part of this, to achieve broad balance on the current budget for the first time in 21 years.  Borrowing for capital purposes and the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement will need to be held to the minimum level consistent with this strategy and with the needs of balanced economic growth and stable monetary conditions.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, the achievement of these objectives will not come easily. There will always be tension between the pace of progress in reducing borrowing and debt and the many other objectives we are trying to achieve within our limited resources.  It is essential, nevertheless, that we build on what has been achieved over the past few years and make further progress on the basis of the new objectives.</P>
    <P>Control over public spending has been a major contributory factor to the turn around in the public finances which we have witnessed since 1986.  Overall Government spending has been reduced as a percentage of GNP from 53 per cent in 1986 to a projected 42 per cent this year.  In real terms, net day-to-day spending by the Government, other than on <Col N="1111" /> debt servicing, is now some 9 per cent lower than it was in 1986.</P>
    <P>The savings achieved over the past few years have enabled us to recover some of the ground lost in the years prior to 1987. Achieving major expenditure adjustment is never an easy task.  Many difficult but necessary decisions had to be taken.  In taking these decisions, however, the Government were always conscious of the needs of the less well off.  I would strenuously deny any suggestion that the less well off carried the brunt of the adjustment process.  Members of this House need only look at the budgets that this and the previous Government have introduced to see quite clearly that the Government have more than met their responsibilities to those in receipt of state welfare payments and to persons on low incomes generally.</P>
    <P>Providing sustainable improvements in public services, in terms of the quality of and public access to those services &mdash; whether they be in health, education, housing or welfare payments &mdash; is, of course, desirable.  This can only be done, however, from a position of strength in terms of our ability to fund the services and the improvements in question.  The road we were travelling prior to 1987 was one which was leading us to economic ruin.  Rather than improving the position of the less well off it would ultimately have led to a worsening of their position. As more and more resources were swallowed up by debt servicing costs, less and less would be left available to meet the Government's other social and economic commitments.  Let me say that the Government are determined not to put at risk the fruits of our hard won recovery from the economic and financial crisis of the mid-eighties.  There will be no slipping back into the abyss.</P>
    <P>While the resumption of growth in the economy has enhanced our capacity to see through the process of budgetary adjustment, it does not absolve us from the need for continuing tight management of the level of public expenditure. The Government remain committed to the elimination of wasteful <Col N="1112" /> or inefficient expenditures.  This, combined with improved targeting of expenditure programmes, will ensure that aggregate spending will absorb a reducing share of our national resources.</P>
    <P>Tight controls on Government spending will, therefore, stay in place.  This is a basic message which I want to get across this evening.  Careful management remains the watchword.  We must continue the restraint on spending so as to maintain downward pressure on the EBR.</P>
    <P>Having said that however, let me say that the Government are conscious of and have addressed certain priority spending areas where extra funding has been clearly needed.  This is evidenced by the additional resources made available this year in, for example, the welfare area, the health services and security.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party motion before us tonight talks about the regressive impact of Government cutbacks in areas such as housing, health and education.  The reality, of course, is somewhat different. In relation to housing, for example, there has been a significant increase in the provision for local authority housing this year.  The 1990 provision stands at £51 million, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer sources.  This is an increase of around 40 per cent on the outturn for 1989.  It is allowing work to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Opposition's record in Government is diabolical and they do not need me to repeat it here.  In <Col N="1113" /> effecting necessary savings in the educational sector care was taken to ensure, in line with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that the burden of adjustment did not fall on the disadvantaged.  While teacher numbers in the second-level sector were reduced overall, 175 additional supernumerary teachers were specifically allocated to disadvantaged schools.  Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, 125 additional teachers have been allocated to disadvantaged schools in the primary sector.  A pilot psychological service has been established for primary schools while the allocation for the fund for disadvantaged schools was trebled last year to £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>As I have already mentioned, we have set ourselves ambitious new medium-term targets for the public finances and for the current budget in particular. These targets will not be achieved easily. A basic requirement is that the tight control of public spending evident over the past few years is maintained.  To do otherwise would be to loosen the floodgates and undermine confidence in the Government's commitment to the long-term welfare of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At long last we are getting to grips with the reform of our taxation system so as to gear it to the needs of the economy and, in particular, the requirements of job-creation.  I have already referred to indirect taxation and the need to harmonise our taxes, as our circumstances permit.  The Government are totally committed to achieving harmonisation of our taxes at the earliest possible date.  We all agree that the levels of direct and personal taxation are too high.  The Government have made a very good start in tackling this problem by reducing the top rate of tax from 58 per cent to 53 per cent and the standard rate from 35 per cent to 30 per cent, significantly extending the standard and 48 per cent tax bands, substantially increasing the exemption rates for the low paid and introducing an addition to those limits in respect of children.  The Government have made a very good start towards protecting the living standards of those <Col N="1114" /> on low pay and giving a better standard of living to those at work.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Government have made a start towards harmonising our taxes and will continue to do so.  The EC Commission study on the problems for the Irish Exchequer should be completed shortly.  Hopefully this study will indicate how further progress can be made in this area.  The major changes in the corporate tax area, tax collection and the introction of self-assessment will mean better collection and more revenue from the corporate side.</P>
    <P>Our progress in the European Community has not been confined solely to Ireland, we had a very successful Presidency and we have started to spend our Structural Funds.  This will bridge the gap between our economy and the economies of our more developed partners in the EC.</P>
    <P>The Government's vision of economic and social progress in the nineties is of strong and sustainable growth in output and employment aimed at raising living standards and meeting the challenges of the Single European Market.  The external conditions which face us promise to be relatively benign.  The outlook for the world, and particularly the European economy, is more favourable than it has been for a very long time.  Because of the progress we have made in removing major inhibiting factors, the economy now has the capacity to move into a period of sustained growth.</P>
    <P>However, turning our vision from aspiration to reality will not be automatic or even easy.  It will require an unwavering commitment to the policies that the objective demands.  Let us be clear that we delude ourselves if we will the end but not the means.  This is, basically, what the Labour Party motion is about.  In an open economy, expansion of the internationally traded sectors is the only enduring basis for growth.  To bring this about, improvement of competitiveness in all its many aspects is the key.</P>
    <P>When, I hope, we sit down to discuss a new programme for recovery, by the end of this year the shape of the new <Col N="1115" /> arrangement and the particular requireements of each of the participants will, no doubt, be on the table.  The Government's priority, however, is unequivocal. The overriding objective of the new accord must be to maintain the basis of sustainable growth and thus secure the maximum possible rate of employment increase.  This has major implications, not only for the feasibility of pursuing other objectives, but also for the way we go about advancing them.  All the participants must be prepared to face up to the &ldquo;trade-offs&rdquo; inevitably involved between pay and jobs, between public services and personal spending power, between preserving sectional privileges, evolving a more efficient and equitable system between welfare provision and taxation relief and between aids to commercial activity and a more hospitable general business environment, objectives which we all seek from within our limited resources.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael fully support the Labour Party motion.  To quote the words of a modern day singer, the Minister's speech is an illusion because the figures he quoted indicated that everything in the garden is rosy.  He pontificated about those who claimed that they could have turned the economy around without pruning public expenditure and said they were perpetrating a cruel hoax on those people who inevitably suffered some discomfort from the cuts.  Indeed, that could be said about those on the Government's Front Benches when they were in Opposition who put forward that view daily and fooled the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech is set against the background of last week's devastating rise in unemployment figures.  The national average hides the serious situation in many urban areas in Cork and <Col N="1116" /> Dublin.  I know that in parts of my own constituency there is 75 per cent unemployment. The Minister's position is also against the background of the ongoing continued cutbacks in the social programme. The Minister referred to a percentage increase this year over last year in regard to housing but a 40 per cent increase on zero is still very little.  In the city which I represent not one house was built in 1989 although there are 1,100 people on the housing list.  Recent figures show that there are close to 150 people homeless on the streets of Cork and living rough.</P>
    <P>There are still very long queues for the health services and the failure of the Minister for Health to act on the report of the Commission on Health Funding condemns him in the eyes of the public. We have an ever-growing divide between haves and the have-nots, the people who can afford medicine and those who are at the mercy of hospital queues day in, day out.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan interjected, 46,000 people emigrated last year, a scandalously high figure which hides the reality of the unemployment figures released monthly.  Cattle and sheep prices are plummeting and there has been a dramatic drop in the price of lamb.  There has also been a reduction in the price of milk which has not been passed on fully to the consumer.  It shows an appalling lack of protection for the public.  There is a greater division among our people now than at any time in our history but the Government are still not willing to tackle the key issues.  Society is riddled by restrictive practices, demarcations, privilege and exploitation but the Government seem incapable of tackling these problems.  It is a Government of the privileged for the privileged and they will funk any issue which affects their own supporters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I question the attitude of the IFA in relation to the ever-growing crisis in agriculture because of the Government's failure to submit proposals in time to Brussels in regard to disadvantaged areas.  Despite all this, the leaders of the IFA, who were so vocal in years gone by, are as silent as mice.  Where are the teachers' unions?  Their tepid comments at their annual delegate conferences in recent months compares very badly with their fire and brimstone in years gone by.</P>

It is time for members of these groups to question whether they are being effectively led and represented by the leaders of their unions and associations. I submit that they are not.  The <Col N="1118" /> Government may impress with fiscal targets and indeed tonight the Minister's speech was full of references to targets and figures.  He also spoke about tourism increasing by 15 per cent.  It is not foreigners coming to this country but the returned emigrants who are pushing up the figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The boot boys are in again tonight.  I did not interrupt the Minister and I do not expect to be interrupted.  As I said, it is the returning emigrant who is pushing up the tourism figures and it is callous of the Minister to use the scandalous problem of emigration to justify tourism figures.</P>
      <P>The time has now come to closely examine whether the position of people who suffered most from the cutbacks in recent years will improve if the economy improves.  The evidence shows that the flood of Structural Funds into this country will by-pass the areas which have been deprived and which suffered in recent years.  The great infrastructural works proposed by Ministers will benefit those who are already rich but the deprived areas, which need an uplift to attract employment, are being ignored and will be by-passed.  The Minister referred to regional development which has torn asunder its whole concept.  It will continue with an even more centralised control of Structural Funds.  That policy has already cost us dearly in the allocation of Structural Funds to date and will cost even more in the years ahead.  Therefore, I support the Labour Party motion fully because we have a Government representing the haves who support the privileged in every decision made daily but forget the least well off in our society.</P>

There is no doubt at all that there are such sections in the speech.  For example, near the beginning in his recital of the sins of the previous Government the Minister's second point was that the balance of payments was in deficit.  It was, but of course that does not tell the story.  The balance of payment was in deficit to the extent of 14 per cent of GNP when the Government went into power in 1982.  By the time the Government left power in 1987 it was down to a nugatory level and the balance of trade was in surplus.  If you had to mention only one item of the many successes of the previous Coalition Government you would have to give credit for the major change in the balance of payments position.  As regards reciting it as a problem when the Minister arrived in power, of course the balance of payments was not a problem in 1987.</P>

Item 4 is that our external competitive position was deteriorating.  It was not.  If anything laid the foundation for the growth in the economy from 1987 through to the present, it was the improvement in competitiveness, and if there were two items to which you could attribute that, they were the taking of inflation from 21 per cent as it was in 1982 annually down to 4 per cent in 1987 which <Col N="1120" /> improved competitiveness enormously and, secondly, the devaluation of the IR£ in the autumn of 1986 which improved Irish competitiveness enormously and that competitiveness was held within the economy right up to the present.</P>

It is good to have a general debate on the economic state of the nation when we are not having an Adjournment Debate this week.  My party will be supporting the Labour Party motion without seeking to amend it when it comes to a vote tomorrow night at 8.30. I do not want to go through the elements of the recital of political charges contained in the motion, but for the very limited time at my disposal I would like to talk about the necessity for a comprehensive economic and social programme to be developed by the Government to attempt to get some kind <Col N="1121" /> of consensus in this House for the objectives of the programme and to remove the policy uncertainties which are widespread at the moment.</P>
      <P>One of the main objections I have to the Minister's speech tonight is that it recites one of the great fairy tales of modern Ireland, that a Government came into power in 1987 and by dint of expenditures cuts they righted the economy. Any analysis of what happened does not support that, and I am not talking politics, I am talking economics.  Most of the progress made in righting the national finances was not done by expenditure cuts.  The then Deputy MacSharry, now Commissioner MacSharry, in his first budget in 1987 took over Deputy John Bruton's budget, established harder targets and got it through the House. Then the Tallaght strategy came in and the 1988 budget again cut expenditure, but there was very little restructuring. The 1989 budget was to a very large extent neutral, but the real progress in reducing the EBR was not achieved through expenditure cuts.  It was achieved by tax buoyancy.  In the first instance there was the success of the tax amnesty which delivered £0.5 billion and was dedicated to reducing the borrowing, last year the estimates of the Department of Finance for tax revenue were so off the rails that almost £0.5 billion more than the Department estimated was collected in 1989.  The progress which took the EBR down from about 5.5 per cent of GNP to the year end result, a very good year end result indeed, was due to the buoyancy of taxation.  Again this year in the run up to the budget first of all there were real increases in public expenditure for the first time in the Book of Estimates last autumn.  They were well disguised, but across the Departments they averaged twice the inflation rate.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We will come to that.  I am not contradicting that. I am saying that to claim that the books are being balanced through expenditure cuts is not correct.  The books are largely being balanced through buoyancy of taxation. There is an extra tax take every year and now about 45 per cent of all wealth in this country is being collected in tax.  It has gone up over the last four or five years from about 37 or 38 per cent to 44 or 45 per cent of GNP.  The public do not feel it because, as the backbench Deputies have said, this was a result of growth in the economy.  It was not because new taxes were put in place but the old taxes which were put in place are collecting a great deal more.  This year again already the Department of Finance's best estimate on budget day of a growth in tax revenue of about 4.5 per cent now seems to be going to run at around 7.5 per cent.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I never made any charges when the quarterly figures came out or when the first half year figures came out.  I am saying the Minister is overspending this year.  There is evidence to show that a flow of revenue might come in where the books will be balanced again, but the difficulty arises in this.  As long as the OECD countries can motor along with a growth rate of 3 per cent on average and we can do the same with 3 or 5 per cent we are all right up to a point, but the Minister's financial strategy now is based on increasing public expenditure more than the rate of inflation and hoping the buoyancy in taxation will catch up.  The day the buoyancy stops he is on the rocks.  That is the main problem and the first reason I would like to see a four or five year economic plan which sets out the Government targets and the Government intent.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;advertisment&rsquo; means a purchased radio insert or a purchased moving television insert but does not include any of the following:</P>
    <P> (i)  promotional material broadcast by the Authority within its own broadcasting service, for the purpose of promoting its own commercial activities,</P>

      <P>I was referring to paragraph (ii) of Deputy Mitchell's amendment prior to the adjournment. Perhaps the Minister when replying to the House would clarify the position regarding his promise that he would give sympathetic consideration to the position of charitable organisations, when a few days later on 29 June the Taoiseach said that this was not on.  The Minister also said that on the question of charities it was not his intention to curb the time allowed to charitable organisations for advertising on RTE radio or television. However, what in effect the Minister has done by this is to further reduce the earning capacity of RTE.  The Minister suggested that charitable organisations could <Col N="1125" /> have advertising free of charge and that he saw no reason there should be a reduction in the time given to charitable organisations for advertising.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this in his reply because there is a doubt as to what the Minister and the Taoiseach intended here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke) Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an extensive discussion on Committee Stage as to whether we should have a definition of advertising and I remain convinced that it is preferable not to have one because of the dangers of straitjacketing ourselves in an area which needs flexibility.  The areas where the proposed definition would have an impact relate to section 2 (1) dealing with time limits for advertising RTE'S services and to sections 3 dealing with codes of practice for advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will look first to the issues which the proposed definition seek to address and will try to persuade the House that these issues could be better dealt with other than by relying on a definition.  One of the first items the definition seeks to deal with is the question of charity advertising. It is proposed to exempt such advertising from the definition of advertising.  There is clearly a misunderstanding as to how RTE treat such advertising.  Special discounts for advertising only apply to RTE radio services, and even then RTE only allow a maximum of seven minutes discounted charity advertising per day. Charity advertising on the television is charged at the appropriate full commercial rate.  The only exception to this is for special appeals associated with major emergencies or disasters when the advertising is allowed free.  What I have done to accommodate RTE's existing practice is to increase the maximum amount of advertising allowed per hour from four minutes 30 seconds to five minutes &mdash; amendment No. 17.  This would be more than adequate to allow RTE to continue to offer the maximum of seven minutes discounted charity advertising per day on their radio services.  I also have other reasons for increasing the maximum minutes per hour to five minutes.  I <Col N="1126" /> received representations for a number of quarters including ICTU that the four and a half minutes was too restrictive and that there was a danger that RTE might not even be able to reach the advertising revenue cap level, with the time allowed. The concession of the extra half minute is equivalent in current value terms to almost £2 million advertising revenue per annum.</P>
    <P>Another issue dealt with in the definition is the question of announcements about forthcoming programmes or activities of a cultural or educational nature.  These questions can be better dealt with through the code of practice. I made it clear in one of my interventions on Committee Stage that information announcements about up coming programmes would not be regarded as advertising for the purpose of section 3 (2) dealing with what is to be counted as advertising for time limited purposes. Likewise I made it clear that I had an open mind about the treatment of announcements in relation to orchestral concerts and other events of a cultural character.  I made the point that these could be regarded as announcements of a public service nature rather than strict commercial promotion.  It is precisely to find a <i>modus operandi</i> to deal with this kind of issue that I provided for a consultative process with the Authority in drawing up the code of practice.  The issues which the definition seeks to deal with can be better dealt with in general through the more flexible mechanism of the code of practice.</P>
    <P>Apart from the charity question and the matter of announcements about upcoming programmes, the question of the status of sponsored events such as the Carrolls Open and advertising hoardings around football pitches and so on was also raised.  There is no question of RTE or TV3 to whom the same code of practice will apply, being prevented from covering such events and there is no question of the inadvertent showing of an advertising hoarding during the televising of a football match being counted as part of RTE's advertising quota.  The broadcaster has no direct control over such <Col N="1127" /> matters and does not gain revenue from the inadvertent depiction of such advertising.</P>
    <P>One would think that these were all new issues and that RTE had no advertising time limit before.  These kinds of issues will continue to be dealt with in the practical common-sense way in which RTE currently deal with them.  The question of prizes on programmes was also raised.  Of course there will be no prohibition on the acceptance of such prizes but their acceptance will require safeguards which RTE already seek to apply. This is not anything new.  Thus, if a programme has a postal quiz for a motor car, it will be appropriate to give basic factual information about the car but not to extol its virtues on a branded image basis, because that amounts to surreptitious advertising.  I know that already in their codes of practice RTE are concerned about this whole area.</P>
    <P>Sponsored programmes as distinct from sponsored events will continue to be a possibility for RTE and TV3.  There is in fact a small problem about the status of the sponsored brand name and logo on such programmes but that problem arises not from the legislation we are dealing with now but from existing legislation. It is a problem that can be covered in the proposed code of practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan raised a question as to the status of events such as &ldquo;Lark in the Park&rdquo; and similar events and there is no question of prohibiting such promotions of events which are not actually broadcast events and these events do not have any impact on RTE's advertising revenue quota.  The proposed code of practice, in the context of complying with time limits, will apply only to a broadcaster's promotion of his own purely commercial activities by which we mean products or services that are competing on a market with other commercial products.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins eloquently drew attention to the defects in the proposed definition. This demonstrated the danger of becoming straitjacketed into a legal definition rather than relying on the more <Col N="1128" /> flexible approach of dealing with the issues raised for example in the code of practice.  Rather than tying ourselves into a straitjacket, we require flexibility.  It is important to remember that we are not dealing with something new here, as if time limits on advertising never existed before.  There are time limits on advertising in existence and there are voluntary codes of practice.  What is being talked about, and what is intended, is that the codes of practice which are at the moment voluntary will become legal and will be imposed on state and independent television companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy for the amendment tabled by Deputy Mitchell but there are other aspects to advertising that need to be looked at.  For example, we need the introduction of an environmentally sound code of practice.  We insist that the hazardous effect on the environment or health of all products should be clearly labelled and feature as part of all advertising campaigns for them, much in the manner of public health warnings on cigarette packets.  The Green Party are critical of the whole question of advertising. We should look at options to remove advertising entirely from national broadcasts on radio and television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  Looking back at the 1960 Act it is surprising that &ldquo;advertisements&rdquo; and &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; were not defined then.  When one looks at the amendment which is designed to eliminate ambiguity one can see the ambiguity and doubts that exist in regard to what is or is not &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo;.  One can argue as to whether some of these things are in or out but when there is an element of doubt and ambiguity about several of them which is self-evident, the case for having a definition is strong.  I support the proposal as to what should be included.</P>
      <P>I have some doubts about sub-paragraph (v) and one could argue about the merits of its inclusion or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> However, I accept the view of Deputy Mitchell on this subject and the case for having his amendment included is a strong one.  If we are going to get involved in the kind of decisions that the Bill involves in regard to the financing of RTE it is important that everybody should be clear as to what is involved.  Deputy Mitchell's revised amendment states that the announcements regarding other programmes as part of the ordinary service of the Authority should not be described as an advertisement and I was hoping to hear the Minister's views on that point but, perhaps, I missed them.</P>
    <P>With regard to promotional material for charitable and philanthropic or voluntary bodies I should like to say that I do not think the addition of an extra 30 seconds can make that possible or deals with the problem because the pressures on the Authority to sell any time they have at the best rate, given the extraordinary reduction in the amount of time available, would be such that it would be hard for them to spare this extra half minute for that purpose.  Unless the Minister defines &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; as not including that type of promotional material I am afraid that the charitable, philanthropic or voluntary bodies will suffer. For those reasons I support the amendment. An amendment is necessary and Deputy Mitchell's amendment is reasonable and meets the requirement of having clarity and certainty in regard to what it is we are continuing to do.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the intent of the Bill &mdash; I disagree fundamentally with it &mdash; the amendment is needed so that we can be clear as to what we are doing and that RTE and the public can be clear as to what is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their views on the amendment.  Deputy Michael Higgins in adverting to the amendment referred to the original draft and not the revised amendment.  For his benefit I should like to tell him that subparagraph (i) now refers to announcements regarding other programmes or services provided or to be provided by the Authority.  That covers not only <Col N="1130" /> commercial activities but cultural activities. I am grateful for the elaborate support so eloquently given by Deputy McCartan and other Members on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>In the course of his comments on the amendment the Minister said that what we needed was flexibility.  The House should reflect on that major change of heart on the part of the Minister.  This side of the House for several weeks have been telling him that flexibility is needed but what the Minister is giving us is rigidity. I urge the Minister to give meaning to his own words.  We need flexibility and my definition seeks to mitigate, clarify or control some of the powers the Minister proposes to take in subsequent sections, notably in sections 2 and 3.  What is extremely worrying is that the Minister seems to be unclear as to what will constitute &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; and income from advertisements.  He now says that announcements about upcoming programmes will not be included in the prohibition but he did not say whether cross-station promotions, such as announcements on RTE1 about programmes on Network 2 or on 2FM about Radio One will constitute such announcements.  If the Minister is saying that they are not included, that represents a change of heart from his original contribution on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are cross-promotional announcements to be included in the time limits being imposed by the Minister?  Up to now the Minister said they were but tonight he told us that announcements about upcoming programmes will not constitute advertisements.  The Minister has created further doubt and confusion. The Minister said that in response to points made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others, he increased the limit from four-and-a-half minutes to five minutes per hour but he did not increase anything.  The Minister is bringing in a smaller reduction.  The present maximum is seven-and-a-half minutes per hour, or an average of six minutes, but the Minister is bringing in a maximum of five minutes per hour which represents a reduction to two-thirds of the present <Col N="1131" /> level.  We have been pointing out to the Minister for weeks that that will mean that the price of advertising will be pushed up and that will push out the charitable organisations.  I appeal to the Minister to exempt advertising by charitable or voluntary bodies from the overall limits.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried throughout the debate to have jam on both sides of his bread.  He has sought to give the impression that he is concerned about charities.  Indeed, earlier in the debate he urged RTE to carry advertisements for charities free of charge.  If I were to say this was an off the top of the head suggestion it might be said I was being derogatory, but it is self-evident if RTE were to carry advertisements for charities free of charge they would carry nothing else because of the demand for such advertisements. It would be far better &mdash; this would give real meaning to his concern &mdash; if the Minister were to exempt advertisements for charitable, philanthropic or voluntary organisations.  Having regard to the fact that RTE do not charge a reduced rate, they will charge the going rate unless additional time is made available for the carrying of advertisements for charities.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister is unable to accept this constructive proposal which could not be described as over-elaborate.  It would ease many of the practical problems which are bound to arise.  It is quite clear that no advertisements for charities will be carried on RTE after 1 October next when the Bill comes into operation as they will be priced out of the market.  I appeal therefore to the Minister to accept the definition at this late stage.</P>
    <P>There was one significant omission from the Minister's comments.  He referred to sponsored programmes and events, but in a very narrow sense.  For instance, he did not say if it would be possible for bodies such as Bord Gáis to sponsor RTE's coverage of the World Cup in 1994 or the Olympic Games in 1992.  It is my understanding, having read the Bill as it stands, that this will not be possible and we can only assume the <Col N="1132" /> Minister deliberately avoided addressing the question in his comments.  He did say that time limits are nothing new.  He is correct in saying this, as the Minister already has power to control the time limits per hour, day and month.  Indeed, one wondered from the outset why he was introducing the Bill given that he already had that power.  Using this power he can also control the amount of cash that flows into RTE.  However, he has sought to give himself a new power with which to control the income earned by RTE.  Section 2 (4) states:</P>
    <P>If in respect of any financial year or in respect of the period from the commencement of this Act until the 31st day of December, 1990, the statement to be provide to the Minister under section 5 (2) shows that the actual receipts derived by the Authority from advertising, sponsorship or other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasts in that year or period exceeded the limit as calculated in accordance with subsection (2) or (3) of this section, as the case may be, the total receipts which may be derived from such sources in the subsequent financial year in accordance with the said subsection (2) shall be reduced by the amount of the excess.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that it will not be possible to sponsor the coverage of events such as the World Cup in future years.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to an excellent article by Cliona Foley on page 20 of this evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> under the heading &ldquo;RTE's Cup Hat Trick&rdquo;.  In this article she makes reference to Bill O'Herlihy, Johnny Giles and Eamon Dunphy, RTE's panelists for the World Cup who were excellent.  Indeed, RTE's coverage of the event was superb and outdid the coverage of the event by the BBC, ITV and the satellite channels. They attracted the overwhelming percentage of the Irish audience and a fair share of the Northern audience also.  The article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> says, &ldquo;a shoestring of success but can we stay in the big league?&rdquo; It is quite clear, and I challenge the Minister to deny this, that <Col N="1133" /> RTE will not be able to avail of such sponsorship unless they reduce the amount of money they earn by way of their other advertising.  This would make no sense for RTE as it would not defray the cost of covering these events.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, Deputy McCartan has put down a similar amendment and it will afford the Minister a second opportunity to clarify whether income raised by way of such sponsorship will be exempt, whether he is prepared to grant such an exemption so that such events may be sponsored in the future.  At least three major events take place in each four-year period: the World Cup, the European Football Championship and, of course, <Col N="1134" /> the Olympic Games.  Added to these are events such as the Tour de France.  When an Irishman proves successful in that event the Government are prepared to jump on the bandwagon.  Therefore we are not talking only about coverage of the World Cup but also about the Olympic Games, the European Football Championship and events such as the Tour de France and the Nissan Classic in this country.  I regret the Minister has not indicated that he is willing to accept this definition and, in conclusion, I urge him to accept it because if he does it will greatly clarify this matter and many others raised by other Deputies and myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;advertising&rsquo; shall mean advertisements other than advertisements carried for or on behalf of a charity, or material broadcast by the Authority within its own broadcasting service for the purpose of informing the public of forthcoming programmes or other activities of a cultural or educational nature, in which the Authority may be involved;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment addresses the need for the introduction of a definition of the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.  The need exists for all of the reasons I advanced in talking on amendment No. 3 and in advancing the cause of amendment on Committee Stage when I then proposed a particular definition of the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.  The issue was lost by The Workers' Party on Committee Stage.  Consequently, I have sought to introduce a definition that builds on the arguments advanced by myself and other Members on Committee Stage, repeated to some extent on Report Stage.  As indicated, it follows, in composite form the general lines of the preceding amendment and seeks to introduce an element of clarity into the debate and indeed into the whole intent of what the Minister proposes in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty experienced by all of us on the Opposition benches &mdash; and as I <Col N="1137" /> have said before those inside and outside the House, those inside and outside RTE &mdash; is to ascertain precisely where the Minister is going and what are his ultimate intentions.  The only guidance we have received in this area to date has been contained in the course of the Minister's introductury remarks on Second Stage when he talked about unfair practices, sometimes amounting to abuses, which he felt in the commercial workings of RTE had to be dealt with, first, and then generally about the whole right of RTE to advertise being restricted, capped, and their revenue pegged on a downward spiral from this year henceforth once the Bill has been passed.</P>
    <P>Our difficulty is that there has been little guidance in the Minister's approach, in the Bill itself or in any amendments the Minister proposes, to specify exactly what advertising will consist of in his mind.  The Minister says there is need for flexibility, that all of this could be left to consultation between himself and the RTE Authority on the passage of the Bill, when he will thrash out all of the issues on which we have sought clarification and in respect of which he has been so scant on explanation.</P>
    <P>To deal with that proposition and, in so doing, advance what I believe to be the absolute necessity for a clear statement of definition on the concept of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; in this Bill &mdash; and contrary to anything the Minister says &mdash; in section 3 (1) as the Bill now stands &mdash; formerly section 5 &mdash; he will seek to confer on himself the power to draft codes of conduct governing standards, practice and prohibitions in advertising, sponsorship or other forms of commercial promotion in broadcasting services and so on.  He gives himself absolute power to draw up these codes. Then in section 3 (5) he suggests that his only obligation will be to consult the RTE Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>Consultation is a meaningless exercise in the hands of a Minister who simply has his mind made up and is determined to see his way through in this legislation. While the current Minister may be prepared to listen to all representations and <Col N="1138" /> be the most reasonable man on earth in regard to the future of public broadcasting &mdash; although I do not suggest that is the case; nonetheless he may well be, or may like to think he is &mdash; we here are legislating for the future.  Who knows how matters will progress in the future? We are being asked by this Minister to accept a formula that he, or any successor of his, will have absolute power to draft a code of standards in the area of advertising. The only brake on that power is the proposition that he consult with the two bodies involved.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation &mdash; as there was in the Bill as originally drafted &mdash; that these proposals would be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That provision is gone.  We are left in circumstances in which, henceforth, it will be a matter for the Minister, he can consult, but we know that consultation does not mean negotiation. Even if it was said that he would negotiate terms with the RTE Authority, that they would have a right to be heard and insist on a right of consideration, one would hope always that, in reasonable minds, consultation would mean that, in circumstances in which a Minister is dealing with those responsible for broadcasting he would have full regard to their opinion, but there is no guarantee of that. At the end of the day a man or a woman in the Minister's position can say that that is his or her view of it and that they are doing it in a certain way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said to us, since this debate opened, that he is doing it his way, and we get curt replies to the effect that nothing we have to say in the matter will have any bearing on the Minister's actions.  This suggestion that flexibility is a desirable way of approaching the issue of defining advertising is not acceptable to me, particularly in the context of the Minister's attitude and, most importantly, in the context of the codes of negotiations or consultations provided for under this section that the Minister says he will embark upon once this legislation is passed.  It gives me no comfort. For that reason I am doubly convinced that this House should introduce some form of clarity to, in some way, reflect <Col N="1139" /> the views of the House as to what should or should not be included in advertising.</P>
    <P>In what way &mdash; and here is the kernel of it &mdash; are we introducing inflexibility into this Bill by simply suggesting points of definition which, if I understand the Minister's arguments, he is fully in agreement with?  As I understand the Minister, in broad terms he is for looking after charities; he is all for allowing sponsored programmes to operate with proper interludes; he is all for ensuring that the public broadcasting authority will continue to give us the excellent sports coverage they have given us up to now.  He tells us that gifts and prizes will not be a big problem provided certain standards are there.  He says that in any event RTE are currently applying those safeguards and standards.  What is the difficulty? Where is the element of inflexibility the Minister is accusing us of introducing when we promote definitions of this sort? It is simply not there.  This plea for flexibility is nothing more than a clever device on the part of the Minister to give him a free hand to do the bidding of whoever it is that has prompted him to introduce these new departures and practices heretofore not known in the area of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>There is a need for flexibility.  The Minister should remember that the definition is there.  Advertisements shall mean advertising generally.  I would then go on to simply ask the Minister to exclude a number of areas of gesture and work and activity of the Broadcasting Authority that is not really a revenue earning operation but is an integral part of the public spirited social function of the Authority on the one hand and, on the other, their own self-promoting commerciality.  What we are asking for is a small gesture of encouragement for the work of RTE.  For that reason my amendment suggests that we should take out of the general concept of advertising activities by RTE promoting a charity, or material broadcast by the Authority within their own particular broadcasting service for the purpose of informing the public of forthcoming programmes or other <Col N="1140" /> activities of a cultural or educational nature in which the Authority may be involved.  If the Minister says all of those are in the clear in any event, what is the difficulty?  Why not simply put our minds at rest and let us move on in this debate to issues that we have not yet reached because of the machinations in the debates heretofore?</P>
    <P>This is not just an academic issue.  Let me take the first area of my amendment, the one that the Minister took up and tended to concentrate on here, that is, the position of charities.  I want to read correspondence from the Irish Cancer Society.  The suggestion is that the Minister's extension by half a minute is his concession to charities.  I will ask the Minister a positive question in the hope that he will answer it in time.  Am I to understand that what the Minister intends is that when increasing the amount of advertising time for RTE from 4.5 to five minutes per hour he will tell the RTE Authority that that extra half minute is to be exclusively given over for the purpose of facilitating charities and their use of the airwaves?  This needs to be clarified. To what extent will the Minister guarantee what he said to Deputy Mitchell's amendment that he introduced the 30 seconds to meet the representations of those in the charity area?  The Minister referred to amendment No. 17 which we will come to later.  Is this the way the Minister is going to handle the problem?</P>
    <P>The Irish Cancer Society have made the case very succinctly in a letter which I referred to on Committee Stage.  I simply want to quote what it says:</P>
    <P>Presently RTE allow charities a greatly reduced advertising rate. Should their allowed advertising time be cut down, they would cut out this special rate.  Presently we spend £26,000 per annum on radio spots promoting our programme of rehabilitation, education, information and funding.  Should the charity rate be abolished the cost of the above advertising would rocket to £132,000. Obviously we could not afford this, and without it our programmes would be <Col N="1141" /> very much less effective and our income reduced which in turn, would mean curtailment of services.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly any move to change the status quo in regard to RTE 1 and 2 FM would be disastrous and will hit the already hard hit terminally ill, the cancer researchers and the future prevention of cancer through education.</P>
    <P>That is their letter.  Those are their words, and that is the case they make.  Altering the advertising time of RTE and radio will inevitably lead to the ending of the special charity rate which would push up costs for the charities and mean that their work and activities will, by definition, be curtailed.  Increasing the time by 30 seconds will still leave a situation where RTE is down 2.5 minutes per hour from current standards on their advertising capacity.  Thirty seconds will not put right what the Irish Cancer Society are concerned about and what we in this House are concerned about.  It is simply not enough.</P>
    <P>That point was also made to the Minister in a letter from the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped in correspondence dated 12 June 1990.  The following is what they asked the Minister on behalf of the 45 members of their organisation acting on behalf of the physically handicapped.  I want to read it into the record so that there is no confusion in this area:</P>
    <P>I would ask you to consider amending the Bill to allow advertising for registered charities to be discounted from normal advertising time, in other words, that RTE be allowed to continue to broadcast promotions or advertising of registered charities in addition to the reduced air time allowed for commercial advertisements.</P>
    <P>That is what they are asking for.  They are not asking for 30 seconds extra to be added on to RTE's advertising time. They are asking, as my definition proposes, that the promotion of work and charities as promulgated by RTE not be <Col N="1142" /> considered as advertising.  Any suggestion by the Minister that he is attending to the position of charities is not accurate and is somewhat disingenuous.  The Minister says that the 30 seconds means, in quantified money terms, an amelioration of £2 million in the position of the revenue earning capacity of RTE.  That is simply not good enough from RTE's point of view.  They are still short massive amounts of revenue.  By definition of the commerciality that is required of them, they will be obliged to use to the maximum every second of the shortened period, unless the Minister introduces an edict in this consultative process he talks about that the 30 seconds extra he has introduced on Report Stage will be used for charities and nothing else.  The Minister must make that clear.</P>
    <P>He also suggested in response to Deputy Mitchell's amendment that the 30 seconds extra was in response to ICTU, whose submission to him I also have. They were not making the case for charities but were trying to help RTE meet the unbelievable restrictions on their revenue. In short, on this issue of charities the Minister is playing hot and cold.  He is telling ICTU he will give RTE an extra £2 million in respect of the 30 seconds while on the other hand he is suggesting that the interests of charities will be looked after in the same 30 seconds. Which is it?  What does the Minister intend in this area?  Because of his muddling, pushing the issue around and manipulating cleverly, as he has done from the outset of this debate, this House should introduce a clear definition, excluding the area of charitable work from the definition of advertising.  The Minister's arguments here tonight make that case most forcibly.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to some of the other issues mentioned by the Minister.  He said the cultural and educational events, which I wish to have excluded from the definition, will be dealt with by the code of practice.  I have no confidence in the Minister's concept of broadcasting and therefore I have no confidence in giving him the free hand he proposes for himself in this legislation in terms of the code of <Col N="1143" /> practice.  For that reason, I am arguing that we should be entitled to include in the legislation a definition that reflects the views of the House, on the one hand and on the other, of the many hundreds of thousands of people who are concerned about the Minister's proposals and the implications of the loss of revenue to RTE in this important area of cultural and educational activities.  I would ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>
    <P>When the Minister says we need not be concerned about cultural and educational events, is he talking about the promotion by RTE, on radio or television, of the activities of the orchestra or of the educational activities of the broadcaster?  Is he talking about the existence of events, particularly those related to 2FM, all of which, from my understanding of the submissions on that area, cannot survive without sponsorship?  You cannot have &ldquo;Lark in the Park&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beat on the Street&rdquo;, &ldquo;Roadcaster&rdquo; and such events, including the orchestra, without direct commercial sponsorship.  How is the Minister going to deal with these events in terms of the code of practice and in his overall concept of advertising?  This is an issue I have raised &mdash; and I am raising it again for the final time &mdash; in the hope that the Minister will clarify what he is referring to when he talks about practices that are unfair because they cross promote, or because they are abuses.  I would invite the Minister to clear the air once and for all and say what he is talking about in the context of abuses.  Where are they and what are they?  What does the Minister intend to get rid of &mdash; as he said in his Second Stage speech &mdash; once he gets his hands on the Authority under the powers to be given him in this area?</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that all these issues are adequately covered at present because RTE are implementing their own safeguards, or that they will be dealt with in consultation.  If I understand him correctly, he said there is an element of consensus on what should be the position with regard to the various areas we have agreed on.  The one thing on which we seem to disagree is that we believe there <Col N="1144" /> should be a definition of advertising but the Minister says that is not necessary. For all the reasons I have advanced, I would urge the Minister to acknowledge that he is not conceding substantially if he includes in the Bill a definition of advertising that seems to be in accord with everything he hopes to achieve once the legislation is passed.  As I have said, what I suggest would not mean a major concession and would show that at least we are making some progress and taking a constructive attitude to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the Minister chose not to respond to my highlighting the fact that at an earlier stage he indicated that he was prepared to give more time on behalf of various charitable organisations throughout the country.  At a later date this was contradicted by the Taoiseach, as I pointed out earlier.  I would like the Minister to take into consideration some of the points made by Deputy McCartan, which I will not repeat.  Some of the people who are likely to be affected by virtue of the fact that there is no clear definition of advertising in this legislation are the various charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voluntary organisations for the handicapped represent a large body of people who are disadvantaged.  I will briefly list the charities concerned: the Rehabilitation Institute &mdash; I do not think anybody could doubt for a moment that they are doing a magnificent job; the Central Remedial Clinic; the Irish Wheelchair Association; Cheshire Homes; Disabled Drivers; the Asthma Society; the Arthritis Foundation; Barnardos; Irish Epilepsy; C.O.P.E. Foundation; Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis Ireland; Muscular Dystrophy Society of Ireland; Cerebral Palsy Ireland; County Wexford Community Workshop; Downs Syndrome Association; Fingal Association for Handicapped Children, in which the Minister was directly involved and to which he made a major contribution &mdash; I believe he opened that institution; the Galway County Association for Handicapped Children; Freidrichs Attaxia Society of Ireland; Clashganhagh Mills <Col N="1145" /> Trust; Riding for the Disabled; the Order of Malta &mdash; last Sunday week many accidents resulted from the massive crowds who gathered on the streets of Dublin to welcome home the international soccer team, and several hundred calls were responded to by the Order of Malta; the National Council for the Blind; National Association for the Deaf; Irish Deaf Society; Irish Association for Spina Bifida; Alzheimers Society of Ireland; Irish Guide Dogs Association; Irish Kidney Association; KARE; the Order of Malta Workshop Training Centre; the Polio Fellowship; St. Michael's House; Sunbeam House Service; the Volunteer Stroke Scheme; the West Limerick Community Workshop and various associated groups including the Irish Speech Therapists and Occupational Therapists.  A number of other organisations could also be added to that list such as the National League for the Blind; Headway, who deal specifically with head injuries; ARCH and the Caring and Sharing Association.</P>
    <P>A number of people depend for their very existence on charity.  There are people who are totally dependent on their fellow human beings to be generous towards them because the State does not provide adequate cover for them, people who are disadvantaged and who are ill-equipped to make a case for themselves. Yet this legislation is inadequate and the Minister cannot face up to reality, define advertising and deal with the matter appropriately.  I anticipate that the Minister will say he has already responded to this matter when dealing with an earlier amendment from Deputy Mitchell, that it does not apply to television except in special cases and that it specifically applies to radio.</P>
    <P>Deputies have received correspondence from various organisations which states that the organisations concerned have no doubt that the legislation will affect their ability to get support from the community.  I do not understand how the Minister can sit there mutely believing that all will be well on the day.  The weakest section of the community have <Col N="1146" /> appealed to the Minister, but he has refused to respond to their requests.  It is an indictment of the Minister and the Government, that the Minister can sit there and refuse to do anything about their appeals on the basis that his position is under threat from the Opposition.  For that reason I will be supporting Deputy McCartan's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the arguments put forward on the general question of the need for a definition of the word &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; I responded to this argument in reply to the last amendment put forward by Deputy Mitchell.  I thought I had made the point very strongly &mdash; as strongly as I possibly could &mdash; for the need for flexibility rather than an amendment which would limit us to a straitjacket definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a joke, the whole Bill is a straitjacket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that it is preferable not to amend it because of the dangers of straitjacketing ourselves in an area where some flexibility in the code of practice is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of advertising for charities, I want to tell Deputies that I listened very carefully to the arguments put forward on Committee Stage and indeed I have received the same correspondence which was read into the record.  I was convinced by it and with that in mind, together with the arguments put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others, I increased the limit from four minutes 30 seconds per hour to five minutes per hour to include the work of the charities.  Having listened to Deputy McCartan's contribution, there seems to be a misunderstanding of the role of the concession rate available from RTE.  Let me reiterate that there is no concession rate available on the <Col N="1147" /> television services, that is RTE 1 or Network 2, and the advertisers have to pay the full rate except in cases of special appeals associated with major emergencies or disasters and at that time the advertising is allowed free of charge. RTE give a concession rate to charities for a total of seven minutes only across the entire radio service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that per day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, seven minutes is the maximum per day which is discounted for charities advertising on all radio stations, that is Radio 1, 2FM, Cork local radio. There is no discount for charities on television. I propose to increase the amount of advertising allowed per hour from four minutes 30 seconds to five minutes per hour.  I believe that RTE, while meeting their public service obligations and not just their straight commercial obligations, should be able to allow charities seven minutes advertising out of the extra time that I have given, because it should be borne in mind that it is not just 30 seconds per hour on one service but it is 30 seconds extra per hour on Radio 1, 30 seconds per hour on 2FM and 30 seconds extra per hour on Cork local radio and 30 seconds extra per hour on both television stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan asked what abuses in advertising I was referring to. However, I felt I had answered this on a number of occasions and I had referred to it again in response to Deputy Mitchell. In situations where, for example, a car is being given away on a television show there is a difference between giving the car as a gift and mentioning that it is a brand X car.  I am sure Deputies are aware that a car can be placed in a certain position in the centre of a studio with full flashing lights and the presenter extols all the qualities of the car in a way which is just like reading out public relations bumf from the manufacturer and giving the car a branded advertising promotion.  I believe that is an abuse of the situation as distinct from giving a car as a gift or a <Col N="1148" /> prize on a show, and I see nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell asked about the implications of the new capping proposals for RTE coverage of the World Cup and major events.  The capping proposals will merely return RTE to their 1988 level of income.  In that year RTE were able to increase broadcasting hours significantly, stage the European Song Contest, provide extensive coverage of the European Soccer competition, the Seoul Olympic Games, the Tour de France and other major sporting events while still turning in surplus of £5.3 million.  RTE will not be prohibited from securing sponsorship appropriate to maintaining the excellent coverage of major sporting events, to which we have all become accustomed in recent years, and while revenue arising from such sponsorship will need to be taken into account for the purpose of the advertising revenue cap, RTE as a public service broadcasting service will give due priority to the viewing preference of the public, as they have done in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan made a statement that he had no confidence in my concept of broadcasting but Deputy McCartan argues from a strong ideological point of view &mdash; to be fair to him he makes no apologies for this &mdash; and he is strictly supportive of a State-owned radio and television service.  I am afraid time has passed by Deputy McCartan's point of view on State-run services.  Right across Europe the monopolies of the State-run services have been broken and choice has been made available to the peoples of Europe.  This happened illegally in this country for nigh on ten years when the public decided they wanted a choice and listened to illegal pirate radio stations. This was legalised under legislation which we brought through this House in 1988 with the establishment of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
    <P>For the first time a scientific assessment of the listnership of all the radio stations in the country, including RTE, the national independent radio stations and the local radio stations has been carried out.  This information was available to us <Col N="1149" /> about a week or ten days ago.  This survey was carried out by RTE in conjunction with the Independent Radio and Television Commission and the advertising profession during the months of April and May, when a number of local stations were not on air and a number are not yet fully on air.  However, the report showed that in any one day &mdash; I am not saying all day &mdash; over one million people are listening to independent radio at any one time.  This proves that Irish people want choice.  That is what this legislation is about &mdash; it is about providing the opportunity for choice.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the amendment before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle rules me out of order.  We argued this point in detail when discussing Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  I have tried to answer the specific points brought forward by the Deputies who have contributed.  I can assure the Deputies that I have taken into consideration the arguments which were put forward by them, by the charities concerned and by ICTU.  I am confident &mdash; I will be prepared to make this point in the discussions with the RTE Authority in relation to their code of practice &mdash; that the position of charities who advertise on RTE will be fully catered for.  At present RTE only give seven minutes to such charities.  I believe that as public service broadcasters they should give a lot more time free of charge to the registered charities.  I am confident that the extension of time which has been given, as a result of the debate in this House and the representations made by outside organisations, will meet the legitimate concerns, which I share, of the charitable organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very clear that the Minister does not know what he is at and is waffling here.  I want to refer to a number of points he made.</P>
      <P>I deliberately waited to speak after him to see whether he would clarify any of the mis-statements or extraordinary comments he made on my amendment.  The Minister spoke about advertising on TV for emergency relief which is now free of charge.  However, as he proposes it, even free of charge advertising will be included within the five minute cap.  The Minister made this clear in his contributions on earlier stages of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in his earlier contribution tonight he said that programme announcements will not be precluded.  I have all the records with me and I will quote them chapter and verse if he likes. In debates on this subject over the past couple of months the Minister said that RTE will not be permitted, except within their advertising time limit cap, to cross-promote their different stations, channels and services.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the Minister said tonight that it was because of his concern for charities that he increased the four-and-a-half minutes to five minutes or, to be more accurate, confined the reduction to two-and-a-half minutes rather than three minutes.  The Minister is contradicted out of his own mouth.  He said that charities pay the going rate on television.  Would he not admit that the necessary corollary of what he is doing by reducing advertising time will be to push up the price of advertising especially at peak times? Does he not see that logic dictates that by pushing up the price he will make it extremely difficult and much more costly for charities to advertise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, he has clarified beyond doubt in his latest contribution that if RTE seek sponsorship to cover events like the World Cup and the Olympic Games in future they will have to do so by reducing by a similar amount their advertising income.  This will mean there will be no financial benefit to RTE in <Col N="1151" /> having sponsorship and it will unquestionably affect the quality of coverage in the future.  If the Minister cannot see this he must be blind.</P>
    <P>The Minister made another extraordinary claim in his earlier contribution on my amendment.  He said that the extra half minute would bring in £2 million extra to RTE but he did not say how.  It could only bring in extra money to RTE if the revenue cap was increased by that amount, which it has not been.  I can get the blacks of his earlier reply to verify that point.  How could this extra half minute bring in any extra amount if the cap on revenue is not increased by a similar amount?  It is self-evident that if RTE's maximum advertising per hour is reduced to five minutes from seven and a half minutes and their total revenue is reduced by as much as £10 million or maybe even £12 million in a full year that they are going to sell our all their advertising time and will get their full limit from that advertising time.  If they stay with the four and a half minutes advertising time they will get the £46 million or whatever amount they will be permitted and if they go to five minutes they will still get the same amount because the revenue cap will not be increased.  It is very clear that the Minister is trying to make it appear that he is doing something for charities when all he is doing is pricing them out of television. He is pushing them out and is also bringing to an end, effectively, sponsorship of the type we had for the World Cup and of which he was fulsome in his praise a week or two ago, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>I do not think any part of this debate since it was commenced with the Fine Gael motion on 29 May has so incapsulated the contradictions and confusion of the Minister's position as this debate has and nothing said by Members on this side of the House has condemned his policy as eloquently as he has condemned it out of his own mouth.  Even at this stage I ask the Minister, before he makes a complete mess of broadcasting which will require new legislation to be brought before this House in months &mdash; in any <Col N="1152" /> event within months from 1 October &mdash; to see sense and provide for some flexibility in relation to advertising time limits and income for RTE.  If he does not do this there will be no free emergency advertising, no charity advertising, no sponsorship and no cross-promotion of services.  It is amply clear from the Minister's reply to both Deputy McCartan's and my amendments that all these things will happen.  I will be strongly supporting Deputy McCartan's amendment.  Notwithstanding all he has said I urge the Minster at this late stage to accept the definition proposed by Deputy McCartan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification from the Minister before the proposer of the amendment, Deputy McCartan, replies.  It is a matter which has, unfortunately, become more muddied than clear as the debate has worn on.  It is in relation to the question of the times.  If one is talking about, for example, charity advertising, the merit of Deputy McCartan's amendment is, very simply, that it takes the time given to charities outside the advertising quota; it is very clear and unambiguous.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to those who used the phrase &ldquo;charity advertising&rdquo; within the boundaries of the advertising allocation and this is where the confusion begins. I want to put it as briefly and as clearly as I can.  The Minister said he had gone from four and a half minutes to five minutes in response to the charities and ICTU lobbying.  That is possibly the basis of the confusion because the charities lobby and ICTU made two entirely different cases to the Minister.  The ICTU case, as I understand it, was to allow RTE to have greater scope in relation to advertising revenue which would, in turn, allow them greater freedom in relation to a number of different activities, charitable and otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was felt that the other kind of concession for advertising in RTE, such as a discount for advertising entirely or partly in Irish, is equally affected by shrinking the advertising period.  It simply means <Col N="1153" /> you have no space for that concession unless you are out of your mind as a business organisation, because when you are given a limited amount of time to earn advertising, you have to go for the prime earners, if you want to say that RTE is run as a business.  If you also want to say that RTE have commitments to the people it means that, in public service broadcasting, they should allow space for charitable organisations to send their message and for the Irish language because they are doing something to promote it in making advertisements and because of the number of people involved.  The way to do that is to take it outside the advertising category.  The Minister is choosing not to do this although that is what the amendment suggests.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, in response to the charities lobby, he granted this extra half minute.  What does he mean by this? Does that mean the half minute was lobbied for by Congress who wanted a general expansion of the advertising capacity of RTE to shrink the damage as much as they could while, at the same time, the half minute is due to the lobbying of charities?  This creates a whole host of problems.  It means that one could envisage the list of people about whom Deputy O'Sullivan was speaking all queuing up for their portion of five minutes.  The charities' proportion of five minutes is obviously different from the proportion of seven minutes and, if you are talking about the charities' proportion of five minutes and comparing it to their proportion of seven minutes you are talking about disabling RTE in relation to their revenue-earning capacity within that slot of time allocated to them.</P>
    <P>There is a list of questions and I am asking the Minister to state unequivocally what is happening.  Is the charity advertising, for example, within this allocation? If it is not, how can he say that the half minute makes a case for the charities?  Is the Congress case that it is the half minute which makes it possible for him to make that statement?  Which is it?  We must remember that all this is being done in a way which is peculiarly <Col N="1154" /> insensitive to the nature of the structure of advertising on television and radio. The Minister has not yet in the Bill accepted the concept of averages, the notion of, for example, averaging times across a day's broadcasting.  Therefore, he could be talking about a five minute slot in a major period of the day.  He cannot come back and say that this is something he can work out when he discusses the code of practice because it cannot be done like that; it must be stated at this stage in addressing this amendment what is within the five minutes and what is outside it.  If the Minister does not put the activities of charitable organisations outside the limits of advertising, the House is entitled to hear how exactly he will do it.  If he does it within a slot of five minutes, does he accept the implications that the proportionate activity will be far greater in the case of five minutes than of seven?  If that is the case, what is left of the half minute concession to Congress?  Which is it?  He cannot have it every way.</P>

      <P>These questions must be answered.  There is no point in confusing two quite different, separate things in this debate.  I hope we will be as constructive as possible and make as much progress as we can on these amendments. However, if the Minister is speaking about plurality of choice in relation to either radio or television, that is one thing; it is a well known concept.  It is entirely different from concepts which suggest breaking up State ownership. That is not the relationship which prevails at the same time.  In a very curious way, the Minister is regulating the market and he has selected a particular company &mdash; RTE &mdash; a corporate entity seeking to function in the market-place with other sellers of advertising.  He is saying that they are peculiarly disabled because of their origins and because they receive the licence fee.  I expect that the constitutional issues provoked by this will <Col N="1155" /> probably be decided by the courts, and I need not delay on them now.</P>
      <P>The Minister should avoid stretching the debate on these narrow amendments to wider areas of philosophy and this whole question of choice and one million people listening at any one time, according to the recent listenership survey.  I could delay &mdash; but I will not &mdash; on the question of the figure of one million.  It is an extrapolation from a sample survey and if the Minister looked at it closely he would see that there are grave reservations about the manner and the way you could go from the sample published, to making a statement that one million Irish people are listening to the new independent stations at any one time.  If there are, good luck to them but I am just saying that it is not as factually based as the Minister might think.</P>
      <P>The main reason I rose before the proposer of the amendment replies is to seek clarification on the situation.  It cannot be left vague so that it appears attractive to people with two quite different projects and straightened out in the codes of practice. That is evading the issue, and we would like straight answers in regard to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins is optimistic in seeking clarification, especially on Report Stage, when the Minister has already spoken.  As everything the Minister said failed to give us clarification, perhaps it does not matter very much whether he speaks.  I do not want to go over the ground already covered, the evasions and the deliberate ambiguities which mark this whole discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to focus on something on another level which disturbs me.  The Minister has twice said he is concerned that there should be flexibility in interpretation of advertisements.  I have been in the Oireachtas for 25 years in Opposition and Government and I tried to recall any occasion when a Minister defended the drafting of legislation because it was uncertain, ambiguous and left doubt and room for interpretation.  The purpose of <Col N="1156" /> legislation is to be clear and unambiguous. We often fail and things go to the courts and are decided differently from what was intended, but at least we try to be unambiguous.  I never heard a Minister advocate uncertainty in legislation. One wonders why.</P>
    <P>In this case will the interpretation of this word ever be decided if it is in dispute in the courts?  I do not think so.  Whatever the Minister decides regarding the interpretation it imposes, it is rather hard to visualise the Broadcasting Authority taking the matter to the courts and challenging the Minister's interpretation. That is why the Minister is not concerned about the meaning of the word.  This Bill is unlike most other Bills before the House because its interpretation rests in the hands of the Executive, not in the courts &mdash; in practice, although I do not know about the theory.  The Minister will decide &mdash; as he has made quite clear by his concern for flexibility &mdash; what an advertisement is.  He will also, without any control whatever in the form of bringing the matter before this House, decide off his own bat, on codes covering standards, practice, prohibitions on advertising sponsorship.  He decides also on the level of licensing fees without coming back to this House.  All these matters are decided by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have noticed with some amusement Deputy McCartan using the usual ploy we have in this House of saying it is not just the present Minister, that you could not be sure what other Ministers might do in future.  Deputy McCartan was not being serious.  Surely he does not envisage any future Minister being more hostile to public broadcasting than this Minister.  In this case let us forget the ambiguities and the politeness.  It is this Minister who is setting out to control public broadcasting for his own purposes, not in the public interest we are concerned about.  It is he who is seeking these powers for himself to exercise in order to control public broadcasting to which he is known to be inimical because it has been impartial where all of us are concerned, to our own fury and annoyance. We are all paranoid about the subject. <Col N="1157" /> Because of that the Minister wants to get control of public broadcasting and also because he favours more the commercial broadcasting aspect.  However, I think the former motive has now become, in this draft of the Bill, more obvious than in the previous one.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great concern that a Minister should come into this House and defend drafting because it is ambiguous, because it will give him power to decide what things mean.  That is not how parliamentary democracy works.  It works by doing our best to define things and the courts deciding on them.  In this instance the Minister has no intention of allowing it to go to the courts.  No broadcasting authority while he is there would have any encouragement to dispute a matter in the courts.  We know from the appointments made that we have an Authority who are not appointed with a view to being independent and tough in standing up to Governments, unlike the kind of authority we appointed five years ago.  This appointment was on quite different criteria.  Therefore, I am very concerned in this instance about this talk of flexibility.  At this stage the Minister has what he wants.  He has got his majority.  He is steamrolling this measure through.</P>
    <P>I am afraid a certain party in this House, the Progressive Democrats, have let themselves and the country down on this issue.  They failed to tackle this problem at the right level from the beginning in Government.  When that was found out they tried to mend their hand and did so clumsily and inadequately.  Now having shot their bolt, they are unwilling to exercise their leverage in Government on which we rely to a great extent to ensure that this Government do not abuse their power.  In this instance that leverage has been lost because they shot their bolt too soon and are not prepared to stand up now and take their responsibilities as the party who have in the past given very strong views on some of these issues and were seen to be serious about it.  Without that the Minister now will have his way.  He will force this through. He will tell RTE what &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo;<Col N="1158" /> means.  He made it quite clear that he does not expect that to be contested in the courts.  He will decide all the other matters here including the licence fee.  I may come back to that point about the licence fee later.  It may not be relevant now, but I think we want to look at it. When the original legislation was brought in the Minister's power to determine the licence fee related to a broadcasting service under his control, under the control of the Government, and he wanted to have more revenue.  It was not envisaged in 1926 that the Government would want the broadcasting authority to have less revenue.  That was not thought of, and that legislation under which the Minister has power to determine the licensing fee is quite wrong now in the present context. Unfortunately, we cannot deal with that here but I hope a future Government will return to it.  The power to determine that crucial factor and to have a stranglehold over public broadcasting should not rest in the hands of any Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald is absolutely correct when he corrects me in turn and the views he has expressed in terms of the current Minister are views I expressed earlier in the debates.  Short of throwing the kitchen sink at the Minister in an effort to engage him in some way in this debate and get him to respond to some of the excellent points that have been made on this side of the House, I felt that suggesting what might be a future more bleak than the present might have prompted him, but it was simply a device and the Deputy is correct about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank those Deputies who have spoken to the amendment.  I will address briefly the points the Minister has repeated as he did on Deputy Mitchell's amendment along similar lines.  As Deputy Michael Higgins said, the Minister has played absolutely clever on the issue and is being totally inconsistent.  He argues on the one hand that charities and their functions will not be included in the definition of &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; as he understands it or as he will be introducing it to the Authority once in place with the powers under section 3 of the Bill, but <Col N="1159" /> on the other hand he says that, as he is giving RTE an extra half minute, charities can be included and accommodated. I do not know where the Minister is going.  Even though I raised those questions with him before he rose on this section of the debate, he refused point blank to answer them.  We can only leave it there hanging and let us see what emerges as time progresses.</P>
    <P>On the issue of flexibility, the Minister's main point, he suggests that the definition I am proposing would introduce a strait-jacket element on the workings of himself, the Authority and anyone in the area of broadcasting.  I tried to make the point that the definition is anything but a strait-jacket, that it is a simple formula for including everything relating to advertising except a number of stated narrow, precise areas of activity.  It includes one area which he himself said on Committee Stage he would address by way of amendment at this point.  That was the position of charitable organisations seeking access through the airwaves to promote their activities.  Why has he not done that?  It is quite clear that, having reflected on the matter, if he had brought in any provision to guarantee in legislation the position of those charitable organisations, he would be abandoning his very first premise which is that the notion of advertising is a common-sense one that requires no refinement, no definition and in particular no exclusion for any area of activity.  It could all be left to himself in consultation later.  That is why he has not put before us the amendment he undertook to introduce. He did not want to set the precedent because if he did so in regard to one area it would be so easy for us then to argue, as we have sought to do, in regard to any other area.  Now it is ambiguous.  It is <Col N="1160" /> clear that the Minister has another agenda and another area of debate and it is now a matter for the independent commission and the Authority to try to curb his zeal for intrusion into the airwaves and into what are properly the functions of RTE.</P>
    <P>Finally let me refer to one remark the Minister made in regard to me, to the effect that I am relying on ideology in this area.  He has forgotten or again paid no regard to anything Deputy De Rossa said in the debate on the 1988 Bill when it was going through here.  The Workers' Party have no difficulty in welcoming the establishment of the commission or welcoming into the arena an area of broadcasting independent operators.  As I have said time and again in this House, we do not wish any of them ill nor would we like to see them being closed down.  The Deputy has simply made the point that what the Minister is attempting is not the best way of going about this issue.  If one is talking about a public broadcasting service, we are committed and see RTE as a national broadcaster, the best and only one providing that public service area of broadcasting.  For that reason we are concerned with what the Minister is doing here.  He is not simply dismembering RTE, he is dismembering that Authority, that agency, who can sustain so many socially desirable aspects of a national broadcasting service.  He is dismembering that whole concept itself. That is where this Minister and I disagree fundamentally.  However, we have pushed this issue thus far.  The Minister is not prepared to enter into debate in a meaningful, constructive way to respond even to the questions that have been asked.  For that reason I ask that the amendment be put.</P>

Basically, the Government have determined that we should pursue a policy objective of creating fairer competitive conditions for the broadcasting sector as quickly as possible.

      <P>The Minister cannot be serious when he describes this as a concession to RTE.  We are now in the second week of July and the Bill must go through all Stages in the other House. The earliest that it will be passed by both Houses is the end of the month or, perhaps, early next month, and it must then go to the President for signature.  That will be done in August.  In effect, the Minister is talking about a delay of six weeks.  The implementation of the provisions of the Bill three-quarters of the way through a financial year is absolutely crazy.  This is exactly how Fianna Fáil used to run State companies up to 1982 and it was one of the main reasons why every State company was loss-making in that year and for several years before. That includes RTE.  Fianna Fáil gave insufficient notice of financial changes to State companies.  CIE were a classic example.  They were told within a few days of the new financial year that their subvention would have to be reduced by £20 million or £30 million.  That was done every year and as a result each year they grossly exceeded the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Control over the finances of State companies was lost as no one took the figures seriously.  No sensible organisation would attempt to dramatically change the parameters in the middle of the financial year without giving due notice.  If the <Col N="1165" /> Minister was to indicate that the Bill would come into operation on 1 October 1992, or some earlier date he may fix by order, I might be inclined to say that that was a concession and therefore I would be willing to support him, even though I am vehemently opposed to the capping proposals in principle.  This would make sense from the point of view of management as it would allow for a phasing in of the proposals and the date on which they would come into operation to be synchronised with the date on which the alternative television channel is to be set up.  For the Minister to suggest it is a concession to postpone the coming into operation of the Bill by about six weeks is to treat the House with contempt.  I do not know where this leaves RTE but, as far as the Minister is concerned, they are beneath contempt.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the amendment proposed by the Minister not because it would defer the coming into operation of the Bill by between six and seven weeks but rather because it suggests it should come into operation in this financial year. Have the Government any idea of what went wrong in the State sector in the period up to 1982 and are they willing to learn any lesson from the way in which this was rectified between 1982 and 1987, by which time most of the State companies had returned to profitability or greatly improved their finances?  RTE, having incurred losses year after year, returned to profitability and repaid some of their Exchequer loans.  However, they are now to be penalised for this.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus also incurred losses in the three-year period up to 1982 but they, too, returned to profitability by 1986 and continue to make profits.  Other companies to return to profitability include the ESB, the Irish Sugar Company and the Great Southern Hotels Group, to mention but a few.  This was done by running the companies as businesses, which not only required a change of attitude on the part of the Government but also on the part of the trade unions, who were not found wanting.  Indeed, they played a very significant role in improving <Col N="1166" /> the performance and prospects of the State sector.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have been so inactive in this matter.  They have made statements but these have not been as strong or as virulent as some of the statements they made on other issues in the past.  We need be in no doubt that if the Irish Congress of Trade Unions strongly defended the State sector in this instance, this Bill would not be enacted or, indeed, brought into operation on 1 October this year.  I have already indicated that it is my prediction that the broadcasting sector will be in a mess following 1 October but it is possible that the Government will find themselves in a bigger mess before then when they come to negotiate the next centralised pay deal. It seems the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will be able to make a very powerful argument when they come to discuss the Government's attitude to this Bill, the unemployment figure and the other privatisation proposals.</P>
    <P>This amendment, apart from symbolising the attack on RTE, also symbolises a reversion to the old attitude towards State companies and the failure to understand that they should be run as businesses and given sufficient notice of changes in financial policy.  On 27 February the Minister indicated in the House that he had no plans to level the playing field.  However, On 29 March, he indicated that he was going to do so and on 29 May he outlined certain proposals in response to a Fine Gael motion.  Four days later he introduced a different set of proposals, which were revised one week later.  These are to be implemented even though seven-twelfths of the calendar year have passed by.  By the time this Bill is enacted two-thirds of the year will have passed by and suddenly they will have to change tactics and meet new targets.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate what implications this Bill will have for RTE; how much they are likely to have received by way of advertising and the licence fee in the period up to 30 September; what precisely is going to happen in the months October, November and December, in <Col N="1167" /> other words, how much income are RTE going to lose?  Furthermore, how much advertising revenue are they capable of bringing in, at present projections, during the last three months of the year?  I also ask the Minister to outline how he expects RTE to survive without that income at such short notice.  As anyone who has run a Department or a business knows, decisions are often made long before the commencement of a financial year when commitments are given, people hired and contracts signed.  These commitments cannot be abrogated or changed at short notice.  It is deplorable that the Minister is moving this amendment and it is clear he is not prepared to give RTE sufficient time to adjust to the vice-grip regime he is proposing to introduce.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was sensible he would forget about any clawback from RTE this year.  If he was intelligent he would forget about it next year as well and, perhaps, the following year.  This is no way to treat any business or State company.  More significant than the attack on RTE is the impossible target it implies for RTE.  If the same attitude is to be applied to the finances of other State companies, they will throw up their hands in horror, there will be no clear targets and no confidence in the Government's approach.  If the Minister adopts the same attitude in relation to the other State companies for which he has responsibility, for example, Telecom Éireann and An Post, I do not think the present healthy financial position of Telecom can be assumed.  For those of us who played a part in achieving the turnabout in the State sector, this proposal makes us recoil in horror that we are on our way back to the pre-1982 situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address the Minister's amendment and to say that I oppose it at least until I hear some explanation and if he is disposed to expand in some way on how he considers the short period between now and 1 October as a reasonable period in which to allow RTE adapt and meet whatever potential contractual obligations exist.  I <Col N="1168" /> would like to hear what consultations he has had, what views have been expressed to him and to what extent the RTE managers association have been consulted so that those who run RTE as a business, on a day-to-day basis can indicate that 1 October 1990 is the date on which they will be ready to deal with this draconian legislation.</P>
      <P>I propose an alternative to 1 October because I suspect there is no basis whatsoever for suggesting that 1 October is a reasonable period.  Amendment No. 10 proposes that this legislation should not come into being until such time as the television programme service as envisaged under the provisions of the 1988 Act is in place; in other words until TV 3 is up and running.  If it is in operation before 1 October 1990 then I am in a slightly awkward position, but I am prepared to gamble on that issue and say that I do not expect TV 3 to be up and running by 1 October 1990 or, indeed, shortly thereafter.  What I am arguing for is in keeping with the crude principle of the Minister as advocated in this debate, in regard to the playing pitch, that if you want to even the playing pitch you need two teams for the game.  TV 3 is not in existence at this stage, and I do not see any necessity whatsoever for the legislation to be put in place until such time as we do have two teams out on the pitch needing an even surface to play on.  For that reason I am advocating a very simple proposition that the Minister defer the implementation of the provisions on capping of advertising etc. in the Bill until such time as TV 3 is up and running and there is the cogent need for the level playing pitch about which the Minister talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also adopt the formula in amendment No. 10 because there is a need, as the Minister grudgingly acknowledges, for RTE to be given an opportunity to redress the draconian provisions in the legislation.  This proposition was made in the submission correspondence of the Radio Teilifís Éireann Managers Association by letter dated 9 July 1990 where they said, in one of the three basic propositions which they put to the Minister <Col N="1169" /> after Committee Stage and in recognition that little was to be conceded.  They sought as a third proposition &ldquo;a general phasing in of the crucial financial provisions to allow RTE time to adjust to the new realities in a more structured way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage many of us illustrated the wide-ranging implications of the financial curtailment for RTE in the current year, and in the full financial year to follow, 1991.  There were implications not only within RTE, such as curtailment of programmes, the laying off of staff estimated by the managers to be in the order of 500 &mdash; the Minister has not given any indication to the contrary &mdash; the laying off of contracts for independent film-makers outside.  The implications of what is intended in this legislation are not simply confined within RTE; there will be knock-on effects on the independent film making and advertisement making area of the industry.  In addition, the independent broadcasters who are serving RTE on contract or otherwise will be affected.  The advertising industry has indicated also what is in store for them in terms of the laying off of staff and the loss of revenue that will inevitably occur. We are not just arguing the cause of RTE in regard to a phasing-in process but also that there is a need for breathing so that the industry as a whole outside of RTE that services and works with that Authority will have an opportunity to adjust and to find their own level.</P>
    <P>The point was very well made by the Campaign 25 Group to which I adverted on Committee Stage.  I understand the Minister is familiar with their submission. This is an organisation of independent film-makers representing all the major independent film-makers in the country, with the exception of Windmill Lane because of their close association with the proposed TV 3.  They have acknowledged the need for a phasing-in operation in regard to an organisation like RTE that is up and running.  In their proposition they suggested a phasing-in over a three year period.  As independents representing the other team in the game, they recognise the need for the broadcaster <Col N="1170" /> working in the field and they simply cannot respond overnight to a change in the rules.</P>
    <P>If the pitch is to be levelled &mdash; I argue it is not a levelling of the pitch but more the changing around of the goal posts, the operation and rules are being so fundamentally altered &mdash; there is an urgent and important need for a phasing in of these provisions if they are to be implemented.  The Minister acknowledges that in part.  He has suggested 1 October.  He has not indicated any grounds whatever to suggest that that is a reasonable period.  He has merely made the bald statement that it is so.  All the indications are to the contrary.  The RTE Managers Association have indicated that they would need a period of years to assimilate and to reorganise the scale of the jobs to be shed, the reorganising of programmes, structures and schedules and the renegotiation of contracts not only in the advertising area but also in the employment area, all of which would require more time than that between now and 1 October.</P>
    <P>In terms of the best management and in respect of the people whose lives will be fundamentally affected by what is proposed here, I urge the Minister to think again and to look at the proposition in amendment No. 10 which fits in with his own concept &mdash; as best we can understand it in this debate &mdash; of interfering in or refereeing in this game of pitch levelling and working between the various players. The other player in the game is TV 3. The financial capping provisions are not needed until TV 3 show that they are ready to launch and to enter into the fray. At that stage the Minister can move, if necessary, but I see no basis on which there is need for these measures to be introduced in advance.</P>
    <P>Finally, as we are discussing amendment No. 23 I should say I have no difficulty in supporting the basis of what is being argued by Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan on behalf of the Labour Party.  Equally it fits in with what we, as a House, should be concerned about, that is having a say in when the Act should come into effect.  A commencement order laid <Col N="1171" /> before both Houses of the Oireachtas would afford us an opportunity to debate when that should be.  Developments take place on a day-to-day basis so that one cannot be clear as to what will be the nature of the game to be played in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>In this respect the proposition of the Labour Party merits consideration &mdash; that we should have an opportunity to understand the actual conditions prevailing in the field of broadcasting when this Act comes into force.  The amendment in Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan's name is a good one, that a commencement order be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Equally, the concept of renewal of the order, once made and laid before the Houses, is equally a good one because it would enable us to review its operation.  Indeed, it is in line with the provision I will be proposing later on behalf of my party.</P>
    <P>In the context of when this legislation should come into force there are two very reasonable and acceptable propositions emanating from this side of the House. It would be my hope that the Minister would depart from the tightly-scripted words he is delivering from his file in order to have some regard to the arguments being advanced by Deputies on this side of the House, ascertaining whether there is a <i>via media</i>, a compromise, or another way of meeting the grave concerns of those working within RTE, those working in the field of broadcasting closely associated with the RTE Authority, with regard to the immediacy of the implications of what is proposed in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 23 is a logical extension of the arguments advanced in amendment No. 10.  Indeed, the Labour Party will be supporting amendment No. 10 as we will be opposing amendment No. 6 unless we hear convincing arguments in favour of No. 6. The difficulty about amendment No. 6, as has been pointed out, is that it proposes an arbitrary date for the coming into operation of this Act without any justification whatsoever.  A lay interpretation of what the Minister is proposing is very simply that this is the earliest date he feels he could bring the Act into effect, once it has been passed by Seanad Éireann and has been signed by the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion made in amendment No. 10 is an entirely reasonable one.  If one takes the Minister's own logic &mdash; if it <Col N="1173" /> is to confer conditions of competition between two broadcasting services &mdash; is it not entirely fair to have the second player, as Deputy McCartan says, in the field?  I might say that, if the Minister rejects amendment No. 10, then a very clear construction can be put on it.  If one says that the present player in the field, RTE, is to be capped in terms of advertising revenue, without another competitor being in the field, the only construction that can be put on an action like that is one of being entirely punitive towards the existing major broadcaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is necessary to repeat the obvious, even more necessary as the weeks of this debate go on, because what is being proposed is in violation of elementary logic.  For example, the concept of competition requires more than a single player in the field.  In the absence of that, what one is saying is that one is capping the advertising revenue of a corporate entity in anticipation that another broadcasting entity will come into existence.  That is, if you like, reducing the uncertainty &mdash; as we should &mdash; in legislation.  One of the principles of good legislation is that it should be as certain as possible.  I agree very much with the point made earlier by Deputy Garret FitzGerald in this regard. Therefore, if one is anticipating the imminent arrival of TV3 one should await their arrival.  The Minister might say: I am going to make it possible for them to arrive.  But what he is saying here is that he is taking it from RTE.  Then he allows in all the other arguments made previously about what will happen in the interim, the whole leakage of advertising from the State to other systems, to other advertisers and the inevitable job losses that will accrue.  One cannot have it every way.  If one says one is going to take it from RTE whether or not TV3 comes into existence, that is just an extremely punitive viewpoint and turns the proposals of the legislation straightforward into the category of vindictiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion in amendment No. 10 <Col N="1174" /> that TV3 be in existence, that that is the time that this Act should come into effect, has another merit, which is that this section to which we are adressing ourselves is one dealing with advertising. I have never heard of an advertising community that advertises on a hypothetical station.  They are very shrewd people. When they are talking about radio, they know a lot about listenership and, when talking about television, they know how many people are viewing which programmes not only on their station but others, at different times of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case how can one possibly speak about a level of competition in respect of something that is not there?  Then to go on to an entirely illogical deduction from that and say: &ldquo;I will damage what is there already just in case that which might be might come into existence&rdquo;, is, to put it bluntly, just crazy. Amendment No. 10 merits support on the simple basis that it tries to make some sense even out of what the Minister is proposing.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 23 is to endeavour to restore some authority to this House in relation to broadcasting and to legislation.  It proposes that the provisions of the section will not come into effect until the Minister for Communications has issued a commencement order which shall be placed before Houses of the Oireachtas.  Then the second part reads:</P>
      <P>(6)  The provisions of this section will cease to have effect unless the Minister for Communications brings an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their renewal within twelve months from the date of issue of the Commencement Order.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I offer some pragmatic, and I can assure the Minister certainly not ideological, points in favour of amendment No. 23?  They are simply theses: the amendment allows the Minister and the Dáil and Seanad to have a look at the <Col N="1175" /> legislation again in 12 months' time.  I am telling the Minister this evening that he would be very wise to think carefully about rejecting this amendment.  Rather it would be a very wise course of action for him to think why he should accept it. Let me give one reason that I have hinted at already.  In the event of a legal challenge to either a section or sections of this Bill, which I believe there will be, it gives one an opportunity to react to the legal case that is being made against any particular provision or provisions in this Bill.  As well as that, there are other practical adjustments that will be possible. How could one, for example, take the draconian effect of subsections (3) and (4) and imagine that they should quickly come into effect on 1 October, without giving the station, that is RTE, an opportunity to discuss and assess their impact on the station in terms of employment and recruitment?  The problem about that is that in many ways what will happen, if it comes in, is that there may be a short, sharp reaction which would lead to the loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>I know that the word is being put around Dublin and elsewhere that one can simply dislodge people from RTE and there will be lots of jobs in the new station, whenever that happens.  That is poor comfort to people who will be threatened and RTE will be locked into an almost inflexible position.  They will have no flexibility whatsoever.  By putting in the possibility of reviewing the impact of the legislation after 12 months, one is able to see how the effects of the legislation, through advertising capping, have in fact worked their way through the system in a period of 12 months.  Therefore, one is able to judge costs against employment and recruitment and one is able to try to avoid forced redundancies and having to advertise for voluntary redundancies within RTE.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose the Minister rejects this amendment.  I would remind him that he will be seeking a new national <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> But if a <Col N="1176" /> new national wage agreement is negotiated &mdash; and that is the position the Minister and his colleagues think they are operating in relation to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions &mdash; then if the Minister sticks to his date, which he has not justified, any new national wage round for its staff will be at the expense of jobs in RTE, because there would have been no opportunity to look at the effects on revenue of the capping of advertising and so on.  It could be simply disastrous.  It would mean that there would be confrontation within the station.  In addition to that, if RTE inform their staff that the wage increases it was hoped would be agreed could only be implemented at the cost of jobs, that will involve the whole question of the possibility of concluding a national wage agreement and a <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>I am simply saying that it is madness to be putting in an arbitrary date that has no justification whatever in relation to the policy thrust of this Bill, whatever it might be, which has not been justified for us.  It makes no sense at all to be so provocative.</P>
    <P>I would put this interesting point to the Minister before he dismisses not only amendment No. 23 but amendment No. 10.  I sat in this House, Sir, and I listened to the very same Minister on the occasion that, as he keeps saying, he won his spurs in defeating the pirates.  He said he would not put the pirates off the air until the alternatives were in place, until the new stations were in place.  He said he would not implement his legislation until the new people were in place.  The fact was that he would face the wrath of the crowds that were gathering all around this House and in the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Then it came to deflectors and the Minister's flirtation with what he saw as the first application at national level of MMDS.  But did he have the courage to say to the people who were using deflectors that they should take them off from within a few weeks of his passing this legislation?  No, he did not.  He said he would have to think it out very carefully and see whether MMDS was in place. Is it not extraordinary that the Minister <Col N="1177" /> would use one criterion of judgment about legislation coming into effect in relation to people using deflectors illegally, or the pirates operating outside of the law altogether, and he could grant them time, and yet refuse time in relation to the station that has been established and built up, whether one likes it or not. I agree with what Deputy FitzGerald said earlier, that it is because it is discomfiting for the Minister and is creating an intolerant reaction on the part of the Minister, because it is a station that is critical and has the capacity critically to address issues in society.  In that sense it has been a powerful contributor to change and to discussion on the nature of change.  That station is to be singled out and treated in an entirely different way, a lesser way than the pirates and the people using illegal deflectors.</P>
    <P>The suggestion in amendment No. 6 has not been justified and in the absence of any case being put forward by the Minister one can only think that it is through sheer expediency that he is justifying this date in October.  I would certainly say that the Labour Party's position is that we will support amendment No. 10 as an entirely sensible amendment on the grounds that it makes no sense to be talking about completion until all the partners are there.  This is quite consistent with previous decisions taken.  In relation to amendment No. 23, we believe it gives accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas, it gives us time, it gives us an opportunity for review, and quite frankly, if there is a serious legal challenge to a provision or provisions of this legislation under amendment No. 23, it can be allowed to wither away without any significant loss of face by a Minister for whom having a great deal of face seems to be a preoccupation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in regard to his amendment, is it not the case that his amendment implies the <Col N="1178" /> intention, when this Bill goes to the other House, of not allowing any amendment to be made there?  As we know, the Dáil is adjourning shortly and, as far as I am aware, it is intended it shall resume in October.  Perhaps I am wrong in that, but that is my understanding.  What the Minister is proposing is to emasculate the other House by bringing a Bill before it and telling it in advance that he has no intention of allowing them to amend it. This is another example of the kind of tactics which are associated with the Minister which do not help the reputation of Government in the eyes of the people.  For the reasons already given, this is a bad amendment intrinsically and it is bad in parliamentary terms also.  That is the only point I want to make.</P>

      <P>I would also like to confirm my support for the views expressed in relation to this amendment. It is very clear that this amendment is not a cosmetic gesture on the part of the Minister.  What is the effect of putting back the commencement of the operation of this section to 1 October?  We are now coming to the close of the present Dáil session.  After that there will be the holidays and, effectively, what the Minister is talking about is a gesture to those who are opposed to the Bill which involves having a commencement date immediately after the holiday period and, indeed, before the resumption of the Dáil.  It seems that this is a further ridiculous example of the Minister's attitude. It is absolutely nonsensical for the Minister to ask this House to accept this amendment.  It is absolutely nonsensical for him to ask the general public to accept that it makes sound sense to construe this amendment as a concession of even the slightest consequence on the Minister's part.  It is typical of the ill-thought out approach on the part of the Minister to this whole business behind this Bill and is a further indictment of the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Communications. In fact, this is the first opportunity I have had to address any remarks to the Minister in that capacity. My remarks have generally been in <Col N="1179" /> relation to his other part-time job.  Let me say that I am as unimpressed by him in his capacity as Minister for Communications as I am of him in his capacity as Minister for Justice.  I totally reject the approach which he is asking this House to adopt in relation to this amendment.</P>

I would ask the Minister at this late stage to scrap the whole Bill in all its shapes and forms, of which it has many.  There is so much confusion about the Bill that nobody knows exactly what is in it or what is the end purpose.  The original purpose was to cap advertising so as to bail out the Minister's friends in Century Radio. Some people might think that is a very personal thing to say but I can support it.</P>
      <P>Advertising will find its own level on television.  If there is too much advertising and not enough content in programmes, people will not watch it.  If the TAM ratings go down, the advertisers will pull out because they are only interested in advertising to a public who is viewing and buying the goods they are advertising.  Rather than putting a cap on RTE, they should be encouraged to get as much revenue as they can from advertising, and reduce the licence fee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we continue to see the advertisement of the man with his dog complaining about his neighbour who is not paying the licence fee?  When people are not warned about the consequences of not paying, others will follow suit and will not pay.  Therefore a bad situation will become much worse.  That is only one aspect of the matter.</P>
      <P>A deadline of 1 October has been set by the Minister.  The same Minister set a deadline in relation to the pirate radio stations.  If he is so concerned about helping independent radio stations, why has he turned a blind eye to pirate stations who continue to operate?  I am not blaming the Minister personally &mdash; he may have some knowledged of these stations but certainly his Department have knowledge of them.  I will name the radio station who are still on the air, collecting advertising and competing with a legalised station in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan &mdash; it is Radio Star.  That station continues to broadcast programmes and to advertise in competition with a legal station.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why he has turned a blind eye to them.</P>
      <P>In the same constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, a very popular illegal radio station went off the air when the Minister announced the deadline but came back to fill a vacuum until the new radio stations came on the air and within two days of coming back on the air, the Department officials intervened and the Garda, backed up by the Army, confiscated the equipment and warned the operators that they would be sent to jail.  There seems to be a law for one while a blind eye is turned to the other.</P>

      <P>Far from it.  The law should be applied fairly across the board but that is not happening.  I would like to know what is behind the Minister's thinking on this matter.  I am totally <Col N="1181" /> opposed to this deadline and to the Bill. It has done irrevocable damage, which will take a long time to undo.  RTE are an excellent station who are providing excellent viewing for the public.  You would not be embarrassed to sit down with your family to watch an RTE programme, unlike the case of some of the other stations that are available in this country.  People will now have no alternative but to turn to these stations because RTE will not be able to provide the entertainment they were previously providing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to add my voice in opposition to the Minister's amendment.  In the last few weeks, as the debate has raged about this ill-conceived Bill, the Minister appeared to give the impression that he was listening to some of the arguments and that perhaps he would consider suspending the operation of the Bill for some time.  As we can see from this amendment, that was all a smokescreen and a window dressing.  It is quite clear the Minister does not want to listen to what the Opposition have to say.  I would ask him why he is not prepared to listen to all the bodies who represent the various sectors involved in television advertising, such as the marketing society and the Association of Advertisers of Ireland.  I am sure the Minister has received similar correpondence to what we have received.</P>
      <P>In the letter from the marketing society of 9 July, they clearly state that the availability of TV3 still appears to be, at the very least, a year away.  There has been no indication as to whether the contract for TV3 will be awarded.  The marketing society remind us that when another television service has been set up they will have to build up a reputation for their programmes and prove that they have a large enough audience to attract advertisers, who will not spend money on a station that people are not watching.  If the Minister does not know the basic element of advertising, he should not be bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas the Minister might not wish to be seen to be giving in to the calls from <Col N="1182" /> the Opposition, he is totally ignoring all the professional bodies who represent the advertisers and the marketing society and I would appeal to him to listen to their calls.  As regards this amendment which proposes a deadline of 1 October, I support Deputy Garret FitzGerald in that the Minister is pre-empting any possible amendments that the Seanad or even he might wish to make, by cutting off any opportunity for those amendments to be taken or to be brought back to this House.  The Minister should stop bulldozing this Bill through the House and listen to the bodies outside the House, the unions, the associations and the marketing board, even if he is not prepared to listen to us.  He should change the Bill or, as Deputy Boylan has said, throw it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On amendment No. 6, I would like the Minister to clarify one point.  I would refer to his speech on Second Stage on 7 June 1990, in which he stated, volume 399, column 1575 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>I would expect that the effect of this measure in the current year should be to divert something around £6 million of advertising revenue onto the media market, while in a full year, in current terms, it should lead to a diversion of around £12 million.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the commencement date proposed in this amendment is 1 October, three months from now, are we to take it that the figure of £6 million applies to the three months?  If that is the case, rather than doubling the figure to £12 million, I would imagine we are talking in terms of £24 million for a full year. This is a point that will have to be clarified. If I am correct, our predictions to date regarding the future viability of RTE will be realised in no uncertain terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in supporting amendment No. 10 in as much as it proposes to introduce an element of sanity into the debate.  What the Minister is doing is ensuring there is not a repeat with TV3 of what happened with Century Radio.  He is making provision in advance <Col N="1183" /> of the introduction of the third television channel, at the expense of RTE.  We have expressed our views time and again on what he is doing.  This is an effort on the part of the Minister to avoid the pitfalls that would be encountered in allowing a third national radio station to come on the air.  What the Minister is doing could be challenged in the courts and could eventually lead to the embarrassment of this House.  He has not shown any inclination to listen to the suggestions made by the speakers on this side of the House to reduce the draconian effects, as Deputy Michael D. Higgins said earlier, of what he is trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 23, we in the Labour Party are asking that the provisions of this section should not come into effect for a period of 12 months.  This would allow the Government and the Dáil to have a fresh look at the situation and would be the proper course to follow, bearing in mind that in spite of the Minister complimenting himself on his achievements in 1988, we are here two years later introducing new legislation. It is indicative of how unsuccessful the Minister was in 1988 and how flawed the legislation was that we again must have a protracted debate on broadcasting on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the inactivity of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, but I think his point needs to be qualified.  It is difficult to say how effective the ICTU action will be at this juncture but I imagine the Minister is putting the chance of another national agreement in jeopardy.  If he is prepared to play for such high stakes, that rests fairly and squarely on his shoulders, but I have no doubt that his colleague, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, must have some reservations about the course of action the Minister is pursuing.  The point was made earlier in the day, but each and every one of us realises the importance of achieving a second national agreement because when the floodgates open in 1992 unless, there is some measure of agreement between the trade unions and the Government, <Col N="1184" /> we will expose ourselves to the cold chill from mainland Europe, where they are highly organised and do not face the problems we face in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>I feel that the likely effect of the Minister's actions must go on the record of the House.  However, I accept the Chair's ruling.  I will conclude on the position of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have asked that the legislation should be brought in on a phased basis rather than on 1 October 1990.  I would much prefer to go along with what has been suggested by Deputy Boylan and other speakers in the House that the proper thing would be to throw the legislation out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But unfortunately we are trying to restrict the damage that is being inflicted on RTE.  I ask the Minister to give further consideration to the point made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that the legislation be introduced on a phased basis because I think this is the correct and sensible approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the participation in the debate, of Deputy Garret FitzGerald who highlighted the very sensitive area of the public attitude to what is happening in this House.  The Minister, by setting down a commencement date of 1 October 1990 is engaging in a pre-emptive strike <Col N="1185" /> in that he is applying a guillotine to the debate in Seanad Éireann over which the Members of Seanad Éireann have little or no control.  In addition, this House will be in recess on the commencement date and will not have the opportunity of passing any amendments that might be referred from the other House.  For that reason the Minister has to reconsider the commencement date, or, face the consequences of having the matter resolved in the courts and bringing the House into further disrepute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the points being raised.  The effect of the amendment which I proposed is in response to representations I received, in particular, to allow RTE a reasonable period to adjust to the new circumstances and also to avoid difficulties relating to possible contractual arrangements with advertisers and it was for that reason I decided on 1 October 1990 as the appropriate starting date.  In reply to the points raised by Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan and Deputy Jim Mitchell on the cost of capping advertising in 1990, it will cost about £2.8 million as distinct from the sum of £6 million which was referred to earlier.  The effect of not introducing the legislation on 1 July will save RTE about £2.1 million in 1990 so that the postponement of the commencement date to 1 October 1990 is of benefit to RTE to the tune of the figure I have, just mentioned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell's speech had more to do with the record of the Government of which he was a member and I do not want to start tossing back and forward arguments about who doubled the national debt and who did this, that and the other.  The Deputy also predicted the need for new legislation shortly on broadcasting but I would let my record on broadcasting stand against his any day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins made the point that competition requires that there is more than one player but there is more than one player in existence at present. On the radio side we have RTE and <Col N="1186" /> approximately 21 alternative independent stations.  I accept that the television company is not yet on the air but in terms of overall communications they must compete with the newspaper industry. If anybody was under any illusions about the problems in the newspaper industry, one has only to look at the situation in the Irish Press Group.</P>

In response to their arguments and the arguments made in this House I put down amendment No. 33.  This is the same proposal put forward by Deputy McCartan in relation to giving them a guarantee that between now and the coming into force of the European Community Directive on 3 October 1991 RTE will be bound, in principle, by the same rules and regulations, and we will keep in existence until that time a thriving independent sector.

This point is covered by the EC Directive and I argued this in response to the legitimate views put forward by the independent film-makers group.  Having considered their argument further, I decided to put down an amendment which would copper-fasten the position of the independent film production sector in advance of the Directive coming into force.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity of raising this most controversial and emotional issue in this House.  This matter relates to a claim for compensation by Swords Community Council from the County Dublin VEC and the Department of Education who, at the end of the day, have to sanction any such payment.  The claim is for £62,375 in respect of the renovation, maintenance, painting, cleaning, caretaking and general upkeep during the occupancy of the old school in North Street, Swords, from 1984 to 1987.  I can speak with a certain authority on this matter as I was a member of the VEC from 1974 to 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1981 the VEC vacated the site of the old vocational school in North Street and moved to a new school building at St. Finian's community college.  The old building, ideally located in the centre of Swords though restricted as a new school site in my opinion, was left unattendd. Cider parties took place on the site, break-ins occurred, the buildings were vandalised and fires were started in the building on at least two occasions.  During <Col N="1193" /> that period the Department of Education on a number of occasions refused a caretaker for the building.</P>
    <P>At that time Swords Community Council were desperately seeking a premises for use as a community centre. They sought and were granted permission to lease the building for this purpose.  In my opinion, without their intervention the building would have been levelled in no time.  Every residents' association in Swords, together with over 20 organisations, such as sports, drama and dancing clubs, mothers, toddlers, senior citizens, raised finance through sponsorship events, raffles, collections, etc., for the refurbishing of the building.  The building was refurbished, a caretaker employed and the centre was a buzz of activity.  President Hillery himself on officially opening the community centre in 1985 complimented the people of Swords on the excellent condition of the building.</P>
    <P>Following an all-night vigil by parents, the Department of Education eventually realised that a new post-primary school was needed.  They had already rejected a proposal for a site at Swords which had been identified by the VEC.  The Department directed the VEC to take that building which was in occupancy by the community council.  Through the untiring efforts of Swords Community Council they were able to walk straight back into a refurbished building at little or no cost, but what was the cost to the State?</P>
    <P>I have here a copy of a letter dated 28 April 1987 signed by David Gordon, the Minister's private secretary and by Marian O'Driscoll.  Mr. Gordon states in it that it had already been established that the incorporation of the old vocational buildings into the proposed new school &mdash; the school which was refurbished by the community council &mdash; would save at least £250,000 of Exchequer funds. Another item to note is that Dublin County Council in 1984 approved a grant of £10,000 to Swords Community Council for the purpose of refurbishing the premises occupied by them which had been extensively vandalised.  Notwithstanding the needs of the community centre, <Col N="1194" /> Swords Community Council vacated the building in the interest of the education of the children in the catchment area. However, they sought an undertaking from the VEC at a meeting in 1987 that compensation would be paid.</P>
    <P>As a member of the VEC, I attended a meeting in the Department offices in Marlboro' Street in 1986 with the officials of the Minister's Department and the agenda for that evening was to discuss the site for the proposed new Fingal community college.  I make no apology to any one in this House for saying that in reply to a question by me at that meeting the meeting received an undertaking from the Department officials present that the community council would be compensated for expenditure incurred by them in refurbishing the building.  In hindsight it seems they were prepared to give any undertaking until they got vacant possession.</P>
    <P>Nearly four years later, in response to the claim, the VEC state they have no legal obligation to pay compensation. This is a scandal.  I am utterly appalled at this attitude, given the facts I have outlined.  Another problem exists. Swords still requires a community centre. However, the officials of the community council are finding it extremely difficult to reactivate fund raising, given the amount of money collected by the people of Swords in the past.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister here this evening to accept, notwithstanding any legal problems, that a moral obligation exists for the payment of this compensation. On behalf of the people of Swords I appeal to the Minister to accept her responsibility in this matter.  They are looking to her for justice and fair play. In politics I believe, notwithstanding any problems that may exist, she can find her way to ensure that justice can be seen to be done and the people in Swords can get the compensation they deserve so much and are entitled to, so that they can go ahead and build the community centre that is required in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for giving me a couple of minutes of his time. <Col N="1195" /> I endorse everything he has said and I make a very strong appeal to the Minister to recognise the moral obligation of her Department to acknowledge what was done by the Swords Community Council. I have not the slightest doubt that the Minister would have been in a desperate position two years ago if she had not been able to take over a well maintained and modified building to turn into a second community college in the Swords region. She would have been hung out to dry by the parents in Swords if she had not been able to provide school premises for the pupils.  What did she do?  She took back the building which the Swords Community Council, through blood, sweat and tears, had renovated, in which they had installed extra toilets and facilities, where many hundreds of people from the Swords community had enjoyed many leisure hours and many young people were kept off the streets and perhaps, from acts of vandalism, etc; by giving them a community centre where they could enjoy various facilities such as table tennis, card playing, a meeting place for scouts, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Ryan stated, Mr. Gordon from the Minister's Department has said there is an acknowledgement in the Department that had the Department had to take over a building that had been lying vacant for many years at the very minimum they would have had to spend £250,000 to renovate that building to make it fit for a school premises.  Instead, the Minister was able to take the key, hand it to the principal of the school and say, &ldquo;There you are, Mr. Principal, you can start your school&rdquo;.  She had not to put even a lick of paint on the building.  The community are now looking for some compensation for having saved the Minister £250,000, and I believe that was only the thin edge of the wedge.  I am sure it would have cost the Minister more.  They are looking for £62,375 which, as Deputy Ryan said, includes the £10,000 grant from Dublin County Council which is now in the Minister's pocket.  The work it was used for goes now to the benefit of the Minister's Department.  The Minister <Col N="1196" /> at least owes Dublin County Council the £10,000 grant which the council gave to the community council to spend.  A sum of £31,175 was spent on the building and than a further sum of £31,200 was spent on cleaning, caretaking and upkeep.  That building was falling into disrepair and would not be there if the community council had not restored the building and made it available.  I appeal to the Minister to soften her heart to the pleas of the community council.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be responsible if the Swords Community Council cannot start another fund raising campaign to get an alternative community centre for this growing town where 50 per cent of the people are young.  The Minister knows that, having regard to the school figures. There are five primary schools there and four second level schools, a convent, a Christian Brothers school and two community colleges.  The community council cannot raise anything because the local businesses when asked for money for a community centre say that they already gave money for a community centre.  The community council are fighting a losing battle.  The Minister should find it in her heart to comply with her moral obligation, to see the justice of this case and give this community council, if not the full sum of £62,375 at least a good portion of the money, and return the £10,000 grant to Dublin County Council so that they can give it to the community council to help them with their next fund raising project.  I know the Minister will see the justice of what we are saying and recognise that but for the diligence of this community council and the people of Swords she would have had a far greater problem in 1987 than she had when she needed a new school premises.</P>

      <P>Deputy Nora Owen is priceless, and what I could say about Deputy Seán Ryan is something else, but I will say it to him privately.  In this file there are interesting letters from 1984, 1985 and 1986 when Deputy Owen and her party were in Coalition and in Government. At that time the fine words that <Col N="1197" /> Deputy Owen has just repeated were ignored by various Ministers.  I will spare the Deputy's blushes, but I will show her the letters afterwards.</P>

      <P>I will show the Deputy the letters after this, and it will make the hair rise on her head.  I will give the reason why I cannot accede to the request, much as I would wish to.  I beg the Deputy to hear me out.  This is a matter for the County Dublin VEC and Deputy Owen may engage in all the histrionics she wants, throwing herself at Ministers' feet and nailing herself to office doors, but I will read the legal advice which the County Dublin VEC sought and which I am now bound by. The legal advice is as follows:</P>
      <P>Dear Ms. O'Regan,</P>
      <P>Your letter dated the 14th of February 1989 has been passed on to us by the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  We have advised our client that it does not have a legal liability to compensate Swords Community Council for any expenditure incurred by the Council relating to the property.</P>
      <P>As a statutory body subject to the statutory limitations and guidelines as regards disbursement of funds the committee has no discretion in this matter.</P>
      <P>Our instructions are accordingly to advise Swords Community Council that the committee will not be making any payments to it.</P>
      <P>Any further communication regarding this matter should be directed to this office.</P>
      <P>When the community council came to see me some time ago I took out this letter, and the file also has a second legal opinion which the VEC got from a senior counsel and that opinion is also dated.</P>

      <P>I told the community council that night that my hands were <Col N="1198" /> tied because the VEC had sought legal opinion and because I am bound by that legal opinion.  I would be responsible for any funds paid out despite a legal opinion telling me or the VEC not to pay.  The case rests there.  Swords Community Council have done great good for their area but because of their very inappropriate decision to seek legal opinion, a legal opinion which told the VEC not to pay, I would now be responsible if I paid the money because I had overlooked the legal opinion of a senior counsel and the opinion expressed in a solicitors letter given to me.  When they sought the legal opinion they took the wrong course.  My hands are tied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, in the House, because Deputy Treacy is first a junior Minister at the Department of Health and second a representative of a western constituency, so he is totally <i>au fait</i> with the problems encountered by farmers in general and particularly by farmers in the west.  I know I am pushing an open door.  I will make a number of salient, logical arguments that cry out for natural justice. Medical card guidelines were set down by the Minister in consultation with the <Col N="1199" /> eight health boards.  At the best of times such guidelines are restrictive.  We have established that somebody can qualify for a medical card provided his income is under £65 a week.  There is an upward threshold for the adult dependant and a reduced upward threshold for each child dependant.  It is however, a fairly restricted regime.  To qualify, one must submit evidence of earnings.  It is relatively simple for a person on the PAYE sector to produce a P60 or a P45.  The self employed produce a profit and loss account.  However, if one derives one's income exclusively from farming one is bound by the ridiculous notional system which, as the title suggests, is entirely notional and is based on the production of flat rate figures.  Unfortunately, in this case it is based on criteria that are no longer valid.  I respectfully submit that on the basis of the experience of farmers in County Wexford who in 1982 took the whole business of the constitutionality of the rateable valuation system to the courts and won, such a notional system could, if challenged in the courts, be declared illegal and unconstitutional.  In the meantime we are stuck with the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The flat rate system of assessment for medical cards is based on the assumption that every animal yields exactly the same income.  Whether that animal is in the west, the north or the south the assumption is that its yield will be exactly the same and give the same profit to the farmer.  Of course that is manifestly untrue.  The assumption is that if one has a bovine adult unit the animals, whether bullocks, heifers or cows, will yield a profit of £120.  It is assumed that every calf yields a flat rate net profit of £50 and that every sheep or lamb will yield on an annual basis a profit of £40.  That may have been the position a number of years ago or, indeed, some months ago but it is now well established that the bottom has fallen out of agricultural prices.  The Minister of State, a Deputy from the west of Ireland who has in the recent past been involved in the livestock trade, will be aware that cattle are fetching almost £100 <Col N="1200" /> per head less than they did this time last year.  He will be aware that lamb prices in Galway-East, Mayo-East and Sligo-Leitrim are between £20 and £40 per head less than this time last year.  The Minister of State will be aware that one cannot give wool away because the price is so low.  This time last year milk prices were in the region of £1 per gallon but today top grade milk fetches in the region of 80p per gallon and lower grade milk 78p per gallon.  They are indications of the dramatic fall in farm incomes.</P>
    <P>The guidelines for medical cards, which are based on notional assessments of income, and in accordance with established criteria agreed in conjunction with Teagasc, should now, in the light of the overwhelming evidence that farm incomes have dropped dramatically, be downwardly adjusted to take cognisance of that fall.  Urgent talks should be undertaken with Teagasc, the IFA, the ICMSA and other interested bodies in an effort to reach a consensus on the downward movement of thresholds and in order to give fair play.  People are losing medical cards at an enormous rate on the basis of such assessments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to Deputy Higgins for giving me some of his time.  Generally farms are small and some land very bad and a substantial number of farmers in Sligo, Mayo, Leitrim and Roscommon and, indeed, in parts of Galway, receive unemployment assistance or what is known locally as small farmers' dole and qualify also for medical cards.  There is no dispute about the principle of dole for small farmers or medical cards for them. What is at issue is the level of the estimates being made by the Departments of Health and Social Welfare of family farm incomes as distinct from the reality that exists behind the farm gate.  Most of all we are concerned about the disastrous decrease in family farm incomes this year compared with 1988 and 1989.  We are also concerned at the failure of the Ministers for Health and Social Welfare to instruct their officials to take this into <Col N="1201" /> account.  There is nothing in their guidelines, instructions or signals sent out to the field staff to show that they realise what this catastrophic tumble in incomes has done to farm families.  In fact, the contrary seems to be the position.</P>
      <P>The national farm survey conducted by Teagasc shows family farm income in the disadvantaged areas, which, broadly speaking, includes the 12 western counties, to be £4,671 for 1988, the latest year for which figures are available.  We do not have the figures for 1989 but the CSO figures indicate that they will be roughly the same as 1988.  That figure includes all farms, the good, the bad and what I might call the bog.  Naturally, farmers who draw social welfare and hold medical cards belong to the group who have poor farms. I suggest that their average income is less than £2,000 per annum and for many it may be as low as £1,000 per annum. Indeed, some farms, although farming activities are being conducted on them, do not produce any income or have a negative income.  A constituent said to me last weekend, &ldquo;with the type of place I have, Deputy, one needs to keep it rather than it keeping you&rdquo;.  I know of hundreds such farms along the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a misconception in the Departments of Health and Social Welfare about farm incomes.  I am not blaming the field officers who do a difficult job in a courteous and conscientious manner. What is wrong is the direction from the top and the failure to take into account the drastic drop in farm incomes.  The Minister of State, who is conversant with farming, will be aware that there has been a dramatic drop this year.  I am not referring to the problems created by the bad weather although there may be knock-on effects from that.  I talked to a broad range of experts today about the fall in incomes this year and they suggest from preliminary figures that in 1990 family farm incomes will be down by more than 25 per cent.  Those experts are predicting that the final figure will represent a drop of 30 per cent.  What we are talking about in plain language is a cut of 30 per cent, in the wages of farmers.  I <Col N="1202" /> should like to refer to the small quota milk producers in Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and parts of Galway.  Last year those farmers received £1 per gallon for milk but the net return to the farmer from that source was 40p per gallon.  This year the price of milk in that vast area is down by at least 16p per gallon which represents a loss of 40 per cent for the small quota milk producer.  They are the problems dairy farmers must face.  Beef prices have dropped by £100 per head compared with last year.  Costs are not declining and as a result many farmers are selling their beef at a loss.  Sheep prices have dropped to 36p per lb from last year's price of 46p per lb.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell us that there is a mechanism for dealing with special difficulties for those seeking medical cards and I am sure the Minister for Social Welfare will make a similar response about social welfare payments but that will not meet the problems faced by small farmers.  There should be a general direction from those Ministers to reduce across the board calculations for farm incomes by 30 per cent.  Such an adjustment is needed if those seeking medical cards and social welfare payments are to be treated fairly.  The Ministers have an obligation to take urgent action to deal with the difficulties being faced by small farmers.  The Ministers should show their concern for the people who are not among the most well off in our community. I suggest that the Minister of State communicate with the Minister for Agriculture and Food and suggest that headage payments be doubled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to respond to the debate and I should like to thank the Deputies for their contribution.  Coming from a small farm, representing farmers and having worked in the agri-business for 13 years prior to entering politics I am aware of their problems.  In recent weeks I had discussions with farming organisations about the problems in agriculture and I concur with the sentiments expressed by my colleagues from the <Col N="1203" /> west.  Medical cards are issued under the 1970 Health Act to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable without undue hardship to provide general practitioner service for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in reaching a decision about a person's entitlement and to ensure uniformity of decisions in the different health boards.  The guidelines are increased each year to allow for changes in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Since the return of a Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 there has been renewed confidence in the country, in particular in our primary industry, agriculture. Consequent on this confidence was a gradual increase in farmers' incomes.  Production of livestock and agri-products has reached an all time high, up to 1990.  Sheep numbers are three times greater in 1990 than they were in 1980.  In this, the laws of supply and demand along with the surpluses within the European Community are taken into account.  There has been a somewhat inconsistent market for livestock this year to date.  While some of the figures quoted by the Deputies are accurate others are not so accurate through no fault of the Deputies as they are simply reacting to the market on particular days in particular weeks.  Because of this, farmers' incomes have most definitely dropped this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this half-way stage it is impossible to predict the exact level of farmers' incomes in 1990.  I hope the health boards, whose community welfare officers work within and for the community, are fully aware of the factual position at this stage and are taking this into account in their assessment of <Col N="1204" /> farmers' applicants for medical cards and their recommendations to the relevant deciding officers in each health board.</P>
    <P>Applications for medical cards are assessed by reference to current income and the circumstances of the applicant. If a farmer's current circumstances justify the granting of eligibility then a card may be issued without having regard to whether his or her circumstances have disimproved since last year.  I wish to emphasise that under 1970 Health Act the granting of a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board and for the delegated administrative officer who makes the ultimate decision on behalf of the chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health announced earlier this year that it is his intention to set up a statutory medical card appeal system.  The necessary administrative and legislative arrangements are currently being pursued in my Department.  When this system is in place any person who feels aggrieved in relation to a decision not to grant a medical card can have the problem addressed by a statutorily designated officer.  Pending the introduction of that scheme there is already in place, under existing health board arrangements, a scheme to review any decision not to grant a medical card. However, I am aware of the position and as a result of this debate tonight I intend to communicate with the Western Health Board and other health boards on this matter.  I expect that the factual assessments of farmers' incomes are being and will be used in arriving at decisions on medical card applications from farmers at all times.</P>

The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these grants is a matter for the local authority.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for taking the poll at a presidential election, including the employment of staff and the efficient conduct of the poll, rests with the local returning officers.  They are not subject to direction as to how they carry out their duties.  However, at recent elections and referenda I asked returning officers to employ unemployed persons wherever possible and to contact FÁS for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I have informed the county council that I have no objection to the cost of proposed work on a temporary site in Mulhuddart, estimated by the council at £262,000.  Approval was on the basis that the works are limited temporary arrangements to improve the existing conditions of approximately 100 families.  These works may be funded from the council's 1990 capital allocation for the provision of serviced sites.</P>

      <P>The new programme presents an integrated investment strategy for roads, airports, ports and public transport.  In so far as roads are concerned, investment priorities were reviewed in the light of the available EC funding and of the provisions in the community support framework which placed special emphasis on investment which would reduce the impact or peripherality, provided 75 per cent grants for national primary roads and indicated that, in the case of the roads other than national primaries, priority should be given to roads supporting industrial and tourism development.

With regard to the pay question, it is a general and well established principle in the public service, including the local authority service, that temporary appointees are paid at the minimum of the salary scale for the office to which they are appointed and there is no question of introducing an incremental salary scale for temporary local authority officers.</P>

      <P>Ireland strongly supports the aim of the proposed Directive on Habitats, which is the conservation of habitats and species of European significance and the advancement of the draft Directive was included in the work programme of my Presidency.  However, despite consistent pressure on the Commission to have this and other proposals of particular interest to the Irish Presidency expedited, especially a proposal for funding habitat protection which the Commission had promised, the proposal in its completed form did not emerge from the Commission in time to enable either the European Parliament or the Council to have a substantive discussion on the matter. The dossier therefore passes to the Italian Presidency.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that Ireland is anxious to have this proposal advanced as quickly as possible and will adopt a supportive attitude in negotiations on the matter.  In the final analysis, however, it is the Italian Presidency which will have primary responsibility for ordering the agenda of Council meetings during the remainder of 1990.</P>

      <P>The Third EC Directive on Motor Insurance &mdash; 90/232/EEC &mdash; was adopted on 14 May 1990.  Article 6 of the Directive lays down deadlines for the implementation of the Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> Article 1 requires the compulsory insurance of passengers on all vehicles with seating accommodation for the safe transportation of passengers.  In Ireland, compulsory third party insurance must be extended to passengers on goods vehicles and motor cycles.  The compulsory insurance of passengers on goods vehicles will increase premia by an estimated 25 per cent &mdash; but only in those cases where such passengers are not insured, on a voluntary basis at present.  Ireland has secured a three-year derogation, until the end of 1995, to phase in the impact on commercial vehicle insurance premia. The compulsory insurance of pillion passengers on motor cycles will increase premia by an estimated £100 per annum, on average.  Ireland has secured a six-year derogation period, until the end of 1998, to minimise the impact on motor cycle premia.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the directive improves third party insurance cover for driving abroad.  Irish motorists will be automatically insured up to the minimum cover laid down in the EC member state, or in Irish legislation, whichever is the greater.  In effect, this means that Irish motorists driving in EC member states will have unlimited personal injuries cover.  Ireland secured a three-year derogation from Article 2 until the end of 1995.  By that stage, all EC member states will have introduced the minimum cover limits of 272,000 for personal injuries and £78,000 for property damage, as laid down by the Second EC Motor Insurance Directive.  The impact on premia will not be significant when spread over about one million insured vehicles in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Articles 3 to 5 provide for improved procedures to assist victims of road accidents to effectively recover compensation and must be implemented by the end of 1992.  Existing procedures in Ireland are substantially in line with the new EC legal requirements and no significant increases in premia will arise.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the implementation of the 1988 Housing Act, with particular reference to the provision of accommodation for homeless young people; and if his attention has been drawn to the serious concern expressed by a number of welfare groups at the growing incidence of homelessness among young people.</Quest>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 58 of 14 December 1989.  The additional powers in relation to the accommodation of homeless persons, which were conferred by section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, are available to all housing authorities and are used by them as required by circumstances in their individual areas.  Responsibility for the provision of accommodation for homeless young persons, however, is primarily a matter for the health boards.</P>

      <Quest>when he will introduce the review of the particulars of office and qualifications of Local Government/ Public Service jobs which at present exclude people from Northern Ireland who do not hold leaving certificate qualifications; and his views on whether the continued use of these regulations are partitionist in outlook.</Quest>

      <P>The offices for which I am responsible are those in the local authority service.</P>
      <P>The position is that in the case of certain recruitment grades in the local authority service the qualifications provide that candidates are required to have obtained a certain standard in the leaving certificate examination or have passed an examination of equivalent standard.  An appropriate standard obtained in the general certificate of education &lsquo;A&rsquo; levels examinations obtainable in Northern Ireland would satisfy the requirement laid down in the qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However under the particulars of office for some of these offices, local authorities have discretion as to whether recruitment shall be by competitive examination held by the local authorities themselves or by competition based on candidates' results <Col N="917" /> obtained in certain leaving certificate subjects.  Where local authorities opt for the latter method of recruitment they award points for results obtained in the leaving certificate for the purposes of placing candidates on panels from which appointments may be offered.  This method of recruitment also applies, I understand, in the case of certain other public service posts.  The local authority recruitment procedures are currently being reviewed.</P>

      <P>The Council of Environment Ministers on 22 March 1990 reached agreement on a regulation dealing with the establishment of a European Environment Agency.  The regulation incorporated the substance of a number of amendments proposed by the European Commission on foot of the Opinion adopted by the European Parliament on 14 March.  The question of an inspectorate did not arise in this context. However, one of the amendments provides for a review of the Regulation within two years, with a view to the allocation of further tasks to the agency including, <i>inter alia</i>, possible involvement in monitoring the implementation of Community environmental legislation, in co-operation with the Commission and competent bodies in member states.</P>
      <P>The agency will agree the necessary arrangements, contractual or otherwise, with the bodies comprising the European Environment Information and Observation Network, in order to fulfil its tasks. No difficulties are envisaged with this procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 186 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, recovery facilities for CFCs used as coolants in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment are provided by the main suppliers of those substances in Ireland to their industrial/commercial customers; recovered CFCs would be transported to their original suppliers in the UK and elsewhere for cleaning and recycling, as necessary.  My Department has initiated contact with these and other relevant companies with a view to having <Col N="922" /> CFC recovery facilities extended to cover as much refrigeration equipment as possible, including old domestic fridges which are being disposed of.  I have also asked local authorities to consider how best they can facilitate or assist the process of recovery and recycling of these CFCs.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that the most effective use is made of the £50,000 that is provided in the environment action programme for the recovery and recycling of CFCs.  In that context, the allocation of the £50,000 will not be finally decided until the discussions with the parties mentioned already are concluded in the near future.  The situation as referred to in the media reports mentioned by Deputy Garland will be borne in mind in that regard.</P>
    <P>CFCs used as coolants represent a relatively small part of the CFCs used in refrigeration equipment.  The bulk of the CFCs are used in the insulation foam. At the moment it is not economically feasible to recover those CFCs.  I will however, keep developments in this area under review, and the Deputies can be assured that any option which becomes feasible will be pursued without delay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would summarise these documents by saying that the European Council has asked for priority action on money laundering, on co-operation with Colombia to help it transfer to substitute products and on trade in chemical precursors used <Col N="923" /> in refining drugs.  The Council also asked CELAD to prepare for its next meeting in Rome a comprehensive European plan to combat drug abuse, while the TREVI Group has been asked to speed up work on issues such as a European programme of training for law enforcement officers and the establishment of a European central drugs intelligence unit.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have introduced a number of measures to ensure that refunds are made as quickly as possible. A special simplified system was introduced in 1986-87 to deal with these refunds.  An advertising campaign in the <Col N="950" /> press and on radio was undertaken in April last to draw attention to the circumstances in which an individual would be entitled to a refund.  This campaign has been very successful and has resulted in an appreciable increase in the number of claims received.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners are not aware of any undue delay in dealing with claims in tax districts outside the Dublin area.  If, however, the Deputy is aware of specific cases where delays have occurred, I will have them investigated on receipt of the necessary details.</P>
      <P>In Dublin there has been an increase of over 55 per cent in the number of claims received and this has caused some delay.  Additional staff have been allocated to deal with this work and outstanding claims will be dealt with by the end of July.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note also that the Revenue Commissioners will be keeping a computerised record of taxpayers qualifying for a refund this year. These taxpayers will automatically be issued with claim forms in advance of the end of the tax year to facilitate next year's claim.</P>

      <P>In June 1987 Dublin County Council sought that the State assume liability for a derelict property in Balrothery, Balbriggan, County Dublin to which the Deputy's question refers and have the property restored to a non-derelict condition as soon as possible.  The council maintained that the property was vested in the State under the terms of the State Property Act, 1954, by virtue of the dissolution of a company which was the registered owner of the property.</P>
      <P>My Department referred the matter to the Chief State Solicitor's Office which carried out investigations of the title held by the registered owners.  The Chief State Solicitor then asked Dublin County Council in July 1987 if it was interested in acquiring the site.  The council confirmed in February 1989 that it was so interested</P>
      <P>Prior to the council's reply, however, a general review of the precise legal implications for the State of certain relevant sections of the State Property Act, 1954, was initiated.  This review is at present nearing completion.  When it is completed, I shall arrange for my Department to give the case at Balrothery, and a number of similar cases also on hand, urgent attention.  The review, I should stress, is of a general nature, it was not related to, or instigated by, any of the specific cases on hand.</P>

      <P>The development of the canals as a fishery is being undertaken on a phased basis under the environment action programme announced earlier this year.  It is envisaged that the project will take five years to complete.  The field work and other research is being undertaken by the Central Fisheries Board on a repayment basis from the Office of Public Works. The Central Fisheries Board have so far been paid £15,000 by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The 1990 work programme, which is underway at present, has the following principal elements:</P>
      <P>&mdash;approximately 90 km of canal channel to be electrically fished during the summer to determine existing quantities, species etc.;</P>
      <P>&mdash;large numbers of fish to be individually and batch tagged to study migration;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>At present, three Irish-based companies are authorised, by permits granted under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, to dump industrial waste at sea.  The companies are obliged under conditions attached to their permits, to regularly monitor their wastes and to submit analysis and monitoring results to my Department. My Department also carries out spot checks on a regular basis.  Studies of the Cork dump site, which receives 99 per cent of the total industrial waste dumped in Irish waters, were carried out in 1982 and 1988 and no adverse environmental impact from the wastes was identified.</P>
      <P>The Government's environment action programme announced the Government decision to ban all dumping at sea of industrial wastes from 31 December 1995.  This accords with the decision of the Oslo Commission, made in Dublin in June of last year, to cease the dumping of industrial waste in the North Sea by 31 December 1989 and in the rest of the Convention area by 31 December 1995 unless it could be shown that there were no practical alternatives for disposal on land and the wastes caused no harm to the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is in communication with the companies currently authorised <Col N="963" /> to dump industrial waste at sea which (Pfizer Chemical Corporation), intends to phase out dumping at sea next year.  The other two companies (Irish Refining plc. and Wyeth (Ireland) Ltd.), are undertaking feasibility studies this year with a view to developing land-based alternatives at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>No additional legislation is envisaged as necessary to eliminate dumping of industrial waste.</P>

      <P>Regulation (EEC) No. 797/85 permits member states to introduce schemes under which annual premiums may be paid to farmers who undertake to introduce or maintain, for at least five years, farming practices compatible with the requirements of the protection of the environment and of natural resources or with the requirements of the maintenance of the landscape and the countryside.</P>
      <P>An amendment to the Regulation in 1987 allows for an EC contribution towards the cost of these schemes.  The rate of annual premium depends on the type of work which needs to be carried out but the amount to which the EC contribution relates cannot exceed approximately £120 per hectare.</P>
      <P>These environmentally sensitive areas schemes are optional for the member states.  As part of the Government's environmental action programme, a provision of £100,000 has been made in the 1990 Estimates to introduce these schemes in Ireland.  An inter-departmental committee has been set up to recommend areas suitable for designation as environmentally sensitive and will be reporting to me as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Street Trading Act, 1926, in so far as it applied to casual trading, was repealed by the Casual Trading Act, 1980, which provides for the control and regulation of casual trading and connected matters.  The Act defines &ldquo;casual trading&rdquo; as selling goods by retail at a place, including a public road, to which the public have access as of right or at any other place that is a casual trading area.  The use by banks of cash dispensing machines would not in my opinion be covered by this definition and, accordingly, would not need to be licensed under the Act.  I do not consider it necessary that the Act be amended to provide for this.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124, 125, 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware environmental impact assessments (EIA) are mandatory since 1 February 1990 for all major developments.  By identifying the impact of such developments, the EIA promotes the use of clean technologies and low waste production processes.  EOLAS provides consultancy services in relation to process technology and waste minimisation.</P>
      <P>It is a condition of all industrial grant agreements that the grant-aided industry meets all statutory requirements in relation to environmental controls and the prevention of pollution.  In effect, industrial grants are withheld from companies where environmental discharges are not within acceptable limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial development agencies are actively promoting industries in environmentally friendly sectors and in <Col N="970" /> the environmental technology sector.  A base of environmental technology and service companies already exists here and efforts are being made to attract other suitable projects.</P>
    <P>Determination of the rate of grant payable for a particular project is affected by a variety of factors, principally the likely benefits from it and the need for the grant to ensure implementation.  There is no fixed rate of grants for industrial projects generally and hence no specific amount of additional grant is payable in respect of any one specific factor.  However, projects having a positive environmental impact will attract more favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>The 3 per cent quota for the employment of disabled persons in the public sector is an overall target and is not applied on a grade basis.  In the year to 31 December 1988, the latest year for which complete statistics are available, 2,196 disabled persons were employed which reprepresented approximately 1.4 per cent of the total employed in the public sector. The figures for 1989 are being compiled. It is, however, unlikely that the situation would have changed to any great extent.</P>
      <P>Recruitment of disabled persons to the Civil Service is currently taking place from an existing panel.  A further competition will be advertised by the Civil Service Commission later this year.</P>

      <P>The objective of the social employment scheme is to give the long-term unemployed employment on a part-time basis for 12 months.  An extension of this period would reduce the number of opportunities for other long-term unemployed persons awaiting a place.  In the circumstances, I do not intend to extend the duration of participation.  However, I would point out that the scheme provides that where the duration of projects extends beyond 12 months sponsors are permitted to recruit replacement participants.</P>

      <P>The Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, provide for the granting of mineral prospecting licences which authorise the holders to enter upon the lands specified and there to carry out surveys or other investigations to ascertain whether mineral deposits of commercial interest exist there.</P>
      <P>A condition attached to all licences is that the licences must obtain planning permission in advance under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976, for any work contemplated under the licences which would require such permission.</P>

    <P>There are at present 44 prospecting licences granted to ten companies (Appendix A).  The licences were issued for an initial term of two years subject to payment of the appropriate fee, and to the conditions generally applicable to the grant of prospecting licences.

      <P>The decision in November 1989 related to an assessment for disablement pension in respect of an accident at work in 1981.  The factors taken into account in determining disablement pension are all the disabilities or loss of faculty, whether or not involving a loss of earning power, to which a claimant is subject as compared with a person of the same age and sex in normal health.</P>
      <P>Disablement benefit is payable whether or not a person is otherwise fit for work.  The fact that a person has been awarded a disablement pension for life would not necessarily mean that he is incapable of work, or that he would not be subject to the normal reviews for claimants in receipt of disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was awarded a disablement pension in 1982 as a result <Col N="982" /> of the accident in 1981.  The rate of pension has varied over the years as the ensuing condition appeared to disimprove and improve.  He is currently being paid at a reduced rate of £27.40 per week, because he is considered to be partially suffering from a disability or loss of faculty.</P>
    <P>He has also been in receipt of disability benefit since 1982.  In connection with receipt of this benefit he was examined by a medical referee on 28 June 1990 who expressed the opinion that the person concerned was capable of work.  Payment of disability benefit was therefore disallowed from 9 July 1990.</P>
    <P>The representations made have been treated as an appeal on the person's behalf and arrangements are being made to have him examined by a different medical referee.  His claim will then be reviewed in the light of that medical referee's report.</P>

      <P>I have always been very conscious of the special difficulties faced by people who are widowed and of the need for support and assistance when a bereavement occurs.  In recent years I have made funds available to the National Association of Widows in Ireland who have carried out very worthwhile research in this important area which has helped to identify the particular issues which need to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also very conscious, as Minister for Social Welfare, of the need, when people are bereaved, for immediate access to information on the various social schemes which can be availed of. The information leaflet on widows' pensions was recently revised with a view to providing a better overall picture of the social welfare aspects of widowhood.  The <Col N="983" /> development of a more localised social welfare information service will further improve the accessibility of social welfare services to claimants.  Further improvements will be made as resources allow.</P>

      <P>Arising from the introduction of the principle of equal treatment in matters of social security under EC Directive 79/7, the definition of dependency in the social welfare code had to be revised.  Under the revised arrangements a spouse is not regarded as an adult dependant where he or she is either in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right or has weekly earnings from employment or from self-employment in excess of a specified limit.  This earnings limit has been increased to £55 with effect from the beginning of June 1990.</P>

      <P>The question suggests that the courts are reluctant to grant barring orders except in cases where there is evidence of physical violence.  However, there is no such requirement in the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981 and the judgements delivered in the Supreme Court in the case of <i>O'B v. O'B</i> [1984] ILRM 1, which considered the 1981 Act in depth, make it clear that there are grounds other than physical violence on which a court may grant a barring order.  In the circumstances, I see no need to alter the criteria set out in the statute.</P>

      <P>Gardaí are involved in the court fines payment process only in cases where fines have not been paid by the due date and where a warrant is issued by the court to enforce payment.  The enforcement of warrants whether for payment of fines or for any other purpose is considered to be an integral part of the law enforcement duties of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>No specific study of the Garda time spent on this duty has been undertaken, but this aspect of Garda operations, like all others, is kept under continuous review by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 171, and 172 together.</P>
      <P>The internationally accepted disposal method for asbestos waste is controlled landfill.  Asbestos waste arising in Ireland was largely exported to the UK for disposal by landfill until the coming into operation there of the Asbestos (Prohibitions) Regulations, 1985.  The need to make suitable arrangements for the land-fill disposal of asbestos waste arising in their areas has since been emphasised to local authorities by my Department on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asbestos waste in dust or fibre form is one of the categories of toxic and dangerous waste which are subject to control under the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982.  The Regulations make the larger local authorities, County Councils, <Col N="996" /> County Borough Corporations and Dun Laoghaire Corporation, responsible for all aspects of the planning, organisation and supervision of toxic and dangerous waste disposal in their areas.</P>
    <P>The Regulations are complemented by the European Communities (Asbestos Waste) Regulations, 1990 which came into operation on 1 March, 1990 and which include provisions governing the deposit of such waste.  The latter regulations apply to the following six types of asbestos: crocidolite (blue asbestos), actinolite, anthophyllite, chrysolite (white asbestos), anosite (brown asbestos), tremolite.</P>
    <P>The implementation of both sets of regulations is a matter for the local authorities and my Department is not directly concerned in monitoring and control aspects.</P>
    <P>Regulations governing the use and landfillings of asbestos in the work place are a matter for the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the decommissioning of some power stations has given rise to asbestos waste.  The disposal of this waste is primarily a matter for the ESB subject to the oversight of the local authority in whose area the waste occurs.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the environmental protection agency will have a role in the implementation of the regulations in waste management.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>Co-disposal in which industrial and other wastes are disposed of in conjunctions with domestic and commercial wastes in the same landfill is an internationally accepted method of waste disposal. My Department has given detailed guidelines to local authorities on the selection, management and operational criteria for landfill sites with particular reference to co-disposal.  I am arranging to have a copy of these guidelines placed in the Library.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are responsible for all aspects of waste management in their areas including the selection of sites for waste disposal.  They have been reminded however on a number of occasions that as part of their waste planning they should see to the provision of land-fill facilities for the disposal of industrial as well as other wastes arising in their areas including where appropriate, the upgarding of existing landfills.  In the future, it is envisaged that the environmental protection agency will have a role in waste management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to encouraging local authorities to provide well engineering <Col N="998" /> co-disposal sites to meet industrial waste disposal needs on a regional basis, my Department introduced a 50 per cent capital grant scheme some years ago.  The response to this grant incentive has been most disappointing.  Only three projects have qualified for assistance under the scheme and two of these have not advanced beyond the study stages.  The third is however in operation and is catering for the broad range of landfillable industrial wastes that arise in the region.</P>

      <P>Leitrim County Council have, on a number of occasions in recent years, requested that R202, Swanlinbar, County Cavan-Dromod, be upgraded to national secondary status.  The case for its up-grading has been examined by my Department.  Having regard to the criteria for the selection of national secondary roads, it is considered that reclassification is not warranted.</P>
      <P>This is a regional road and, accordingly, primary responsibility for road works on it rests with the local authority. The cost of such works normally falls to be financed from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department for regional and county roads.  In the case of Leitrim County Council, the 1990 allocations under this heading amount to £1.882 million. Included in this provision is a supplementary discretionary grant of £300,000 for improvements to regional and county roads in recognition of the special needs of the county.</P>

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 189, 192, 194 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the section of the N4 route from the end of the Lucan by-pass to the west of Kinnegad will be improved to motorway standard.  Two motorway schemes are involved i.e. Lucan to Kilcock, and Kilcock to west of Kinnegad.</P>
      <P>A public inquiry must be held in accordance with the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974 into all aspects of a proposed motorway scheme before the Minister for the Environment gives his decision in the matter. In the case of the Lucan to Kilcock motorway scheme, the necessary public inquiry has been held and, in June, 1988, I gave approval to Kildare County Council's proposals for this scheme.  I understand that the local authority expect to be in a position to forward a final set of contract documents for the scheme to my Department, for decision, in September. The development of a motorway scheme for the balance of the route to Kinnegad including any necessary consultation with local interests is a matter, at this stage, for the local authorities concerned.  A public inquiry will be held in relation to the proposal in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the N6 route, I understand that Westmeath County Council are at present (a) examining alternative alignments for the improvement of the route between Kinnegad and Rochfordbridge; (b) considering possible <Col N="1005" /> alignments for by-passes of the intermediate towns between Rochfordbridge and Moate; and (c) preparing a CPO in respect of the unimproved sections between Moate and Athlone.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 202 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of grants for small-scale recycling projects applys both to local authorities and to voluntary organisations. In the case of local authorities, the grant scheme is directed mainly <Col N="1007" /> towards involvement in the provision of bottle banks, skips and other containers for waste materials and in the selection and provision of suitable locations for them.  I would not consider it appropriate for local authorities to become directly involved in the operation of recycling plant nor would they be equipped to do so.  This type of activity is more appropriate to the commercial sector.</P>
    <P>The recycling grant allocations of £500,000 for 1990 will be decided on very shortly.</P>

      <P>The complete statistics for farm surveys carried out by local authorities in 1989 are not yet available.  However, provisional returns indicate that over 5,000 farms were surveyed countrywide, and that approximately 2,500 of these fell into the medium or high pollution risk categories.</P>
      <P>A circular issued to local authorities earlier this year asked them to consider further farm surveys in 1990, especially in areas of high pollution risk.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has co-operated by making a special allocation available to allow farm development services personnel to participate in the surveys. Areas of particular importance have received special attention; for example, over 250 farms in the Lee catchment have already been surveyed this year.  More detailed information will be available when returns have been received from all local authorities.</P>

      <P>The draft consolidated Directive on the control of vehicle emissions was discussed at the two meetings of the Council of Environment Ministers held during Ireland's Presidency of the European Communities and progress was made in resolving some of the major outstanding issues.  As this draft Directive is one to which the co-operation procedure with the European Parliament applies, it requires two readings in Parliament before it can be adopted.  Since the Parliament has not delivered its first opinion on the draft Directive, it was not possible for the Council to reach a common position on it at its June meeting.  At that meeting, however, the Council, after stressing the importance it attached to the rapid adoption of the Directive, asked the European Parliament to adopt its opinion by the urgent procedure, so that the Council will be in position to take a decision at its next meeting in October 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland did everything it could, in the context of is Presidency of the European Communities, to advance the draft Directive as quickly as possible.  The date of final adoption depends, however, on <Col N="1015" /> the speed with which the European Parliament and, subsequently, the Council deal with the proposal.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 211 and 212 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to the reply given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to Question No. 114 of 6 February, 1990 for information on the pilot digestor project being developed in the Lough Sheelin area.  No grants are available from my Department for the recycling of farm wastes.</P>
      <P>Slurry management plans for the major pig producers in the Lough Sheelin and Inny Catchments have been in place for some years.</P>
      <P>They provide an important management tool to regulate the timing of slurry spreading and the quantities involved so as to minimise the risk of water pollution.</P>
      <P>Cavan County Council has availed of its powers under the Water Pollution Act, 1977, to give statutory backing to appropriate pollution controls, including the limitations on slurry spreading contained in the pig slurry management plants.  245 notices under the Act have been served on pig and cattle producers in the Sheeling Catchment.  Spreading of pig slurry is prohibited between 1 November and 28 February and is restricted during October and March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest water quality results for Lough Sheelin show that the lake is continuing to improve.  Central Fisheries Board reports indicate that the condition of the lake over last winter and spring <Col N="1017" /> was better than at any time since 1970-71. The water clarity in June of this year at 3.2 million was significantly improved on the reading of 1.6 million recorded in June 1989.  This should allow sufficient light penetration to encourage the germination and growth of charophyte spores.  The growth of these rooted plants should be beneficial for both fish life and water quality in Lough Sheelin.</P>
    <P>The Lough Derravarragh Catchment falls mainly within the administrative area of Westmeath County Council.  That council is at present finalising a report on the condition of the lake, which, I understand, will show that Lough Sheelin and the Upper Inny account for the greater portion of the nutrient inputs to the lake.  Measures being taken to combat pollution in the area include a survey of approximately 200 farms in the Derravarragh Catchment completed just six months ago.  The 13 farms found to be in the &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; category will be followed up to ensure that proper pollution control measures are carried out. An initial survey of 150-200 farms is ongoing in the North Inny Catchment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 215 together.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the Government's action programme in January this year Ireland will accede to the Helsinki Protocol to the Geneva Convention on Long Range Trans-boundary Air Pollution. The Protocol requires contracting parties to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide, SO 2, by 30 per cent on an annual basis by 1993 using 1980 as the base year.  In Ireland's case this imposes a ceiling of 157,000 tonnes of SO 2 by 1993.</P>
      <P>A programme to meet the ceiling is presently being developed taking into account the use of low sulphur coal at Moneypoint generating station, the continued use of natural gas by the ESB if supplies allow, and action to ensure substantial reductions in SO 2 emissions from industrial sources.</P>
      <P>If necessary desulphurisation equipment will be installed at Moneypoint power station and this matter is currently being examined in the context of meeting the Protocol's obligations.</P>
      <P>A reliable estimate of SO 2 emissions for 1990 is not possible at this stage of the year.</P>

      <P>My Department wrote to the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board on 11 April 1990 requesting that family income supplement should not be taken into account in determining eligibility for medical cards in advance of regulations to this effect being made.  A draft of these regulations will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, with a resolution for their approval as <Col N="1023" /> soon as possible.  In the meantime, health boards are acting in accordance with my request not to take account of family income supplement in determining eligibiltiy for medical cards.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind where a medical card is being denied in these circumstances he might contact me on the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation to youth services from <Col N="1039" /> the national lottery is made annually by the Government just as funding from the Exchequer is voted annually by the Dáil. Furthermore the advent of national lottery funding has led to an unprecedented level of increase in the funds available for youth services.  Exciting new initiatives have been made possible in major areas such as services for homeless young people and disadvantaged youth generally, youth organisation development and youth information.  These have been made possible only as a result of the allocation from the national lottery.</P>

      <P>As I made it clear in reply to a similar parliamentary question on 1 February, 1990, the Government decided that financial assistance on a once only basis and up to an absolute limit of £500,000 loan grant and £500,000 loan should be made available to Swansea-Cork Ferries Limited for the provision of a service in 1990.</P>
      <P>I also made it clear at the time that I fully support the maintenance of all ferry services in the interests of tourism and our exporters but that it is Government policy that access transport services should operate on a commercial basis. In those circumstances, I indicated that Swansea-Cork Ferries Limited has been informed that the Government had decided that no further Exchequer assistance would be available to the Company from 1990 onwards.  There is no change in that position.</P>

      <P>The EC Transport Council, at its meeting in Luxembourg on 18/19 June reached broad agreement, in principle, on the granting of financial support for transport infrastructure projects in the Community under a three year action programme and instructed the Permanent Representatives Committee to prepare the necessary Regulation with a view to its adoption at the next formal meeting of the Council of <Col N="1042" /> Ministers (Transport).
