      <P>Why, then, do the Fianna Fáil wing of the Government appear to be using an RTE correspondent to give advance notice of the contents of the budget and the Progressive Democrats wing of the Government seem to be using a new Sunday newspaper to give advance warning to the whole country of what is to be in the budget?  Is this normal practice or is it something deliberately engineered by this Government?  Are we now seeing a sudden sea change in that we have open government for a change?</P>

      <P>On a point of order, this Bill was introduced by the Minister for Justice.  I am delighted to see the Minister of State.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, here this morning but I was amazed to see the Minister for Justice walking out of the House as soon as we commenced Report Stage of this Bill.  It is quite outrageous that, if the Minister has confidence in his Bill, he would not come in and present it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to observe that the Minister has not been involved in the Committee Stage of this Bill.  There have been reasons, that he was out of the country or otherwise, but he was actually in here this morning and he walked out as soon as we commenced this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I had called Deputy McCartan to move his amendment. The Deputy in possession is dealing with irrelevance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must record my disappointment at the Minister's lack of concern for his own legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete lines 17 to 29.</P>
      <P>I join with the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Keeffe, with no disrespect to the Minister of State present.  This is the fourth change of Minister of State since Committee Stage and that is not a satisfactory way of dealing with the matter.  It should not have been ordered for debate this morning if the Minister responsible was not available.  I do not see why we are dealing with it at all in the absence of the Minister for Justice.  However, I intend to get on with what is before us.</P>
      <P>I withdrew this amendment on Committee Stage on the understanding that the Minister of State who was in the House at the time agreed to look at the matter and see if the Minister could take on board what has been argued.  While we are taking amendment No. 2 as an alternative, it does not substantially alter the Bill as proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, I have resubmitted my amendment and I want to briefly explain my reasons for so doing.  In amendment No. 3 I have also corrected an oversight on Committee Stage, that is to take out the words in subsection (2) &ldquo;made or adapted for use&rdquo;.  What I now hope to <Col N="10" /> achieve is a single universal rule governing the possession of weapons in all circumstances; that there should be no differentiation between a weapon that can be specifically adapted for the purpose of crime on the one hand and a weapon that is capable of an innocent domestic use on the other.  My argument is that we should work towards legislation which is as simple, clear and concise as possible and does not create confusion.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill as it stands, with the ordering of standards and rules with regard to different weapons in different circumstances, certainly is a seabed of confusion and will be a minefield for the prosecution and a goldmine for the defence lawyer seeking to exploit the nuances of the section to avoid conviction when ultimately brought to court.  What we should work towards is one single universal test to be applied to all weapons irrespective of their nature and where they may be found.</P>
    <P>The reasoning of the Government in support of the Bill as drafted is that we should have regard for the person in his home whose possession of an implement can be for innocent domestic use, an implement such as a screwdriver, a kitchen knife or a hammer, as opposed to the person found abroad in possession of an implement clearly intended for use to commit a crime such as burglary.  If we have a single universal rule applying to all situations, that it is unlawful to be found in possession of a weapon or article to be used for the purposes of committing a crime, the circumstances of possession will be the dominant feature in the first instance of the case.  If a garda finds someone on the street who can give an explanation for his possession of an implement, such as that he is a carpenter or a plumber or some other tradesperson and that the article is for the purpose of trade, we can rely on the judgment of the garda.  If, on the other hand, circumstances arise where an officer finds a person at home in possession of such a weapon or implement, the garda can look at the circumstances and make a reliable judgment as to whether the person's explanation is valid.  We need not be <Col N="11" /> unduly concerned about having different standards between the circumstances. Ultimately if a person is prosecuted and brought to court he can give his explanation to the court and receive judgment there.  Acceptance of my argument would result in more effective and tidier legislation which would be far more easily understood by the public, easily employed by the Garda Síochána and make the legislation more straightforward for the purposes of the court if a prosecution is brought.</P>
    <P>The new section 28 (1) now proposed to be inserted into the 1916 Act will give rise to a number of confusions.  The new section makes it a felony when a person, when not at his place of abode, is found in possession of any article for use in burglary or larceny.  The Minister here proposes an amendment to my amendment and I have no difficulty in accepting that.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with taking out &ldquo;for use&rdquo; and inserting &ldquo;with the intention that it be used&rdquo;.  That is a sensible amendment but it does not address the central issue.  That section incorporating in the Minister's amendment, &ldquo;with the intention that it be used&rdquo;, deals with a person who is not in his place of abode.  Subsection (2) provides for a person who is without lawful authority or reasonable excuse in possession of any article made or adapted for use in the course of or in connection with larceny or burglary and so on.  Here, the Minister does not introduce the same formula proposed under subsection (1).  The Minister uses the words under subsection (1) &ldquo;with the intention that it be used&rdquo; but it is specific here that the implement would be for use in the course of or in connection with a larceny or burglary.  Why do we have the broader formula for being found abroad whereas in this instance we are simply relying on the more strict formula of the person being without lawful authority to have it for use?</P>
    <P>Further on in the Bill the Minister allows this formula &ldquo;without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.&rdquo;  That formula can and should apply in all <Col N="12" /> instances.  I do not see the need for establishing a different regime for a person who is found at home and for a person found abroad.  For that reason I will press my amendment that we take out subsection (1), correct subsection (2) by my amendment No. 3 and provide for a universal standard for all articles found in all circumstances.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 2 is designed to make it clear that the offence under subsection (1) of the new section 28 of the 1916 Act consists of possession of any article with the intention that it be used in larceny, burglary or any of the other offences specified in the subsection. On Committee Stage, Deputies had expressed the view that the intention element was not absolutely clear from the subsection as worded at present and I indicated then that I would have the matter examined for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The revised wording which has now been prepared by the parliamentary draftsman will have the added effect of highlighting the contrast between the offences at subsections (1) and (2) of the new section.  Under subsection (1) it is the intention of the possessor which makes possession of what may be an ordinary everyday article an offence.  Under subsection (2), on the other hand, it is the nature of the article which makes possession an offence: anyone who possesses an article which is made or adapted for use in larceny, burglary etc. will be guilty of a subsection (2) offence unless there is lawful authority or reasonable excuse for such possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning to subsection (1), it is not necessary that the accused had the article for use by himself or herself in larceny and so on: possession of an article with the intention that another would use it will be encompassed by the subsection. If, for instance, a woman is in possession of a stolen or forged credit card in the name of a man, then she is clearly incapable of using it herself to obtain goods by false pretences; but if it is shown that she was in possession of it with the <Col N="13" /> intention that it be so used by a male accomplice, then she will be convicted of a subsection (1) offence.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan's amendments, Nos. 1 and 3, on the other hand, would bring about an undesirable situation.  The effect of the two amendments would be that the substantive provision of section 28 would read as follows: &ldquo;A person who is, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, in possession of any article with the intention that it be used in the course of or in connection with larceny etc. shall be guilty of felony....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an inherent fatal inconsistency in this formulation: that is, that there can never be lawful authority or reasonable excuse for criminal intention.  That paradox alone is sufficient ground for opposing the Deputy's amendments.</P>
    <P>A further reason these amendments should be rejected is that they would leave a gap in the criminal law as far as articles made or adapted for use in larceny etc. are concerned.  Under subsection (2) in the Bill as drafted at present, once it is shown that the articles in question were made or adapted for such use, it will not be necessary for the prosecution to show any intention on the part of the possessor in order to obtain a conviction: it need merely be shown that there was neither lawful authority nor reasonable excuse for such possession.  Thus, if the Garda Síochána find a person in possession of a supply of circular letters begging for a bogus charity, designed specifically for obtaining money by false pretences or, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, an article specifically designed to obtian money from telephone coin boxes, they need not show an intention on the part of the possessor that they were to be used in that connection: nor, in my view, should they have to in such circumstances. Under Deputy McCartan's proposals, however, a prosecution could not succeed without proving criminal intention.</P>
    <P>At the risk of labouring the point, I will quote from paragraph 12.5 of the Law Reform Commission's Report on Vagrancy and Related Offences which <Col N="14" /> recommended changes in the law in this area and which is the basis for section 2 of the Bill and the two-handed approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>In the Law Reform Commission's view the proposed new offence should apply to possession anywhere of an article for the purpose of burglary, etc. The onus of proof of the offence, including the requisite intent, will be on the prosecution, so that if the article is of such a kind that possession of it is as consistent with an innocent as a guilty explanation, then it will be very difficult indeed to prove <i>mens rea,</i> in the absence of accompanying suspicious circumstances.  Such circumstances are unlikely to exist where such an article is found in a person's home.  On the other hand if the article is one made or adapted for use for the purpose of burglary, theft or taking a vehicle without authority, there should be a burden on an accused to give an explanation of his possession &mdash; i.e. he should be under an &ldquo;evidential&rdquo; burden to adduce sufficient evidence to raise an issue as to the innocence of his possession but he should not be under a &ldquo;peruasive&rdquo; burden to prove his innocent intent (the burden of proving guilty intent would remain on the prosecution).  If the article is one so made or adapted it is difficult to see why possession of it, even at a person's home, should not be an offence in the absence of an innocent explanation.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to the discussion in an effort to form a view regarding the best balance.  I am convinced by the argument that there should be the two-handed approach referred to by the Minister.  There is need for a distinction to be made between possession of such articles within the home and outside it.  However, I have one remaining concern regarding the Minister's amendment.  We debated absolute liability on Committee Stage and I was concerned about the way the first part of the subsection was originally drafted. However, I am now wondering if we have <Col N="15" /> gone too far the other way now by putting such an onus of proof on the prosecution. My concern is whether the prosecution will be able to discharge the onus of proof.  How will they be able to prove that possession of the article means that there was an intention on the part of the accused to use it in the course of or in connection with a larceny or burglary?  I see major difficulties in the prosecution proving that intent.</P>
      <P>A better way of handling the matter would be to put the responsibility on the accused but to provide that if the accused could prove lawful authority or a reasonable excuse it would absolve him.  I am concerned that we are putting so much onus on the prosecution that the subsection may be of no use to the Garda or the DPP in bringing a prosecution against people who are clearly in possession of articles in suspicious circumstances outside their home although the State may not be able to prove that they intended using them in connection with a larceny or burglary.  Why not leave the onus on the accused but provide the defence of &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; by the person who is found in possession of such articles?</P>

      <P>When I spoke originally on the Government amendment, I explained that, as a result of a commitment I made in the House on Committee Stage on this section when Deputies O'Keeffe, Flanagan, Kavanagh and McCartan made the point that the intention element was not absolutely clear, the officials in the Department of Justice would go to the parliamentary draftsman on the basis that perhaps an amendment could be introduced to make the purpose of the section clearer.  This would make it easier for the courts and the prosecution in larceny or burglary cases.  Because of that it is now proposed that in amendment No. 2 &ldquo;for use&rdquo; would be deleted and &ldquo;with the intention that it be used&rdquo; be substituted.</P>
      <P>The circumstances are always taken into account.  For instance, if someone is found in a car park with a bunch of car keys it is obvious that he is acting suspiciously. The same applies to someone found in possession of the article to which we referred on Committee Stage and which is specifically for removing coins from a telephone kiosk.</P>

I accept what she has done to meet the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her remarks although I am not convinced. I want to briefly respond to the points made.  As a general proposition I had hoped we would achieve a single <Col N="17" /> standard applicable to all persons found in possession of any or all articles and allow the circumstancs to dictate whether a prosecution should follow.  It should be a simple, universal standard, easily understood and easily applied.</P>
      <P>The primary reason there is a difference between subsections (1) and (2) is because of the protection of the constitutional position of the home.  My question to the Minister, which in some respects is rhetorical because of the way the debate has been ordered, is, under what subsection will the woman found in possession of a credit card in the home, as instanced by the Minister, be prosecuted? If I understand the nod of the head again, she would not be prosecuted and I wonder why?  Why should the home give protection to a person who is clearly on the face of it engaged in criminal activity?  The home is often the place where these crimes are planned.</P>
      <P>In regard to forgery, work has to be done on doctoring a credit card, an identity card and so on and where is that carried out?  If the Garda, in the course of a search for stolen goods, find such items as credit cards that clearly do not belong to the person of the house and have a reasonable suspicion that the woman is in cahoots with a person who is involved in forgery or a crime of dishonesty, will she be prosecuted?  Why should she not be prosecuted?  Will she not be prosecuted because she is in the home?  I do not understand the Constitution, or the law, to give that type of protection to the criminal and if it does it is something we should address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic argument by the Minister against my amendment is that there is some type of fatal inconsistency in it. While I accept many of the arguments put forward, I must say that the inconsistency the Minister spoke of is not there.  The Minister suggested that under subsection (2) there is the element of allowing for a lawful authority or reasonable excuse explanation to be advanced in the circumstances, that under subsection (1) there is some form of absolute liability, to use that misplaced suggestion, that mere possession is in itself an answerable <Col N="18" /> crime.  That is not the law and it can never be, no matter how much we legislate for it.  The courts have been interpreting similar provisions and have extended such offences to require circumstances above and beyond mere possession.  The courts have said they must be surrounded in circumstances suggesting a crime on the basic principle that every crime requires not just simply being found in possession but the <i>mens rea</i> of an intent to commit some form of crime or to have a criminal intent.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is suggesting that subsection (1) makes it absolutely an offence merely to be found in possession of an item, then I say she is forgetting what will be the inevitable traditional interpretation. It is my belief that the courts will import into that a requirement of the proof of intent which will give the opportunity to a person to argue his or her way out of the offence on the basis that they have a reasonable excuse or that there is a lawful authority.  For example, in regard to the element of duress, a person may seek to satisfy the court that circumstances above and beyond their control require them to be equipped with an article which might be used in the commission of a crime; that is a classic theme we encounter in the common-day activities of terrorism.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment is implanting the concept of intention and intent into the section.  Rather than improving the section by highlighting the contrasts between subsections (1) and (2) we are, in fact, creating muddier water, we are clouding the issue further.  We should stand on one universal application where it should be open to an accused in all circumstances to advance, as the courts will allow, lawful authority, reasonable excuse or other proper defences to possession.  Where such lawful authority or reasonable excuse is absent, whether it is in the home or elsewhere, the criminal should be made answerable for possession.  I regret I must press my amendment in this instance, although I stand alone.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we send a signal to the criminal elements that in so far as we need to tighten and toughen up the law we are prepared to do so.  Essentially what I have in mind is that we provide that where any person is convicted of an offence by way of possession of an article to be used in the commission of a crime that article must be forfeited.  As the section stands there is a discretion to the court as to whether such forfeiture <Col N="20" /> should occur.  I cannot conceive of any situation where there would be a conviction and such forfeiture should not automatically follow.  Even if my amendment is allowed the court has discretion as to the disposal of the item.  I want it to be forfeit as far as the convicted criminal is concerned.  If there is a case in regard to some third party rights to the article in question, the court has discretion to dispose of the article as seems right.  Let us put into the legislation the provision that we have no sympathy whatever for the convicted criminal.  In that case the article in regard to which that criminal is being convicted must be forfeited.  On Committee Stage the Minister of State indicated a possible scenario where somebody who was the owner of welding equipment was found lurking behind a bank in the dead of night, that there would be a case for non-forfeiture of that equipment so that the welder could pursue his honest livelihood.  I am not convinced that a welder who is carrying his welding equipment and lurking behind a bank in the dead of night, following which he is convicted of an offence under this section, is about his lawful business, and he does not seem to me to be the kind of person that should be left in possession of such welding equipment. The welding equipment in my view should be forfeited.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced by the arguments made by the Minister of State on Committee Stage.  We must send out a signal to the criminal elements that we are not prepared to put up with any nonsense and if they are using equipment for unlawful purposes it must be forfeited.  To a large degree I accept that under the section as drafted, the court has a discretion but, even more important, is the signal we send from this House that anybody who is prepared to use an article, be it welding equipment or otherwise, for the commission of a felony, is putting that equipment at risk and it will be automatically forfeited on the conviction of such person.</P>
    <P>Apart from the change I am proposing, it is part of an approach which involves a <Col N="21" /> tougher attitude to people who are prepared to engage in crime.  Because of the appalling crime figures we have in Ireland it is necessary for us here in the Oireachtas to send that message to the criminals and for that reason I am pressing this amendment.  I urge the Minister to accept it.  We are talking about offences which are occurring at an appalling rate.  In the last crime report the number of offences involving violence, aggravated burglary and robbery increased to over 35,000 in the year. There were larcenies, forgeries and fraud offences of various kinds in excess of 50,000.  We are talking about indictable offences in excess of 85,000 in the year, and this does not include minor offences. There is a very strong case for making the change I propose.  Let the signal go out from this House to those who use articles or equipment in the commission of a crime that automatically it will be forfeited.  That is the reason I am pushing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was opposed by me on Committee Stage and is being opposed again now for precisely the same reasons.  The reasons are that it would be too harsh to the offender to order confiscation regardless of the circumstances and that the article in question might be the property of an innocent person, like the welder whose equipment might be owned by a welding company and not by himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not appropriate that the court's discretion to confiscate articles in particular cases should be fettered in the manner proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe. What is appropriate is that the court should in each case decide whether or not confiscation is the right course in the particular circumstances of that case, and if so, to order the confiscation.  That is the effect of the provision as it stands in the Bill &mdash; just as it is in analogous provisions in the recently enacted statutes on incitement to hatred and on video recordings.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that a formula such as this which confers a power on a court is generally accepted as placing a duty on the court to <Col N="22" /> exercise the power in appropriate cases.  I draw Deputies' attention to the fact that the Law Reform Commission in its report which dealt with this topic at paragraph 12.7 clearly recommended that the court have a discretion in the matter, that is, discretion to order forfeiture of the article or articles in question.</P>
    <P>I have to say that nothing in the Deputy's contributions either before, on Committee Stage or here again this morning has come near persuading me that there should be an exception in this provision to the standard manner in which a power of confiscation is conferred on a court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say briefly that I am inclined towards the Minister's view in this regard.  I think it is better that we confer a permissive power on the court and leave the discretion to the judge in the particular case to decide what is appropriate.  There are circumstances where people can wrongly give in to resorting to crime and, perhaps, the use of the tools of trade would be the very means whereby that person could be pushed back on to the road of rehabilitation. Losing the means of earning a living might well be the one single factor that would ensure the person would be inclined to offend again.  It is a factor that can and has occurred in cases in court.  I think it is better that we leave it on a discretionary basis and available to the courts to decide.  There is the general power, and usually the Garda Síochána ask the court to order forfeiture of weapons of offence even as the law stands. This is simply reflecting the general principles in circumstances such as this.  The clear message about which Deputy O'Keeffe talks and in which we all join him is signalled in the Bill in the fact that we are addressing this whole area.  For that reason I am inclined to the Minister's views as the better formula.</P>

I should like to <Col N="23" /> give an example of an extreme case of somebody who used a bulldozer to break into a builder's yard and to load up equipment with it.  Having seen the background and the hardship it would cause the family if the court did not have the discretion they might not have been in a position to look at all the facts.  The proposal in the Bill leaves that discretion to the courts.  We all appreciate the argument made by the Deputy but in the end some discretion in this area should be left to the court.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that such a provision would be too harsh for an offender.  We are talking about a section which provides that apart from a fine there can be a term of imprisonment up to five years.  Obviously we are talking about very serious offences.  Whether we are referring to welding equipment or bulldozers the message must go out to people that if things are being used in the commission of a crime there is a danger of forfeiture.  Our whole approach must be to help the Garda who have a duty <Col N="24" /> not only from the point of view of detection of crime but also from the point of view of its prevention.  The purpose of this amendment would be to help the Garda from the point of view of prevention. If somebody owns welding equipment or a bulldozer that person would think twice, or perhaps ten times, before using that equipment for the purpose of the commission of a crime if they were aware that it would be followed by automatic forfeiture.  That is the signal I would want to send to such persons from this House.  Where the forfeiture is discretionary there is always the chance that the person who might be tempted to engage in crime will say: &ldquo;Well, I can get the case argued and have a plea of <i>misericordia</i> put in by a capable defence solicitor and I will get away with it.&rdquo;  That takes away then from the kind of signal, the tough message I want to send to people who would be even considering using equipment for the commission of a crime.  On that basis I want to press this amendment and send that signal to criminals. We just will not stand for people using equipment in that fashion.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 5 in the names of Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Charles Flanagan.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> In page 3, line 27, after  &ldquo;property&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, or being reckless as to whether such property has been stolen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment goes to the very heart of the Bill.  We are talking about the whole issue of <i>mens rea;</i> the intent that should ground a finding of guilt of a person charged with the handling of stolen goods.  When the Minister for Justice first trumpted the circulation of this Bill he indicated that it was intended to make life much more difficult for receivers.  Initially I was delighted to hear this and I assumed that the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission were the basis on which the Bill was grounded.</P>
    <P>The central recommendation of the Law Reform Commission is that the test of recklessness should apply when we are considering whether an accused person should be found guilty of handling stolen goods.  If he was reckless as to the providence or ownership of the goods it should not be essential, as it is today, to prove he knew the goods were stolen.</P>
    <P>We are all very well aware of the difficulties which have arisen under the present legislation, the 1916 Act, and it is, probably, because of the difficulty in proving knowledge that the number of convictions obtained under that Act for receiving is very low indeed.  As I mentioned earlier, the last crime report indicated that there were over 85,000 offences against property with only 268 convictions for receiving stolen goods being recorded.  The discrepancy between the value of property stolen and the amount recovered was very wide.  The value of the property stolen in that year amounted to £34 million with less than £3 million worth of goods being recovered.</P>
    <P>We start from the basis that the existing law is unsatisfactory and needs to be toughened to make life more difficult for those receiving or handling stolen property. We are on common ground there. However, there is a clear difference of opinion as to how this should be done <Col N="28" /> between the Government and the Fine Gael Party and, from our discussion and the amendments they put down on Committee Stage, The Workers' Party and the Labour Party.  In case it might be suggested I am trying to claim a monopoly of wisdom on this issue, let me say it was not off the top of our heads that Deputy McCartan, Deputy Kavanagh and I made such a serious effort to toughen the Bill on Committee Stage; rather was it based on the considered view of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>I have the highest regard for that Commission and the work it has done on a variety of subjects.  On this topic it has gone far beyond the call of duty.  It was not a question of producing a report; the Law Reform Commission, because of the complexity of the issues involved, produced a consultative paper and then arranged a number of discussions and seminars to obtain views on the issue, following which, and only then, they produced a report which basically says that the major change which should be made is to introduce the definition of recklessness so far as an accusation against a person for handling stolen goods is concerned. We should not look for the definition which the Minister has come up with, of requiring the State to prove the accused knew or believed the property to be stolen.  That is the central issue in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is my approach that we have to have a tougher regime so far as the receivers and handlers of stolen goods are concerned and we must make it easier for the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring prosecutions against such persons.  We must also remove the defences at present available to those who &mdash; where it sticks out a mile &mdash; are clearly guilty.  Obviously we do not want to go overboard on the issue, but we must find the balance between the prosecution and the defence to ensure as far as possible that the guilty are found to be guilty and the innocent are not found guilty.  That is where we have to find the balance and this is why it took the Law Reform Commission so much <Col N="29" /> time to come up with its recommendation. Following the publication of its consultative paper and the discussions and seminars it produced a final report and it opted for this approach.</P>
    <P>No clear explanation has been given by the Government as to why this approach has not been adopted in the Bill.  I accept that the Bill as at present drafted marks some improvement but, on the other hand, the present legislation clearly bends massively in favour of the criminal. Therefore, I do not think it is any great advance to say that the present Bill bends somewhat less massively in favour of the criminal.  We should establish the law in a way which will ensure as far as possible that the guilty criminal is so found by the court.  I do not believe that will be the effect of this legislation.  As at present drafted, it contains too many escape hatches for the criminal.  Despite all our discussions and the efforts of the Law Reform Commission, those receiving and handling stolen goods will largely carry on as before.  Clearly, this is not in the interests of society.</P>
    <P>If the House were to accept the amendment I propose which seeks to have this approach adopted we would have much tighter legislation.  I would like this House to give this issue serious consideration, but as I look around the House I see that the only Deputy on the Government benches is the Minister of State and it is clear to me the Government party are not taking any great interest in it.  The only solution is to ask them to come into the House and for that reason I am calling for a quorum.</P>

      <P>My worry is that if the Minister does not take on board the proposals in this amendment receivers of stolen goods will be able to escape with their ill-gotten goods in the future in the same way as they have done in the past. That is the core and essence of my argument and the basis of my concern.  The Minister's proposal seems to be based on <Col N="30" /> the English Theft Act and it is quite clear that that provision in that Act has given rise to major difficulties there.  The Law Reform Commission obviously went further afield and looked at the situation in many other countries and ultimately came to the conclusion that the approach under consideration in the US was the best precedent to follow.  In their recommendation they followed the model penal code in the US which defines recklessness. The result of that was a clear and unambiguous recommendation from the Law Reform Commission and I quote from page 115 of their report: &ldquo;The test of liability in the new offence should depend on whether the defendant knew or was reckless as to whether the goods were stolen&rdquo;; plain, bald, unvarnished and unambiguous and a totally unanimous recommendation from the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>After all their consultation and work, why is that test not included in the Bill? The purpose of my amendment is to incorporate the approach recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  It is as simple as that.  I believe that if my amendment is not accepted there is a major danger, indeed, that we are leaving a major escape hatch for criminals in the future.  That is why I am putting this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the amendments of Deputy O'Keeffe in this area.  As he said, correctly, this goes to the core of what is sought to be achieved in this Bill in attempting to address the offence of receiving.  The amendments are a credit to his skill in drafting something that would be slightly different from what had been advanced by himself and myself on Committee Stage where we attempted to introduce the element of recklessness into the definition of <i>mens rea</i> in receiving cases.  While I was unable to think of a formula that would get me back in here on Report Stage, it is to the Deputy's credit that he was able to convince the persons in the drafting office that there was another way of going about the same thing.  We are beholden to him <Col N="31" /> and to Deputy Flanagan for the opportunity to pursue this very crucial issue on Report Stage.  We voted on it on Committee Stage, lost the issue there and now we have the opportunity, perhaps again in repeating it, of convincing the Minister that the Government are going about this issue entirely incorrectly.</P>
      <P>In advance of what the Minister may say, I can borrow from the explanations offered on Committee Stage to understand the Government's thinking for using the formula of belief as a better way of dealing with the issue.  We have to understand exactly what we are trying to tackle here.  It is universally and historically accepted that convincing receivers of the offence of handling or dealing with stolen property has been traditionally difficult.  The proofs to be established by the prosecution beyond doubt have in the past rendered it almost impossible to win home convictions against receivers of stolen property to date.  For that reason we are specifically addressing that crime in the context of this Bill and attempting to produce a working formula that makes the law much more relevant to modern circumstances and reflects our experience of dealing with this area of the law since 1916 over the decades past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these singular difficulties that has been experienced over the years is the question of <i>mens rea,</i> the mental element to be proved by the prosecution. &ldquo;Well knowing same to have been stolen&rdquo; was a 1916 formula, the concept of knowledge, and the English authorities in addressing this matter adopted the formula in the Theft Act, 1968 that has now been taken on board and proposed by the Minister in the Bill as circulated.  The Law Reform Commission, as has been referred to on Committee Stage, again by Deputy O'Keeffe, dealt with this matter at length.  They worked through all nine different formulae of <i>mens rea</i> or intent that might be borrowed on or used, and analysed each one of them in the context of arguments and submissions received from right across the board, not <Col N="32" /> just from the Director of Public Prosecutions but from everyone in the field who has experience in the area, and analysed them in the context of comparative studies of what had happened abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us on Committee Stage that the concept of belief is one that is well recommended by the commission. We must put the record correct on that. I quote from the Law Reform Commission's report, page 94,</P>
    <P>7.  Liability based on reception where the accused believed that the goods were stolen.</P>
    <P>120.  We must now consider whether the test should be one of <i>belief</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;the one the Minister wants us to take on board&mdash;</P>
    <P>that the goods were stolen.  This solution was adopted in section 22 of the English <i>Theft Act, 1968,</i> to unfortunate effect.  These difficulties have been attributed to the judicial interpretation of the section.  Spencer</P>
    <P>&mdash;a criminal text commentator in the English jurisprudence&mdash;</P>
    <P>observed that:</P>
    <P>sometimes you would think that the courts were trying to make a dog's breakfast of the law of handling stolen goods.  In one line of cases in Section 22 of the <i>Theft Act, 1968</i> they have interpreted the words &ldquo;knowing or believing them to be stolen&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;knowing or knowing them to be stolen&rdquo;, so perpetuating the defect in the earlier law which the addition of the words &ldquo;or believing&rdquo; was designed to cure.</P>
    <P>That is the end of the quote from Mr. Spencer.  I use his words &ldquo;making a dog's breakfast of the law&rdquo; to describe what the Minister is attempting to do with this Bill as it is currently drafted.  We are making a dog's dinner of the work we are trying to engage in in this House to improve the law.  The Law Reform Commission report discards this approach by saying:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> There is, however, an inherent problem with using the word &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in this context, which the English courts were surely correct in sensing.  Belief admits of degrees of commitment, ranging from certitude to suspicion.  There is little advantage in a legislative definition which leaves the question of the accused's <i>mens rea</i> in such an imprecise state.</P>
    <P>That is the Law Reform Commission's attitude to the concept of belief.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister seemed to advance a different impression of the views of the Law Reform Commission and suggested that they gave strong support to the concept of belief as second best after giving their strongest recommendation to the concept of recklessness. We have to understand exactly what is being suggested.  The Law Reform Commission are unambiguous in saying that the concept of belief did not work in the English context, it is imprecise and will, borrowing Spencer's phrase, end up making a dog's breakfast of the points we are trying to address at present.</P>
    <P>In the Official Report of 6 December 1989, volume 394, column 407, I think the Minister of State, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was misreported when she said:</P>
    <P>I think it is important to note that the Law Reform Commission were able to provide any example...</P>
    <P>I believe that should read: &ldquo;were unable to provide any example of this concept actually in use.&rdquo;  The Minister continued by making what I believe is her strongest argument against the concept of recklessness and giving the reasons the Government are moving in this direction. I again quote from volume 394, column 408, of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It is not favoured by the Director of Public Prosecutions whose office would have to apply this provision in practice.</P>
    <P>In a later amendment, which Deputy Rabbitte moved on my behalf as I had been suspended from the service of the House, the Minister advanced that <Col N="34" /> reason for not accepting my amendment, which was the same as the Law Reform Commission's proposal.  The fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions was not in favour of the concept of recklessness is not a valid argument.  With the greatest respect to the office holder of the office of Director of Public Prosecutions, for whom I have the highest regard, I want to make it absolutely clear that it is a wrong day in this House when we fashion our law to respond to the views of one person in the community.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions is not a legislator, but he was consulted and was involved in the deliberations of the Law Reform Commission.  We were all there and were able to listen, contribute, submit and argue on what should be formulations of the law.  The Law Reform Commission, who were specifically charged with making recommendations on reform in the law considered his views and after weighing them up came down with a counter view.  In fairness to the Law Reform Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions I do not think it is fair to expose the view of the Director of Public Prosecutions simply because the Minister cannot think of a good argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot say the Director of Public Prosecutions is not in favour of the concept of recklessness in the context of dealing with handling and receiving cases.  I ask the Minister to outline the context in which the DPP made his remarks.  Has the Minister made his submission available to us so that we can examine the arguments behind his views? We should not borrow one line phrases as arguments when we cannot think of anything else to say.  That does no credit to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Law Reform Commission who have gone to great lengths advising the Government and it is no credit to the Minister or the Minister of State to try to borrow reasons for ignoring the arguments for proper reform procedures in this House.  I hope the Minister will abandon that type of facile approach to serious arguments in the House.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister of <Col N="35" /> State suggested that recklessness was an imprecise concept in law and would create difficulties in the area of receiving. She acknowledged that there is a clear drift in the Department to accept and bring on board the element of recklessness. The Law Reform Commission dealt at length with this concept, as it is the correct concept in their view, and quote from well regarded commentators and academics in the area of criminal law, such as Professor Mary McAleese who acknowledges that recklessness is the standard that should be applied under criminal law with regard to intent in the future, recognising that it creates the correct balance between the subjective interest of the accused and allowing the jury the opportunity to have a real function as to whether recklessness stands up to reasonable observation.</P>
    <P>I now quote from Professor Mary McAleese, a former Reece Professor at Trinity college on the subject:</P>
    <P>We need some standardisation of the definition of concepts basic to criminal liability, e.g., intention, negligence and the one in question, recklessness. If the courts cannot do it, why not the Legislature?</P>
    <P>I ask that question again.  Why cannot we, the Legislature, do so?  There is nothing imprecise in the concept of recklessness. The Law Reform Commission give us their definition of recklessness in the summary of recommendations and I advanced a definition on Committee Stage which I believe is eminently workable. I will now quote from the conclusion on page 100 of the Law Reform Commission report on receiving stolen property, because I cannot put the argument any better.</P>
    <P>We think that the present law is undoubtedly too favourable to the accused.  After detailed consideration of the several options for reform mentioned above, we have come to the conclusion, and recommend, that the test of liability in the new office should depend on whether the defendant <Col N="36" /> knew or was reckless as to whether the goods were unlawfully obtained.</P>
    <P>They say &mdash; and I think we all agree &mdash; the law is too favourable to the accused, which is the problem we are trying to address.  We are trying to bring in a law that makes it much more difficult for the receiver or handler, as we now define him, to evade prosecution.  The report fully illustrates that the formula borrowed by the Minister is one that will not alter the law one iota.</P>
    <P>As has been shown in the English context, reliance on belief will advance the law little in this area.  I am urging, with all the strength capable of being assembled in these austere surroundings of empty seats, but with serious intent, that the Minister listen to the argument advanced in Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment and acknowledge that collectively we can improve this Bill.  Otherwise, I join Deputy O'Keeffe in accusing the Minister and Government of being easy on the handlers and not being at all serious in their intent to improve the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to replace the existing offence of receiving stolen property with a new one of handling stolen property.  In section 3 &mdash; that section proposed to be amended by Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan &mdash; we are reverting to the main argument advanced on Committee Stage.  On that occasion I said that, leaving aside the issue of sentences, there is little or nothing proposed in this Bill that a sensible judge or jury could not deal with under the provisions of the 1916 Larceny Act.  When the former Attorney General, Mr. John Rogers, requested the Law Reform Commission to examine this whole area of receiving stolen goods they had recourse to the best legal brains, received submissions from people world-wide and spent a good deal of time formulating their recommendations and the heads of a Bill to deal with this whole aspect.  I said it was my opinion that the Minister for Justice had failed when he omitted to adopt those heads of a Bill and recommendations in order to build <Col N="37" /> up a proper Bill using them as a basis. Rather, he appeared to merely refer to those recommendations where the argument suited and reject them where it did not.</P>
      <P>In regard to this section he did depart from their recommendations.  Indeed, one could almost contend he was reckless in his treatment of this whole area, losing a great opportunity to deal with what is now by far the greatest crime being perpetrated in this country, that of receiving stolen goods.  It will be seen from the report on crime of the Garda Commissioner it is in this area that the vast majority of crime is committed.  This is also the area in which there is least success on the part of the Garda in apprehending criminals or in recovering the vast amount of property and money stolen.  For example, something of the order of £3 million out of a total of £34 million was recovered in the year 1988.</P>
      <P>I do not see how we can accept this section without amendment.  My party intend to support the amendments being advanced in a last ditch attempt &mdash; with the other parties on the Opposition side of the House &mdash; to effect some improvement in this area.  I criticise the Minister and Government on the basis that the Bill, as it stands, is a lost opportunity to adopt the new methods and modern technology available in this area.  The Bill, as it stands, is out of date.  It appears we can assume that this Bill will be passed more or less in its present form which will be some help in that sentencing will have been updated.  I anticipate the Minister will have occasion to return to this House in the near future when he realises that very little will change as a result of the passage of this Bill in its present form.  If, on reflection the Minister feels there is merit in the arguments advanced even before Christmas I hope her approach will be somewhat different on this occasion.</P>

      <P>These amendments are opposed.  On Committee Stage the House on a vote rejected the suggestion that the <i>mens rea</i> for the offence of handling stolen property should consist <Col N="38" /> of recklessness rather than what is provided in the Bill, namely, knowing or believing that the property was stolen. The amendments now before the House propose that these two concepts of <i>mens rea</i> should co-exist.  This would result in complicated circumstances which would present difficulties for prosecution, defence, judges and juries alike.</P>
      <P>The effect of these amendments would be to bring about circumstances in which neither the last thoughts of the Law Reform Commission &mdash; as recommended in their report &mdash; nor their earlier proposals, which the Government developed in the Bill, would be implemented.  In each case it would be necessary for the jury to go through an elaborate and cumbersome process in order to arrive at a verdict, having first to decide whether the accused engaged in activity which would constitute handling, then having to decide whether the accused knew or believed at the time that the property in question was stolen.  Then, if the accused neither knew nor believed so, they would have to determine whether he or she was reckless as to whether the property was stolen.</P>
      <P>We would all agree that &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; here could not have a broad meaning such as a simple &ldquo;could not care less&rdquo; attitude but rather must mean, even in the absence of a statutory provision to that effect, something on the lines of what the Law Reform Commission recommended: that it involves a conscious disregard by the accused of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the goods were stolen.  The judge must spell all of this out to the jury with indications as to when a risk is substantial and unjustifiable and the jury must apply those tests also to the facts of the case.  I am quite convinced that the ensuing confusion in the minds of juries would be counter-productive and that the amendments would result in fewer convictions than would be the case under the provision as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say to Deputy O'Keeffe that the Government considered the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in relation to recklessness and <Col N="39" /> rejected it for the reasons I have already outlined on Committee Stage.  That is the prerogative of the Government.  A decision was taken after full consideration of the pros and cons of all the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  However, the formula in the Bill draws heavily on the work of the Law Reform Commission in their final report and earlier consultation paper.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) &mdash; which provides that believing, as referred to in subsection (1), includes thinking that the property in question probably was stolen &mdash; is intended to cover circumstances in which the accused strongly suspected that the property was stolen.  The discussion paper produced by the Law Reform Commission on this topic in May 1987 put forward this option as their preferred approach at page 164.  In their final report, paragraph 118, page 93 &mdash; while not recommending this option &mdash; the Law Reform Commission say that a strong case may be made in favour of it.</P>
    <P>As regards the criticism of the English provision mentioned by the Law Reform Commission and referred to by Deputy McCartan, I should say that the problems experienced initially were promptly corrected &mdash; I think I said so already on Committee Stage &mdash; in the decisions of higher courts.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, the amendments are opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and indeed the Government appear to have a poor opinion of the common sense of those men and women who make up juries in this country.  I have seen them deal with very complex issues both on the civil and criminal sides and it never ceases to amaze me how they are able to boil down the issues involved and reach clear decisions.  Therefore, I am firmly wedded to the concept of juries in criminal trials. In the main, I contend the system has withstood the test of time, that juries have shown they are able to cut through the verbiage, get to the core of the offence and produce sensible decisions. It is not a good defence for the Minister <Col N="40" /> to raise the difficulty that juries might have in interpreting the concept of recklessness. Let us be clear: the jury do not make decisions at their own discretion; they listen to the arguments from both sides and then get a charge from the judge.  Any difficulties in regard to interpretation are clearly pointed out to them. Therefore, that is not a valid defence to my amendment.  Neither is it the defence that after long deliberatons the Law Reform Commission recommended this approach.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission is not an anonymous body.  It is chaired by a very respected judge of the High Court and consists of people from different disciplines, including barristers, solicitors, psychologists and so on.  It is a body whose opinion has to be given great weight.  The other defence offered by the Minister to my amendment was the traditional one of power.  She said it is the prerogative of the Government to decide on these matters.  It is the prerogative of the Government to propose matters and it is the prerogative of the Dáil to decide on them.  That is why I am pressing this amendment.</P>
      <P>Finally, there is no doubt about the extent of the problem.  Recent figures have shown that, on a square footage basis, the extent of property crimes in Dublin is three times that in London.  In property terms Dublin is the crime capital of Europe.  We have to react and update our laws but we must do so in a way that will give the Garda and the prosecution a reasonable chance of securing convictions. It is very clear that the law as it stands at present in relation to receiving is inadequate and as a consequence the Garda and the prosecution have great difficulty in obtaining convictions.</P>

    <P>Now we have a chance to do something about the matter, 74 years after the original Larceny Act was put in place.  I hate to think of the criminals getting away with receiving to such an extent for another 74 years under a benign régime.  This is the last chance the Dáil will have to make this change because we are now on Report Stage.  I would make a final plea to the House &mdash; obviously the Minister has a <Col N="41" /> stony heart on the issue.  That is something I would not expect from her&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that in general terms, but this is an exception.  My real concern is that the legislation we are now putting in place as drafted by the Government will not do the job that is intended.  As regards receivers and handlers of stolen goods, the prosecution will still have major difficulty proving that the goods were stolen.  That is not just an escape hatch; it is a back door we are <Col N="42" /> leaving wide open for the criminal.  The way to close and bolt that door is to introduce the concept of recklessness as proposed by the Law Reform Commission and as has been so ably argued by way of support for my case by Deputy McCartan from The Workers' Party and Deputy Kavanagh from the Labour Party.  On this issue it seems clear that everybody on this side of the House, as well as the Law Reform Commission, is of one view, but the Minister and the Government stand obdurate on the issue. On that basis I will be pressing this amendment to a vote.</P>

      <P>An order in this House is taken as a request.  I wish to again pursue these amendments in the hope that in the meantime, there may have been a change of view in the Minister's Office in regard to what was sought to be established.  The first section of the amendment proposed that &ldquo;in the laying of an indictment or the making of a charge under section 3 of this Act it shall not be necessary to specify how the goods were stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained&rdquo;.  The current position is that receiving requires an ingredient of well knowing the item to have been stolen. The amendment proposes to extend it beyond simple larceny to include &ldquo;unlawfully obtained&rdquo; which shall be construed to mean &ldquo;obtained in circumstances amounting to an offence and the misappropriation occurred in the initial taking or subsequent to that initial taking&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point is that, in the drafting of an indictment, it is not necessary to specify the method in which it is maintained the item was unlawfully obtained or stolen and, secondly, an extension of the definition of &ldquo;unlawfully obtained&rdquo; should include not simply stealing but in <Col N="47" /> circumstances amounting to an offence. This follows a proposal contained in the report of the Law Reform Commission on page 103, paragraph 134:</P>
    <P>To resolve these difficulties we consider that the legislation should provide that the offence would be committed in respect of goods &ldquo;unlawfully obtained&rdquo; and that it should not be necessary to specify how the goods were unlawfully obtained.  &ldquo;Unlawfully obtained&rdquo; could be defined as &ldquo;obtained in circumstances amounting to an offence (including any breach of Section 106 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1987)&rdquo;.  The definition should be extended to cover cases where the goods were obtained lawfully and were subsequently criminally misappropriated.</P>
    <P>They are reasonably sensible proposals and I do not see any objection in principle to them in the report or indeed in anything the Minister said on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, dealt with this section on Committee Stage and it appears that the single ground relied on by the Minister in not accepting these proposals was that the Government and the Minister had consulted the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I referred earlier to this strange procedure in formulating legislation, and I do not intend to go back over it.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from column 1578, volume 394, of the Official Report of 14 December last which states:</P>
    <P>He [the Director of Public Prosecutions] is satisfied that there is no need for a provision of this nature. Accordingly, no such provision has been incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The simple approach of the Government is, if the Director of Public Prosecutions says there is no need for such a provision, they will not include it.  However, the Law Reform Commission have expressed the view that there is a need for it and I say there is a need for it.  On Committee <Col N="48" /> Stage my colleague was supported in that view by Deputies Kavanagh and O'Keeffe.  There is a wide view that there is a need for such a provision.  If the only countervailing argument is that the prosecuting authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions, thinks he can get on just as well without it, I wonder if there is any harm in including it.  It would not take away from his armoury, although he believes it would not add to it.  Is there any harm in acceding to my proposal and doing something which the Law Reform Commission consider necessary?</P>
    <P>Where goods are unlawfully obtained in any circumstances they should be the subject matter of an offence of handling. We are talking in particular about offences committed in contravention of the customs consolidation legislation, goods smuggled.  The great old story advanced on a daily basis in answer to such charges refers to the Jonesboro Market.  Many people charged before the Dublin District Court, and elsewhere, have referred to that market in their defence.  I wonder if the Jonesboro Market was popular in Wicklow, LaoisOffaly or west Cork, but I am aware that ladies and gentlemen in the centre city of Dublin found with transistor radios, electrical goods or other property suspected of being stolen invariably said that they went to Jonesboro and purchased them.  Many of them said they believed those goods were the produce of sales after bombings in Northern Ireland or, more particularly, were the produce of smuggling exercises but were definitely not stolen goods.</P>
    <P>That odd situation was referred to by the Law Reform Commission at paragraph 39.  They referred to the decision of the English Divisional Court in the Nieser case in 1958.  The Commission stated:</P>
    <P>...it was held that, where a person is charged with receiving property obtained under circumstances amounting to misdemeanour, the prosecution must prove that he &ldquo;knew that the property fell into the general category of property which has been obtained <Col N="49" /> under circumstances which do in law amount to misdemeanour&rdquo;, though it was not necessary to prove that he &ldquo;knew that [it, the property] was obtained under circumstances which amount in law to the specific misdemeanour by which [it was] in fact obtained.</P>
    <P>That exposes another oddity.  If goods were obtained under circumstances amounting to a felony they could not be the subject matter of a receiving or handling charge and that is why we talk about obtained in circumstances amounting to an offence.  That is an important addition to the whole area of the law in which the offence of handling can arise. That is important here where smuggling is an endemic problem and is an exercise engaged in along the Border by those involved in organising paramilitary crime.  We should make life a little more difficult for them by including goods that are smuggled in the category of goods handled or subject to the charge of receiving.  The Minister should give a clear response to that.</P>
    <P>On the drafting provision in regard to indictments I should like to ask what is the necessity, now that we are setting a broad campus in which goods can be the subject matter of receiving charges, to add the precise difficulty for the prosecution of establishing clearly the grounds upon which it is believed the goods were unlawfully obtained.  It should not, as the commission recommend, be necessary for the prosecution under the 1924 Act to specify in the indictment the way property is stolen. That should be established as a matter of proof in the course of the case and dealt with by the court.  It appears that the only argument advanced on Committee Stage was that the Director of Public Prosecutions felt that these additions were not necessary.  If he believed that I do not think there is any harm in us acceding to what the Law Reform Commission, and the Opposition parties, are arguing for.  I should like to ask the Minister to accept the amendment as being a sensible and useful addition to the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are satisfied that this amendment is unnecessary and inappropriate and I must therefore oppose it.  The amendment is based on section 7 of the scheme of a Bill appended to the Law Reform Commission's report on Receiving Stolen Property, but the amendment fails to take account of the differences of substance between the Law Reform Commission's proposals as to the definition of the offence of handling and the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The question whether any special provision, other than section 4, should be included in the Bill as to how charges of offences under the Bill may be framed was, as Minister of State Ger Connolly said in replying to the similar amendment at Committee Stage, as reported at column 1578, volume 394 of the Official Report, carefully considered during the drafting of the Bill; and the Director of Public Prosecutions was consulted and he was satisfied that there is no need for any such provision.</P>
      <P>As Minister Ger Connolly pointed out, the precise drawing of an indictment will always depend on the facts in each case. There may be cases in which, in order to do justice to the accused, it will be necessary to show in the indictment how exactly the property, the subject of the charge, came within the definition of &ldquo;stolen property&rdquo;.  This is a matter of the general law and, therefore, as I have said, a special provision such as proposed is not necessary.</P>
      <P>Moreover, as I have also indicated, the amendment does not correspond to the definition of the offence of handling in section 3.  Both subsections (6) and (7) in the amendment are based on the Law Reform Commission's proposal that the offence should apply to property which has been &ldquo;unlawfully obtained&rdquo;, but the Bill does not use the expression &ldquo;unlawfully obtained&rdquo;.  Instead it specifies, in section 7 (4), the offences which are to be the relevant initial offences, stealing, embezzlement and so on, in relation to which the offence of handling is to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> Further, subsection (7) in the amendment refers to whether &ldquo;the misappropriation occurred in the initial taking or subsequent to that initial taking&rdquo; but, apart from the drafting point that the Bill does not use the expression &ldquo;misappropriation&rdquo; at all, the amendment is in conflict with the provision in the definition of the offence in the substituted section 33 (2) (a) that the receiving and so on must take place &ldquo;otherwise than in the course of the stealing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I am clear that the amendment should not be accepted.</P>

      <P>In page 6, after line 50, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In addition to, or in lieu of, any penalty imposed by a court under subsection (1) of this section on any person, the court may order such person to pay such compensation as it considers appropriate to the person (if any) considered by the court to be the victim of the offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the last point of major substance that I wish to refer to and it is a matter about which I feel very strongly.  My proposal is that when a person is convicted of an offence of receiving or handling stolen goods the court should have statutory power, apart from imposing a fine or sentencing the individual to a term of imprisonment, to order the payment of compensation to the victim of the crime. For too long insufficient consideration has been given to the victims of crime. <Col N="52" /> We have an opportunity to show our concern and provide a practical vehicle whereby in certain circumstances the victim will gain some compensation.  I accept that it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the problem of compensation but it provides a vehicle which could be very useful in certain circumstances and could be used by the court to order compensation to the victim of the crime.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government will not accept the amendment.  It is totally logical.  One could argue that in many instances the convicted person would not be capable of paying compensation &mdash; I accept that &mdash; but we often hear about the real enemies, the godfathers of crime who, it is alleged, are living in luxury on the proceeds of crime. Is there any reason these people, some of whom are alleged to own a number of houses, apartments, and other worldly goods, should not have some of their wealth transferred to the unfortunate victims of crime?  The principle appears to be so logical that I am amazed the Government are not prepared to accept it.  I understood I had secured a commitment from the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, who was then deputising for the Minister for Justice who, as usual, had not bothered to attend the Committee Stage debate on this Bill.  I understood from the Minister of State he would inform the Minister for Justice of my views and that it might result in a new approach on Report Stage.  Nothing has come from the Government in this regard and I want to press this amendment strongly since I believe very sincerely in it.  I know a number of colleagues will probably support me.  I conclude by strongly urging the Minister to accept this very sensible amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed we should conclude Report Stage.  We strongly supported such a proposal on Committee Stage and I had tabled an amendment in similar form.  The lot of the victims of crime has not been a good one when one considers the record of this Government.  The Irish Association for <Col N="53" /> Victim Support are crying out for help. The Rape Crisis Centres are suffering from lack of funding.  We have virtually closed down the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal and the malicious injuries code has been abandoned.  The victims of crime do not do well.</P>
      <P>This is just a simple working proposal which would enable courts, where possible, to call upon the convicted person to compensate the victim.  If we ever get before the court the godfathers, the handlers of goods, the people who pull the strings of the little guy in the street, the fat cats who let others do the work, we should fleece them.  This provision would allow for that and it would show an earnest on the part of the Government to look after the victims of crime if they were to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that people have made a great deal of money out of misdemeanours over the years and their victims do not seem to be compensated. The courts should have the ability to take some of the value of those goods and hand it to the people who have suffered.  That ability should be given to the courts as this amendment endeavours to do.  We lend our support to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that the principle which underlies this amendment is not opposed. It makes good sense that the court should be able to order an offender who has just been found guilty to compensate the victim of the offence in appropriate circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of informal arrangements made daily in District and Circuit Courts throughout the country.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> reported a case on 29 January where a man was given a clear choice by the justice.  He was ordered to pay a total of £730 compensation by a certain date or else face six months in prison.  There is no statutory basis for these kinds of <Col N="54" /> informal arrangements, which are an exercise by the court of its judicial discretion. Since suggestions made in these circumstances are not orders and not enforceable, there is no element of compulsion, although the prospect of a stiffer sentence may well have a persuasive influence on the offender.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is on record as having indicated an intention to have legislative proposals prepared which will deal with the question of compensation across the full spectrum of the criminal law.  I am willing to convey to the Minister the vigour of the concerns expressed this morning and on Committee Stage.  This matter should be considered in the context of crime generally as indicated by the Minister for Justice and, therefore, we are opposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments raised by the Minister of State confirm that we should make this change.  I am convinced that in her heart she sees the good sense of this proposal.  She used those very words in responding.  I accept she does not have the authority because she is standing in for a different Department. She quotes the Minister for Justice as being on record.  The Minister for Justice has come into the House this morning for three or four divisions.  Why is he not here to tell us his views?  I regard it as utter contempt of the Dáil that he does not come in and tell us clearly why this amendment cannot be accepted.  I hazard the guess that he knows nothing about it and that is part of the problem.</P>
      <P>The amendment I propose is eminently sensible.  The fact that there are informal arrangements lends further credence to putting the compensation provisions on a statutory basis.  We have an opportunity to do so now and for that reason I am pressing the amendment.  It is an utter disgrace that on an issue as serious as this the Minister for Justice has not come in and argued his own case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Calendar of Council Meetings for the Irish Presidency which has been placed in the Library.  This and other arrangements indicate that there are 67 or so meetings at ministerial level in Europe, Africa and elsewhere in the world already scheduled for the period of the Irish Presidency.  In addition, there will be bilateral visits abroad by members of the Government and Ministers of State but, given the evolving nature of EC business, it is impossible to give details at this stage or to make the estimate sought in the latter part of the question &mdash; even if it were possible for Ministers to attend the meetings using a scheduled airline service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that during Ireland's 1975 Presidency of the Council the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, made over 160 flights abroad and travelled an estimated 60,000 miles in Europe, Africa, Asia and North America without the use of a Government jet? <Col N="59" /> Is the Taoiseach not further aware that during the 1984 Presidency, the then President of the General Affairs Council, Deputy Peter Barry, used the Government jet only to get to European departure points when his travels were outside Europe and that it was all done using scheduled airlines without the slightest disruption to the programme of the Presidency and without excessive absence by the Minister in question from this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Fine Gael Party will not allow themselves to be branded as the horse and buggy party in this connection.  Even since Deputy Barry's time as Minister for Foreign Affairs the size and scope of the European Community's participation in world affairs has enlarged enormously.  I say quite frankly that it would be impossible for Ministers today to attempt to encompass the duties of their Presidencies without this additional facility.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I gave the House an indication of one series of journeys which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has to undertake.  During the first week in February the Minister for Foreign Affairs will go to Brussels, Geneva, Brussels, Ottawa, Brunei and Kuching.  He will visit all these places practically within the course of one week.  At the same time the Minister for Industry and Commerce will visit New York, Chicago and New York and the Minister for Tourism and Transport will visit Washington and Orlando.  These are just a couple of samples&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Even making the maximum use of scheduled airlines, it would not be possible to meet the demands of these schedules without this additional facility.  I made the point in the <Col N="60" /> House yesterday that the Government jet we have &mdash; members of the Opposition will be well aware of this from their time in Government &mdash; was already fully extended before the Presidency commenced at all.  In fact, it was not meeting our needs and an additional facility was required.  After careful consideration and taking all the extension of activity into account we decided that this was probably the only way of meeting our obligations. Certainly in my view it is the most expeditious and economic way of meeting them.</P>
      <P>I have before me a memorandum prepared for the previous Government by the then Minister for Transport dated 21 June 1983 which states: &ldquo;The study also shows that the jet has advantages such as security and flexibility of timetable on which no monetary value can be placed but which are relevant in any study of this nature.&rdquo; I suggest to the Deputies opposite that this finding applies ten times more today because of the enormous extension which has taken place in the Community's affairs and activities.</P>
      <P>I can only repeat &mdash; and I ask the Opposition to be sensible about this &mdash; we did not take this decision lightly or because we had any grandiose ambitions. We examined the matter very carefully and we took a decision based on a realistic assessment of the situation.  This additional jet is leased only for the period of the Presidency, not from the day before or until the day after.  I believe it is a very sensible decision.  Indeed, this decision was almost dictated to us by circumstances. I ask Deputies to have a bit of common sense about it and to accept that in the view of the Government it was the only way to tackle the almost impossible demands which are now made on Ministers as President of the different Councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to thank the Taoiseach and congratulate him on that very lengthy disquisition.  I am bound to say that he seems to be very sensitive about this issue.  Does the Taoiseach not understand that the question I put to him, in conjunction with the question I put to <Col N="61" /> him yesterday, did not relate to the need for a Government jet, the need for which is beyond dispute, to add to the capacity which is already there &mdash; that aircraft is the most used aircraft of its type flying anywhere in the world &mdash; but simply asked whether the Government needed another jet with transatlantic capability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the vast majority of the journeys Ministers will make outside Europe can be planned around scheduled airline flights?  Would he not further agree that if one of the Government jets is being used to any great extent for lengthy trips such as the one to be undertaken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it will therefore not be available to other Ministers to go about their Presidential duties?  Can the Taoiseach give me any indication of what proportion of the use of this new mysterious jet, of which only one small photograph apparently exists, will be in travelling outside Europe?</P>

      <P>I want to dissuade Members from the notion that they may debate this matter now.  It was also adverted to at Question Time yesterday and I want to deal with other questions also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Dukes is narrowing this question down now to the single issue of the use of this jet on transatlantic trips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach had read my question properly he would have understood that from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is early days yet but the new jet has already been across the Atlantic at least twice, and this is an indication of the ways things are going. The broad strategy to be applied is that the smaller jet will be used for what we might nowadays call, in present circumstances, local work, that is, visits to London and Europe and the new jet will be used for longer journeys where there <Col N="62" /> is a larger complement of officials.  That is important.  As the Deputies themselves know from their ministerial experience, the small Army jet that we have all been used to is very restrictive in the number of officials it can take.  I instance the Strasbourg Summit when the majority of officials had to waste an enormous amount of time travelling the day before by scheduled services and having to come back the day after the same way.  The agenda of Ministers and officials these days is so packed that there should be no argument about this.</P>
      <P>The few instances I gave the Deputy I am sure he will be very relieved to know &mdash; do not include any travelling by myself because my schedule of visits has not yet been finally settled.  Most of those visits will be transatlantic.  That is another dimension, but I am absolutely convinced as a practical person that this represents a good practical solution by the Government to this almost horrendous problem of carrying out the obligations of the Presidency at this time.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>whether he has any plans, in the context of the EC Presidency, to reinforce Community action in the sphere of arts and culture; and the implications, if any, which such plans would have for Ireland.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the setting up in recent years of a Council of Ministers with responsibility for Culture, the European Community has created the framework for promoting and financing a programme of action in arts and culture. A meeting of this Council of Ministers will take place next May under our Presidency. There is also a Committee on Cultural Affairs at official level to advance the work of the Council.  It meets in Brussels and, under our Presidency, will hold about five meetings.</P>
      <P>The main elements in the current cultural programme relate to books and reading, training for the cultural sector and a range of ventures in the audio-visual sphere.</P>
      <P>In relation to books and reading, schemes for a European Literary Prize and a scheme for a European Translation Prize have been put forward and these will be launched during the Irish Presidency. A pilot scheme for translation of literary works will also be advanced to the operative stage during our Presidency.</P>
      <P>Work will also be advanced on a programme of co-operation between libraries in the Community and for the exchange of information and expertise in areas such as conservation of books, maps and manuscripts.</P>
      <P>The Commission is preparing a survey of training in the cultural sphere.  We hope to draw up during our Presidency a programme for Community action on training which could be of particular benefit to those working and seeking to work in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the audio-visual sector, ten pilot projects under the title MEDIA '92 have been developed by the Commission aimed at encouraging and developing the audio visual sector in the Community. These include a scheme for film script <Col N="64" /> awards in which Ireland is participating and schemes to assist the financing and marketing of films made in Europe.</P>
    <P>The cultural programme generally will have relevance for Ireland.  In addition, major capital works in the cultural sector in various parts of the country which have a significant tourism potential are currently being assessed for assistance from the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>I am also considering what initiatives it might be possible to take as regards cultural exchanges between Ireland and Community member states as well as in the developing relations between the Community and Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would be right in concluding that the Taoiseach has no plans other than those which existed when the Government took over the Presidency to add anything to this.  May I ask the Taoiseach if in advance of that meeting of Ministers in May the Government intend to introduce a new element into that package?  I am grateful to the Taoiseach for reading out what I can get in documents from the Commission and Council, but can he tell us if anything new will be added between now and the end of the Presidency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 104 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the recommendations in question is as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) and (b) The question of designating officials of my Department with responsibility for development of links between the primary and post-primary levels will be reviewed in the light of the report of the Primary Education Review Body.  The establishment of effective links between individual primary and post-primary schools is essentially a local matter.  My Department's inspectors monitor the situation in their own districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) The report's recommendations on pre-service training have already been taken into account by the colleges <Col N="70" /> of education in their training.</P>
    <P>(d)  In the autumn of 1988 my Department organised seminars for all primary school principals entitled &ldquo;Discipline and Good Relationships in Schools&rdquo;.  The seminars were designed to enable principal teachers to pass on the benefits of the course to the other teachers in their schools.</P>
    <P>(e)  The report of the Committee on Discipline in Schools did not recommend that my Department draw up &ldquo;a written and legally enforceable code of discipline&rdquo;.  It proposed that each school draw up its own code of discipline in consultation with parents and this was provided for in Circular 7/88, which my Department issued to schools in March 1988.  A review of the operation of the provisions of the circular was promised and this is being carried out at present, in consultation with the interested parties.</P>
    <P>(f)  The question of facilitating direct referral by schools of pupils to child guidance services provided by the health boards is one in the main for the health services.</P>
    <P>(g)  In relation to improved facilities recommended in the report, I have recently allocated 95 additional teaching posts for primary schools in disadvantaged areas together with an additional 30 remedial teaching posts. I am also having arrangements made for the early establishment of pilot projects for schools psychological services at primary level.</P>
    <P>In so far as post-primary schools are concerned, the managerial authority of the school is responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of discipline is drawn up and applied in the school. Guidelines for post-primary schools were issued in March 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that teachers, school principals and boards of management are facing acute difficulty at the moment in that they do not know whether they have an adequate <Col N="71" /> legal basis for disciplinary decisions they must make, for example, in regard to the suspension of a student, in the light of the constitutional rights to education and the requirements of the School Attendance Act, and that it is not good enough for the Minister to say this is something that should be dealt with by individual boards of management?  Will she agree they do not have the legal resources available to them that she has in her Department and that the Department should take the lead in giving schools legal guidance as to their rights in this matter so that we do not have uncertainty where disciplinary decision will be fought out in the courts rather than the Minister doing her job and acting on the report which I believe is on her desk.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's last statement is quite untrue.  The report of which he speaks is not on my desk and let that be on the record of this House. He asked that the Department take the lead.  We have done just so.  A review of the operation of the circular on the code of discipline was promised.  This is being carried out at present in consultation with the interested parties who include the groupings of whom the Deputy has just spoken here in the House, that is, the teachers, management and the parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if she wished to have a decision on this matter she could have taken it quickly and she should not hide behind yet another review committee?  Will she agree further that there will not be great confidence in the review she has now mentioned in view of the fact that in respect of the pre-existing committee on discipline no action has been taken by her Department on designating an official of her Department to develop links between primary and secondary schools, no action has been taken on the setting up of local committees and no action has been taken on allowing schools to make direct referrals to child guidance services? In view of the inaction documented in her reply to this question on <Col N="72" /> the committee on discipline who reported some years ago, what confidence is there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The revised regulations and guidelines on discipline in national schools, originally prepared by Deputy Cooney when Minister, issued to school authorities in 1988 were prepared having regard to the respective legal positions of the various parties involved in school disciplinary matters and following full consultations with their representative bodies.  We are all for democracy.  This document, Circular <Col N="73" /> 7/88, is currently being reviewed and rela-ted-school discipline problems raised by the representative bodies will be considered in full consultation with those bodies.</P>
      <P>In the case of post primary schools, guidelines on discipline were issued to post primary schools in March 1988. These guidelines indicate that school management is responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of discipline applies in the school.</P>
      <P>In the small percentage of cases where school authorities have experienced serious difficulties in resolving discipline problems, the Inspectorate and/or Psychological Service of my Department have endeavoured to assist in resolving the difficulties.  The general experience has been that these difficulties have been amenable in the main to resolution within the school context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1987 there were 1,733 students attending the Colleges of Education, there are now 1,090.  In the light of the deomgraphic trends the numbers that should be recruited to the Colleges of Education were revised.  In 1987 the number recruited to the colleges was 533 whereas the number recruited in 1988 and in 1989 was 275.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full impact of the limitation on recruitment will not be evident until 1991 <Col N="74" /> because of the three year cycle between recruitment and graduation.</P>
    <P>As regards opportunities for employment, as I said earlier, there are 95 additional posts for disadvantaged areas, 82 of which were filled by open recruitment. There are 30 additional remedial posts, most of which will be filled by open recruitment.  At any one time there are in excess of 1,250 teachers on career breaks of one to five years duration.  Eight hundred substitute teachers are required on any one day.  Each year 750 plus permanent and temporary teachers leave the service.  The pupil/teacher ratio &mdash; PTR &mdash; improvement from 1 September 1990 will provide at least 250 new jobs in primary schools.</P>
    <P>My Department sanctioned the filling of 145 permanent vacancies in secondary schools at the beginning of the present school year other than through the redeployment scheme for secondary school teachers.  In addition 58 temporary incremental appointments were approved.</P>
    <P>The numbers entering the higher diploma in education courses have declined significantly from, 1,127 in 1986-87, to 681 in 1989-90.  It is not possible to say how many of these posts were taken up by first time graduate teachers.  Let me add that the rules demand that substitutes for teachers on career breaks must be fully qualified.  Therefore, much as one would like every single teacher who is fully qualified to have a permanent post, that would not be possible because of the need for fully qualified substitute teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it costs the Irish taxpayer £32,000 for each teacher who is trained and at present, because of the policy to continue training teachers and the lack of openings in the Irish educational system for Irish trained teachers, what is happening is that the Irish taxpayer is subsidising the British educational system and that of other countries to which our teachers have no option but to emigrate?  Would she further agree that there is an urgent <Col N="75" /> need to provide these teachers with openings particularly in the primary school sector where there is a disgracefully unfavourable teacher/pupil ratio to deal with such matters as remedial education, career guidance and the problems of curriculum development.  In view of the fact we are already spending so much money training these teachers, would the Minister agree that it is false economy on our part and a subsidy to the economies of other countries, not to provide teachers with adequate employment opportunities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very long and complicated answer.  On 31 August 1977, the then Minister for Education entered into a contract for the building of St. Paul's at Lisduggan, Waterford.  The school authorities attained partial possession of the school in April 1979 and total possession in September 1979.  In accordance with my Department's procedures, 5 per cent of the contract sum was held as retention money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department were firstly advised by the VEC that the roof required remedial work on 20 September 1982.  The dates of all subsequent notifications about the roof are not readily available in my Department's records.  As it would take an inordinate amount of staff time to compile that information, the deployment of staff from more urgent duties would not be warranted.  The IIRS report <Col N="79" /> referred to in the question was received in my Department on 14 November 1986. This was before my time.</P>
    <P>In the period from September 1979 to September 1980, schedules of remedial work to be done on the building project were furnished to the contractor.  A substantial sum of money, in addition to the normal retention money, was retained as security that the listed works would be executed by the contractor.  The architect certified the release of the sum retained in October 1980.  I think this is the point the Deputy is interested in.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the expiration of the defects liability period, a further list of remedial work to be done was given to the contractor on 18 August 1981.  Apart from the translucent roof sheeting, this list, however, did not include any work in respect of the roof sheeting generally. The contractor accepted liability for two items only on the list.  In July 1982, a rectification contract was entered into by the VEC with another contractor to do the required remedial work.  Action pertaining to the maintenance of the roof is initially a matter for the City of Waterford VEC.</P>
    <P>With regard to the final payment made to the contractor, this was authorised by my Department when they had established to their satisfaction that the account was properly due and payable. The payment was appropriately adjusted to take account of the cost of the remedial work for which the contractor was liable.</P>
    <P>My Department have recently requested the VEC to provide an up-to-date report on the present condition of the roof.  As soon as this is received, such action as is necessary will be taken by my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agreed that the IIRS report described a highly defective roof and workmanship; that the Department and not the VEC, were the partners to the contract; that a teacher in the school has suffered a serious injury and children in the school suffered minor injuries as a result of leaks in the roof?  The Minister said that this <Col N="80" /> was first reported to her Department in September 1982.  I have the minutes of a meeting with senior officials of her Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 151 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Projected expenditure on examinations this year is £8.5 million. The total <Col N="82" /> cost to the Exchequer of running the examinations would far exceed this amount.  When account is taken of other factors such as staff salaries &mdash; including inspectors &mdash; overtime, stationery, maintenance of building, supervision of group certificate and provision of examination materials, school transport costs etc., the true cost overall would be £12 million approximately.</P>
    <P>Pupils whose parents or guardians are the holders of a current medical card &mdash; or a pupil, the holder of a medical card &mdash; will be exempted from the payment of the repeat fee on production of the medical card for noting by the school authorities.</P>
    <P>For repeat candidates entering for one or two subjects only the fee will be £35 and £70 respectively.</P>
    <P>The estimated amount of State expenditure, excluding capital expenditure on education for 1989 on a <i>per capita</i> basis, is £1,475 at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the fees for this year would have already been paid by this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the fee, not merely for this year but for future years, is becoming a massive burden on parents with regard to the expenditure on education for their children.  In her reply the Minister has not said there are any proposals to withdraw that fee.  Therefore, I am assuming it will escalate.  Has the Minister any proposal to eliminate or even reduce that fee in order to facilitate people just above the medical card bracket who now feel the fee constitutes a massive burdren on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked, in his question, the cost of repeating the leaving certificate examination this year. In fact the fees would have been paid already for this year.  The fee has not been increased since its introduction three years ago.  It is a matter I will keep under review.  I might add that the number of students repeating annually has greatly increased.  People write to me about various aspects of the matter and <Col N="83" /> it is something I will continue to keep under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately how many students repeat the leaving certificate examination and what are the comparative figures in respect of repeats in previous years?  With particular reference to my question, No. 151 &mdash; which relates to the comparison between the fee charged and the actual cost to the Department &mdash; would the Minister agree that, in respect of repeats, her Department are making a substantial profit in the sense that the examination is being held anyway and that the relevant cost with which to compare the charge to repeat students is the extra cost involved for those students, not the entire cost divided by the total number of students sitting the examination?  On that basis would the Minister agree that her Department are in fact making a profit by means of repeats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The day the Department of Education make a profit will be some day.  I totally refute that allegation; absolutely not.  First, the Deputy asked me for the numbers of students.  I know their numbers have increased each year. I will forward the exact numbers who have repeated the examination for the past three years.  That information is not contained in my back-up file here.  I should like to give the Deputy the correct figure but I know it has increased by over 1,000 and somewhat more each year.  We are not making a profit out of it at all; indeed far from it.  If one takes into account all of the infrastructure, for want of a better description&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the marginal cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>To begin with I should say the students are in school &mdash; I am not now talking about the attendance &mdash; I am talking about the students who go to school for a year.  Naturally the pupil/teacher ratio is based on the number of students in a class.  I would <Col N="84" /> hope that more and more students would remain in their regular schools in order to repeat their leaving certificate examination, or go to a voluntary secondary, community comprehensive or vocational school rather than to the many outside agencies who run the examination repeat at a prohibitive cost &mdash; for example £1,500 on the last occasion.  I would hope that students would remain in their regular schools.  In regular schools, no matter how many students wish to repeat, they are accommodated and teachers always provided for them.  It is the pupil/teacher ratio that applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that many students are repeating the examination without going back to school where they would be receiving an indirect subsidy and that, in those cases anyway, the marginal cost to the Department of allowing them repeat the examination is virtually nil?  Would she agree that the Department, in those cases at least, are making a profit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all; that is not the question appearing on the Order Paper.  I will have that information and a tabular statement of the costs incurred conveyed to Deputy John Bruton also to be added to the big red book he is compiling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree, to deal with the fee itself, the £200 to repeat the leaving certificate examination is excessive with regard to medical card holders whose income eligibility limit for a medical card in respect of a <Col N="85" /> married couple is £103.50 with an additional approximate £11.50 per child? Would the Minister agree that if a family marginally above the income eligibility limit for a medical card must find £200, that sum is well in excess of a week's income?  My main concern &mdash; and I am sure that of Deputy O'Sullivan also &mdash; is that this is consolidating a two-tiered education system with regard to repetition of the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In levying that fee we took account of disadvantaged pupils, as evidenced in the medical card holder exemption.  Indeed, we adopted the same criteria as the Fine Gael and Labour Parties when they introduced school transport fees and when they, too, had recourse to medical card eligibility in respect of such fee exemption.  As I said to Deputy O'Sullivan, and I will say again to the House, it has not increased since it was brought in three years ago.  It is something that I will be keeping under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a basic inequality in post-primary education in that some schools provide five years post-primary education and some six years?  Would she not consider addressing this problem by allowing pupils who repeat in a five year post-primary school to do so free of charge and only address the charge to those who already had six years post-primary education?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister to clarify something that I thought I heard <Col N="86" /> her say, that the cost for a repeat leaving certificate is £70?  I would like the Minister to confirm that the cost is actually £111.  I have a son who is repeating his leaving certificate and that is the amount of the receipt that I got from the Department. As well as that, he must also find a location in which to repeat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 32, 35, 55, 57, 64, 71, 87, 88 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are currently being made to relocate the remand and assessment centre for girls known as Cuan Mhuire from its present location in Whitehall, Dublin 9, to Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin.  This relocation becomes necessary because of the expiry of the lease under which the Department held the Whitehall property from the order of nuns who own it.</P>
      <P>Refurbishing works are being carried out at the proposed new location and are expected to be completed in February 1990 at which time the transfer will take place.</P>
      <P>The same services for remand and assessment will continue to be provided at Oberstown as have hitherto been available at Whitehall.  The provision being made at the new location includes a special facility in which two girls could be accommodated, should this prove necessary, for longer than the usual remand and assessment period of three weeks.</P>
      <P>At the same time the need for a secure unit for longer-term girl offenders has been referred to the Department of Justice for urgent consideration by a high-level interdepartmental group, currently considering all aspects of detention of offenders.  <i>Inter alia,</i> they are discussing this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When will Cuan Mhuire close and when will the new facility be opened?  Will there be any interval and, if so, what will happen during that period? Secondly, is the Minister aware that this relocation involves having the remand and assessment centre for girls on the same campus as the one for boys?  Could the Minister say if the board of management of Cuan Mhuire have indicated that they are happy with such an arrangement or is the Minister happy with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the <Col N="89" /> Deputy's first question, there will be no gap period.  That will be looked after. I understand that there is disquiet not precisely about the matter to which the Deputy referred but in general about the issue.  The fact remains, that it is necessary, because of the expiry date, to re-locate, albeit on a temporary basis.  The final resolution of this problem is now, <i>inter alia,</i> being discussed by an inter-departmental committee of the Departments of Justice, Health and Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that girls who are currently being accommodated in a remand and assessment centre ought to be accommodated after sentence in a facility which is not a remand and assessment facility?  Is there no such facility for girls to be accommodated after sentence and, if not, would the Minister agree that that represents a very serious gap in the education and justice systems?  Could the Minister be a little more specific than she was in her reply as regards exactly what is going to be done about this and when?</P>

      <P>Yes, it is and it is not a practice of which I approve.  The Deputy must remember that, particularly at post-primary level, schools can use their capitation grant at their own discretion. Naturally, they pay their heating and insurance bills and so on but they have a freedom of manoeuvre as regards the use of the grant.  We cannot tell them what to do with the money.  I am not very happy with the development as outlined by Deputy Kavanagh but there are areas where there are active parents' councils who want to do things like that.  Do you just tell boards of management or principals they cannot do that or do you allow a certain freedom of manoeuvrability in that respect?</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to accept that the number of teachers in schools is adequate but I do not accept that.  The question of the pupil-teacher ratio is one that has been discussed over a long period.  I think all schools would prefer to have more teachers if that was possible and that there is a demand for more teachers in most second-level schools.  As I have said, people in the areas of more affluence can afford, through fund raising &mdash; I am not talking about the grant &mdash; to make up the shortfall they perceive in their schools whereas other areas cannot do so.</P>

Would the Minister agree that the capitation grant of £26 per pupil is inadequate, that a figure of £42 per pupil has been <Col N="92" /> given as the cost per pupil and that this would mean that the parents are contributing approximately 30 per cent of the cost of primary education and that the Minister is contributing approximately 60 per cent?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 29, 51, 77, 93 and 106 together.  The Primary Education Review Body &mdash; that is the Murphy review &mdash; represents a wide range of interests and it was necessary, when it was being constituted, to limit the number of members to reasonable proportions.  It was in this context that the National Parents' Council were allocated two places on the review body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the allocation of two places to parents as against eight places for teachers and five places for management does not reflect the importance of the contribution of parents in education and does not give sufficient weight to the views of parents in this context?  Would the Minister further agree that additional parental representation would bring new disciplines into the operation of the <Col N="95" /> Murphy Committee which would be beneficial on the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Murphy review has been set up for two years and is now due to report so it is rather odd that it is two years since its establishment that this raft of questions appear on the Order Paper.  On perhaps half a dozen occasions I have met the parents in formal consultative meetings and they have expressed difficulties about compiling the research and about being ready with reports and various other matters but they have never expressed the view that their numbers were inadequate on the review committee.  As Deputies know, the calibre of the parents on the committee is excellent.  In furthering their work and research so that they could participate fully on the review committees &mdash; the curriculum review committee and Dr. Tom Murphy's committee on primary review &mdash; coming to the end of the year in my Supplementary Estimate I made an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £25,000 to the national parent council, a payment which the Deputy refused when he was Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Why was the Presidency programme not included in a measure to alter the provisions of the Treaty of Rome which currently prevent &mdash; or allegedly currently prevent &mdash; the Community from giving assistance to education?

      <P>I am advised by Sealink that at 11.30 a.m. this morning a fire broke out board the <i>St. Columba</i>, The Sealink vessel.  It was carrying 199 passengers at the time and it was on its regular service from Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead. The vessel left Dún Laoghaire at 8.45 a.m. this morning so it was obviously close to the port of Holyhead when the incident occurred.  Alerts were issued from the vessel and a lifeboat and helicopters from the UK were in attendance. The B &amp; I vessel, the <i>Leinster,</i> was also <Col N="103" /> in attendance.  I understand, from my information from Sealink this morning, that the crew of the <i>St. Columba</i> put out the fire themselves and that there were no injuries.  I also understand that the vessel is currently being towed into Holyhead Port.  The Deputy will appreciate that the information is still coming in and I only received this Private Notice question less than half an hour ago. However, I am assured by Sealink that that is the current information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The central aim of this first budget of the new decade is to promote more economic growth and jobs at home and a better standard of living for all our people.  We now have convincing proof of how this can be done.  The policies which are already being implemented &mdash; and which are set out clearly in the Programme for Government, together with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i><Col N="165" /> and the National Development Plan &mdash; are delivering the results.  Sustainable growth in the economy has been achieved and, increasingly, this growth is being translated into more jobs.  Our objective for 1990 and the new decade must be to intensify this process in order to achieve our national goals.</P>
      <P>An increase in jobs will help us to tackle directly the human tragedy of unemployment which is the cause of many of our most pressing social difficulties. We must ensure that all sections of the community will share in the benefits of our economic progress.</P>
      <P>Our plans and actions must, therefore, carry an &ldquo;effect on jobs&rdquo; assessment with them.  Sectional interests must be suborinated to this overriding commitment to a sustained increase in employment. Achievement of the objective of more growth and more jobs requires co-ordinated action on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>The excellent progress which we have made in putting the public finances in order must be resolutely continued.  The improvement here has been the central factor in restoring confidence and in facilitating all the progress made up to now.  Given the size of our public debt there is no room for relaxation.  Further progress is essential.</P>
      <P>There must be unrelenting action to control inflation and costs of all kinds in order that we can continue to improve our competitiveness in the more integrated markets which we face as the EC moves towards 1992 and, subsequently, towards full ecomonic and monetary union.  Inflation is the particular enemy of the poor.</P>
      <P>We clearly need to make further progress in restructuring and reforming our tax system so as to encourage initiative and reward effort and support the process of non-inflationary growth with more jobs.  We must also begin to prepare for tax changes in the EC.</P>
      <P>Consistent with this overall developmental approach, there is scope too for specific additional measures which can help to promote jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget contains important new initiatives in each of the areas I have <Col N="166" /> mentioned.  It also brings forward new economic and social measures to help those on low incomes &mdash; whether they are young or old.  It is my aim that those most in need of help will get it.</P>
    <P>In framing the budget the Government are determined to play their part in supporting and developing the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The programme is a pivotal element in our overall policy framework.  If we are to realise the full benefits from the actions taken over the past few years, it is essential that the consensus approach, embracing policy and partnership which is enshrined in the programme, should be maintained and indeed broadened in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>THE ECONOMY</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economic Situation</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am publishing today, with other budget documents, my Department's latest assessment of recent economic developments and of prospects for 1990. These take into account the effects of the measures I will be announcing later.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of 1989</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the year just completed, we have seen the consolidation and continuation of the recovery which began in 1987.  A few short years ago it would have seemed over-optimistic to predict that the Irish economy by 1989, would, be growing as fast as the rest of the EC while continuing to make a major improvement in the public finances.  Yet that is the reality.</P>
    <P>Real GNP is estimated to have grown by 3¼ per cent last year, with the volume of output rising by 4¾ per cent.  A second successive trade surplus of over £2 billion kept the current balance of payments in surplus despite increased profit repatriations. In line with international trends, interest rates and inflation increased somewhat.  Our rate of inflation is, however, only half that in the UK.</P>
    <P>The latest labour force survey confirmed that the sustained efforts of the past three years are having the anticipated major impact on employment growth.  Between April 1987 and April 1989 the number of jobs in the private non-agricultural sectors increased by <Col N="167" /> more than 30,000.  Non-agricultural employment is estimated to have grown by some 13,000 in 1989, despite necessary reductions in public sector staffing.  By the end of the year, numbers on the live register had fallen by almost 12,000 &mdash; standing some 19,000 below the level of end 1986.</P>
    <P>
      <i>International Developments</i>
    </P>
    <P>Economic growth in the OECD area has been moderating, with a more pronounced slowdown in the US and the UK.  The outlook for world economic activity in 1990 is, therefore, rather less favourable than in the past two years. Britain's imports, which rose by almost 10 per cent in 1989, seem likely to grow much more slowly this year, although, against this, economic activity in continental European countries should remain relatively buoyant.  While we can anticipate a further, if more modest, expansion in our overall export markets, actual and prospective cost develoments abroad re-emphasise the vital importance of cost containment at home.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prospects for 1990</i>
    </P>
    <P>A number of the factors which increased domestic inflation in 1989 will either be absent or, better still, will work in the opposite direction this year.  Taking account of the measures I will announce today, consumer price inflation should fall to little more than 3 per cent on average this year.  The weakening of sterling and the dollar and the better outlook for international inflation, will help to bring down the rate of price increase here as the year progresses.  If we manage our affairs properly, inflation could be less than 2½ per cent by the end of 1990.</P>
    <P>Investment will again be buoyant this year.  Against this background, and in the light of the budgetary measures, output in 1990 is likely to grow by about 4½ per cent, with GNP growing by more than 3½ per cent.  This should stimulate substantial further job creation and another reduction in unemployment.  Non-agricultural employment should grow by <Col N="168" /> about 16,000.  A further decline in emigration is expected.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments is likely to continue in surplus for the fourth successive year, though at a modest level. Overall, I expect the strong growth in domestic economic activity and the improvement in employment which were such welcome features of 1989 to continue in 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>
    </P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> by any standard, has been an outstanding success.  The substantial progress made towards the achievement of its objectives has underpinned the economic recovery of the last three years.</P>
    <P>With almost a year of the programme remaining, the targets for Exchequer borrowing set in the programme, and the target of stabilising the national debt, have already been more than met.  The Government's commitments on tax concessions have been met, and indeed greatly exceeded, as has our commitment to the poorest sections of society.</P>
    <P>The pay provisions of the programme, I am glad to say, have been widely observed, ensuring a welcome improvement in the international competitiveness of Irish production and jobs, and helping to secure a continuing moderate inflation rate.  This, with the income tax reliefs and other improvements, has resulted in the real take home pay of all workers, and especially the lower paid, increasing significantly over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The job creation targets of the programme might have appeared ambitious. However, the target of 20,000 jobs in manufacturing and international services has been met for the second successive year.  There is the prospect of a similar achievement this year.  In areas of the economy such as tourism and the International Financial Services Centre, the response to the various initiatives has been impressive.  There has been a dramatic fall in redundancies which were down by over 40 per cent in 1989.  This has meant, of course, that when new jobs were created their beneficial effect in providing employment has been much <Col N="169" /> less diluted by job losses than in recent years.  As a result there has been a significant reduction in unemployment, and the latest figures show that the long-term jobless too have begun to benefit from the greater opportunities.</P>
    <P>Progress on such a broad front would simply not have been possible without the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Although much has been achieved under the present programme, more remains to be done.  The next phase of our development, not least because it will include preparations for completion of the EC internal market, will, in its own way, be even more important and challenging than the last.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's wish that when the present arrangements expire, consensus should continue as the basis of economic management and of the development and implementation of policies. We see the provisions of this budget as helping to build a bridge towards a new programme, and hope that the other participants will view the budget in similar terms.  Any worth-while accord &mdash; which must, above all, be consistent with advancing the long-term welfare of all in our society &mdash; has, of course, to come to terms with the basic realities, as did the programme adopted in 1987.  It will demand a preparedness, on the part of each grouping, to temper expectations and demands by reference to what is judged economically feasible, and to confront the unavoidable trade-offs between various goals.  The same degree of courage and foresight which made possible the transformation of this economy under the current programme will be required in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of 1989 Budget Outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year Government borrowing, at 2.4 per cent of GNP, was at its lowest for about 40 years.  In money terms, the amount borrowed by the Government amounted to £479 million, about £580 million below that £1,055 million envisaged in the budget.  In the space of one year we reduced borrowing by nearly three percentage points of GNP more than had seemed possible at the start of <Col N="170" /> the year.  As recently as 1986, Exchequer borrowing amounted to £2,145 million or just 13 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Revenue 1989</i>
    </P>
    <P>The single most important contribution to the excellent outcome last year came from exceptionally high receipts of tax revenue.  These were about £430 million, or 6 per cent, ahead of the budget estimate. Virtually all the tax heads performed better than expected.  The biggest increase was in indirect taxes.  This reflected the sharp pick-up in consumer spending, especially on cars, the sales of which increased by some 25 per cent on a year earlier.  The strength of the property and stock markets also contributed significantly to the increase in indirect tax receipts.</P>
    <P>Income tax receipts were also ahead of expectations, partly because of higher receipts from the deposit interest retention tax but mainly because of the speedier payover of PAYE tax deductions to the Revenue Commissioners by companies and businesses.  This acceleration in PAYE tax payments was a direct result of the more intensive use of computers by the Collector General's staff in the monitoring of tax compliance, as part of the continuing improvement in tax collection and enforcement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Expenditure 1989</i>
    </P>
    <P>Debt service costs last year were about £100 million less than anticipated.  This reflected lower than expected borrowing and the fact that a significant portion of fund raising did not take place until relatively late in the year.</P>
    <P>For the third successive year, spending on non-capital supply services came in below budget.  At £5,566 million the outturn was £29 million below the target figure of £5,595 million.  As in 1988, the biggest contributory factor was lower than expected expenditure on social welfare reflecting, in the main, buoyancy in social insurance fund receipts.  Spending on health was up by more than £20 million as a result principally of the improvements in hospital services announced in July 1989 and increased spending on the <Col N="171" /> general medical services scheme, but this was offset by savings on the Exchequer pay and pensions bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital in 1989</i>
    </P>
    <P>Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes during 1989 was some £20 million less than estimated.  Capital receipts increased by £67 million which more than compensated for lower than expected transfers from the European Regional Development Fund resulting from timing factors.  There was also a saving of £10 million on non-programme outlays.</P>
    <P>On the non-Exchequer side, capital expenditure was somewhat higher than budgeted.  Lower than expected demand for Housing Finance Agency loans, and lower expenditure by some of the semi-State enterprises, was more than compensated for by an expansion in ACC and ICC activity which in turn reflected higher demand for farming and small industry loans.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Borrowing and Debt/GNP Ratio</i>
    </P>
    <P>The substantial reduction in Exchequer borrowing achieved last year, together with the further economic growth, saw the debt/GNP ratio fall to about 123 per cent, a reduction of some eight percentage points.  Given the problems which have beset the public finances for so long, this represents an important turning point.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this major achievement, it is necessary to remind ourselves once again of the realities of our situation. The fact that we borrowed less than expected in 1989 is gratifying but we still borrowed nearly £500 million just to pay our way.  The overhang of national debt now stands at close to £25 billion.  This is about twice the EC average in relation to GNP.  The costs of servicing this debt continue to constitute a heavy burden on the budget and the economy.  This year alone these costs amount to well over £2 billion, the equivalent of virtually all the expected income tax yield from the PAYE sector.  They pre-empt large resources which we so badly need for economic and social development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> The sheer size of the debt also leaves us continually exposed to adverse movements in interest and exchange rates.  The increases in interest rates which have occurred over the past six months or so bear this out.  There is no avoiding the conclusion, therefore, that despite the commendable progress we have made, we must continue to bring down borrowing and debt.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Medium-Term Policy for the Public Finances</i>
    </P>
    <P>Clarity about, and agreement on, Government financial policy over the medium-term is central to maintaining public confidence and providing a framework for progress in the years ahead.  As the medium-term targets included in the <i>Programme for Government 1989 to 1993</i> have been achieved some three years ahead of schedule, it is obvious that new medium-term budgetary objectives are required.  Our medium-term policy must also, more than ever before, take account of the increasing convergence of economic policies in the European Community which will require action by the member states to curb excessive borrowing and debt.  Progress beyond that envisaged heretofore is possible.  The Government are determined to maintain the momentum in improving the public finances, which will continue to be crucial for more economic growth and jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Medium&mdash;Term Objectives</i>
    </P>
    <P>Over the period up to and including 1993 the aim will now be to maintain a significant rate of progress in reducing the debt/GNP ratio towards 100 per cent and, as part of this, to achieve broad balance on the current budget for the first time in 21 years.  Borrowing for capital purposes, and the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement, will need to be held to the minimum level consistent with this strategy and with the needs of balanced economic growth and stable monetary conditions.</P>
    <P>These are the objectives we must set ourselves.  They will not come easily. There will always be tension between the pace of progress in reducing borrowing and debt and the many other objectives <Col N="173" /> we are trying to achieve within our limited resources.  In the period ahead our pursuit of competitiveness will require us to face the heavy costs involved in meeting the Government's objective of lowering the standard personal tax rate to 25 per cent and of having a single top rate by 1993, and the implications of tax approximation in the EC.</P>
    <P>To fulfil our objectives, therefore, we will need to have a favourable international background and sustained growth.  We will also require continued tight control of public expenditure and measures to broaden the tax base.  We will be dependent too on a successful outcome to our request to the European Community for measures to help us to deal with the problems posed for us by the approximation of indirect taxes.  Notwithstanding the difficulties, we are determined to make further progress on the basis of these objectives over the next few years.  It is important that we get back to paying our way.</P>

      <i>Structural Funds and National Devellopment Plan</i>
    </P>
    <P>Ireland expects to get over £3 billion from the EC Structural Funds over the period 1989 to 1993.  The Community Support Framework adopted at the end of October 1989 by the EC Commission, in agreement with the Irish Government, contains a financial commitment of £2,860 million, in 1989 prices, over this period.  Ireland will also benefit from additional funding from the reserve retained for new Community initiatives. This total funding will represent the biggest single financial commitment ever made to this State by the Community.</P>
    <P>A total of £539 million in assistance will be available to Ireland from the Structural Funds in 1990.  In addition, some £18 million of commitments from the Social Fund in 1989 will be carried forward to 1990, bringing total assistance to £557 million.  This compares with an adjusted figure of £462 million for 1989, an increase of over 20 per cent.  Commitments for 1988 were £361 million.  The 1990 figure therefore shows an increase, <Col N="174" /> in nominal terms, of 54 per cent on the pre-1989 position.</P>
    <P>The increased funding from the Community will play a major part in realising our plans for higher investment and more jobs in 1990.  It will have a major positive effect on the construction industry which has already recovered well in recent times.</P>
    <P>The expected 1990 Structural Funds commitments were taken into account in the Estimates and Public Capital Programme published last November.  Commission decisions on the operational programmes will represent the definitive commitment of Community aid.  We have reviewed the provision made in the Estimates and Public Capital Programme and are satisfied, in the light of the programmes already approved by the Commission and the continuing work on finalising the other programmes, that the assumptions underlying the provision remain valid.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opening Position for Main Budgetary Agreement</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset, budgetary policy in 1990 is aimed at making the economy more competitive so as to advance our economic and social development.</P>
    <P>The opening current budget deficit, based on the published 1990 Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, is £85 million after allowing for the deduction of £25 million for departmental balances.  The opening Exchequer borrowing requirement is £251 million.</P>
    <P>EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>
      <i>Central Fund Services and Debt Management</i>
    </P>
    <P>The opening estimate for Central Fund Services for 1990 is £2,690 million, of which £2,345 million is in respect of debt service payments.  The debt service provision represents an increase of 9.6 per cent on the outturn for 1989.</P>
    <P>Despite the savings arising from the lower than expected borrowing requirement in 1989, interest rate increases <Col N="175" /> during the past year will result in a significant rise of over £200 million in the cost of servicing the national debt this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Office for Management of the National Debt</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is continuing emphasis within my Department on arrangements to minimise the cost of debt service which is our second largest overhead after pay. Further new measures were introduced during 1989 to keep costs as low as possible through the further use of the most modern techniques and instruments and by diversifying sources of financing.  Debt management has become an increasingly complex and sophisticated activity requiring flexible management structures and sufficient suitably qualified personnel to exploit fully the potential for savings. It is for this reason that the Government decided to establish, under statute, an independent office for the management of the national debt.  This development does not alter my statutory responsibility as Minister for Finance for the management of the national debt but I will now have available the resources needed to carry out this function in a more cost effective way.</P>
    <P>I expect that the new office will be in place by mid-year and, on this basis, I am providing in the budget arithmetic for a saving on debt service costs of £35 million on the opening central fund services figure of £2,690 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Exchange Rate Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>While on the subject of debt service it is appropriate to make reference to exchange rate policy.  The guiding principle has been the stability of the Irish pound in the European Monetary System.  The objective is to pursue a strong currency policy within the system and to implement whatever monetary and other measures may be necessary at any time to secure this position.  Sometimes it is necessary to maintain a level of domestic interest rates higher than we would wish in order to achieve the vital exchange rate objective.  However, the <Col N="176" /> value of a strong currency is such that over time more than compensates for the short-term costs associated with achieving it.</P>
    <P>The substantial relaxation of exchange controls from the beginning of 1989 led to increased movement of funds abroad by Irish investment institutions.  This was not unexpected.  In fact, a large increase in inflows by non-residents, particularly into Irish Government bonds, was sufficient to allow a further repayment of foreign currency debt.  These inflows by non-residents are a reflection of the growing confidence in our economic management. The process of phasing out exchange controls will be continued with a view to meeting the deadline of 1992 for elimination of all controls.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Capital Supply Services Expenditure Departmental Spending 1990</i>
    </P>
    <P>In settling the spending allocations for 1990 the Government had to satisfy a number of basic requirements.  First, that the progress we had made since 1987 in putting the public finances into better shape must not be undone; second, that overall expenditure in 1990 had to be consistent with continuing downward pressure on the Exchequer borrowing requirement; and third, that there were specific priority areas of spending which we had to target with additional resources.  The spending allocations already published are some £250 million below the departmental demands.  When coupled with the additional provisions I will announce shortly, the 1990 allocations will clearly demonstrate that a reasonable balance has been reached between the various competing needs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Opening Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure published recently included a figure of £5,661 million for net non-capital supply services, the same figure as was published in the 1990 Abridged Estimates Volume in November last year.  A final figure of spending in 1989 which was lower than had been expected, other developments since the Abridged Estimates were published, and certain <Col N="177" /> savings which have been made to meet part of the cost of the additional expenditure allocations which I will announce shortly, are all factors which necessitate some adjustments to the 1990 allocations already published.  The net result of these adjustments is to reduce the published figure by £84 million.  Details of these adjustments are explained in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget,</i> which is being circulated separately.</P>
    <P>Taking account of these adjustments the opening figure for non-capital supply services is £5,577 million, or £5,552 million on a budgetary basis when estimated departmental balances of £25 million are taken into account.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1990 Summary Public Capital Programme published last November totalled £1,657 million.  As with non-capital spending, this figure must also be revised to take account of developments in the intervening period.  The net impact of the changes is to reduce the published 1990 programme by £9 million to £1.648 million.  Details of these changes are also set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>Additions to Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>I now propose to make a number of additions to non-capital and capital expenditure starting with:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Welfare, the Elderly and the Disadvantaged</i>
    </P>
    <P>This Government are strongly committed to alleviating poverty and disadvantage. Over the last three budgets, during a time of unprecedented fiscal adjustment, the Government allocated sufficient resources not just to protect the underprivileged in our society, but also to make significant progress in raising the real value of payments to them.  I am continuing on that course in this budget so as to ensure that the fruits of the economic improvement are spread right across our society.  I will now outline the improvements which will be implemented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" />
      <i>Weekly Welfare Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>First, weekly welfare payments generally and health allowances will be increased by 5 per cent with effect from next July.  This increase is well above the expected rate of inflation.  There will be increases of higher than 5 per cent to an even wider range of social welfare recipients than have benefited from special increases in past budgets.  Also, and most importantly, I am increasing monthly child benefit payments across the board by 5 per cent or 75p for each of the first four children and £1.15 for other children.  These steps reflect the Government's intention that this year more welfare recipients should receive special concessions than was the case with previous budgets.  We continue, of course, to give particular attention to the problems of those on the lowest payments.</P>
    <P>This will mean, for instance, that the rate of old age contributory pension for a person under 80 years will increase from £58.50 to £61.50 per week.  The rate for such a pensioner with an adult dependant over 66 will rise from £102.20 to £107.20. Similarly, the rates of invalidity pension for persons under 66 will increase from £51.50 to £54.10 per week for a single person and from £85.60 to £89.90 for a married couple.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pensioners, Lone Parents and Long Term Unemployed</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am giving special increases to pensioners and lone parents on long-term means-tested assistance.  Thus, I am giving a £3 per week or 6 per cent increase to non-contributory pensioners bringing their personal rate from £50 to £53.  A new personal rate for persons under 80 of £53 per week will be made available to widows and deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives, together with widowers and deserted husbands with children.  This represents an increase of £4 or 8 per cent for those under 66 and £3 or 6 per cent for those over 66.  For widows and deserted wives under 80 years on social insurance pensions, the new weekly rate of pension will be £56. I am giving a £3 per week increase to those on weekly supplementary welfare <Col N="179" /> allowance, bringing their personal rate from £42 to £45 per week.  Also, the adult dependant allowance payable to such persons will be increased by £4.10 or 15 per cent to £31 per week.  A similar increase of £3 per week or nearly 7 per cent will be made in the personal rate of unemployment benefit and disability benefit, currently at £45 per week: their corresponding adult dependant allowances will go up by £2 to £31 per week. Finally, the long-term unemployed will receive the largest increase, bringing their personal rate from £47 per week to £52 per week.  This increase of about 11 per cent demonstrates the continued determination of the Government to assist those on the lowest rates who have little or no alternative to reliance on social welfare.  The dependent spouse increase payable to long-term unemployment assistance recipients will also be increased by £2 to £31 per week.  The disabled person's maintenance allowance will be brought into line with these rates, giving a new personal rate of £52 and £31 for an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Dependants</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year we introduced a minimum weekly payment of £10 for all child dependants.  This provided significant increases to families on the lowest rate of welfare.  It also halved the number of separate rates.  This year I am providing for a £1 per week increase in the minimum, bringing it to £11 i.e. a 10 per cent increase on the existing minimum.  This will also have the effect of reducing further the number of rates.</P>
    <P>It is worth-while at this stage to illustrate the value of the package of improvements outlined above.  I will take as an example the overall increase for a married man with 3 children on long-term unemployment assistance.  The total payment is currently £107 per week excluding non-cash entitlement.  The increases I have outlined will give him an extra £9 per week.  Similarly, such a person on short-term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance will <Col N="180" /> receive an overall increase of over £10 per week or somewhat above 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Twenty Year Olds in Full-Time Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>Currently, weekly increases payable to long-term social welfare claimants in respect of their children in full-time education cease to be payable when the children reach 19 years in the case of some schemes, and 21 years in the case of others.  As a further step in the rationalisation of schemes, I am raising the 19 year age limit to 20 years from next September.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Clothing Allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am introducing today a new allowance to be operated through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist families in particular difficulties to provide for their children's school and winter clothing.  The payment will be made to qualifying families from September. Further details of this important new scheme will be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>A New Carer's Allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>In recognition of the particular efforts made by relatives of permanently ill and elderly persons, I am increasing from £28 to £45 per week the payment made in respect of certain relatives who care on a full-time basis at home for such persons. This measure is intended to provide an incentive to families to care for their elderly relatives in a home setting rather than be forced, for financial reasons, to leave them to institutional care.  In this context some changes in the scope of the existing prescribed relatives allowance scheme will be made.  Details will be announced by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Services for the Elderly</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are concerned that health services for the elderly should be developed further.  In addition to the carer's allowance, the Government are now making an extra allocation of £5 million in 1990 towards improving health <Col N="181" /> services for the elderly in general.  The allocation will be funded by £2 million from the Exchequer and £3 million from the national lottery; £2.5 million will go to help strengthen home nursing and home help support; £2 million will provide more facilities for increased day care, short-term and long-stay care, and improved treatment of respiratory disorders; and £0.5 million will provide additional nursing home places for the relief of families who are caring for people at home who require constant attention and nursing care.  This initial investment of £5 million in expanded health services for the elderly marks the beginning of a wider redeployment of resources towards the support of our older citizens.  It is an investment in which we all have a long-term interest.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Free Schemes</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year, I addressed certain anomalies applying to the free schemes and this year I am glad to make further improvements.  Many recipients of the disabled person's maintenance allowance are unable to fully utilise the free travel concession because a companion brought along to assist mobility must pay the appropriate fare.  In future, the free travel scheme will allow a companion to travel with recipients of this allowance.</P>
    <P>Pensioners over 80 years are to be allowed to retain their free electricity entitlement when people come to live with them.</P>
    <P>The anomaly whereby an invalidity pensioner with free scheme entitlement loses this entitlement on transferring to retirement pension at 65 years is also being removed.</P>
    <P>Finally, free scheme entitlements are being extended to social security pensioners of states with whom Ireland has signed a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fuel Allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>There are some anomalies in the way in which entitlement to the fuel allowance operates which need to be remedied. With effect from the commencement of the next heating season in mid-October, a long-term welfare recipient will no longer <Col N="182" /> be denied the fuel allowance where a recipient of a short-term means-tested welfare benefit lives with the individual concerned.  The allowance is also being extended to persons in receipt of smallholders' unemployment assistance who live alone.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Family Income Supplement</i>
    </P>
    <P>In addition to the funds already provided in the Estimates, I am providing an extra £1 million to finance further improvements in the family income supplement scheme in 1990.  The details of these improvements will be announced later by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In the administration of the FIS scheme, the Government are taking steps to ensure that no person loses the medical card as a result of claiming the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special £0.5 million Allocation for Programmes for Women</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is in recent years an increasing involvement by women, particularly women who work full-time in the home, in tackling problems and issues which affect them.  Many such self-help groups have been established in local communities and have become an important source of personal development for participants. They have encouraged women to improve their education and skills and to develop their capacity for leadership and organisation.  In this way they can enable the women concerned to contribute more fully to the development of their own communities.</P>
    <P>The Government are making a special allocation of £0.5 million for programmes for women.  Of this, the sum of £150,000 is being made available to support the work of the Rape Crisis Centres in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Clonmel, Waterford and Galway.  The balance will be used to encourage local self-help groups working for women.  The Minister for Social Welfare will make arrangements to allocate these funds.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Grants for Local Enterprise Activities</i>
    </P>
    <P>Local people are in a unique position <Col N="183" /> to identify the needs of their own communities and to tackle them.  We have a long tradition in this country of local involvement in social services and community self-help.</P>
    <P>The Government have strongly supported the EC Poverty Programme as a means of developing local initiatives. Two large-scale Irish projects based in Connemara and Limerick and a smaller project for travellers based in Dublin are included in the third EC Programme which is now commencing.</P>
    <P>These projects can provide a vital resource in their communities.  They can initiate a wide range of activities, including local enterprise activities and projects with the elderly, young families, single parents and other groups in need of help and support.  An amount of £0.6 million has been provided in the Estimates for grants to voluntary organisations and the Government have decided to allocate £0.525 million of this to support the core activities of worth-while projects of this kind.  Allocations from this provision will include amounts for Tallaght Resource Centre, Inishowen Development Group, Knocknaheeny Support Group in Cork, Louisburg Community Development Group, Ballymun Community Development Group, Coolock Parents Alone Centre, Dublin South Inner City Community Development Association and South West Wexford Development Group.  The Minister for Social Welfare will make the necessary arrangements to allocate these funds.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Simon Community</i>
    </P>
    <P>£50,000 of the balance is being provided as a once-off grant to the Simon Community.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Child Abuse Prevention Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The remaining £25,000 is being allocated for a child abuse prevention programme. This very worth-while programme is being developed on a pilot basis by staff of the Eastern Health Board in a number of primary schools in the Dublin area.  The pilot programme has the support of all of the main parties <Col N="184" /> involved in the primary school sector and this special grant will enable the pilot phase of the scheme to be finalised.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of the entire social measures will be £78.6 million in 1990 and £181.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special Equal Treatment Payments</i>
    </P>
    <P>The special equal treatment payments, introduced originally in 1986, will be continued in 1990.  As in previous years, they will be reduced in amount, in the context of the general budget increases in social welfare rates, in such a way as to ensure that recipients of the special payments do not suffer a reduction in their overall benefit level.  The 1990 Estimates have already provided for this.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Services for the Mentally Handicapped</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government also will provide an additional sum of £2 million in the current year towards the further development of services for people with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>The first priority will be to cater for persons in urgent need who have either no services at all at present or a completely inadequate one.  A particularly serious situation exists in the Dublin area and it is hoped that the additional funds now being made available will have a definite impact on services in the Eastern Health Board area.  Money will also be made available to meet specific priority needs identified in other health board areas.</P>
    <P>These extra resources will relieve the anxiety of many hard pressed families, and it is the intention of the Government to continue their commitment to these services in future years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dental Services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have decided to make a further £3 million available to the health board dental services in order to further improve services for eligible adults and to treat further top priority orthodontic cases.  This follows the additional provision of £300,000 made in 1989 to begin treatment of priority cases.</P>
    <P>The health boards will be given a degree of autonomy, subject to agreed targets, with regard to the arrangements they make to improve the services, both <Col N="185" /> the adult service and the orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>The health provisions I have listed for the elderly, the handicapped and dental services amount in all to an additional £10 million provision for health services in 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Schools in Disadvantaged Areas</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are conscious of the difficulties faced by primary schools in disadvantaged areas and we have decided to treble the allocation for the fund for disadvantaged schools from £0.5 million to £1.5 million.  The Minister for Education will shortly announce details of the extra measures to be implemented under this scheme.  This increase of £1 million is additional to the 125 extra teaching posts for these schools which were announced recently.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Adult Literacy</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am increasing the allocation for adult literacy from £0.5 million to £1 million, in recognition of the fact that 1990 is adult literacy year.  Activities to be funded from this increased allocation will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Voluntary Housing</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am allocating an additional £1.3 million for developments by voluntary housing associations.  This is in recognition of the valuable contribution these associations make in housing the homeless and others of the less fortunate in our community. In particular, £120,000 of this will be used to provide communal facilities for the Stanhope Street housing project in Dublin.  This brings the total allocation for voluntary housing to £9.275 million in 1990, an increase of 41 per cent over the 1989 provisional outturn.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax: Low-Paid</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am continuing this year with the process which I began in 1989 of seeking greater integration between the social welfare and tax systems in tackling the problems of people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Last year I announced important changes in the income tax exemption limits and the introduction of a child <Col N="186" /> addition in conjunction with those limits. These measures were specifically designed to help taxpayers with low incomes, especially those with family responsibilities.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to make further improvements in the exemption limits in order to provide targeted help for the special needs of part-time and lower-paid workers and their families.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has also called for increases in these limits.</P>
    <P>The changes I am now making are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the general exemption limits are being increased from £6,000 to £6,500 for a married couple and from £3,000 to £3,250 for a single person;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the special child addition which I introduced last year is being increased from £200 to £300;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the age exemption limits are being increased, from £3,400 to £3,750 for single persons aged 65 years or over and from £4,000 to £4,350 for single persons aged 75 years or over.  These limits will be doubled, to £7,500 and £8,700 respectively, for married couples;</P>
    <P>&mdash;I am also reducing the marginal relief rate, currently 60 per cent, which applies where income does not greatly exceed the exemption limits.  The new rate will be the same as the new top rate of tax, which I will be announcing later in my speech.</P>
    <P>The increase in the general exemption limits and the child addition, which will benefit farmers, small shopkeepers and the self-employed generally as well as the PAYE sector, will mark the second year in succession in which I have significantly improved the tax treatment of low-paid married couples with children.  The increases over the two budgets have been very substantial.  For example, in 1988, the general exemption limit for a married couple with two children was £5,500; it <Col N="187" /> will now be £7,100, an increase of nearly 30 per cent.  For a married couple with four children, the increase will be to £7,700 or 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of this package of measures should be to exempt an estimated 31,000 taxpayers with 58,000 children from tax altogether, while a further 65,000 taxpayers with 123,000 children should benefit from marginal relief.  I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to undertake publicity measures to bring home to those concerned the availabilty of these concessions.  The Commissioners will enclose an information leaflet, incorporating a short application form, with the tax-free allowance certificates which will be issued to low-paid taxpayers over the coming weeks.  The leaflet will also alert such taxpayers to the family income supplement scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare and will indicate how to obtain details of that scheme.</P>
    <P>Following are some examples of what these tax changes will mean for different categories of taxpayers:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a married couple on PAYE with two children and an income of £7,100 will have their current tax liability of up to £420 eliminated;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a married couple with four children and an income of £7,700 will have their current liability of up to £540 eliminated.</P>
    <P>These tax measures will cost £14.2 million in 1990 and £23.7 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employee PRSI Exemption Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government recognise that those persons on very low incomes who are outside the tax net have not benefited from the major reductions in the tax burden introduced in recent years.  In this budget I am introducing a new scheme whereby employees on the lowest earnings will be relieved of PRSI.</P>
    <P>While operational details of the scheme will be announced later by the Minister for Social Welfare, the essential features of the scheme will be along the <Col N="188" /> following lines.  The scheme will operate on a weekly basis and take effect as from 6 April 1990.  Employees whose gross earnings are £60 or below in a week will be exempt from employee social insurance in respect of that week.  The maximum relief will be £3.30 per week for each employee.  Employers' contributions will continue to be payable. The exemption from employee contribution will not affect the entitlement to social insurance benefits of those employees involved.</P>
    <P>I estimate that well over 50,000 employees could benefit from this scheme.  The cost in a full year in terms of PRSI foregone will be up to £11 million depending on the numbers of employees who actually qualify.  I am allowing £8 million for the cost in 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Inter-Departmental PRSI Study</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government intend to carry out this year a detailed inter-departmental study of the operation of the whole PRSI system.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Welfare of Emigrants Abroad</i>
    </P>
    <P>Some Irish emigrants need advice and assistance in finding work and accommodation abroad, particularly in the large urban areas.  Through the DION committee, which operates under the aegis of the Minister for Labour, the Government already support a wide range of organisations working to help Irish emigrants in the United Kingdom. The Government have already provided £0.5 million for this purpose in the Abridged Estimates.  The welfare of Irish emigrants in the United States is also of concern to us and accordingly I am providing £200,000 to support groups in the United States dealing with the welfare of Irish emigrants.  The assistance will be channelled through the Irish consulates in the United States, working in consultation with the emigrant working committees.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Total Welfare Provision</i>
    </P>
    <P>This brings the total amount of money being devoted to welfare, the elderly and the disadvantaged to £114 million in 1990. <Col N="189" /> The full year cost of these measures is almost £235 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment Initiatives</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Expansion of Social Employment Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>The long-term unemployed have benefited from the general improvement in employment.  In fact, the latest available figures show a faster reduction in the number of long-term unemployed people on the Live Register than for the shorter duration groups.  However, in October 1989, there were still over 100,000 on the register who had been unemployed for 12 months or more.  The Government are determined that the improvement in job prospects for the unemployed, and for the long-term unemployed in particular, will be reinforced.  Accordingly, we have decided that the social employment scheme run by FÁS, which provides part-time work on community projects for the long-term unemployed, should be expanded to cater for an additional 5,000 people.  By the end of 1990, the scheme will be providing around 15,000 places. The additional cost to the Exchequer will be £10 million this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Employment Training Scheme &mdash; Pilot Basis</i>
    </P>
    <P>Through the consultative mechanism provided by the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the CII and FIE have recently made proposals for a new employment training scheme.  The new scheme would offer participants actual work experience, as well as a substantial element of general skill training.  The Government consider that an approach of this kind could be a valuable addition to the FÁS training programme.  Provision is being made in the FÁS budget to run a scheme of this type for up to 1,000 people on a pilot basis in 1990.  It is estimated that the cost to the Exchequer in 1990 will be £1 million.</P>
    <P>These new schemes complement the employment measures taken by the Government last September, including the exemption in the 1990-91 tax year from employers' PRSI contribution in respect of any new employees taken on <Col N="190" /> between 23 October 1989 and 28 February 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Education</i>
    </P>
    <P>I will turn now to the area of general education.  I am pleased to be able to announce some significant improvements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capitation Grants</i>
    </P>
    <P>The capitation grant payable to primary schools is being increased by £1.50 or 5.7 per cent per pupil on top of the increase of £2.50 given last year.  The cost will be £0.9 million a year.  This is in addition to the extra £1 million that I have announced for disadvantaged schools.  The capitation grant payable to secondary schools has not been increased since 1986 and I am increasing the grant by £10 per pupil from £140 to £150.  The cost will be £2.1 million a year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increase in Third Level Intake</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have accepted the recommendations of a report prepared recently by a working party of officials and university representatives.  The universities have agreed to increase their intake of students by 1,200 per annum from next October.  Over a period of three to four years, this will result in an increase of about 3,600 student places, or 10 per cent, in the universities.  To enable them to undertake this expansion, I am providing an additional £4 million in capital for the colleges in 1990, £1 million for equipment and £3 million for minor capital works.  In addition, I am increasing the current grant to the colleges by £300,000 to help defray the recurrent costs of this welcome initiative.  The working party recommended, and the Government accept, that a special initiative to strengthen the science and technology and research capability of the universities is very desirable.  I am providing £350,000 in 1990 for this purpose. We will continue to seek out private sector support for third-level education.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tourism</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have laid great emphasis on the development of tourism. The results of the last few years, in terms <Col N="191" /> of tourist numbers and revenue, have been most encouraging.  In order to maintain this momentum the Government are increasing the provision for Bord Fáilte promotional activities by £2 million, conditional on matching funding from the industry.  In addition, a total amount of £1 million is being provided to Bord Fáilte to meet expenses in connection with Ireland's participation in EXPO 90 in Japan.  This includes £300,000 already provided in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>This year the EC Structural Funds will assist in raising investment in tourism to much higher levels.  The new tourism facilities and products which will be provided will help ensure that our tourism industry builds on its past successes and goes on to make an even greater contribution to the economy and to employment in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cork Ferry</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have already decided to make up to £1 million available to Swansea-Cork Ferries Limited to enable the company to provide a summer service in 1990.  The payment will take the form of a grant of £500,000 and a repayable loan of £500,000 and the cost is already reflected in the adjustment to non-capital supply services to which I referred earlier. This should benefit tourism development in the South-West region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The storms in December 1989 caused severe damage to the coast, harbours and boats on the south-eastern seaboard.  I am, as an exceptional measure, providing an extra £950,000 to the Department of the Marine to enable them to give grant assistance for emergency coastal protection works in the area of the North Beach at Arklow.  The details of this grant assistance will be the subject of further consultation between <Col N="192" /> the Minister for the Marine and myself. I am also allocating an additional sum of £100,000 to BIM to provide assistance towards repairing and replacing boats damaged in the same storms at Kilmore Quay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have given careful consideration to the needs of the horse racing and greyhound racing industries, in the light of the various submissions received.  These industries have a long and important tradition in Irish life, and their further development ment is a necessary adjunct to the well-being of the bloodstock breeding industry and to the growth of tourism.</P>
      <P>I intend, therefore, to devote a proportion of the revenue from off-course betting to the development of these industries.  A sum of £3.5 million will be provided in 1990, broadly equivalent to the proceeds of 1½ percentage points of the 10 per cent duty on off-course betting. These funds are intended to allow the Racing Board and Bord na gCon to accelerate their investment programmes at courses and to enhance generally the attractiveness of, and incentives for, racing.  The amount of the grant to be made to each body from this provision will be settled later.  Payment of the grant in each case will be subject to conditions, and will be contingent in particular on satisfactory proposals for the use of the funds to be provided being submitted to the Government for approval.  I intend to make similar arrangements each year for the next three years and to review the position again at that stage.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Grants for Agricultural Students</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trainees on Teagasc courses at agricultural colleges receive less favourable treatment than trainees on vocational courses assisted by the European Social <Col N="193" /> Fund.  Given that agricultural trainees can readily obtain jobs on completion of their training, the Government have decided to pay the cost of fees for residential trainees so as to remove the anomaly that exists and to encourage more young people to undertake full-time training courses in agricultural colleges. The cost will be about £1.7 million annually, of which £1.1 million will be obtained from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Environment Action Plan</i>
    </P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Minister for the Environment announced the details of the National Environment Action Plan.  This plan sets out the action the Government are taking to protect and enhance Ireland's natural environment and to improve the quality of life.  I am providing an additional £20.1 million to meet the costs of this plan in 1990, of which £13.6 million relates to expenditure, and £6.5 million relates to a taxation measure with which I will deal with later.  Of the £13.6 million, £5.65 million is in respect of current expenditure, and £7.95 million relates to capital expenditure, details of which have already been published by the Minister for the Environment.  A list of the provisions involved are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI Contributions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The current rates of PRSI contribution for employees will continue to apply for the contribution year 1990-1991.  As already provided for in legislation, the contribution rate for self-employed contributors will rise from 4 per cent to 5 per cent in 1990-91.  For 1990-91 the earnings ceiling for contributions will increase from £16,700 to £17,300 for employees and self-employed and from £18,000 to £18,600 for employers.  The income ceiling for the health contribution will be increased from £16,000 to £16,700.  The Minister for Health intends to announce an increase in the income limits for a Hospital Services Card at a later date.  With the amalgamation of the Social Insurance Fund, Occupational <Col N="194" /> Injuries Fund and Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund, already announced on publication of the 1990 Estimates, the total PRSI contribution for employers will remain at 12.2 per cent for 1990-91.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Trade Union Rationalisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Our strike record in 1989 has been the best since this State was founded.  It is vitally important in terms of investment that we do everything possible to ensure that this continues.  The Industrial Relations Bill, 1989 which has been introduced in the Dáil proposes fundamental changes in industrial relations law as well as procedures and practices.  An important element in Government policy is the encouragement of further trade union rationalisation.  The number of unions has gone down, from 95 in 1970 to 69 today.  From 1 January this year, in an historic merger, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the Federated Workers Union of Ireland ceased to exist and the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, later known as SIPTU, came into existence. In accordance with the Government's scheme to encourage trade union amalgamations, a grant of up to £1.27 million is being provided for in 1990 in respect of costs arising from this amalgamation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>In last year's Budget Statement I expressed the Government's concern at the build-up of special pay increases in the public service, and announced my intention to invite the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to meet me to discuss this whole issue with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable solution.  I met ICTU on 8 March 1989, and this was the first of many meetings out of which emerged a package which set out an agreed basis for the phased implementation of special increases over the years 1989 to 1992.</P>
    <P>I am allocating an additional £50 million in a Vote for increases in remuneration and pensions in respect of the cost in 1990 of special improvements in pay and conditions which have not already been provided for in Departmental <Col N="195" /> Estimates.  The effect of this, and other adjustments to certain pay allocations which underpinned the published Abridged Estimates Volume, is to increase the Exchequer pay and pensions bill for 1990 from £3,048 million, as published last November, to £3,096 million. This is a sizeable sum in both absolute and relative terms.  It is our single largest overhead cost.  I would stress once more the need to maintain strict control in relation to it.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Hours</i>
    </P>
    <P>I also referred last year to national discussions which were then in progress, as provided for in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> on a reduction in working hours for employees who work 40 hours or more.  These discussions resulted in the conclusion of a framework agreement which affects large numbers of public service employees, entailing substantial costs for the Exchequer.  In accordance with the terms of the framework agreement, local discussions on the reduction in hours are under way throughout the public service.  These discussions cover all aspects of the change in hours, including the possibility of securing savings to offset some of the costs.  On the assumption that agreement will be reached on these matters, I expect the reduction to be implemented later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI for Public Servants</i>
    </P>
    <P>In the 1989 budget also, I announced the Government's decision to extend the social insurance cover of public sector employees currently on modified PRSI rates, and my intention to raise the matter with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in accordance with the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, and I have commenced those discussions on this matter with the interests concerned. Although the issues involved are necessarily complex, we hope to arrive at a mutually satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" />
      <i>Present Policy on Numbers</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a result of the restrictions on recruitment to the public service which have been in force since the 1987 budget, combined with the offer of voluntary redundancy or early retirement to public servants, the number employed in the public service &mdash; including the local authorities &mdash; has fallen by about 20,000 from 1987 levels to its present level of approximately 196,000.  In the coming year the emphasis will be on consolidating the reductions in staff numbers which have already been achieved, and seeking greater economies through improved efficiency and better management.  In areas of particular need, recruitment may be permitted to fill key vacancies, but only with the approval of the Minister responsible for the area and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Civil Service Numbers</i>
    </P>
    <P>There has been a reduction in civil service numbers from over 32,000 serving in 1981 to the present more sustainable and affordable figure in the region of 27,000.  There will, as I have said, be limited scope for the filling of some of the vacancies arising this year where it can be clearly demonstrated that this will lead to tangible, immediate and continuing net benefits to the Exchequer.  In addition, the scope of the career break schemes has been extended and future vacancies arising under these schemes can be filled where this is required by the needs of the work.  These elements should generate significant employment opportunities. Any recruitment will, of course, be at much more junior levels than those at which persons took early retirement, so there is not, and will not be, any question of replacement of staff who were paid enhanced terms to leave the service. There can be no question of undermining the savings already achieved &mdash; many at considerable initial expense under the early retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to this limited recruitment, there will be continuing efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public services so as to ensure that the <Col N="197" /> taxpayer gets the best possible value for money.</P>
    <P>In this context, there will be an increasing need for better management information to improve decision-making and the quality of service to the public.  The widespread application of information technology has a central role in the process and will require continuing significant investment by the Government. This is reflected in the provisions totalling £35 million in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Redundancy Package</i>
    </P>
    <P>Over the period 1987 to 1989 a total of approximately 9,600 people left the public service under the voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.  The terms will be available in 1990 on a very restricted basis, namely, only to staff who have been identified as surplus to requirements; £5 million has already been provided for this purpose in the Estimates and the numbers involved will not be large.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Management Initiatives</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year in my Budget Statement I said I was examining the possibility of fixing administrative budgets on a three-year cycle at a level which would involve a real reduction in funding each year because of greater efficiency but which would allow managers to manage with greater flexibility within their budgets.</P>
    <P>Much useful work has gone into advancing this project over the past year. Considerable progress has been made in working out the practical changes necessary in discussions between my Department and the line Departments chosen to take the lead in this initiative &mdash; the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Energy.  I expect to conclude formal agreements shortly with the two Ministers and with the Revenue Commissioners.  These will cover the details of the flexibility being allowed and the size of their three-year administrative budgets.  The process of extending the new arrangements to other Departments has already commenced and I anticipate that the new system will be operating <Col N="198" /> throughout the Civil Service within a relatively short time.</P>
    <P>Realisation of the full benefits of this initiative now depends on the capacity of Departments, and in particular their top managers, to take on board the best management practices as applied by business and to adapt these as necessary to achieve the more efficient delivery of public services. These changes must, of course, be brought about against a background where the need for further reductions in the overall cost of public service administration remains.  It would be foolish to imagine that it is possible to have the greater freedom associated with delegated administrative budgets without the discipline associated with a commitment to a three-year cycle within which real reductions must be achieved. I wish to take this opportunity to stress that I am seeking such reductions in the cost of running the Civil Service and that I am determined that Departments will achieve worth while efficiency gains over the period 1990-92.  The provisions for Civil Service running costs incorporated in the 1990 Estimates are quite adequate, and I expect these to fall in real terms in 1991 and 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Post-Budget Position on Non-Capital Supply Services and Capital Expenditure</i>
    </P>
    <P>The net result of the changes and initiatives I have just announced is to add £170 million to non-capital supply services in 1990, bringing the total to £5,722 million, and to add almost £18 million to the opening Public Capital Programme bringing it to £1,666 million.  Details of the adjustments to the allocations for individual Votes as published in the Abridged Estimates Volume, and to the Summary Public Capital Programme, are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Programme Outlays</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have already included in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure a provision of £25 million in 1990 for non-programme outlays.  As in previous years this allocation will allow the Government to meet the essential financial restructuring costs of State-sponsored bodies, <Col N="199" /> if these are required, along with other miscellaneous capital payments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sale of State Assets</i>
    </P>
    <P>There has been significant growth in recent years in the proceeds of the sale of State assets.  These sales have been carried out in pursuance of the Government's view that it is not in the best interests of the State &mdash; any more than it would be for a business &mdash; to continue to hold assets which are not providing an adequate return, in particular when the national debt and debt-service cost are so large.  I have, therefore, made a prudent provision in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure for a further increase in such sales in the current year.  This is the first phase of a new five-year programme of such sales so as to help to reduce the national debt.</P>
    <P>TAXATION</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Revenue Opening Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The current tax revenue projection, as shown in the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure, is £7,870 million.  This projection takes account of the broadening of the tax base which has occurred over the last two years, reflecting the measures taken to improve collection and increase fairness in the system.  I must, however, allow for some once-off cash flow gain in 1989 resulting from the speedier tax payments to which I referred earlier.  The revenue will not be available to me in 1990.</P>
    <P>Before outlining this year's measures, I would like to point to a fact that is sometimes forgotten.  The Exchequer cost of tax concessions does not arise only in the year in which they are given.  The full-year cost is greater than that of the initial year the additional cost of income tax concessions given in last year's budget is £80 million, which has to be met along with the net cost of the tax changes which I am about to outline.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Overall Thrust of Tax Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made <Col N="200" /> in the past couple of years in the restructuring and reform of the tax system.  Last year I was able to begin the process of reducing our excessive rates of personal taxation which are an obstacle to initiative and to job creation.  Last year's standard rate reduction from 35 to 32 per cent was the first such reduction in 20 years.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government commits us to continuing this process by reducing the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent by 1993 and by moving towards a single higher rate of tax.  To meet part of the cost there must be a further broadening of the tax base.  As I said earlier, we must also begin the process of adapting our tax system to the needs of the EC internal market.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, today announcing a significant and balanced package of reform measures affecting income tax, indirect taxes and corporation tax, as well as other tax areas.  The package has been formulated so as to ensure the continuation of a healthy balance of payments position and its objectives are fully in line with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Programme for Government.  These objectives are: to give substantial further tax relief to workers, so as to underpin the pay moderation provisions enshrined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the related agreements on pay; to support the overall efforts of the Government to reduce inflation in the economy; and generally, to continue the process of improving the tax system so as to make it work in favour of an increase in jobs. Tax reform is a complex task requiring a balanced approach.  The solutions are not always simple.  Very often simplicity is the enemy of equity.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Tax: General</i>
    </P>
    <P>I turn first to income tax.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> contains a commitment by Government to introduce income tax reductions to the cumulative value of £225 million over the period of the programme, including increases in the PAYE allowance costing £70 million, and in the context of this provision to make significant progress <Col N="201" /> towards having two-thirds of taxpayers on the standard rate.  These commitments have already been more than fulfilled. The cumulative cost of income tax reliefs introduced since 1987, at over £700 million, is more than three times the £225 million commitment in the programme. On the same basis, the cost of the £100 increase in the PAYE allowance in 1988 is over £90 million, compared with the programme commitment of £70 million. The percentage of taxpayers paying tax at no more than the standard rate in the current tax year, at about 63 per cent, is a significant improvement on the figure of less than 56 per cent in the 1987-88 tax year.  In addition, the standard rate itself has been reduced to 32 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I have said the Government recognise that, notwithstanding these substantial improvements, more needs to be done.  I propose, then, to continue the process of reducing income tax rates by making the following changes: I am again reducing the standard rate of tax.  The new standard rate will be 30 per cent. This reduced rate will, of course, also apply to the withholding tax on professional fees and to the deposit interest retention tax; The standard rate tax band is being widened from £12,200 to £13,000 for a married couple and from £6,000 to £6,500 for a single person; The 56 per cent rate is being reduced to 53 per cent. In view of the Government's objective of moving towards a single higher rate I have left the 48 per cent rate unchanged. Persons on this rate will, of course, benefit from the further substantial reduction in the standard rate and the widening of the standard rate band.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples of what the changes will mean for different categories of taxpayers: a single person on PAYE with an income of £10,000 will gain up to £194; a married couple with an income of £16,000 will gain up to £216; a married couple with an income of £20,000 will gain up to £388.  Further details of the income tax changes, showing their effect on different income categories, are contained in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i></P>
    <P>These measures are expensive and I <Col N="202" /> have looked to specific reliefs in the income tax code for a contribution to their cost.  I am, however, making only one change.  The tax relief on life insurance permiums is estimated to cost over £35 million in the coming tax year, despite last year's curtailment of the relief to 80 per cent of its previous level. It is also a cause of distortion in financial investment.  I propose, therefore, to reduce the figure of 80 per cent further, down to 50 per cent, in respect of premiums paid on or after 6 April next. Taking account of this restriction, the total cost of the income tax measures which I have just announced is estimated at £106.2 million in 1990 and £177 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I should add that the PRSI is being renewed, at an estimated cost of £51 million.</P>
    <P>This package of income tax reliefs will have a substantial impact.  All taxpayers will benefit.  There will be a particular benefit to lower-paid taxpayers with families from the measures I announced earlier. The percentage of taxpayers on the standard rate will be maintained at 63 per cent.  Most important of all, the marginal tax rate faced by some 700,000 taxpayers will fall: this is the second year in a row in which the Government have cut marginal tax rates for the majority of taxpayers. The package marks our determination to force down tax rates and reduce the burden of income tax.  It also marks our commitment to the <i>Programme for National Recovery:</i> on a cumulative basis, it means that the cost of income tax relief introduced in the three budgets covered by the programme will be well over £800 million, as compared with the £225 million commitment contained in the programme.  The package also represents a substantial step toward achievement of the income tax targets set out in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Take-Home Pay Aspects</i>
    </P>
    <P>The personal tax concessions which I have announced will ensure that the take-home pay of the generality of workers in receipt of the basic terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will more <Col N="203" /> than keep pace with expected inflation this year.  Moreover, there will be substantial increases in disposable income for lower-paid workers with families, mirroring the special recognition of their circumstances in the pay agreements.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this budget mean that workers can look forward to a further improvement in their living standards in the coming year while, at the same time, pay increases will remain moderate, thus protecting competitiveness and employment. This comes on top of the significant gains they have already made over the past couple of years, through the combination of tax reliefs, realistic pay settlements and low inflation.  I am sure there will be widespread agreement that, besides increasing employment, the Government are doing what they can to ensure the wage and salary earners generally share in the benefits of the progress made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>Indirect Taxation and 1992</i>
    </P>
    <P>In determining my approach towards indirect taxation I have, of course, to bear in mind the continuing discussions at EC level on the harmonisation proposals which are an integral part of the process of completing the internal market of the Community.</P>
    <P>Progress in the discussions is slow, but this is hardly surprising given that the issues involved in tax harmonisation are extremely sensitive for many member states, including ourselves.  There have, nevertheless, been a number of significant advances during the past year.</P>
    <P>Decisions taken at last month's Council meeting of Economic and Finance Ministers yielded a consensus on an outline framework for VAT rates.  It was agreed that member states whose standard rate already falls within the range 14-20 per cent will not move out of that range between now and 1 January 1993. Member states whose standard rate is outside that range have agreed not to diverge further.  Essentially, these decisions formally enshrine the concept of convergence.  Deadlines were also set <Col N="204" /> for further decisions on the format and level of the proposed standard rate, on the scope and levels of the reduced rates and on the products which will continue to be zero-rated, from 1 January 1993. Clearly, therefore, while much remains to be debated and decided, the post-1992 position as far as VAT is concerned is beginning to take some shape.</P>
    <P>By contrast, little detailed discussions have yet been held at Council level on the revised Commission proposals on excise duties and we are still a long way from decisions on a new Community-wide regime.  During our Presidency, I am taking initiatives to make progress in this area as well as in regard to other aspects of indirect tax harmonisation.</P>
    <P>Another significant development is the recognition which has been given at Community level to the potential budgetary difficulties posed for Ireland by the harmonisation proposals.  Deputies will be aware that, on the basis of certain reasonable assumptions, the Irish Exchequer could incur unsustainable revenue losses of the order of 3 per cent of GNP.  During the past year of EC discussions, I made it clear, repeatedly, that while we were strongly in favour of the completion of the internal market, including the tax harmonisation dimension, and while we wished to avoid long-term derogations, our budgetary difficulties with the proposals needed to be recognised and addressed.  I am pleased to be able to tell the House that, at the December ECO/FIN Council, a declaration relating to Ireland was recorded whereby the Commission will study and bring forward measures to deal with our difficulties. I understand that this study is getting underway and I hope it will provide the basis for Ireland's effective participation in the process of completing the internal market.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VAT</i>
    </P>
    <P>As an indication of our commitment to this process, I propose today to make a number of changes to the VAT regime consistent with the emerging 1992 framework and with the Government's desire to point clearly towards lower inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" />
      <i>Standard Rate</i>
    </P>
    <P>The standard rate of VAT is currently 25 per cent and its importance in overall fiscal terms is reflected in the fact that it accounts for almost three-quarters of our VAT revenue.  It is self-evident that a sizeable reduction in this rate, in the context of EC approximation, will prove extremely costly.  I propose today, however, to initiate this process of convergence by reducing the standard rate from 1 March next by 2 percentage points to 23 per cent.  This will cost some £76 million in 1990 and an estimated £125 million in a full year.  The reduction will lower the prices of a wide range of consumer goods.  I have asked my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce to monitor the situation so as to ensure that the benefit is passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VAT on Electricity</i>
    </P>
    <P>With the exception of electricity, which attracts VAT at the 5 per cent rate, all other fuels used domestically for heating and lighting are 10 per cent rated.  I propose, therefore, to raise the VAT rate on electricity to 10 per cent.  This will take effect on 1 March next and will yield £11 million in 1990 and £18 million in a full year.</P>

    <P>Since the inception of the VAT system, the telephone service has been exempt <Col N="206" /> from the tax.  In recent years, Bord Telecom Éireann has made rapid progress in achieving profitability and, in this light, it is considered that the VAT exemption is no longer appropriate.  Taxation of this service would also bring us into line with the majority of our European partners. Accordingly, I propose to levy VAT at 10 per cent on telephone and related services provided by BTE with effect from 1 July next.  Allowing for the fact that BTE will now be able to reclaim VAT on its inputs, the charge will yield a net £3 million to the Exchequer in 1990 and £11 million in a full year.  I am confident that this initiative can be implemented without increased costs to telephone users&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>Excise Duties</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last three budgets the Government have adopted a restrained approach in the application of duty increases to excisable goods.  Such increases as there have been were applied on a minimal basis.  This has made a significant contribution to the holding down of prices. The proportion of tax contained in the final price of many excisable goods has <Col N="207" /> actually fallen as a consequence.  I propose to continue this policy of restraint this year by not taxing the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I will be looking to the trade interests involved to match this restraint, since otherwise the effect of the Government's measures could be nullified.</P>
      <P>While, as I have said, no agreement has yet been reached in EC discussions on excises, I am beginning the process of adjusting some of our less important excise duties to accord with the pattern of harmonisation likely to emerge from the EC discussions.  These measures will also help in the efforts to combat smuggling from across the border.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Table Waters</i>
      </P>
      <P>The soft drinks industry is an important part of our food processing industry and table waters are also a useful source of revenue to the Exchequer.  The yield from this source in 1989 was £19.7 million. There is, however, no excise duty on table waters in Britain and this leads to problems of competition from across the Border.  In the EC context, the future of this particular duty will depend on the extent to which it creates problems for controlling trade across frontiers.  With these considerations in mind I have decided to reduce the excise duty on table waters by 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Televisions</i>
      </P>
      <P>I propose a number of changes in the excise duty payable on televisions.  Firstly, I have decided to abolish duty on black and white televisions.  I have also decided to abolish duty on colour televisions with screens up to 17 inches.  Duty on larger televisions will be reduced, from £49 to £30 on sets with screens between 17 and 24 inches, and from £60.05 to £45 on sets over 24 inches.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Videos and Camcorders</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have decided to reduce the duty on videos and camcorders by 50 per cent. <Col N="208" /> These changes respond to many representations I have received from trade interests and representatives of Border regions and I hope that there will be a beneficial effect in increased trade south of the Border as well as some offset to the Exchequer cost as a result of the curbing of illegal imports.</P>
    <P>I am also making further excise changes as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Gramophone Records</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present, excise duty is payable on gramophone records and compact discs but not on pre-recorded cassettes.  The total amount collected in 1989 was £1 million.  In order to help the music industry generally, which is labour-intensive, and to clear up the anomaly to which I referred, I have decided to abolish excise duty on records and CDs.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Matches and Lighters</i>
    </P>
    <P>The yield from excise duty on matches and lighters has been steadily declining in recent years.  There is widespread evasion of duty in the case of mechanical lighters. This evasion is unfair to legitimate traders.  Better enforcement would be costly relative to the yield in duty.  For this reason, I have decided to abolish duty on matches and mechanical lighters.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Lead-Free Petrol</i>
    </P>
    <P>Lead-free petrol has received favourable treatment in the last two budgets. The excise duty is currently set so as to allow it be sold at 5p per gallon cheaper than leaded petrol.  This year, as part of the Government's Environment Action Plan, I have decided to widen this price differential to 10p per gallon by reducing the tax on lead-free petrol by 5p.  This move should provide the incentive for many more motorists to use lead-free petrol.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Auto-Liquid Petroleum Gas</i>
    </P>
    <P>Another environmentally friendly alternative to standard leaded petrol is auto-liquid petroleum gas.  The consumption of auto-LPG has fallen from a high of 8.5 million gallons in 1983 to only 2.5 million gallons in 1989.  Some service <Col N="209" /> stations have ceased stocking auto-LPG. In order to ensure the continued use of this fuel, I have decided to reduce the excise duty on auto-LPG by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>All of the excise changes I have mentioned will take effect from midnight tonight.</P>
    <P>The cost of these excise measures, including the reduction on lead-free petrol, is estimated at £16 million in 1990, and £20 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>A significant feature of the reduction of indirect taxes is their favourable effect on inflation.  The changes in VAT and excises which I have announced will, in the overall, have a downward effect on inflation of 0.7 per cent.  This will be of considerable assistance in our efforts to moderate costs generally in the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The yield from corporation tax in 1989 was £303 million or 4 per cent of total tax revenue.  This yield is still very low by international standards.  Some improvement in the yield will result from the reforms introduced in the corporation tax system in the last two years.  The ending of export sales relief and the Shannon tax exemption scheme on 5 April next will also produce increased revenue from the corporate sector, though the full effect on the yield is not expected to materialise until 1992.  I am, accordingly, now introducing a number of other measures which will increase the corporation tax yield and will continue the process of corporation tax reform begun in 1988.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that I would review for the 1990 budget the position in regard to accelerated capital allowances and the standard rate of corporation tax. These accelerated capital allowances for plant, machinery and industrial buildings were reduced in the last two years from 100 per cent to 50 per cent.  The 50 per cent regime is guaranteed by legislation until 31 March 1991.</P>
    <P>As a result of this review, I have decided to reduce these accelerated allowances from 50 per cent to 25 per cent from 1 April 1991 and from 25 per cent to nil from 1 April 1992.  The standard rate of corporation tax will at the <Col N="210" /> same time be reduced with effect from 1 April 1991 from 43 per cent to 40 per cent, a reduction which is in line with international trends.  These measures will further the process of creating a broaderbased corporation tax system with a lower standard rate.  The lower rate will be helpful in particular to the services sector of the economy which is such an important source of job creation.  The elimination of 100 per cent accelerated capital allowances will remove the bias in favour of capital intensity rather than employment.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the changes will result in a net yield to the Exchequer of about £45 million a year on average for the period 1992 to 1995, declining somewhat after that.  The tax rate reduction will mean that the gap between the standard corporation tax rate and the special 10 per cent rate for manufacturing will have been narrowed from 40 per cent to 30 per cent since 1988.  As already mentioned, the ending of export sales relief and the Shannon tax exemption scheme will also produce increased revenue in future years.</P>
    <P>I should say that I am concerned about the fact that the 10 per cent rate now applies to a wider range of activities than was originally intended, as a result of decisions by the courts in particular cases. As I indicated recently, I am having the implications of these decisions examined.</P>
    <P>The normal annual wear and tear capital allowances will, of course, continue to be available in all cases.  The reduction in accelerated capital allowances will not apply to qualifying service companies in the International Financial Services Centre and in Shannon customs-free airport.</P>
    <P>The reduction will not apply either to the special building incentives for areas designated for urban renewal.  I have decided also, as a further impetus to the development of these areas, to extend the time limit for the designated areas incentive package to 31 May 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of Financial Institutions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Measures were introduced in the 1989 Finance Act to limit the cost to the <Col N="211" /> Exchequer of domestic-sourced section 84 loans.  The net cost of these loans has greatly increased in recent years, mainly because of a big increase in the volume of such loans and because a much greater proportion of the total is now accounted for by special high interest-rate loans which are more costly to the Exchequer than normal Irish-pound loans.  I have decided therefore to continue the process of reducing the cost of these loans by lowering the loan volume ceiling introduced last year.  This ceiling was fixed in the 1989 Finance Act at 110 per cent of each lender's loan volume as of 12 April 1989.  From today this ceiling will be lowered for new lending from 110 per cent to 75 per cent.  No new funds can be lent or drawn down except within the confines of the new ceiling of 75 per cent.  Further details are set out in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i>  The change will result in a significant increase in the corporation tax payments from the banking sector in 1991 and subsequent years.  Because the change will have scarcely any effect on corporation tax revenue in 1990, the bank levy, which has been at £36 million for the last two years, will be continued at this level for 1990, but I will review the position in future years in the light of the results of the measures I have taken.</P>
    <P>Within the last year, a number of new investment products have been launched on the Irish market.  Some of these products are marketed here from abroad by reference to their substantial tax advantages. In certain cases the foreign investment products can be structured so that the proceeds will be free from all corporation, income and capital gains tax liabilities both here and in the foreign country.  This involves a loss to the Exchequer and gives these products an undue advantage.</P>
    <P>In order to promote a more level playing field, I have decided to introduce two measures to help correct the position. First, the 3 per cent levy, which now applies to new life-assurance-linked investments, will be extended to new investment by Irish residents in all foreign and domestic unit trusts and similar <Col N="212" /> investment funds in the period commencing 1 February.  As in the case of life-assurance-linked investments, the levy will be collected from the unit trust and the other investment funds.  Where this is not practicable, it will be collected from intermediaries or other agents.  The charge will not apply in the case of unit trusts or other investment funds set up for charities and pension funds.  The detailed arrangements for the charge will be contained in the Finance Bill.  This new levy will be reviewed at a later date in the context of future developments towards harmonisation of the treatment of cross-Border investment flows within the EC, as well as other developments in the taxation system.</P>
    <P>Second, I am introducing with effect from 6 April next a special measure for foreign unit trusts or similar funds selling investment products to Irish investors.  If the foreign fund fails to distribute to its Irish investors each year 90 per cent of the investment income relating to these investors, the capital gains arising on the disposal by the investors of units or shares in the fund will be taxed under income tax instead of under capital gains tax.  As well as yielding revenue to the Exchequer, this measure will also remove an unfair advantage some foreign funds possess <i>vis-à-vis</i> their Irish counterparts in that the Irish fund withholds tax on all the income it receives whereas in the case of the foreign fund only the income it distributes is taxed.</P>
    <P>I should, of course, stress that none of these taxation changes affecting financial institutions will impinge on the existing taxation provisions applying in the International Financial Services Centre or in Shannon custom-free airport.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Other Tax Changes</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Farmer Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Disease Eradication and Stock Relief for Farmers</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order to assist farmers whose herds have been subject to compulsory disposals due to disease eradication measures, I have decided to extend for <Col N="213" /> such cases the period allowed for restocking before claw-back of stock relief comes into effect.  Accordingly, for disposals of diseased animals arising after 5 April next, the relevant period will be extended by a further year.  This will be of assistance where postponement of restocking is required under the statutory disease eradication schemes.  I will keep the position under review in the light of changes in those schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the present law in relation to stamp duties is highly technical and complex.  The basic legislation dates from the last century when many of the transactions which today fall within the charge to duty simply did not exist.  This is particularly true of transactions in the rapidly-developing field of financial services. Against this background, officials of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have met the Financial Services Industry Association to discuss the impact of stamp duty on financial services.  I will be bringing forward in the Finance Bill a number of measures to clarify and simplify how stamp duties are to apply to various financial services and transactions.  I will also be introducing a number of minor reliefs but the overall package of measures will be roughly revenue-neutral.  The main aim of the changes is to simplify the administration and collection of duties for the taxpayer and Revenue alike.  It is also intended to encourage the execution in Ireland of transactions which are at present being effected abroad to avoid a charge to stamp duty here.</P>
    <P>Over the years a practice has developed whereby the intending purchaser of a new house can reduce his exposure to stamp duty by entering into separate agreements for the purchase of a site and the construction of a house on it.  I am concerned at the loss of revenue which results from this practice and I propose to introduce legislation in the Finance Bill to ensure tha the full amount of duty is paid in future.  This measure is designed to counter the avoidance of duty <Col N="214" /> on the sale of houses in up-market housing estates.  It will not affect grant-type houses, which are exempt from duty.  The anticipated full-year yield from this measure will be of the order of £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>Apart from a relatively minor adjustment made in the 1988 budget the rates of stamp duty on transfers of lands and houses have not been adjusted since 1975.  At present there are 14 rates, 10 of which apply to transfers of property valued at less than £10,000.  It is clear that some updating and rationalisation of the rate structure is required.  The additional revenue generated by the above measure will be used to commence this process in 1990.  This will involve a restructuring of the rates applicable to property valued at less than £25,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Companies Capital Duty</i>
    </P>
    <P>Companies capital duty is a stamp duty payable on the issue of share capital.  It is imposed under the terms of an EC Directive.  I am conscious of the difficulties that imposition of the duty can pose for collective investment undertakings, particularly those located in the International Financial Services Centre, and the question of a concession for such bodies is being pursued with the EC.  A favourable outcome is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Residential Property Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The recent surge in the value of residential property has resulted in a significant increase in the numbers of people subject to the residential property tax. When this tax was introduced, provision was made to give relief in respect of children. This provision was, however, allowed to lapse when the income tax child allowance was abolished in 1986. The Government have decided that the residential property tax child relief should be restored.  This will cost £1 million in 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Gains Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the top rate of income tax will now be 53 per cent. Experience has shown that it is important to maintain the rates of tax on capital <Col N="215" /> gains broadly in line with those applicable to income.  I propose, therefore, to abolish the 60 per cent rate of capital gains tax which applies to disposals of assets which have been held for less than 1 year. The top rate of capital gains tax will now be 50 per cent.  This change is not expected to have a significant effect on revenue receipts.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Acquisitions Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The thresholds for capital acquisitions tax have remained unchanged since 1978. Having reviewed the position, I have decided that in future the thresholds will be adjusted each year to take account of inflation.  For 1990, based on the average annual increase in the Consumer Price Index for 1989, they will be increased by 4 per cent to £156,000, £20,800 and £10,400.  The revised thresholds will apply to all gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 1990.  The full-year cost of this measure will be of the order of £1 million.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that the tax system acts to discourage the transfer of property owned by one spouse into the joint ownership of both spouses.  I propose to address this situation by exempting gifts between spouses from capital acquisitions tax and also by exempting from stamp duty transfers of property from one spouse to the other where such transfers have the effect of creating a joint tenancy in the names of both spouses.  The full year cost of these measures will be of the order of £1 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business Expansion Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>It will be recalled that last year's Finance Act contained a number of measures aimed at curbing abuses of the business expansion scheme.  I regard this as a valuable scheme and I do not wish to see it diverted from its proper function of generating genuine venture capital for qualifying companies in the sectors of the economy to which it applies.  Concern has been expressed in a number of quarters about certain developments which have been taking place in relation to the <Col N="216" /> scheme.  I have therefore asked the Revenue Commissioners to examine these developments in the context of the existing legal framework, which I strengthened last year.  I am determined to ensure that use of the scheme is not distorted by its exploitation for purposes for which it was not intended.  It is a scheme to provide risk capital and I want to see it remain as such.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Administration and Enforcement</i>
    </P>
    <P>There has been a much more effective system of tax administration and enforcement in the past two years.  This has added greatly to revenue receipts.  While the tax amnesty played a major role in 1988, other measures &mdash; of both a policy and an administrative nature &mdash; have contributed significantly to the better compliance and increased tax yield.  Deputies can be assured that the battle against tax defaulters and evaders will be continued in 1990.  It cannot be emphasised strongly enough that those who cheat on their tax obligations only serve to increase the burden on the rest of the taxpaying community.</P>
    <P>One of the policy measures which has been very successful is the introduction of the self-assessment procedures for the self-employed.  The procedures were extended to companies from 1 October last.  These new procedures, which include a voluntary self-assessment option, have increased the tax yield from the self-employed.  They have also had beneficial administrative spin-offs for both the Revenue and complying taxpayers.</P>
    <P>In my Budget Statement last year, I indicated that the Government would like to move to a fully-fledged self-assessment system, under which self-computation of final liability would become obligatory for all taxpayers.  I also indicated that the absence of a single-year basis of assessment of all income and reliefs greatly inhibited the development of such a system, since more than one tax return is nearly always required to settle one year's liability.  A switch to a single-year basis of assessment would be a major advance because it would simplify the <Col N="217" /> system, reduce administrative costs for both taxpayers and Revenue, and, as I have said, enable us to make progress in developing the self-assessment system.</P>
    <P>The Government are, therefore, committed in principle to the introduction of a single, current-year basis of assessment for all income for tax purposes.  The major implication of this change is that the self-employed will be assessed on the profits of the accounting period ending in the current rather than in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the change have been considered by officials of both my Department and the Revenue Commissioners who had the benefit of preliminary views submitted by certain interested groups.  Further detailed discussions with these groups are required on the legislative and implementing arrangements.  These discussions will be held immediately with the objective of making provision for the necessary legislation in the 1990 Finance Bill if possible, so as to allow the introduction of the change in the 1990-91 tax year.  It is only fair that I should place on record the Government's appreciation of the commitment and co-operation received from tax accountants and advisers in relation to the changes introduced to date and I have no doubt that they will approach the discussions on the switch to a current-year basis in the same spirit.</P>
    <P>The tax forecast for 1990 takes account of this proposed change as well as other efficiency and collection measures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Post-Budget Current Revenue Position</i>
    </P>
    <P>The net cost to the Exchequer in 1990 of the taxation measures I have outlined is £221 million.  When this and the £91 million increase in tax revenue buoyancy arising from the various measures announced today are taken into account, the total post-budget tax revenue estimate comes to £7,740 million.  The total post-budget estimate for current revenue, which comprises both tax and non-tax revenue, is £8,116 million.  The non-tax revenue includes an additional payment of £5.5 million to the Exchequer by <Col N="218" /> Bord Gáis Éireann over and above the provision already included in the 1990 White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure. The most up-to-date projections now available suggest that the board's profits in 1990 will be appreciably greater than originally estimated.</P>
    <P>BUDGET TARGETS</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current Budget Deficit and Exchequer Borrowing Requirement</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Budget Targets</i>
    </P>
    <P>Following the various expenditure and tax changes which I have announced today, the estimate for the current budget deficit in 1990 is £261 million or 1.2 per cent of GNP, and that for the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement is £449 million or 2.1 per cent of GNP.  These targets consolidate last year's excellent figures of 1.3 and 2.4 per cent respectively.  This represents a major achievement given the additional costs arising this year, the special factors which boosted revenue last year and the important package of measures I have announced today which are needed to promote competitiveness, growth, employment and social equity.</P>
    <P>Exchequer borrowing has now been reduced to less than one-fifth of its 1986 level in percentage GNP terms.  As a consequence, it is, as I have pointed out earlier, at its lowest level in forty years. It is worth noting also that it is now in line with the average level of Government borrowing in the EC narrow-band EMS countries.</P>
    <P>It was against this background of rapid progress in the past two years, and of the need to develop the economy with the measures I have announced today, that the Government decided on the budgetary targets this year.  The priority is to consolidate the considerable gains achieved to date and to continue the downward pressure on borrowing and debt.  This will have the beneficial effect of ensuring the firmest possible financial foundation for the planning of the next phase of the Government's programme for economic and social development.</P>

    </P>
    <P>The economic recovery of the past three years is, let there be no doubt, the outcome of the strategy and policies set down in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  Through the existence of this clear statement of intent and, even more importantly, through the adherence to its provisions, both on the part of Government and of the other participants, all those involved &mdash; investors, business, farmers, workers and consumers &mdash; have been able to bank on a consistent and sensible set of policies being followed, with no back-tracking or deviation.  The Programme for Government confirms the Government's commitment to continue, and to develop in the light of changing circumstances, the policies which turned around the economy, and restored the growth in employment.  With the adoption of the Community Support Framework for Ireland, we are now in a position to utilise the additional resources coming from the Structural Funds to reinforce our own efforts to make the economy more competitive and to expand its capacity, particularly to create jobs.</P>
    <P>The approach of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been shown to be the right one.  A consensus approach, if it does not shrink from facing realities, can work to the benefit of us all.  As I said earlier, it is the Government's hope that when the current arrangements expire, we can evolve, in discussion with the social partners, a follow-up programme which reconciles the legitimate concerns and aspirations of the various interests with the requirements for sustained economic and social progress, particularly in terms of increased employment.  This budget makes a significant contribution to creating the right environment for future development.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>I began this Budget Statement by referring to the evidence now clearly available to us as to the correct path that we must follow.  It would be fatally easy to slip <Col N="220" /> back into the bad habits of the past &mdash; demanding lower taxes at the same time as higher public spending; expecting better public services before they can be sustained by higher growth; seeking excessive nominal pay and profit increases in the short term at the expense of longer-term competitiveness and jobs. Ultimately, that road only leads back to the higher borrowing, rising inflation, worsening competitiveness and declining employment from which we have so recently and so painfully escaped.</P>
    <P>Employment is responding to the new and better conditions which have been created.  Living standards have improved, through moderate income increases combined with the tax reductions which budgetary policy has made possible.  Real welfare increases have been possible for those who have to rely on the State.  It is essential to the future of us all that we continue with our economic strategy.  This is the only way to ensure that we will be in a position to look after, on a permanent basis, the less well-off and disadvantaged in our society.</P>
    <P>Progress on these fundamentals is made all the more necessary by developments abroad, both within the European Community and further afield.  A new and wider Europe will open up in the 1990s.  It will reflect the imagination, the initiative and the energy of the people of Europe freed from existing barriers and restraints.  The nineties will be a decade of opportunity for those with the wisdom and courage to prepare for the new conditions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, this budget advances further the Government strategy for: continuing the improvement of the public finances; consolidating the economic recovery; promoting competitiveness; generating as much self-sustaining employment as possible; continuing the process of tax reform; caring for the elderly and for those who are less well-off or disadvantaged; protecting the environment; and reinforcing the adjustments needed for 1992 and for economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The national morale was never as high. <Col N="221" /> Everybody in the country must take satisfaction from what has been achieved to date.  With the continued commitment and co-operation of all concerned, so <Col N="222" /> much more can be done.  Our prospects are good.  We can face the new decade with confidence, which is a good word on which to close.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As I was saying, this budget increases the national debt once again and leaves the country dangerously exposed to the vagrancies of national events.  It is minimalist in its approach and illustrates a conflict within the Cabinet.  There are many instances in the budget where it is clear that the only acceptable decision was one to do nothing whatsoever and, of course, that is what the Government have done about the question of PRSI.</P>
      <P>The budget has no coherent policy thrust and there are very few coherent decisions in it.  When the Minister makes decisions he is like the man who jumped on his horse and rode off in all directions at once.  It is going to be an eminently forgettable budget except for the harm it may do.  It will be remembered more for the leaks that have preceded it than for the announcements which were made today.  The Minister spoke for two hours and it was like listening to a fifth reading of a budget speech which we have read on at least four other occasions in the national press during the past fortnight and which has been freely discussed in the best hostelries in town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think a budget has been greeted in this House with less excitement. I heard a rumble in the middle of the Minister's speech and for a moment I thought it was the new leased jet landing on Leinster Lawn to take the Minister for Foreign Affairs back to Brunei but I believe now it was the snores from the assembled accountants and bankers in the public gallery who went to sleep after a quarter of an hour of the speech because <Col N="235" /> they knew what was in the budget anyway.</P>
    <P>This budget should have had three objectives.  It should have continued to reduce our borrowing requirement, stabilise and reduce our national debt and reform income tax and PRSI.</P>
    <P>While the budget addresses the income tax question it does so in a very predictable fashion and one which has been announced on several occasions since Christmas.  It fails to address the combined effect of taxation and PRSI and the tax measures will have very little effect on job creation.  It fails to introduce any supply-side strategies for job creation and one wonders whether the Government are aware that there are still 230,000 persons on the live register and that since the last budget was introduced in this House 12 months ago the historically high emigration figure of 46,000 was announced, an all-time high since 1922. During his two hour speech the Minister never mentioned emigration and did not put forward any proposals for job creation.</P>
    <P>This budget fails to attack the problem of poverty even though it contains measures which will change the manner in which the social welfare code is applied.  I will deal with that issue in detail because I do not believe the budget addresses the problem of poverty in a direct way which will relieve the burden on the poorest and lowest paid.  The budget will not relieve the poverty traps which are inhibiting employment and the social welfare measures contained in it will have little or no impact on job creation either.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer first to the national debt.  The Minister has set rather soft targets for the future but we should remember that our national debt is now £25 billion, which is a sizeable sum of money.  Our national debt has gone up every year and will go up again this year. It would have gone up by about £270 million this morning but by the close of play tonight it will have gone up by about £470 million.  Our debt will rise again and the concessions given by the Minister <Col N="236" /> here today have been given principally because he is borrowing more to do so. He has lifted the EBR marginally under the 1989 outturn.  I am not saying progress has not been made; no one knows better than the people on this side of the House how difficult it is to make progress.  I agree with the main thrust of the policy to control our national debt but we have to look at what will happen this year.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's Estimates for 1990 which were published in November there were increases for major programmes in the Department of Justice of 8, 14.1, 15 and 13 per cent; an increase of 16 per cent in the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs; an increase of 15 per cent in the Vote for the Attorney General's office; an increase of 19 per cent in the Vote for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions while the Department of Health Vote, which accounts for 21 per cent of all expenditure, was increased by 8 per cent.  Expenditure was seriously wound up this year but it was hidden because the amount put in for the social welfare fund was smaller as a result of the extra revenue due to buoyancy in the PRSI receipts.</P>
    <P>The progress made by the Minister both this year and last year in reducing borrowing has been achieved principally by the buoyancy in revenue.  In 1989 alone the Minister collected £430 million more from the Irish taxpayer than he estimated when he came into the House this time last year would be the case. Four hundred and thirty million pounds is serious money.  The Minister was able to bring the EBR down by 3 per cent but this progress has been dependent on tax buoyancy.  If this tax buoyancy goes into reverse the Government and the economy will be dangerously exposed because little or no attempt has been made in this budget or in the Estimates already announced to restructure this debt.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the latest survey on the Board of Works.  Will the Minister accept the recommendation that the activities of the Board of Works should be confined to the management of public property?  Will there be any restructuring of the way in which the health boards <Col N="237" /> spend 21 per cent of all Government income?  Will our large hospitals still be left with budgets of £35 million, £40 million and £50 million and be run notionally by junior officials with the title of hospital manager while the main managers are miles away in central offices?  Are we going to do anything about the situation in local authorities?  It would pay the Government to hand over every local authority house to their tenants because what is collected in rent does not go more than 60 per cent of the way towards paying for the repairs to local authority houses.  Because of the way the scheme is administered at present even if the Government gave the houses away they would make money.  Will anything be done about the Land Registry?</P>
    <P>We proposed that that body should be taken out of the State sector and made a semi-State organisation.  The same could apply to the Ordnance Survey Office. Are the ICI going to continue as a State insurance company and will the PMPA be maintained and underpinned by the State?  What is the status of the proposed joint venture for Irish Steel?  Will the Irish Life Insurance Company have their capital base restructured this year?  Will Aer Lingus continue to replace their fleet from their profits and from the Government Capital Programme or will they be allowed to go to the public for funds? Where do the Government stand on the disposal of State assets?</P>
    <P>The debt can certainly be reduced by running budgetary surpluses and the Minister indicated that this may be his strategy from now until 1993.  It can also be reduced by dedicating the proceeds from the sale of State assets to reducing the debt.  I welcome the soft new target the Minister has set.  It is certainly better than the redundant target of reducing the EBR to 3 per cent of GNP by 1993.  That was redundant the day it was put into the Programme for Government and the people who put it in knew it was redundant. I believe we should aim for a balanced budget by 1991 and there should be surpluses or, alternatively, funding from the sale of State assets after that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> The present level of debt is the highest among EC countries.  It is twice the EC average and, as I said, if anything goes wrong with buoyancy &mdash; and there are enough signs to make one worry at present &mdash; or if it winds down the Government will be dangerously exposed because all the programmes are still in position.  They have been geared up, but this has been cleverly disguised in the Book of Estimates.  We would give a better service if we were to restructure public expenditure particularly by the high spenders.  However, the Minister has failed to bring about any fundamental reforms.  He should be modelling this country on the narrow band EMS countries and should be aiming for a debt GNP ratio of about 75 per cent by 1995.  That is the kind of target he should be aiming at and I have indicated how he could achieve this.</P>
    <P>It must be a record for a Minister to succeed in giving a two hour speech without making any mention of interest rates. This is significant because interest rates are going to knock the stuffing out of this mildly expansionary budget.  It is mildly expansionary, but what the Minister did in the past, for which he was personally responsible, in many instances is going to act as a major brake on the budget.  Last spring retail sales were up by about 10 per cent on the previous 12 months.  By November this had flattened out and there was no increase for the 12 months to November.  The reason for this is obvious.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement last year the Minister said there would be no increases in interest rates but they went up four times.  I do not blame him for the first three increases, but I blame him for the last one.  It was in his hands to introduce a different policy to keep interest rates down but he has failed to address this problem today.  Interest rates are knocking the stuffing out of this economy at present and will continue to do so.  Our rate is four points higher than the rate in the economy to which our currency is tied.  Interest rates in Ireland across the range are four percentage points higher than those in West Germany.  The margin <Col N="239" /> was 2 per cent but the Minister, by not intervening in the autumn of last year, has allowed interest rates to go up.  Our rates are 1 per cent higher and quite likely 2 per cent higher than they should be. The authorities should have intervened last year and should have borrowed Deutsche Marks short term and put them into the money market here.  This would have indicated a clear commitment to our EMS position, but the Minister is now trying to ride two horses and we are going to end up with the worst results as a result of being tied to a hard currency.  We are going to be left with very high interest rates.</P>
    <P>Interest rates are not just esoteric things which affect very wealthy people and bankers.  We all experience their adverse effects in our daily lives &mdash; anyone who runs an overdraft or a business or a farmer who owes money.  Mortgage holders in particular have had it very hard and have obtained no relief at all in this budget.  The average new mortgage has gone up by about £100 per month since the Minister last introduced a budget in this House.  That is a colossal increase.  The banks left the door open by deferring the last increase in the mortgage rate until the beginning of the next tax year.  They said they would take no decision until April.  The invitation was obvious and I called on the Minister on several occasions to restore mortgage interest relief to the full amount, but he has given no response today.</P>
    <P>In the estimates of receipts and expenditure no separate figure is given for the amount to be collected by way of DIRT but I understand the Minister has calculated that the receipts from DIRT will go up from a figure of £190 million in 1989 to a figure of £294 million in 1990. It is no wonder the Minister did not refer to interest rates here today because with that increase in the Government's calculations there is no expectation by the Department of Finance that interest rates will go down.  The figure is based on an interest rate which will remain at its present level or alternatively, edge up slightly in the course of the year.  The <Col N="240" /> Minister has let down the young couples who are trying to house themselves and those people who entered into commitments to raise money to house themselves and their families.  Last year he justified the reduction in mortgage interest relief by saying that interest rates were down and that they would stay down.  They have gone up and the Minister has been proved wrong.  He is personally responsible for not taking action to prevent the last increase in interest rates and he is doubly responsible for not taking action today.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants interest rates to come down in the short term to those which apply in West Germany he will have to remove certain exchange controls immediately.  The Minister is well aware that there is about £4.5 billion of German money in Irish Government paper at present and if he removes exchange controls to allow money to come in to be invested in the interbank market he will get interest rates down but, of course, he would not take that decision here today no more than he would take the decision last autumn.  The Irish business community, farmer and consumer are going to pay the penalty over the next few months.</P>
    <P>The Minister has increased child benefit by 75p per child per month.  The last time I heard a figure like this bandied about was when a jury in London gave <i>The Sunday Times</i> 60p in a libel award. I was reminded of that today because any man who would come into this House to give 75p per month per child to alleviate poverty thinking he was doing a great job and be applauded for it by the people on his backbenches certainly does not understand how ordinary families live.  I am not surprised by this because when the Minister came into the House last year he was not going to increase child benefit at all.  As a matter of fact, he intended to introduce an arrangement to cut it off from certain families and give them nothing.</P>
    <P>The child dependant allowance is being increased by £1.  I welcome this as it is a significant increase.  In his Budget Statement the Minister says that the minimum <Col N="241" /> rate will be increased by £1.  I wonder is there a hidden clawback for those who are not on the minimum rate?  Can we receive an explanation for this later tonight?  No attempt has been made to do anything about a child tax allowance. The main thrust of this budget is anti-family in the way it targets certain sectors and ignores the problems facing large families.  A head of household in prudence would insure himself.  Tax relief on all insurance premiums paid after 6 April is being reduced from 80 per cent to 50 per cent.  On first reading one might think that this will apply only to new policies but as we will all be renewing our premiums after 6 April we can see that it will not apply to new policies only but to all policies.  This will also lead to an increase in the cost of endowment mortgages as they contain an insurance element. Rather than relieving the burden on mortgage holders, the Minister has increased it.  He may not have understood what he was doing as he does not seem to understand how ordinary families on low incomes live.  That is what happened.</P>
    <P>This budget does nothing at all for jobs. I am surprised by this.  I am aware we have gone from the days when there were major management initiatives, that can be taken, but there is a whole series of things on the supply side that the Minister could have done, but he does not address these at all.  One would think that the events of the last month would have sharpened him up to do something about employment.  There are 238,000 people on the live register and 46,000 people have emigrated according to the figures available &mdash; an historic high &mdash; yet the Government are inactive when it comes to creating jobs.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister for Labour as to the number of redundancies notified to him during the past 12 months and he replied that almost 13,000 redundancies were notified in 1989.  Of course many other redundancies, outside the scope of redundancy legislation, do not have to be notified.  We have been told that 400 jobs are on the way out at Nixdorf, 1,000 jobs at Sunbeam, 160 jobs <Col N="242" /> at the Skerries shirt factory and 60 jobs at the Coca-Cola factory in Tuam&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is one other computer company I know of, and although it is profitable in this country it has been taken over, an event which will cost 400 jobs.  My total of the number of redundancies publicly announced &mdash; and which have been a matter of public controversy &mdash; is 2,500 and that is not taking into account the threes, fours, tens and 15s never reported in the provincial papers.</P>
      <P>What is the Minister's response to the problems of job creation?  As far as I can see, there has been little or no response. The tax changes are his response to the theory that marginal rates are more important when it comes to job creation than average rates of tax, and he has reduced the standard rate from 32 per cent to 30 per cent, very good, and I appreciate that, but God knows, that has been announced every day since Christmas.  The top rate has been reduced from 56 per cent to 53 per cent; fair enough.  There is a reasonable extension of about 6 per cent in the scope of the standard 30 per cent band, as it is now, and that is welcome.</P>
      <P>However, let us look at the overall tax picture.  The total tax concession for 1990 is £104 million; in this little book the total receipts from income tax estimated for 1990 is £2.8 billion.  What fraction is £104 million of that?  It is roughly one twenty-eighth. It is not even indexed for 1990; it does not even match inflation for 1990. You are looking at something less than 4 per cent &mdash; about 3.5 per cent.  That is the totality of the income tax concession. It is very cleverly done.  The jam was spread with much publicity, but very thinly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the income tax concessions and see if we can relate them to jobs.  How did the magician do it?  First, he ignored all personal allowances and the tax bands, and indexed nothing.  Since we all start with an inflation rate of about 4.5 per cent we are that much worse off. <Col N="243" /> Second, he increased the 35 per cent band by about 6 per cent and left the 48 per cent band as it was.  When people go from the standard rate to the next rate they will move up 18 points.  That is one of the greatest disincentives to job creation, it is one of the greatest traps.  That has caused much consternation in manufacturing industry because it comes into force at a point just above the average industrial wage.  That problem has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister does not have the resources to do everything, but he has given no indication of where he is going after this.  This is a once off measure.  He is heading for a tax rate of 25 per cent, but there is no indication that he understands the traps within the system and the connection between job creation and a low tax rate.  If he did he would have taken the advice of his colleagues in Government and incorporated PRSI with income tax.  He failed signally to introduce a tax reform package because he has taken income tax reductions and income tax reform as an independent issue from PRSI.  PRSI is paid on every £1 from the first £1 and the Minister has done virtually nothing in this regard.  He has a couple of million pounds to exempt people with an income of £60 or lower from paying PRSI, but that does not address the issue.  All it will do is help kids doing part-time jobs in supermarkets and pubs &mdash; provided the supermarkets and pubs are in the white economy rather than the black economy.  Fair dues to them, they will have a couple of extra pounds pocket money going home. However, this is really addressed to the part-time workers and will have no effect on job creation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had been serious he would have looked at the two issues together and exempted at least the first £2,500 of income from PRSI for everybody. I know the cost would be heavy but I know where it could be got &mdash; the other side of the spectrum.  That is the kind of reform that is necessary.  If you do not address the PRSI and income tax problems at the same time all you will <Col N="244" /> have is lower marginal rates of tax.  Winners will be reasonably happy if they are on the high tax rates and the losers will be unhappy if you eliminate the allowances to pay for it, and it will have no impact on the job market.  That is the biggest fault of the Minister's tax reform proposals.</P>
    <P>I say to the absent Progressive Democrats Ministers that I presume the leaked documents were presented to Cabinet.  They had it right and the Minister had it wrong.  He should have taken PRSI and income tax together and moved in tandem on them.  He has made a political decision to massage some of the electorate but it will have no effect whatsoever on the job market.  If he continues with this next year it will have very little effect either.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes on the corporate side and the Minister's intention to trim the impact of section 84 loans.  I welcome also the fact that accelerated depreciation has been discontinued, but I deplore the discourtesy to this party and their finance spokesman in the Minister's churlish decision to refuse to answer questions I put down to him for written answer &mdash; questions dealing with accelerated depreciation, the abolition of export sales relief, section 84 loans and reductions in the top rate of corporate tax.  Three of these subjects were mentioned in the Budget Statement today. The reply I got from the Minister was:</P>
    <P>It is proposed to take these questions together.  Owing to the pressure of work arising in connection with the budget it has not been possible in the short time available to provide the information requested.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will be able to debate this with the Minister right up to midnight, so he need not worry about that.  Apart from the lack of impact on the job market of the changes in the tax régime, there is no attempt whatsoever to have any kind of sectoral strategy to introduce jobs.  For example, the tourist industry is dismissed in a paragraph. The rod licence dispute is still decimating the industry.  This was a live issue here last year and we heard a great deal about it in the course of the year. What is its status now?  Is that going to keep the tourists away for another 12 months?  Tourism had relatively no attention, yet it is one of the industries that in the nineties could keep a cohort of young people in rural Ireland within active communities. It is sad to go around rural parishes and meet old people and two or three farmers with a son at home and everybody else gone, but it is a joyful experience when they are all at home at Christmas.  In the absence of anything happening in agriculture the tourist industry could change the pattern of rural Ireland.  The tourist industry as well as being a good income earner is a great distributor of income into the remotest areas.  There is nothing in the Minister's speech in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are on the periphery of Europe.  If our future is to be based on export led growth we must take our goods to the marketplace and sell them as competitively as the people who are nearer the marketplace.  It follows from that that we must have a competitive transport system which we do not have at present. We are the only country in the EC that <Col N="246" /> still has excise duty on articulated trucks &mdash; at 6.5 per cent.  The Minister should remove it.  We are farthest from the centre of the market and we are still putting excise duty on articulated trucks.</P>
    <P>We have failed to improve the road network in an effective way.  Most of the improvements seen around the country were commenced when we were in Government.  We have been bombarded with announcements about the Structural Funds, yet there will be no new main road projects commenced anywhere in 1990, despite the fact that the Structural Funds are available.  Our road infrastructure is in rag order by any standards. You do not have to go far from this country to make comparisons.  Not only are no funds being made available for reasons best known to the Minister for the Environment, but funds are being diverted to other projects which have not such a high priority.  There will be no new starts in any road programme in 1990.</P>
    <P>Much of what we transport to the marketplace has to be transported in containers. At present, Northern Ireland carriers are carrying 185,000 units across the Border northwards.  They are collecting as far south as Cork and are delivering into Britain as far south as London, yet they can charge a cheaper rate than a carrier from the Republic travelling via Rosslare or Dublin.  The reason for this is very simple.  They can do it a lot cheaper. When the proposed changes in the cabotage rules are introduced by the Community, Northern Ireland carriers will be able to collect in the Republic and deliver anywhere in Europe.  Again, they will have the major cost advantage.  Are we serious about export led growth?  If we are to lift this economy by trading competitively in goods and services and enjoy the spin-off of sustainable jobs from this export led growth, our internal and access transport must be priced competitively. Otherwise we are doomed to failure and all the spurious talk about the convergence of Irish and European living standards is poppycock.  I ask the Minister and the Taoiseach to address the problems of transport in this country and to this country both at home and in <Col N="247" /> Europe.  The infrastructure and the problems of access transport at the ports need to be addressed as they are making it extremely difficult for Irish exporters to compete now and in the future.  These problems are being hidden by the fact that we have been running a trade surplus since the past year and a half of our period in Government.  However if one looks at the composition of the trade surpluses, both in volume and money terms, they can tell a different story.  If we do not take action on the transport issue we will have more serious problems. The Minister has ignored this issue as if it did not exist.  I do not think that is good enough.  The Budget Statement which lasted two hours purports not only to announce Government decisions but to set a framework for the life of the Government and they expect to last for at least four years.</P>
    <P>Agriculture used to be the great industry in this country.  There are two references to agriculture in the Budget Statement: first the modest restoration of VAT rebates to farmers to fulfil the commitments made three years ago by the former Minister for Finance, Commissioner MacSharry.  I suppose one should say thank you on behalf of the farmers in the same way as one would thank the hangman for slightly loosening the noose around one's neck.  The second reference to agriculture was when the Minister announced that he would remove one anomoly in inheritance tax and index the levels of relief beginning this year.  However, it is no good indexing the levels unless a major change is made in the threshold level of relief.  The Minister must first raise levels by a significant jump and after that he can index them. As things stand it will have little or no impact whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>When the Taoiseach entered his third <Col N="248" /> or fourth manifestation some years ago on a very public occasion he and Mr. Goodman announced an enormous investment in the beef industry in Ireland.  However, the price of beef collapsed last autumn.  The price of sheep meat has dropped disastrously as has the price of pigmeat and the only man who did well during the past year was the dairy farmer, but predictions suggest that the price of a gallon of milk will drop by between 10p and 16p per gallon as early as April or May this year.  Interest rates are also rising.  When we begin the new milk quota year I have no doubt the price of calves will drop by between £90 to £100 but there was not mention of any of this in the Budget Statement.  Agriculture used to be the main industry in this country and was a great stabiliser of the social structure.</P>

There is now a great reluctance to announce the extention of the disadvantaged areas and the expenditure of the Structural Funds.  Fianna Fáil backbenchers, not noted for their modesty or shyness, are staying away from meetings organised by the IFA. They are too modest to deliver the good news in person and they are allowing the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to deliver it but anyone who looks at the figures for the Structural Funds will know that over the next five years only £19 million is available for the disadvantaged areas, which is less than £4 million a year.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thought the Minister would avail of the opportunity to announce the extra 11 million <Col N="250" /> gallon milk quota to be distributed among the smallholders and the quotaless men of Ireland.  Under the criteria laid down, the Minister will have a problem.  The extra allocation will be given to people with small quotas or to those without quotas or first time entrants.  If the allocation is spread among 10,000 farmers each will get a 1,100 gallon quota, the milk of a decent cow.  However if as is more likely, it is spread among 20,000 farmers each will get a 550 gallon quota, the equivalent of the milk of five or six goats or half a cow.  This was one of the great election promises.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that one of the main planks of Irish life, the principal plank of rural life, one of the most stable elements in society, is being treated with contempt by the Minister who did not refer in the course of his two hour speech to agriculture as an industry.</P>
      <P>The food processing industry is in a tragic state.  Just ponder on these figures for a moment: 48 per cent of all cattle killed in this country were killed in the eight week period between October and the first week in December.  The EC was not self sufficient in beef this year.  It was 98 per cent efficient and beef had to be imported from outside to maintain the supply on the supermarket shelves.  Yet 50 per cent of all Irish beef goes into intervention.  The Taoiseach had announced that one of his main strategies if he got back into Government would be the development of the food processing industry.  I am not being facetious when I make these remarks.  If we have a natural resource and some of the best farmers who can produce the best quality beef why is it going into cold storage?  Why can we not develop that industry so that this seasonal glut is taken out of the system, so that there will be an even supply with jobs being created not only for farmers' sons in rural Ireland but for their neighbours families as well?  The Minister has the resources but he is doing nothing about it.  Rather he is treating agriculture with contempt.  Indeed, in this budget he is treating everybody living in rural Ireland with contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's action in <Col N="251" /> reducing VAT.  I had called on him to do so on innumerable occasions.  I said that if the rate was reduced from 25 per cent to 22 per cent it would reduce the consumer price index by 1.3 per cent.  I said that was the way the Minister should position himself in the negotiations on the national wage agreement that we on this side of the House hoped would be successful during the course of those negotiations from September onwards in 1990.  I welcome that decision.</P>
    <P>I do not welcome the decision to increase VAT on electricity and telecommunications. But, more than the actual decision to increase them, I deplore the jiggery-pokery that pretends there is some way of financing them which does not hit the consumer.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thought we had learned enough from the past, that we, as a party, had established ground rules for behaviour in public office, that the Taoiseach and his Ministers would no longer interfere in the running of commercial State organisations. The last balance sheet available from the Taoiseach's friends in the ESB to the public shows a profit of £5 million. I wonder how they will absorb £18 million in VAT increases from a profit of £5 million or has their profitability risen enormously since the last figures were published?  If the ESB are profitable to the degree that they can absorb &mdash; to suit their political friends in the Government &mdash; £18 million of VAT increases, why would they not pass on that £18 million by way of a reduction in prices?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am addressing the budget.  I am making the point that the Minister spoke for two hours and never put this budget in the European context.  That is the point I am making.  I am developing my point and wishing the Taoiseach well in the course of so doing, which is quite reasonable.</P>
      <P>One of the major issues facing this country is that of European monetary union.  We have certain preparations to make if we want to subscribe to a régime, which is a European Central Bank &mdash; which will naturally be dominated by the Bundesbank &mdash; and which will also give us a European currency.  I know why the Taoiseach is inventing causes because the fall of events &mdash; without any responsibility on the part of his Government &mdash; has brought about a very thin agenda for the Presidency over the next six months. In a very strong burst of activity in the last three weeks of 1989 the French Presidency cleared a lot of outstanding items on the agenda.  There was reference to one of them already today by the Minister for Finance when, for the first time, he said there was agreement on harmonisation of VAT.  Even though it was not a full agreement, at least progress was made.  Many other items were removed from the agenda as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue which should be of greatest concern to us should be that of European monetary union, which has been put back to the Italian Presidency.  The meeting of Heads of State which will deal with that issue will be within the term of the Italian Presidency.  So the Taoiseach puts a green cloak around himself.  I would suggest that the Taoiseach, in his career, showed much greater familiarity with a different kind of green than that which is now <Col N="255" /> encompassing all the environmental issues.</P>
    <P>I also think that in the course of preparation for European monetary union there is a great chance this country will get stuck in the middle of the river.  We have one chance only in Europe &mdash; that is to front-lead, as the NESC report advised, to shape policy to suit our interests, then we will have some chance. But, if we proceed, as we have done since 1973 on many occasions simply to react to the proposals of others, in particular to the proposals of the Commission, then we will experience great difficulty.  There is serious work to be done in preparation for European monetary union.  It is very low profile work.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Mitchell, my colleague on this side of the House, brought a very serious issue to the attention of the Irish public, both by means of Dáil question in this House and in an article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> that is the whole question of poverty traps and the tax and social welfare systems and how that works counter to job creation. There is very little attempt in this budget to address the question of poverty traps. As I mentioned already in my remarks on the reform of income taxation, the main poverty traps arise not from income tax in particular but from the combination of income tax and PRSI.  In so far as PRSI creates poverty traps, the question has not been addressed at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious problem.  The creation of jobs is naturally the best cure for poverty but obviously the social welfare system must cater for people who cannot return to work or who cannot get jobs.  I want to draw the attention of the House to those people who cannot afford to return to work, even though they want to, because they are trapped in poverty. This arises because they are better off on social welfare than if they are working. Low paid people are taxed and they pay <Col N="258" /> PRSI on every pound, usually at 7.75 per cent, if we include the levies.  Low paid people do not get income tax allowance for their children and therefore large families are not treated under the income tax code any different from families without children.  If these people have a high gross wage they lose many of the benefits to which they would be entitled if they were on social welfare and therefore they are trapped in poverty.</P>
    <P>In this budget the Government should have exempted the 11 to 18 per cent of low paid people whom the ESRI economists consider to be below the poverty line.  What is the point in taxing people who are below the poverty line when we are trying to invent other schemes, whether supplementary welfare allowance, family income supplement or some other scheme, to supplement their income?  I believe that the first tranche of income, say £2,500, should have been exempted from PRSI payments.  If that meant putting up the ceiling at the other side to get the money for it, so be it but there would be a far more progressive taxation-PRSI scheme which would directly address one of the greatest inhibitors in the labour market and one of the factors which makes it impossible for people on low pay to return to work.</P>
    <P>The means tests will also have to be changed.  We have made a very reasonable proposal, that if one is being assessed for family income supplement it should be done on net pay rather than on gross pay.  We have made an equally reasonable proposal that if one is to qualify for a medical card, the assessment should be on net pay rather than on gross pay.</P>
    <P>We have made another proposal, that differential rent should be based on net pay rather than on gross pay.  One of the proposals for social welfare is that all rates will go up by 5 per cent.  We would welcome that.  Last year there was an increase of 3 per cent but of course inflation was at about 4.5 per cent.  People on social welfare last year were not indexed against inflation and at the end of the year they were worse off than at the start of the year.  There was at least a 1 per cent clawback which, in all fairness, <Col N="259" /> had to be given to them.  The expectation for inflation next year is probably around 4 per cent for those on social welfare, according to the consumer price index. Those people are not into importing televisions from Northern Ireland or getting recorders or the higher rated VAT items. Even though the reduction in VAT from 25 per cent to 23 per cent will reduce the consumer price index, it will not reduce the effect of inflation on the lower paid and on social welfare recipients.  These people will get an increase of 5 per cent from July next but that will do nothing more than compensate them for rising prices.  Food prices have increased a lot. I would like somebody to price a basket of groceries for the normal family on social welfare and see what the consumer price index is on those items on which people spend their social welfare money.</P>
    <P>There has been some targeting of different categories and I welcome that. However, at first glance this seems to result in creating a new disadvantaged class.  Those on unemployment benefit and on disability benefit now receive around £47 or £48.  The increase in that category is very small.  Unemployment benefit is temporary and one could justify the low rate of increase by saying that the people in that category will get a bigger increase when they go into the unemployment assistance category but people can be on disability benefit from three to five years.  These people will now be at the bottom of the social welfare league &mdash; the rate for a single person being about £47.50 or £48 a week.  That is not very good targeting and it should be addressed between now and the introduction of the Social Welfare Bill, but in so far as there is an attempt to target, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Announcements have been made already this year that rents are to be increased by £1.50 a week.  If we include in that the unemployed and the aged living alone, these people will be left in a very poor position.  I do not believe there is only a certain quantum of work available for which the labour force competes. If the labour market is freed up by the elimination of poverty traps it will not <Col N="260" /> result in the displacement of one set of workers by another; it will result in an increase in the number of jobs available because there are always jobs available at a particular wage.  It is one of the great fallacies of job creation to say there are only X number of jobs available and if you eliminate poverty traps for those on social welfare, all that will happen is that they will go back to work and displace people who are working already.  That fallacy resulted in the Minister not targeting sufficiently in the budget.</P>
    <P>I want to raise one final issue and the House should take note of it because it is extremely serious.  Our labour force is growing very dramatically and will continue to grow until about 1998.  We may quarrel about the actual growth but if we talk in terms of school and college leavers, the number is about 25,000 a year and we have to add to that those who are leaving the land.  With the state of the beef industry, the pig industry, the sheepmeat industry and the drop in the price of a gallon of milk, more people will leave the land next year and the year after.  In the absence of anything being done by the Government, they will feed into the labour force as well.</P>
    <P>On top of that all the work that has been done on income tax and the connection between income tax and the labour market would suggest that if one moves to reduce the top rates of income tax more women will return to work.  So there has to be a quantum included there in that respect.  On top of that we have about 200,000 recent emigrants and naturally if jobs are advertised here they will apply for them, too.  The real figure for increases in the labour force is about 35,000 a year.  If everything I have said here today and the collective wisdom of this House is applied to job creation, we would be doing very well if 15,000 to 20,000 net jobs a year are created.  That leaves a situation where the live register will not come below 200,000 right through the decade, and 15,000 to 20,000 people will still emigrate.</P>
    <P>There is no point in pretending that the unemployed rest on the live register for a time before they go back into jobs. <Col N="261" /> There is movement in and out of the live register but there is a substantial cohort of people, frequently the heads of families, middle aged men, who have no prospect under present policies of getting back to work.  Their problems will have to be addressed directly.  The problems of the long-term unemployed and of their families will not only have to be addressed by transferring income to them through the social welfare system, but there will have to be an inter-disciplinary approach where the services of the State in health, education and social welfare will have to address their needs.  The long-term unemployed are increasingly becoming unemployable.  The system is ensuring that they cannot do anything worthwhile.  They certainly cannot work and in most places they cannot avail of full-time education.  It is impossible for their families to have fulfilling lives, the kind of fulfilled lives that those who work can have.  There is a danger that the problem will be transmitted to the next generation and not only will the long-term unemployed be unemployable but their children will be unemployable as well.</P>
    <P>This budget should have addressed to a far greater extent the question of health, education and the integration of the various schemes, and should have considered how an integrated approach by the State can help the long-term unemployed and improve their standard of living not only in monetary terms but in terms of lifestyle.  It is a very serious issue and things have not been improved very much by the paltry gesture on the part of the Government to the crisis in the health services.  Nothing is being done by the announcements made today in the budget about waiting lists in hospitals.  Plenty of Members on my side of the House will be able to expand on the deficiencies of this budgetary announcement, but it certainly does not lessen our demand one iota for a special debate on the health services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The problem of the unemployed is frequently <Col N="262" /> disguised by the statistics.  The national unemployment rate is about 18.5 per cent.  That disguises far more disturbing statistics such as one would find in the large urban housing estates.  One of the largest urban estates in my city which is no different from Cork or Dublin has an average unemployment rate of 80 per cent.  In relation to young people between 18 and 25, a recent survey showed that 91 per cent of the men were unemployed in a very large housing estate.  Naturally, some of them are on the fringes of crime and all are in the depths of boredom and frustration.  Some of them have emigrated without high skill levels so they are not highly employable in the UK either.  We will have a very serious problem in such communities and it will be aggravated by the imminent recession in the UK where there will be a shake out of the less skilled Irish emigrants who will come back to our communities.</P>
      <P>It is late in the evening to get involved in the repercussions of that level of unemployment, but we as public representatives know our own constituencies, and without fear of contradiction I can say that there are levels of unemployment of up to 80 per cent in certain communities and that among young men it is between 90 per cent and 100 per cent.  These truths are disguised by the national statistic which is still a horrific statistic.  There are some communities where the unemployment level is 1.5, 2 or 3 per cent. Society has become increasingly segregated not by social class but by housing policy.  As a consequence we are developing serious situations in which whole communities are unemployed and whose children are also becoming unemployable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget today was a failure.  The Minister and the Government by attempting to address all problems, spread everything so thinly that the budget will have no particular impact. The fact that the budget has been announced several times in the past three weeks in the most outrageous breaches of budgetary secrecy that I have ever witnessed certainly reduces the impact of the budget today.  It was the first budget <Col N="263" /> of a Government who claimed to have a life of four and a half years or longer. They could have afforded to be daring. There could have been real structural reform leading to a solution to our problems, rather than an attempt to massage problems.  This is not a prudent budget. It is a moribund budget without imagination or a sense of vision.  It is a totally disastrous response to the problems of unemployment and poverty.  It is an indictment of the Government, that so early in their life, they have become so out of touch with the ordinary people of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Some reference has already been made to the leaking of the provisions of the budget.  It is a remarkable factor, of which the Ceann Comhairle should take note, that on this morning's radio programme on RTE every single provision relating to income tax, VAT, social welfare and so on in this budget, was announced on the radio.  This is a most serious matter and it rather ridicules the Chair's announcement that Deputies could not leave the House with information before the Minister's speech had concluded.  It casts a very poor reflection on this Government that they allowed leaks, so clear and so definite, to take place so that the budget was literally announced on the morning radio rather than in this House by the Minister.  It is equally clear from the conflicting leaks by the Progressive Democrats Party and by Fianna Fáil that they are vying with each other to try to claim what benefit they can from this Coalition Government. That is something the public must deeply regret.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that many of the items in today's budget are welcome, but in overall terms the budget just tinkers with many of our social problems rather than addressing them in any fundamental way.  The budget does not seriously attempt to address the unemployment and emigration cancers that affect us and it does not do nearly enough to address the growing crisis in health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one was to sum up this budget it <Col N="264" /> would be to say that it is a rich man's budget.  The disposition of what is available for distribution goes to the largest extent to the wealthy.  The clearest indicator of that is the reduction in the top rate of income tax from 56 per cent to 53 per cent.  The effect of that is to give a couple on £30,000 a year a net tax reduction of £15 a week.  A person paying tax at the top rate and on £40,000 a year will gain £20 a week.  A person paying tax on £100,000 a year, of which there are many in this country, will benefit by £60 a week.  Contrast that with those on the lower rates of pay.  A person on £10,000 or £12,000 a year is getting a miserable £3 or £4 a week in tax reduction.  Where is the equity in that?  Where is the fairness? The whole thrust here, clearly orchestrated by the Progressive Democrats Party, leaves the major part of the budget to the Thatcherites provisions of directing the bulk of what is available to the wealthey who do not need it and who are paying inadequate taxation.</P>
    <P>The most serious defect in the budget is that it lacks a strategy to lay out a plan for the economic development of this country over the next four years.  The budget does not show from where the growth will come in the years 1990-93.  It does not indicate what finances will be required to fund this growth, what the sources of this finance will be and where exactly it will be spent to ensure that we get the growth and jobs we need.  It has been said that we will need an economic miracle to compete in the nineties with the UK, Germany, Japan and the United States.  Where is the plan in the budget to chart the way forward?</P>
    <P>The Minister has undoubtedly succeeded in balancing the books.  He has done the job of a book-keeper-accountant well enough, but he has failed to do the job of an economic planner and innovator.  The essential role of the budget should be not just to balance the books but to make major inroads into the problem of poverty which has been shown by independent reports to affect about one-third of the population, about one million people.  It clearly fails that <Col N="265" /> test.  In a country with one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe and with emigration draining the life's blood of this country year after year, the role of a budget should be to provide funds for direct Government intervention in the economy to create jobs.  It clearly failed that test.</P>
    <P>In a country where 80 per cent of the wealth is owned by 5 per cent of the population, the role of the budget should be to introduce a taxation system on income and capital that would begin to reduce the gap between the rich and everyone else.  Clearly, it also fails that test.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance introduced his first budget last year he complimented himself and the Government &mdash; prematurely as it turned out &mdash; on the fact that inflation then had fallen to its lowest level for many years.  Deputies will recall that the rate of inflation was 2.1 per cent in 1988.  Since then, however, it has more than doubled and is currently at about 5 per cent.  Low and stable interest rates were another item for which the Minister claimed credit in 1989.  He said that low interest rates were helping householders with mortgages and loans, business people and farmers.  Since then the Minister and the Government lost their grip and interest rates have taken off.  There were no fewer than four increases in interest rates since then and another is clearly in the pipeline.  These steady increases in inflation and interest rates are putting many jobs and people's homes at risk.  Mortgage repayments are escalating and further mortgage increases are in store.  Many householders cannot meet these increases and their homes are liable to be repossessed.  They face another year of mortgage misery and the Minister has done nothing for these families. The interest rate increases are also pushing up the cost of loans, household goods, farm equipment and many other items.  People's living standards as a result have been adversely affected.  On the one hand the Minister is giving income tax cuts but, to wipe out these gains, mortgage rates are rising.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious situations we <Col N="266" /> face at present is the continuing upward spiral in interest rates.  We have one of the highest interest rates relative to the rate of inflation, in recent history.  The prime interest rate is 8 per cent to 9 per cent above the rate of inflation.  The rate being charged to small businesses is 11 per cent to 12 per cent above the rate of inflation, the rate to personal borrowers is 12 per cent to 13 per cent above the rate of inflation and 15 per cent to 16 per cent in the case of borrowers from finance companies.</P>
    <P>There remains the near certainty that the mortgage rate will be increased by another 1 per cent in the next month or so; increases of this magnitude will give rise to considerable hardship and add to inflationary pressures.  The repayments on the average mortgage over the last year have increased by between 25 per cent and 28 per cent.  Living standards would have been helped somewhat if the benefits from the increased value of the punt had been passed on to consumers, but very many importers and suppliers of goods and services failed to pass on the benefits and substantially increased their own profits instead.  The Government accepted that situation and did nothing to deal with it.  Price controls were &mdash; and are &mdash; clearly necessary on a wide range of goods and services but the Government refused to introduce any.</P>
    <P>As I said, inflation in 1989 ran up to 5 per cent but the Minister's 1989 budget gave an increase of only 3 per cent in social welfare, and then only from July 1989.  In this way the Minister and the Government reduced the living standards of the weakest section of the community. The living standards of workers have also declined because the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> confined wage increases to just 2.5 per cent.  The economic policies of the Government have attacked the living standards of pensioners and people on PAYE.  However, many categories have benefited.  For example, the banks have marked up massive increases in profits and the multi-national corporations are all busy taking their profits abroad.</P>
    <P>The scandal of the section 84 loans <Col N="267" /> goes on.  I do not accept the very doubtful and limited way in which the Minister proposed to tackle it in his budget speech. The banks and the financial institutions &mdash; as they do with the BES schemes &mdash; find their way around controls very quickly.  As we speak they are busy with their schemes and plans in the accountancy offices working out how they will avoid and evade that one.  You can be sure their circulars will be out tomorrow morning as they will be on the printing presses tonight.  It is not surprising that the Minister for Finance does not cost in his budget speech how much more in taxation he expects to get from the banks and financial institutions as a result of the limited attention he proposes to give to the section 84 loans.</P>
    <P>The 1984 loans are an absolute scandal as they enable the banks and financial institutions to take in &mdash; as they did last year &mdash;£98 million.  I obtained this information in a written reply from the Minister for Finance.  Only one thing should have been done about that, not to restrict the loans ratio level to 75 per cent but to abolish them.  The banks and financial institutions, who have been making vast amounts of money at the expense of the taxpayer and the Exchequer, should have had these loans cancelled as there is no justification for them.  Tinkering around the edges, as the Minister has done, is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>As I said, and as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions pointed out, the beneficiaries of the policies of this Government have been companies, the corporate sector, banks, big farmers and big business, whereas the workers who, by their efforts, contributed most to producing their increased profits are the people who benefited least.  Pay increases were set at a level of 2.5 per cent and it is interesting to note that there was no such level set on profits.  If one looks at the profits of the banks and the big corporations one will see that they were not constrained at 2.5 per cent or 5 per cent.  If one looks at their figures one will find that their profits increased by between 20 per cent and 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> Millions of pounds in profits were made last year and there was no constraint on the companies.  There was no 5 per cent constraint as in the case of social welfare payments or 2.5 per cent constraint as in the case of pay increases.  The banks, and big corporations, were given a free rein on a very favourable tax base and that enabled them to run away with profits in the last year.  They took full advantage of their position but workers, on the other hand, made enormous sacrifices in 1987 and 1988.  They saw their living standards eroded by inflation and higher interest rates.  The unemployed and those on low pay suffered from Government policies in recent years in regard to health, education and other Government services. They expected the budget to make substantial advances and provide for a sharing in the benefits of economic recovery, but I am afraid they will be disappointed. They will not thank the Government for the £3 and £4 per week reductions in their income tax when they see the profits that companies and the well-off have been garnering to themselves.</P>
    <P>The level of tax relief for the PAYE sector is totally inadequate having regard to the developments that have taken place in the economy and the level of profits being earned.  The Minister could have, and should have, broadened the tax base and raised more from farmers, the self-employed and companies and applied the proceeds to larger tax reductions for PAYE workers.  Instead the Minister has increased the tax concessions to companies and corporations. He has reduced their tax rates.  There has been a lot of talk over the years about fair taxation.  I thought the Government had conceded to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that there would be a sensible balance introduced but there is no change in balance in the budget as between the massive amounts paid by the PAYE sector and that paid by the corporate sector.</P>
    <P>The corporate sector contributed 9.1 per cent of total tax in 1965 and that was down to 4 per cent in 1987.  There is nothing in the budget that will alter that proportion in the slightest degree.  The <Col N="269" /> Minister for Finance, in the course of his contribution on the Adjournment debate on 15 December last, said that what the Opposition wanted were better services and lower taxes at the same time and he told us that we could not have both.  The Labour Party say that we can have adequate health, social welfare and education services paid for by those who can well afford to do so from the vast profits of the corporate sector.  Those services can be paid for by those who take full advantage of the tax breaks, schemes and devices provided for and maintained by the Government.  They should be paid for by the companies who repatriate their massive profits on which they pay little or no tax.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed by the Minister's statement that he intends having discussions about these matters with the Revenue Commissioners to see what can be done.  That is not good enough.  There is little use making speeches describing one of those schemes as Disneyland.  We are not talking about one scheme; there are one dozen Disneylands alive and thriving in Ireland, and it is clear from the Minister's speech that he does not intend to do anything about them.  The business expansion scheme is rolling on in full flow and if the Minister thinks that the little constraints he brought about, setting a limit of £2.5 million and so on, will do any good he can forget it.  Details of those schemes are put through my office letterbox weekly.  There are dozens of them in operation.  Those involved in them have got around all constraints with little difficulty.  They have separate companies funnelling in £2.5 million each. Those involved in them are very smart and the constraints the Minister has introduced will not do anything to control the tax scam that the BES is.  The view of the Labour Party is that that scheme has failed and it should be abolished.  The tax due by the companies from their profits should be paid to the Exchequer.  Projects considered important and in need of help should be grant-aided by the Government on an individual basis.  The BES is one of the many tax devices that the wealthy are using, with the connivance <Col N="270" /> of the Government, to reduce their tax bills.  Those on an income of £100,000 per annum are doing very well out of that scheme.  Each week six or more new companies are set up under that scheme.</P>
    <P>Profits from manufacturing are supposed to be taxed at 10 per cent but many of those companies do not pay anything. We are all aware of the legal decisions under which some of this nonsense, so-called manufacturing, takes place.  I am referring to the ripening of bananas, the grading of coal by CDL and so on.  They come under the 10 per cent manufacturing rate and the best the Minister can do is consult with the Revenue Commissioners to control them.  He should have announced in his speech that he will not tolerate it and that the profits of those companies will be taxed at the full corporation tax rate as and from today.  He should have put them on notice that that is his intention.  However, I do not think he intends to do anything about those companies.  Will we hear any more about the discussions he proposes to have with the Revenue Commissioners on how to control those companies?  Is it any wonder that those in the PAYE sector who see such tax devices in operation complain bitterly at the disproportionate part of the total tax revenue they are forced to bear year on year?</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's policy document on the economy suggests an appropriate way to deal with many of the company scandals.  We say that all companies should pay a minimum of 10 per cent tax on their profits &mdash; that is little enough &mdash; irrespective of the Disneyland tricks and allowances they take advantage of.  The Labour Party also support the proposal of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that there should be a levy on the profits of companies not reinvesting in Ireland. People should note that the Minister chose to ignore that worthwhile proposal and in doing so gave a clear licence to those companies who are making massive profits from the efforts of Irish workers to withdraw their profits from the country on a tax free basis.  The bulk of the investment by such companies in Ireland in the <Col N="271" /> first place was IDA grant money which comes from the taxes of Irish workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quoted as saying that there is no such thing as a free lunch but the facts of life in Ireland today are that for some lunch is a pleasant dream involving four courses with wine while for others putting food on the table for the family is not a dream but a nightmare from day to day.  These inequities cannot be tackled as long as the Government fail to undertake a fundamental reform of taxation, particularly capital taxation. Once again they have failed to do that.</P>
    <P>There is still no fair or adequate taxation on capital, on companies, on business or on farmers.  If these reforms were introduced it would be possible to provide a proper health service, as well as relief for the hard-pressed PAYE sector and improved benefits for people on social welfare.  The banking, business and farming sectors are doing very well out of this budget, although their profits have gone from strength to strength.  As before, it is the middle and low income groups who bear the brunt.</P>
    <P>During the Adjournment debate before Christmas the Minister for Finance told the Dáil that the private sector was responding positively to the needs of the nation.  On the other hand, not long before that speech the Minister for Labour, Deputy B. Ahern, was publicly castigating the private sector for failing to do just that.  One does not have to be a professional economist to see which Minister is correct.  The Minister for Labour at least recognised a serious problem, even though the Government of which he is a member is responsible for it.  His colleague at Finance is less than helpful in refusing to face up to the fact that all the policies and all the plausible talk from this uninspired Government have failed to make any impact of substance in the creation of employment for those who need it and those who have been forced to take to the boats in search of it.  It is clear that the Government have no coherent industrial policy aimed at translating the growth we have had into <Col N="272" /> wealth retained in Ireland and into jobs for Irish workers.</P>
    <P>We need radical changes in industrial policy to ensure the concept of value added in the economy and to maximise investment.  We know that radical changes in industrial policy cannot be achieved overnight.  It would take a medium term programme to build up a strong indigenous manufacturing sector based on the concept of added value and involving a dynamic public sector as well as a competitive, quality conscious private sector.  We want a recognition that our industrial policy to date has been a failure and we want a commitment to begin the policy of change.  The problem is the almost total reliance placed on the private sector.  At no time ever in the history of this State, either in good times or bad, did that private sector so cherished by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael ever provide anything like the level of employment needed to sustain our increasing population.  Cherished it was and is.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for 1990, for example, provide £108 million for IDA grants for the private sector.  Contrast that with the grant of only £4 million to the National Development Corporation.  Can it really be that after all these years of failure the message has still not sunk in, namely that a radical change of policy and direction is called for and that the tired, worn out, discredited policy of reliance on multi-national companies has not done the job for us in the past and is not doing it now? It is high time we organised to do the job for ourselves.  The Telesis report spelled it out some years ago but we ignored it. Minister Ahern warned about it recently too but he has been ignored as well.  This budget could have signalled something new in this regard and set out a new industrial policy to create larger Irish companies which could by reason of their size compete on equal terms on the international market.  The budget could have provided for changes in taxation which would reward companies who created more jobs and penalised those who did not.</P>
    <P>If this Government were really interested in boosting employment they <Col N="273" /> could have provided funds in the Estimates for building council houses which are so desperately needed.  A major new housing programme is essential to tackle the growing problem of homelessness. In 1983, £214 million was allocated for public housing compared to £6 million in 1990.  The Minister could have been more specific in dealing with the embargo on recruitment to the public service in order to give some hope of employment to young people coming out of school. Grants and tax breaks on machinery could have been converted into grants and allowances for the creation of new employment.  The Government were not interested.  They did nothing.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently called in the CEOs of the semi-State bodies for discussions. That is to be welcomed, as far as it goes, but it means very little unless the Government signal a clear change in direction in the area of job creation by channelling the massive funds available in this programme away from more grants and handouts to foreign companies in favour of creating and supporting indigenous industries, in both the public and private sectors and in joint ventures. They will not do it, of course, because they have an ideological objection.</P>

      <P>They continue to put their faith in private enterprise, even though, to paraphrase a favourite saying of the Taoiseach, it is a failed economic entity. If it were successful our unemployment rate would not be the second highest among EC countries and so many thousands of our people, including our youth, would not have had to emigrate.  If it had been a successful programme the population of Ireland would be 500,000 higher than it is and the living standards of our people would not be about 40 per cent lower than the average living standards in most other EC countries. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has certainly produced high profits and high growth rates for many companies but it was supposed to have gone hand in <Col N="274" /> hand with the creation of sufficient new jobs.  That has not happened.  At the current rate of job creation 200,000 people will still be unemployed in 1992.  The 100,000 long-term unemployed have benefited virtually not at all from any of the job creation measures.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have repeatedly called for the introduction of special employment and training measures for the long-term unemployed but on this issue also the Government have failed to respond.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that many of the jobs that have been created are only part time, while many more are low paid jobs in which young people in particular are being disgracefully exploited.  Each of these jobs is included in the job creation figures as if it were genuine, full time and properly paid.  Many young people were hoping for an announcement today from the Minister setting a minimum wage to protect them from exploitation.  Part-time workers were hoping for measures to protect their jobs and improve their rights.  The Minister has given them all a very straight thumbs down</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare increase of 5 per cent is scandalously low.  A fraud was perpetrated on people receiving social welfare in 1989.  They were given an increase of 3 per cent from July 1989, by which time the level of inflation had already overtaken that figure, standing at 4 per cent.  The inflation figure ended the year at almost 5 per cent.  The cost of living index on food, which is such a key factor for people on social welfare, was a percentage point higher at 5.7 per cent. This Government gave 3 per cent.  Those families stricken by poverty and the hundreds and thousands of children involved had their living standards set back and reduced by the Government in 1989.  The 5 per cent increase in this year's budget will not make up for that.  Already they have had rent increases from Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and the other local authorities.  Even taking the case of the long-term unemployed who will receive £9 per week, already £2 per week approximately is gone because of <Col N="275" /> the rent increase.  Inflation which is running at approximately 5 per cent puts them back to square one.  The cost of food is running at an increased cost of 5.7 per cent.  Where is there regard to those independent reports of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors who are calling for at least an announcement from the Government over a two or a three year period that they would provide the basic minimum necessary to give some kind of dignity and support for those families on the breadline?  There has been no indication of it except for a miserly 5 per cent &mdash; a few pounds per week &mdash; which goes nowhere towards maintaining living standards.  We know the basic minimum for a family now should be well over £100 per week if we are to take the report of the Commission on Social Welfare into account and indexing it for the inflation that is taking place.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response on health is welcome in some respects and in some of the things it does but I am afraid it goes nowhere towards meeting the shortfall in the health services.  Those services have been cut not by the £2 million here and £3 million there but by £200 million, 1 per cent of GNP.  That kind of decimation will not be made good.  What is given is a crumb from the table and it will not go anywhere towards resolving the appalling level of the health services in this country. They are in crisis and have been for three years.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I got a reply to a Dáil question from the Minister for Health dealing with the question of dental treatment in the Eastern Health Board area. There are 11,000 adults and adolescents awaiting dental treatment in the Eastern Health Board area for a year or more.  A special list of particularly urgent cases has been set up for pregnant and nursing women and the elderly.  They are privileged and are on a special list.  The Minister informs us that the waiting time is currently only ten months for people who need that treatment.  They are in the special category.  It is an absolute disgrace and a scandal.  If the Minister thinks the <Col N="276" /> paltry sums he has provided for here will go anywhere towards meeting the cost, I am afraid he will find he is sadly mistaken.</P>
    <P>There has been a failure to provide for essential expenditure in the area of primary education.  The President of the INTO said recently in a comment on the Estimates for 1990 that many schools will continue to be in serious financial trouble because of inadequate grants for the maintenance of schools.  Many primary schools are on the poverty line already particularly those on local authority estates.  Parents had been hoping for an improvement this year but there was no improvement.  A programme of special measures for schools in disadvantaged areas should have been singled out for substantial additional funding.  I am afraid the figure of £1.5 million provided by the Minister in his budget speech today on this issue will not meet the needs of the situation.  The figure provided under this heading in 1986 was £750,000, that figure was reduced to £500,000 in 1988 and even then that amount was not allocated for use in full.  While the provision of some additional teaching posts is welcome it is too little, too late.  The INTO called for <i>ex gratia</i> payments directly to the schools to eliminate their existing debts and the Labour Party support their demands.</P>
    <P>The two-tier society gets hardened and more clear-cut as year follows year and the policies of this Government repeat themselves year on year.  In health and in education there is a two-tier society and this is becoming very dangerous.</P>
    <P>The legal aid position has been referred to.  The Judicial Separation Act provides a real need for so many people but the overwhelming bulk of those who need to avail of it are unable to do so.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, former Minister for Justice, gave a half commitment that he would try to arrange for sufficient legal aid funds to be provided to the board to meet the needs of the new Act.  Nothing has been produced and the crisis in the Legal Aid Board has worsened and we have a two-tier society once again.  The rich and the wealthy have no problem as they have access to <Col N="277" /> health, education and to the law but others are thrown on the scrap heap as far as this Coalition Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are concerned.</P>
    <P>The children's allowances are an absolute insult.  There has been an increase of 19p per week per child, after all these years when there was no increase whatsoever, when research shows that it costs £20 per week to maintain a child.  To those on social welfare, those on the lowest end of the scale, the Minister is giving only an extra 19p on top of the £10.  It is any wonder so many of the children of poorer families are undernourished and do not have the basic requirements of food and clothing that they need?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the morale of the country has never been higher.  I invite the Minister to go on a short journey &mdash; he will not need the Government jet which costs £1.3 million; he will not even need his ministerial car for this journey &mdash; to go out of the cosy warmth of Leinster House and walk down past Dublin Castle which has been renovated at a cost of £17 million, converting it from a luxurious centre into a super luxurious centre to accommodate the ego trip demands of the Taoiseach and his Ministers who are flying all over the world at the expense of the Irish taxpayer.  The Taoiseach has told us that we are getting a cheap deal at £1.3 million for the jet. It would be better if the Minister did not go to the trouble of visiting Brunei, and God knows where else at the other ends of the earth, but stayed in this country and tried to help those in the poverty trap.  The sum of £1.3 million spent on the jet could go towards providing a health service and eliminating poverty.  The Government would be much better employed doing that rather than trying to emulate President Mitterand in his Presidency.  They should look at the GNP of France and compare it with the GNP of Ireland before trying to emulate the activities of that country and other wealthy states.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister who has said that the morale of the country has never been <Col N="278" /> higher to go around the corner from Dublin Castle and into an employment exchange.  There he should talk to the thousands of people at the exchange and hear what they say to him.  Let him ask a parent what it is like to watch their children growing up with no prospects of a job.  Let him talk to people who are terrorised by crime and drugs.  Let him go into a hopsital and see the chaos in the accident room.  Let him go to Dublin County Council or Dublin Corporation and have a look at the waiting lists.  Let the Minister go down to the docks or to the airport and talk to the families emigrating; and he tells us that morale in the country has never been higher.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be opposing this budget.  We will be fighting the cuts.  We will be fighting the régime that this Government espouses by every means at our disposal.  This is precisely what we intend to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be truthfully said, given the amount of press speculation and what I suppose could be described as inspired leaks over the last weeks, that we have had a fairly predictable budget.  It can also be said, having listened to the two hour contribution made by the Minister, that it is a fairly unimaginative one with no particular overall shape or substance. Despite the fact that it is one of the longest speeches in recent years, we do not see any coherent Government strategy to tackle the major problems of Irish society &mdash; unemployment, emigration, poverty, deprivation and tax equity.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of talk about creating the right climate but there is nothing specific. It is quite striking that the paragraph devoted to jobs talks specifically about training schemes and there is nothing about the specific involvement of Government in the creation of jobs and direct investment in the creation of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the public relations veil is pulled aside and the small print of the tax and social welfare reforms is examined in detail, most people will find that they are no better off than before.  Most disappointing and shocking is the complete <Col N="279" /> absence of any initiatives to reduce the level of unemployment.  It appears from this effort that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are quite prepared to tolerate the continuation of unemployment and emigration at their present appalling levels and to leave it to the free market, as the Progressive Democrats would describe it, to try to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>While some of the social welfare measures aimed at dealing with long standing anomalies are welcome, particularly the significant increase to the people, mainly women who care for elderly relatives &mdash; it would be churlish not to welcome that important increase which is something that all Deputies have sought over many years &mdash; the overall level of social welfare increases is quite inadequate in the context of the scale of poverty facing the country.  These increases are only generally in line with inflation.  Indeed, the Minister referred to inflation and tried to talk it down to 2.5 per cent.  There are, however, widely differing predictions as to what the inflation rate will be for the coming year. One significant prediction, that of the Central Bank, puts it at 4.5 per cent.  The principle of increasing the benefits in line with inflation would only be acceptable if the basic levels themselves were adequate, and this is clearly not the case. Many of the increases will simply be eaten up by price increases and rent increases in the local authorities which are already coming into effect.</P>
    <P>The extra increases for the long-term unemployed are, of course, welcome; but even with this increase a single person on unemployment assistance will still be getting about £10 per week less than the 1990 equivalent of the minimum levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The increase of 75p per month in child benefit can only be described as a joke.  It would not even buy an apple a week for a child.</P>
    <P>The failure to initiate a serious programme of tax reform will be a particular disappointment to the PAYE sector.  Ten years after the historic marches we are <Col N="280" /> still indulging in minor juggling around with the tax bands instead of genuine tax reforms.  The overall level of tax take from the PAYE sector will not go down and, despite all the promises, the question of ensuring a fair return from corporation tax has again been put on the long finger.  Despite the fact that the banks are expected to make profits of up to £500 million this year, this Government are apparently content to accept a derisory £35 million in the form of the bank levy.  Indeed, there is a signal in the Minister's speech today that if the corporate tax from the banks shows an increase over the next few years as a result of various changes in the legislation dealing with section 84, then he will look favourably at the bank levy.  That is a deplorable state of affairs.  What we should be looking for is an increased take from the bank, not a decreased take or even a levelling out of the take.  In addition, the tax changes will be far more beneficial to the well paid than to those on low pay.  Indeed, this is the effect of having allowances rather than tax credits, a reform which virtually every party in this House said they were in favour of many years ago and which has disappeared now completely.  While the middle level earners will benefit from the reduction in the upper rate of tax, the multimillionaires in our society, of which there are a significant number if we are to believe the reports in the business magazines, will benefit to an even greater extent, that is if they pay any tax at all on their income.</P>
    <P>A married couple with four children and one spouse earning £30,000 per annum will benefit to the extent of more than £500 from the tax changes while a similar couple earning £11,000, the average industrial wage, will benefit to the extent of £116 and, of course, will drift without any doubt at all, into the 48 per cent band before too long, particularly if they get any kind of slight increase in wages.</P>
    <P>I am shocked that, despite all the talk of tackling our environment and pollution problems, the Government have decided to actually increase the level of <Col N="281" /> VAT on electricity, one of the few pollution free sources of energy available to us and which we generate ourselves. Again, despite a commitment to end the sale and distribution of smokey coal by October next, no steps have been taken to reduce the level of VAT on smokeless fuels.  Are we going to have another budget before October or are the Government simply going to take no action to bring down the price levels of smokeless fuels?</P>
    <P>The level of additional funding provided for the health services is derisory and suggests that the Taoiseach, once again, either does not know the extent of the health crisis or simply does not care. Despite the virtual collapse of health services in many parts of the country this winter no extra funds are being provided. The case of the young woman, Samantha Webb, which was publicised in this morning's newspapers, graphically illustrates the plight of the mentally handicapped and their families in our society.  Given the extent of their problems the allocation of £2 million is an insult.  Those who care for the mentally handicapped &mdash; the voluntary organisations, the health boards and the families themselves &mdash; indicate that something like 1,000 residential places are needed for mentally handicapped men and women.  If all of the £2 million provided were to be spent providing that kind of accommodation, we are talking about £2,000 per person for a residential place, to provide staff, equipment and buildings.</P>
    <P>Despite the praise that the Government have been lavishing upon themselves for this so called economic miracle, no area illustrates the utter failure of successive Governments to meet the needs of the people as much as the area of job creation.  It is quite clear that the small reduction in the numbers on the live register in the past year has been due to the continuing extraordinary high level of emigration.  It is a scandal that unemployment continues to be in excess of 230,000, despite annual emigration now approaching 50,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> The climate for enterprise this Government are so fond of proposing, the previous Government also proposed this &mdash; the creation of a Shangri-la &mdash; and which has been dreamed and spoken about for so long by private sector employers, conservative politicians and economists, has arrived.  We have booming exports, profits, growth and productivity, modest inflation and industrial peace, but where are the enterprise and jobs?  They simply are not there.  What are we doing wrong? Why are the people who are making these vast profits, who have been provided with this industrial peace and who have been given the opportunity they have demanded for so many years, not investing in job creation?  The State spends more than £1,000 million in grants for the private sector, in industry, agriculture, tourism and fishing, yet the return in terms of new jobs is derisory.</P>
    <P>At the end of last year the Minister for Labour acknowledged that the private sector employers had failed to take advantage of the favourable conditions, implicitly admitting that the Government's job creation targets were in tatters. The Government's claim of 10,000 net new jobs in 1989 is not only totally inadequate but is based on questionable data on the creation of jobs in particular in the tourism area and are guestimates rather than real jobs.  These figures are produced by taking the assumed amount of money spent by tourists in different areas and dividing it by a particular factor so that we get X number of jobs in the tourism industry.  There is no evidence to show that the number of jobs being claimed for tourism actually exist.</P>
    <P>Thirty thousand net new jobs would be needed each year simply to stand still. Successive independent examinations of industrial policy, from the Telesis report commissioned in the seventies to the NESC report on Ireland and the European Community published last September, have pointed to the need for a change in strategy, but successive Governments have persisted in doing nothing more than throwing more and more money at the private sector with little to show for it in terms of sustainable <Col N="283" /> jobs with linkages to the economy.  There has to be a change in Government strategy if there is to be any hope of reducing unemployment and emigration.  The Workers' Party support the concept set out in the NESC report published last September of a far more active and interventionist role for the Government.  If the Government are serious in their declarations of concern about jobs and the level of unemployment &mdash; it must be said that they have only begun to express this concern fairly recently &mdash; then they must adopt a policy of direct intervention in investment in areas where jobs can be created and products produced.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party believe that the massive debt which reached one and a half times Ireland's gross national product and consumes all income tax in interest payments should never have been run up to such a level.  The practice of borrowing to fund current expenditure which was started by Fianna Fáil in 1972 and continued by them and the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, every year to the present time was a total disaster and a financial scandal of staggering proportions which will be viewed harshly by future generations.  We should borrow to fund current spending once or twice during a recession but to have done so every year until the national debt rose to £25 billion was a criminal act of economic and political irresponsibility.  A far worse crime was to try to rectify that irresponsibility on the backs of the poor and the ordinary people with penal taxes and the unplanned hacking to bits of our health, education and local authority services while at the same time extraordinary levels of company profits, capital and wealth went untaxed.  The extent of tax evasion and avoidance by the wealthy was only finally acknowledged in 1988 when a tax amnesty brought in more than £500 million.  I was told repeatedly in this House by various Governments since 1982 that this money did not exist.</P>
    <P>Nobody in his right mind would advocate a return to the profligate borrowing levels of the seventies and eighties. <Col N="284" /> However, judicious and carefully controlled borrowing to fund investment and capital projects is justifiable on economic and social grounds.  The Public Capital Programme published with the Book of Estimates was widely welcomed by ill-informed commentators because it increased spending over last year's level by a nominal 19 per cent, but they neglected to point out that overall public spending on investment is 55 per cent below the 1982 level.  The Public Capital Programme has to be a central element in any real attack on unemployment.  The figures provided for this year are inadequate and should have been increased by substantially more than the £9 million announced by the Minister today.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out already it is exactly ten years since 750,000 workers marched in the biggest political demonstration ever witnessed in this State demanding tax reform.  In the period since then there has been much tinkering with the tax system but there has been little or no fundamental tax reform.  The underlying philosophy of successive Governments is that wage and salary earners should pay most of the tax while the owners of wealth and capital should pay as little as they like.  There has been much ingenuity, double-talk and double-think invested in justifying this position.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made in relation to the self-employed in the past few years largely as a result of the tax amnesty and the introduction of self-assessment. However, the situation in relation to farmers remains abysmal. They paid only 1.6 per cent of the total income tax take in 1988 compared to the 79.3 per cent paid by the PAYE sector. In the years between 1984 and 1988 the average tax paid by the PAYE sector rose from £2,289 to £2,942 while the average tax paid by farmers fell from £703 to £664.</P>
    <P>Those on PAYE have had enough promises and they now want action.  Particular attention needed to be paid to the plight of the tens of thousands on or below the poverty line who are paying tax.  It is ludicrous that between 11 per cent and 18 per cent of those living in <Col N="285" /> poverty should be paying income tax which in more than half the cases amounts to £20 or more per week.  A real effort needs to be made to remove a substantial number of the low paid entirely from the tax net.  Between 1986 and 1989 successive Ministers for Finance claimed to have moved 52,000 people totally out of the tax net, yet the overall number of taxpayers has remained virtually the same.  The reason for this quite clearly has been that a tiny wage increase of even a few pounds a week has been enough to bring these workers back into the net.  Indeed, the claim made by the Minister today that his proposals will take 30,000 out of the tax net will prove to be untrue within months when people drift back into the tax net because they receive very small increases in income.</P>
    <P>Tinkering with rates is not tax reform. What is needed is a three pronged reform of the system which will adjust tax rates, tax bands and allowances.  As I said earlier, these allowances should be converted to tax credits which would be a much fairer way of applying allowances to taxpayers.  This would ensure that all taxpayers would have the same benefit from an allowance and bring a real measure of relief to low and middle earners.</P>
    <P>We have never argued that the overall level of the tax take should be reduced. The badly needed concessions to the PAYE sector have to be made up by increasing the tax take from those who have paid so little to date.  This will mean substantial increases in company and capital taxes and the reintroduction of a wealth tax.  If the wealth tax had been reintroduced at a rate of 5 per cent it would have brought in more than £50 million, according to the Minister's reply in this House.</P>
    <P>The level of corporation tax, which is a major fiscal problem and is highly dependent on multinationals which have low linkages into the domestic economy, is laughable.  Indeed what the Minister has done today makes this an even greater joke.  Corporation tax as a proportion of the total tax take in this State is way below international levels generally. <Col N="286" /> Figures I have with me show that apart from Greece, Ireland has one of the lowest levels of corporation tax as a proportion of gross domestic product.  The rate of corporation tax paid by companies in this country amounts only to 1.4 per cent of gross domestic product.  The figure is higher in every other country.  In Belgium the figure is 3 per cent; Denmark, 2.3 per cent; France, 2.3 per cent; Germany, 1.9 per cent; Italy, 2.9 per cent; Luxembourg, 7.1 per cent; the Netherlands, 3.7 per cent; Spain, 2.3 per cent and the United Kingdom, 4 per cent. The figure in this country is way below that in every other country with the exception of Greece where the figure is the same.  Therefore, there is a lot of ground to be made up in company taxation.</P>
    <P>The argument of course is that if you tax companies they will not invest and will go elsewhere.  Clearly, the rate of tax is not penal and we have a long way to go before it could be considered penal. The growth in allowances, especially in capital allowances, has guaranteed the continuing decline in the returns from corporation tax.  The present total tax levels are necessary in order to service the national debt and reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  However, the main burden is borne by the PAYE sector.  Since the existing 10 per cent rate on the manufacturing sector almost invariably works out in practice at a zero rating, only one in seven companies pay any tax at all.</P>
    <P>The effective tax rate, that is the percentage of profit actually paid in cash in tax by those companies who do pay tax, is about 7 per cent or 8 per cent.  I have already referred to the banks and what is particularly galling to the PAYE taxpayer is that, despite their massive profits which, as I said, are expected to be in the order of £500 million this year, having made in the region of £350 million last year, the banks are effectively paying no tax at all.  They certainly put tax in their accounts and set aside money to pay tax but when do we ever hear of them paying any?  They manage to do this by using tax <Col N="287" /> avoidance schemes.  I understand that the section 84 scheme enabled them to claim tax relief of £98 million in the past year. This is extraordinary at a time when we are only taking something like £36 million from them by way of the bank levy.  If they were paying taxation at an effective rate of 20 per cent on their profits, half the rate on non-manufacturing industry, we would be taking £90 million from them instead of giving them £98 million by way of tax breaks.</P>
    <P>What is also extraordinary is that the Government, despite being fully aware of what is going on, are prepared to turn a blind eye because of pressure from these staggeringly profitable enterprises.  If an effective tax rate of 20 per cent was applied we would get £100 million from them.  It is time that the Government decided to take tax from that area rather than continue to bleed the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>I want to make a number of points on the question of PRSI.  A number of groups, employer groups as well as conservative political parties in this House, have demanded a reduction in employers' PRSI contributions to create more jobs. This is a dubious argument at the best of times but it is important to bear in mind that this is virtually the only contribution that the multi-national companies in this country, who will repatriate £3,000 million this year in profits, make to the Exchequer.  The rate is one of the lowest in the world and it forms part of the social wage.  Any cut in the rate would effectively be a cut in all workers' wages.</P>
    <P>The argument is that if we cut the employers' PRSI contribution they will be more inclined to employ labour.  The reality of course is that no employer will employ anybody over and above the strict number they feel they need to do the job. Employers would be crazy and out of their minds to do so.  Therefore how can any of these people, that is, the economists and politicians, argue that by doing away with, or reducing the employers' PRSI contribution this would act as an incentive for them to create jobs?  The mind boggles as to what exactly they are at.  Of course what employers and <Col N="288" /> those who support them really want is a deregulation of the labour market.  They want to get out from under their social responsibilities.  If I was to welcome anything other than the meagre increases in social welfare it would be the Government's failure to succumb to the pressure to reduce the employers' PRSI contribution.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the health services and the case of Miss Webb who is severely mentally handicapped.  That woman has had to be brought home by care workers as there is no place available for her.  I ask the Minister or some other Minister to indicate to me in this House tomorrow how quickly the money allocated in the budget today will be used to rectify this immediate problem.  This woman is not the only person to find herself in this position.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of elderly parents around this country who do not get a night's sleep because of the problems they face with adult mentally handicapped persons and their worries about what will happen when they themselves die and who will care for their son or daughter.  In some cases there is more than one mentally handicapped son or daughter in a family. I want to get an indication from the Government of how quickly they intend to rectify this problem.</P>
    <P>Many points have been made on various aspects of the Budget Statement and I do not propose to go over any of them in detail, but a number of points need to be made before I conclude.  For instance, the question of the pupil-teacher ratio in our schools has not been addressed in the budget.  Last night I attended a meeting in my constituency where it was pointed out that because the number of pupils in a school has fallen from a figure of something over 500 to 495 the school will lose a guidance teacher.  It is probable that the school will lose other teachers also depending on redeployment to other schools.  No doubt the increase in the capitation grant to £10 will be of help, but the reality is that, despite a 490-pupil school getting some £5,000 extra, they will still have to service a debt which costs them around £20,000 a year and will for <Col N="289" /> the next ten years.  How are they going to deal with this?  This is but one example in the voluntary second level sector which can be duplicated in many other parts of the country.  This problem has not been dealt with in the budget.</P>
    <P>The damage which has been done to our health, education and local authority services has also not been addressed in the budget despite being told that the national debt has been stabilised and the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been virtually eliminated.  The need to achieve these targets was the excuse given for not attacking these problems. Despite being told that the national debt has been stabilised the budget has failed to deal with the damage which has been caused by the cuts during the past few years.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the family income supplement.  First, I welcome the proposal that the Revenue Commissioners include in the certificate of tax-free allowances a notice to employees that they have a right in certain circumstances to claim family income supplement. I have been arguing for this to be done over many years and I could not understand why it was not done.  We were told that 30,000 people were expected to avail of the FIS, yet something less than one-third of that have ever taken it up because, in my view, people did not know about it.  They did not know their rights. I welcome the fact that the Minister has finally arranged for this notice to be included in employees' wage packages.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the medical card for those claiming the FIS and it has come to my attention, and I am sure that of many other people in the House, that many people refused to apply for the FIS either because they feared they would lose the medical card or because they knew they would lose their medical card.  The Minister's statement today that he intends to eliminate that anomaly and therefore eliminate that poverty trap is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech presented a distorted picture of the job situation today.  The labour force survey indicates that for 1989 there were 1,000 people <Col N="290" /> fewer at work in the economy than in 1988, yet the Minister claimed today that there is an increase in the numbers of people at work.  Whether the Minister has deliberately misled the House or is misreading the statistics I do not know, but he needs to answer the question whether he is simply trying to present the best possible view of the economy and distorting the figures to prove it.</P>
    <P>I will leave it at that.  I do not believe this budget is going to do anything significant on the question of job creation in tackling the question of the vast loss of young people through emigration.  I do not believe it is going to lift the hundreds of thousands of people living in poverty out of it.  The Workers' Party will be voting against this budget tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> (1)  That the rebate of duty on mineral hydrocarbon light oil provided for in section 56(3) of the Finance Act, 1988 (No. 12 of 1988), shall, as respects mineral hydrocarbon light oil on which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that duty at the rate specified in section 40(1) of the Finance Act, 1989 (No. 10 of 1989), has been paid on or after the 1st day of February, 1990, be calculated at the rate of £2.56 per hectolitre.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the duty of excise on gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form imposed by section 41(1) of the Finance Act, 1976 (No. 16 of 1976), shall be charged, levied and paid, as on and from the 1st day of February, 1990, at the rate of £0.393 per gallon in lieu of the rate specified in paragraph 5(9) of the Imposition of Duties (No. 285) (Excise Duties) Order, 1987 (S.I. No. 19 of 1987).</P>
    <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>The purpose of this resolution is to give effect to a reduction in excise duty of 1.1p, including VAT, on a litre of unleaded petrol, which is the equivalent of 5p per gallon, including VAT, and also to give effect to an excise duty reduction of 43p, including VAT, on a gallon of auto LPG or, as it is commonly known, motor vehicle gas.  It is intended that these two reductions will take place from midnight tonight and will have the following estimated effect on Exchequer revenue. The cost of the reduction in unleaded petrol will be £6.5 million in 1990 and the cost of auto LPG will be £0.8 million, making a total of £7.3 million in 1990.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the reduction in unleaded petrol has already been referred to by the Minister for the Environment in his action plan and when it comes into effect it will mean a difference <Col N="292" /> of 10p between leaded and unleaded petrol.  This should give an impetus to the sales of unleaded petrol and is in pursuance of our environmental objective. The sales of unleaded petrol have grown from less than 1 per cent a year ago to 13 per cent of total petrol sales at present and we expect that this measure will result in an acceleration of that growth to 25 per cent.  We hope that 25 per cent of all petrol sales will be in the form of unleaded petrol.</P>
    <P>I will be pleased to answer any other queries that any Member may wish to ask.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (1), to delete &ldquo;£2.56&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;£3.56&rdquo; in the last line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the Taoiseach's question because this is the only day in the year when such an amendment is in order and to that extent the Taoiseach's intervention is understandable.  What this amendment effectively tries to do when you distil, no pun intended, the technicalities involved is to widen the price gap between leaded and unleaded petrol. <Col N="293" /> We welcome the spirit behind the proposal to attempt to get more people to use unleaded petrol than has previously been the case.  A figure of 13 per cent is a good achievement relative to the starting point.  Let us give credit where credit is due, but if the ultimate aspiration at this time is to achieve only 25 per cent of sales I do not think that is accceptable, having regard to the high profile position recently adopted.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach and to the Government that a wider price margin than 10 per cent, given their belief in the infallible efficacy of the market mechanism, would be necessary.  There is the additional reality that for many cars, conversion to unleaded petrol is simply not an option.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A brief correction: it is 10p, not 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant to say 10p.  A 10p price differential, in our view, is too small.  A target figure of 25 per cent consumption of unleaded as a percentage of total consumption of petrol &mdash; which is what I understood the Taoiseach to say based on Government calculations &mdash; is too modest.  The Government should be aiming for something higher.  Bearing in mind the age of our motor stock, the requirement for some cars to convert from leaded to unleaded &mdash; when one still must use leaded petrol every third or fourth fill &mdash; in order to persuade people into thinking that they should use unleaded petrol, even in cases where their cars cannot be properly adjusted, the price margin must be greater and the differential more attractive than simply 10p.  The Labour Party do not believe that this differential of 10p in the price of a gallon of petrol will be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason we have tabled our amendment to Resolution No. 1.  I would invite the Taoiseach or the Minister for the Environment to respond.  If necessary there might be some kind of adjusting mechanism introduced elsewhere within the overall budgetary framework.  But in regard to this measure, which has received much publicity, we do not <Col N="294" /> believe the Government have gone far enough.</P>
    <P>While not germane to this resolution I trust the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to suggest that if we are endeavouring to use the price mechanism to render people more environmentally friendly then it should not be confined to petrol and LPG; coal and other commodities should be included also.  I would invite the Government to do so.  In our view the proposed price differential incorporated in Resolution No. 1 will not be sufficiently wide to achieve the objective.  We are proposing this amendment to render that gap wider so that the exercise would be more productive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice in support of my colleague from the Labour Party and to give recognition to the fact that Fianna Fáil are moving somewhat in the right direction with the notion of making it an incentive for motorists to change over to the usage of unleaded petrol.  I remember that not so long ago previous Governments sought a derogation from their obligations within the EC to conform and allow the sale of unleaded petrol here.  It is my recollection that we fought the implementation of that EC directive every step of the way. Subsequent to that struggle with the EC and the threats on the part of the then owners of the Whitegate Refinery &mdash; who threatened the Government of the day with all sorts of statements to the effect that Whitegate was incapable of refining oil to a degree that would conform to the unleaded petrol standard or quality &mdash; ultimately the State took a correct decision, put Whitegate into public ownership for which The Workers' Party were very grateful at the time.  They took on the seven ugly sisters &mdash; the oil cartels &mdash; proving them wrong in their contention that they could not refine oil of the quality needed on Irish territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must bear in mind the incredible dangers to public health particularly with regard to children in terms of the absorption of lead into the bloodstream which ultimately lodges in the brain.  It has been <Col N="295" /> proved internationally that many children have died as a result of having been exposed to lead.  Indeed some unfortunate travellers here have died, through ignorance, having burned lead-lined car batteries.  Given the incredible health hazards and the prospect of brain damage the arguments for a wider price differential between leaded and unleaded petrol are indeed strong.  Bearing in mind that there are ever more cars being bought, given the disappointing statistics &mdash; here I stand open to correction &mdash; that fewer than 13 per cent of motorists, with the existing price differential, have moved away from leaded to unleaded petrol, there is need to provide a greater incentive to those motorists who are still reluctant, for whatever reason, to change their type of petrol.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that there is not a far greater uptake of unleaded petrol.  Because of the increasing use of cars, particularly in Dublin's inner city, the emissions are concentrated on a very small area.  Due to the lack of playing facilities in the inner city, many of the poorer children play on the streets and are therefore far more vulnerable to the accumulated lead particles that are emitted at the roadside than children in the outer suburbs and middle class areas where local authorities provide playing facilities.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I support wholeheartedly the notion that we should increase the price differential substantially, given that there is already a tremendous take by the State by way of duty on petrol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Quinn, I agree that this is a sensible move, a move in the right direction.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach what evidence there is for suggesting that a differential of 10p per gallon would achieve the result of bringing sales of lead-free petrol up to 25 per cent of the total sales.  Is there any empiric evidence for this?  Has a study been carried out of the elasticities in question, or is enough known about this to be <Col N="296" /> able to make that judgment?  It seems &mdash; and here again I would agree with Deputy Quinn &mdash; that the bigger the move we can make the greater the incentive will be to motorists to use lead-free petrol and the quicker there will be a noticeable effect on reduction in atmospheric pollution. I would like the Taoiseach to tell us what the evidence has led the Government to fixing a figure of 10p.  From the information he has given us, it seems that every penny of a further reduction would cost about £1.3 million.  If that is the case, I would like to know what would be the cost of going further, and if consideration could be given to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Government are going in the right direction on this issue but I do not consider the gesture is generous enough to achieve a target of 25 per cent of overall consumption. That is not a very commendable target considering the damage that can and does arise from the emissions of lead from motor cars into the atmosphere. There is concern that lead-free petrol is not as readily available throughout the country as it should be.  Even in the city the number of outlets still not selling lead-free petrol is very considerable. The Minister for the Environment, who is in the House, might consider how he can impress upon those outlets to provide lead-free petrol and how we can improve on the 25 per cent of total consumption, which is the target in the budget.</P>
      <P>Another point that must be considered is the volume of traffic on our roads. Vehicles that crawl along emit huge amounts of pollution into the air.  Allied to this is public transport and the replacement of the fleet in the cities.  The stock CIE are currently expected to use is old and is doing a great deal of damage to the environment.  The replacement of the fleet is inordinately slow due to the starvation of funds.  Those issues have to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We acknowledge that the Government have moved in the right direction.  The Workers' Party support the Labour Party amendment to achieve a higher target but <Col N="297" /> in the event of the amendment falling, we will support this small step in the right direction and hope that more earnest efforts will be made in the coming year to put matters right in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the Labour Party amendment let me say that a start has been made to promote the idea of lead-free petrol and motivating motorists to purchase it.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the first 13 per cent of take-up is, in a way, the easy step because the majority of those people were not enticed by the 5p differential to buy this petrol; they were genuinely motivated by a concern for the environment and understand the damage leaded petrol does to the environment. Regardless of the price differential, a minority of people would feel it was a good thing to switch to lead-free petrol, and would have done so as soon as it became available.  It has become more readily available thoughout the country in the last 12 months, but we still have a long way to go.</P>
      <P>The next step &mdash; from the 13 per cent to the Minister's target of 25 per cent &mdash; is far more difficult because we have to go beyond those who are motivated or educated enough to understand the consequences of using leaded petrol.  We have to reach out to people who have to be nudged and cajoled into buying it and the price mechanism is certainly one effective way of doing that.  The 5p differential has not worked because the base is low.  The Minister has now targeted 10p as being a sufficient differential to entice a quarter of the motorists to buy unleaded petrol.  I doubt that that is enough because if people decide to buy lead free petrol their cars will have to be modified, and there is an expense involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the exercise of the Labour Party's amendment is to create a positive financial incentive for people to buy unleaded petrol to go beyond the motivated, sensitive minority and to reach out to a much broader section of the community.  I believe the Minister's target of 25 per cent is very modest. Surely our objective should be to entice <Col N="298" /> the majority of motorists to buy unleaded petrol.  To pay lip service is one thing but to take concrete action in the sense of providing money for people to convert to unleaded petrol is another, and that is really what is required.  If we talk in terms of the green island of Ireland, we have an obligation to take concrete steps on issues such as unleaded petrol.</P>
    <P>The point that motivates me particularly is the quite clear case that is now being made on the health issue, the connection between lead pollution in the atmosphere and the damage it does to young children.  There is clear and growing evidence that the health, especially the mental health, of young children can be affected by a heavily polluted environment, particularly the heavy lead content in the atmosphere.  We have an obligation not to put our young children at risk.  In our cities in particular there is a threat to the development of young children from emissions from heavy traffic.  From a health perspective there is a very modest obligation on us to ensure that the majority of motorists on our public roads use lead-free petrol at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>I do not think the amendment put down by the Labour Party is unreasonable. The resources that would be lost to the State by making this adjustment could be recouped.  For that reason this amendment is desirable and laudable. Perhaps the Minister, when replying, would assure the House that the Government will do all they can to ensure that ministerial and other public vehicles will run on unleaded petrol.  I hope the Minister can give us that assurance.  It would be a very good start to this debate if the Minister or the Taoiseach accepted the case being put by all the Opposition parties, a case that is not fundamentally at variance with the budget as it just seeks to move in the direction in which the Minister wants to go at an accelerated pace.  It would be a very laudable start to this debate if the Minister accepted the reasonableness of the Opposition and accepted the amendment.</P>

      <P>We have 185,000 containers going northwards every year, being collected as far south as Cork and delivered as far south as London and there is no attempt to address the general question of the cost of transport which is costing industry twice the European average and £200 million more than it would cost if the average cost to industry here were the same as that in the EC.  Access costs are vitally important.  In the Border area the problem created is that 185,000 units are being taken northwards by northern carriers which constitutes a loss of £70 million worth of business to the Republic. With the advent of 1992 and the proposed changes in cabotage which would allow Northern carriers not just to collect in the South but to collect and deliver in the South which means they could collect in Cork and deliver in Dublin on petrol bought&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government on this bold and courageous move in increasing the differential with regard to unleaded petrol.  It will go a long way towards encouraging people to use unleaded petrol, but I would ask the Minister for the Environment to persuade petrol companies to provide the super unleaded petrol which is available in Northern Ireland and Britain but which is not available here.  Its unavailability is one of the reasons many motorists are reluctant to use unleaded petrol.  The normal grade petrol in many cases gives rise to a sluggish engine.  Also, many motorists are unaware of the small modification needed to adjust engines to unleaded petrol usage.  I was driving around for a long time before I could arrange to get the necessary modification.  Many other people have this problem.  It is not a case of not wanting to use the unleaded petrol but that they do not know how to get the modification done quickly.  A big publicity drive in that direction would encourage people.  People are not opposed to using unleaded petrol <i>per se.</i> We supply only the ordinary grade and not the super grade which is necessary for cars, and this should be borne in mind. A move by the Minister for the Environment might bring about the required result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of unleaded petrol will serve a very useful purpose and I hope that the Green Party represented by Deputy Garland will acknowledge the great move being made by the Government in this regard.  We have a big problem, as Deputy Byrne said relating to the inner city, having regard to hyperactivity in younger children which is a prominent sympton of lead intoxication.  Lead poisoning manifests itself in erratic <Col N="302" /> behaviour and is something that must not be under estimated by our health personnel.  The direction the Government have taken is in the best interests of the country.</P>

      <P>In the fourth line of subsection (1), to delete all words from and including &ldquo;charged, levied and paid&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;(No. 13 of 1986).&rdquo; in the seventh line and substitute &ldquo;abolished, as on and from the first day of February, 1990.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is that the information supplied to us indicates that we are only one of four countries in the European Community that has excise duties on soft drinks.  It has been established that a minimum of 8,000,000 litres <Col N="303" /> of soft drinks are smuggled across the Border from Northern Ireland each year.</P>
    <P>The level of consumption of soft drinks per head of population in this country is 58 litres per head compared with 75 litres per head in Northern Ireland.  All the statistics show that, as a result of the difference in price, we are inviting further smuggling from Northern Ireland if we continue the level of excise duty imposed at present.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach probably knows that 2,750 people are directly employed in the manufacturing plants supplying soft drinks, not to mention the additional revenue available to the State from subsidiary companies involved in other aspects, such as the provision of containers and so on.  I know that Deputy Garland wants to say a few words, so I ask the House to support our amendment to abolish excise duty altogether because there is no excise duty in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  As long as we impose excise duty we will face the continuous problem of large scale smuggling from Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go over past ground, and Deputy Byrne has spoken very eloquently about the damage which unleaded petrol causes to children. I congratulate the Government on their further gesture towards increasing the differential but it is not enough.  The very minimum should be 15p per gallon as against the 10p approximately proposed by the Government.  The sales of unleaded petrol are running at only 13 per cent which, while a big increase on a year ago, are still very small.  There is insufficient incentive in the Government's proposal to make much difference to motorists and I commend the Labour Party amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal that the differential between leaded and unleaded petrol should be far greater. However, I should like to focus on the question of excise duty on table waters. I hope that the reduction will be passed on to the consumer because our record <Col N="304" /> in recent times is not very good.  I will cite a few examples.  There is an excise duty of 36p on alcoholic beer and a 3p excise duty on non-alcoholic beer. However, in a pub they cost the same. The consumer is not getting the benefit, the person who benefits is either the publican or the brewery and there is a scam in that regard.  Because of lack of price control they are allowed to charge what they like.</P>
      <P>The same applies to currency fluctuations in relation to Polish coal.  There was a sevenfold devaluation in Polish currency but there was not one penny reduction in the price of coal to the consumer. There was a reduction recently in the price of coffee but, again, the consumer did not benefit.  I hope that any reduction in excise duties will benefit the consumer and that there will be some form of check and price control at retail level.</P>

      <P>It is perhaps a little unusual &mdash; but not unpleasant &mdash; to be debating a taxation resolution about which there is, if not agreement, at least a reasonably pleasant all-round atmosphere. I want to deal quickly with a number of points raised by Deputies.</P>
      <P>Probably the only real objection to the Labour Party motion is the cost, which would be about £8 million.  The Minister's proposal in the budget will cost £7.3 million in 1990 and, unfortunately, the Labour Party proposal would cost an extra £8 million.  On that score another suggestion could be made: you could widen the differential by reducing the price of unleaded petrol, putting something extra on ordinary petrol and having a neutral budget.  However, that would have the disadvantage, which I am sure would bring Deputy Blaney to his feet perhaps even more vociferously, of accentuating the difference between ourselves and Northern Ireland even more.  We must keep a delicate balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell asked about super-unleaded. I have very good news for the good doctor, super-unleaded is available in Dublin.  I do not know if I will be accused of commercialism but I might as well give credit where credit is due.  Shell <Col N="306" /> have 20 outlets in Dublin where super-unleaded is available, so we are progressing.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  The way to look at it is that we are making progress and Deputies generally agree with that although some of them would like us to go further.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, included this in his environmental package for which £20 million is provided in the budget.  It is not just in this respect that the budget is environmentally friendly because there is a total of £20 million, including this £7 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Diesel is not affected in so far as leaded or unleaded petrol is concerned.  We are trying to encourage auto gas because it is environmentally friendly too.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, also tells me that he is making efforts, apart from this price differential, to have all the Garda and semi-State cars use unleaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes asked if we had any evidence to indicate that this price differential would help the sale of unleaded petrol.  I should like to indicate to him that we have very clear evidence to that effect.  The reduction of 5p that the Minister introduced in the budget last year <Col N="307" /> was progressively improving the situation. I am told that it improved it quite dramatically.  In the first quarter that it was introduced there was a 1 per cent increase in its use, in the second quarter it was 5 per cent, in the third quarter it went to 7 per cent and in the fourth quarter it went to 11 per cent.  In December last it went to 12 per cent.  The House can see that increasingly it had an impact on the purchase of the product.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Labour Party amendment, I should like to point out that when this change comes into operation we will have a differential of 10p.  In Britain it is still only 8p.  I was asked about the number of outlets here.  I should like to tell the House that the number of outlets has been rising rapidly in the past 12 months.  At the end of 1988 and the beginning of 1989 there were only 75 but at the end of 1989, possibly because of the result of the 5p differential introduced in last year's budget, that figure had risen to 1,350.  We can accept that the price differential is improving the position.</P>
    <P>The increased differential of 10p will have a major impact but we should also supplement the incentive of this price differential by propaganda efforts.  I know the Minister for the Environment and Members of the House will play their part in trying to promote the sale of unleaded petrol because it is the way that we must go.  Eventually we hope we will have nothing but unleaded petrol for sale here. There is a long-term problem in that regard because about one-third of the vehicles in the country can never be adjusted for unleaded petrol.  We will have to wait to let the effluxion of time deal with that problem.  I hope the day is not too far away when we will have no leaded petrol being used.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> With regard to table waters, I should like to say it is only a question of price. Our modest proposal, which will reduce the ordinary bottle of lemonade and so on by about 5p, will cost us about £3 million in 1990 but if we were to do away with the duty altogether, as proposed by Deputy Barrett, it would cost another £17 million approximately.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In hard cash terms, the Fine Gael proposal would cost us £17 million in 1990.  If Fine Gael went into this a little more deeply they would be inclined to use that £17 million, if it was to spare, for some other more worthy purpose.  We are making a start here in eliminating the differential between ourselves and the North of Ireland.  All this is in preparation for 1992 and tax harmonisation.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to say I am grateful to the Members who contributed to the debate.  I can only repeat that we went a little down the road last year, we are going a little further this year and next year, all being well, we will go further again.  In the meantime we will use all our good efforts to promote the sale of unleaded petrol in addition to the incentive provided by this price differential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Resolutions Nos. 3, 4 and 5 deal with reductions in excise on televisions, video players and gramophone records and, of course, I would not for a moment oppose these moves.  I want to ask the Taoiseach if any arrangements have been made to take account of the difficulties of traders, if this is regarded as a problem, who hold stocks of these products which have been bought at the existing high rate of duty and who, because these resolutions will come into effect on 1 February, will be selling them at the lower rate of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember on a previous occasion when we reduced the excise duty on televisions there was a problem for those in the trade, particularly for those in the rental business, which had to be met.  I am glad to say we were able to work out an arrangement at that time which, althought not perfect, suited everybody and did not create any difficulties.  This involved a fairly delicate arrangement to make sure that traders, and in particular those in the rental business, did not get caught out.  I suspect that that problem still exists in relation to television sets. The problem would certainly not be as big in relation to video players and gramophone records but nevertheless there is a problem for the people who bought stocks at the high excise duty and <Col N="317" /> who will dispose of them after the reduction.  I should like to know if any measures are being taken to get over this difficulty.</P>

      <P>The only thing I can say by way of a broad general reply is that the changes these three resolutions will bring about will be in favour of the legitimate traders and whatever about short-term losses they will gain over a period of time.  The partial reduction in excise on televisions is to take account of the concern the trade have about stocks on hand if the duty was fully abolished. The trade would be concerned if the duty was abolished fully and to a large extent the partial reduction is in easement of the position of those who have stocks.  These traders will gain very quickly because these three resolutions will be in aid of the legitimate traders as distinct to those who smuggle stock.  The whole exercise is to help legitimate traders against those who smuggle stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I will be more specific because this is a particular corner of the problem.  People involved in the television rental business pay the appropriate rate of excise duty on television sets at the time of purchase and the price at which they rent out those televisions to customers clearly reflects the price they originally paid for them and the excise duty content.  If during the course of the rental the excise duty is decreased then a legitimate trader who has rented out stock which he has had for some years is at a disadvantage as against another legitimate trader who bought his stock when the excise duty was reduced. I want to know if any consideration has been given to that problem and if any measures have been taken to ease it. When we reduced the excise duty on a previous occasion it was regarded as a very substantial problem in the eyes of the trade.</P>

    <P>(4)  That this Resolution shall have effect as on and from the 1st day of March, 1990.</P>
    <P>(5)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are amendments down to this resolution so I will say as little about it as is necessary.</P>
    <P>This resolution provides for a reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 25 to 23 per cent.  I think this reduction will be very widely welcomed. It will achieve many objectives for us and <Col N="322" /> in particular it will mean the start of a move towards solving the problem of tax harmonisation which the Single Market will present to us.  It will also have a fairly considerable influence for the housekeeper, particularly those on low incomes.  This is a broad comprehensive band which includes practically everything and to that extent I am sure, small though it is, it will be very welcome to the shopper.</P>
    <P>The other part of the resolution deals with an increase in the rate of value-added tax on the supply of electricity from 5 to 10 per cent.  As everybody knows, the 5 per cent rate of VAT was imposed on electricity last year and was absorbed by the ESB.  It has been decided to go a step further this year and increase the rate to 10 per cent which also will be absorbed by the ESB so that there will be no cost to the domestic consumer.  Of course, other industrial consumers and business people will be able to recoup this money in their normal VAT transactions. This is another step towards what will be required under the tax harmonisation proposals.</P>
    <P>The third element of the resolution proposes an increase from 2 to 2.3 per cent in the flat rate compensation for farmers and the same increase in the VAT rate on livestock.  Deputies will recall the history of this refund of VAT to farmers and we are beginning to come back near the point which is calculated as a fair return to farmers who are not registered for VAT.  This increase to 2.3 per cent will be very near the point regarded as reasonable recompense to farmers for the VAT which they pay on their inputs.</P>
    <P>Broadly those are the elements in Resolution No. 8.  The most important element is the reduction in the standard rate of tax from 25 to 23 per cent.  In a way this is a very significant move in the right direction.  Of course, it is very costly: each 1 per cent of VAT in the 25 per cent band costs £38 million and the cost of the 2 per cent reduction will be £76 million.  However, it is the direction in which we have to go to undertake the disciplines of tax harmonisation in <Col N="323" /> connection with the completion of the Single Market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you say, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are consequential on amendment No. 1.  Amendment No. 4 in my name is a separate substantive amendment.  The major issue dealt with by the Taoiseach was the proposed reduction in the VAT rate of 25 per cent to 23 per cent which he described as a move towards harmonisation.  In so far as this seems to be fairly inevitable one must go along with it.  Of course, not everybody at the time of the enactment of the Single European Act and the consequent debate and referendum agreed that this was going to be the case. When people at that time, and my party opposed elements of it, argued that there would be a loss in tax revenue of the order of £600 million this was denied by Government spokespersons.  It would appear that that indeed is the case.  I accept that we must move towards harmonisation, that this is the first step in <Col N="324" /> that direction and that it will have an antiinflationary impact.  As such that particular section is not being challenged.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to delete paragraph (b) of subsection (2) in which it is proposed to increase the rate of value-added tax on the supply of electricity from 5 per cent of 10 per cent.  I take the strongest possible exception to this proposal and fail to understand how the Government could advance such a proposition. It is especially regrettable given the forecasts about the contribution from the corporate sector generally.  The Minister for Finance himself hinted that there would be a bigger take from the corporate sector.  For example, he specifically indicated that he was reconsidering the definition of what constitutes the manufacturing process but no effort has been made to increase the take from the corporate sector which is acknowledged as being the lowest within the EC.  It was virtually passed over untouched.</P>
    <P>In 1988, value-added tax was introduced on the supply of electricity at a rate of 5 per cent and it has been suggested that the rate be increased to 10 per cent.  The only reasonable conclusion one can reach is that if a State company is successful it should be penalised.  This is extraordinary given the Government's commitment to protecting the State sector.  Very specific undertakings were given by the Taoiseach to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in this respect. Much is heard from the other ring of the Government about less viable or commercially successful State companies, but here we have a particularly successful company, the ESB, and apparently it is quite legitimate for the Government to come along, once again, as they did in 1988 and put their hand into the till of this successful company.  In the meantime the corporate sector escapes unscathed.</P>
    <P>I submit that it is even more reprehensible than that.  Let us take the case of the associated banks.  In the 1989 trading year they made profits of £350 million and it is projected that they will make profits of £500 million in 1990.  However, no change has been proposed.  The proposed changes in the accelerated capital <Col N="325" /> allowances and section 84 based lending will have a very modest impact.  No attempt has been made to impose a special tax or to increase the present levy on the banks who are making extraordinary and unprecedented profits, yet the ESB must be penalised.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that this is hardly an even handed approach towards taxation.</P>
    <P>The ESB are a very successful company providing a relatively pollution free source of energy, until we provide some alternative and better sources.  They will face competition after 1992 and there is no particular reason from 1992 onwards, if any major user of electricity in the economy wants to import it like any other commodity, they should not be able to do so, yet any attempts by the ESB to gear themselves for that type of competition are being hindered by the measure proposed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable but this is one case where the predictions in the media have been proved correct.  The ESB have been subjected to special levies in the past and, despite all that has been said by the Taoiseach about commercially viable State companies making a major contribution to the economy, not only in terms of the product they market and sell but also in terms of employment, this company are being penalised in this disgraceful fashion.  When the commentators have an opportunity to go through the fine print of the budget they will see that one of the most outstanding features is the refusal to broaden the tax base and to at least make the corporate sector pay a contribution on a par with the contribution the corporate sector make elsewhere in the EC.  However no attempt has been made in the budget to do this, and it seems that Bord Telecom and the ESB, two outstandingly successful companies, are fair game to be rifled at will.  What the consequences for the consumer will be we do not know.  It is all very well to say that the consumer is protected in this case but what will the impact be on the price of electricity further down the line?  This is a backward decision by the Minister for Finance and <Col N="326" /> certainly we will be opposing it.  It may be preferable that I reserve the right to come back on amendment No. 4 later. We are only taking this one at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the proposal, and the amendment I have tabled accordingly, to increase the rate of VAT on electricity from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, I note the Minister in his Budget Statement today proposed to raise the VAT rate from 1 March next and that the increase would yield £11 million in 1990 and £18 million in a full year, and I quote from the speech: &ldquo;In order to ensure that prices charged to domestic consumers do not increase, I am arranging that the additional costs involved will be absorbed by the ESB.&rdquo;  What arrangement has been made to have the costs absorbed by the ESB?  How are the ESB going to fund that absorption and what does that mean in terms of what the ESB might otherwise be in a position to do about the prices they charge to their customers?  The Minister went on to say: &ldquo;Charges for VAT-registered businesses will remain unchanged as they will be able to reclaim the VAT element of their bills.&rdquo;  I may be wrong but that seems to suggest that as far as the charges for electricity made to businesses are concerned it is anticipated that the price will remain the same and instead of reclaiming a VAT element of 5 per cent which is the case now, from 1 March next the VAT registered business will be reclaiming a charge of 10 per cent, so the net position remains the same.  That will <Col N="328" /> not be the case for householders who cannot reclaim any VAT.  We need to know what is going to happen to ESB prices.</P>
      <P>The last financial year for which we have information available pertaining to the ESB is the year ended 31 December 1988.  According to the annual report of the ESB for that year, they had a surplus of £3.407 million in relation to their business in the generation and transmission of electricity, and when the other parts of their operation were taken into account, that is appliance sales, external activities and fisheries, the result for all activities was a surplus for that year of £5.413 million.  All of that came from a total revenue income for the ESB in that year of £712.710 million.  Therefore, the ESB are turning over roughly £700 million per annum.  Their costs in that year amounted to £709 million.  Of course, the figures would have changed by some margin since then for the most recent year.</P>
      <P>It seems that what is being proposed is that the ESB would be asked or obliged or in some way led into absorbing £18 million which would represent an addition of some 2.6 or 2.7 per cent to their total costs and a figure of slightly less than that as an imposition on their total revenue.  For the previous year ended 31 December 1987 the ESB had a deficit of £8.5 million on their electricity trading account and a deficit of £5.5. million on their overall operations.  The ESB also have a very high level of debt.  How a company like that are going to be in a position to absorb £18 million is something of a mystery to me.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to this a few moments ago. In previous years we have seen payments being taken from the ESB at an accelerated rate.  I think I remember in this House on a previous budget reckoning that something like seven years payments were being taken from the ESB in one year.  I do not know what effect an imposition of £18 million is going to have on the financial position of the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the financial position of the ESB is such that they can simply part with £18 million just like that, that raises another question.  What would <Col N="329" /> the ESB do with that £18 million if they did not have to hand it over to the Government in response to an increase of this nature in VAT?  Again, if we apply that to their electricity generation account we can see there is a potential there for a change of some 2.5 per cent in their price level and clearly the possibility that the change could in some cases or for some customers be bigger than that, depending on whether it was decided to apply that over the prices of all the electricity they sell or if they were to apply it selectively on some categories of customer. I take the view that the ESB are likely to be in a position to make the far more sensible decision about the use of resources of this kind than are the Government and, therefore, the case is by no means demonstrated that we need to have an increase in the VAT rate on electricity.  Neither am I at all convinced by the Minister's statement that this is to ensure that arrangements have been made that will ensure that prices charged to domestic consumers do not increase.</P>
    <P>Before we go further with this measure the Taoiseach should explain to us what the financial capacity of the ESB is to this and what kind of arrangement has been put in place to ensure that the price of electricity to domestic consumers does not increase.  Unless and until we know those things this House is not going to be in a position to make any kind of informed judgment simply on the basis of the assertions the Minister has given here today.</P>
    <P>Another proposal is VAT on telecommunications. I am given to understand that the reason this is not in the resolution before us is that it is proposed to come into operation with effect from 1 July next and, therefore, the matter does not need to be dealt with in a resolution here tonight but can be dealt with in the Finance Bill we will be dealing with later on.  In relation to VAT on telecommunications, the Minister makes the following point:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Allowing for the fact that BTE will now be able to reclaim VAT on its inputs, the charge will yield a net £3 <Col N="330" /> million to the Exchequer in 1990 and £11 million in a full year.  I am confident that this initiative can be implemented without increased costs to telephone users, both households and VAT-registred businesses, bearing in mind the ability of BTE to recoup VAT on inputs...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That raises a number of questions.  The charge would yield a net £3 million to the Exchequer in 1990 and £11 million in a full year.  The Minister is again suggesting that this can be absorbed in some way by Bord Telecom Éireann.  He was much less firm about that assertion than he was about the ESB, as he had made an arrangement with them, but in this case he is simply confident that this can happen without affecting the telephone consumers.  As my colleague, Deputy Noonan said this afternoon, it seems that the Minister has a much firmer grip on what happens in the ESB than in Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the case is that the effect on telecommunications charges is not as big as one might think because there is a substantial element of trapped VAT in the operations of Bord Telecom Éireann.  Bord Telecom Éireann pay VAT on a lot of their inputs and purchases and, not being a VAT registered business, they can neither charge, nor reclaim VAT.  If VAT is applied, this trapped VAT can be reclaimed and BTE will be in a more competitive position.  I assume that is what the Minister had in mind when he indicated that the effect on consumers would not be great.  I would like the Taoiseach to expand on that, and if that is the case to say how much VAT is trapped and what the effect of this will be on telephone charges.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister is not able to tell us that the charge will be passed on to consumers because BTE would be adding VAT to every consumer's bill. While this is acceptable for a VAT registered business or person, it means that the ordinary householder has an extra charge imposed on his telephone bill.  If we create a situation where BTE can get the VAT trapped out of the system and thus <Col N="331" /> be more competitive, what steps can the Minister take to prevent them from doing the very thing that gets rid of the blockage that traps the VAT, i.e. passing on the VAT to their customers?  We have had no information from the Minister on the amounts involved, the methods involved or why he is confident that this will not affect the consumers.  I contend that whatever the case of the business consumer and the advantage to Bord Telecom Éireann in terms of freeing the trapped VAT, there is absolutely no doubt but that a VAT charge will find its way into the telephone bills of the ordinary domestic consumer and the many people who are trading in businesses of various kinds but are under the VAT registration threshold and are not registered for VAT, and whose businesses therefore have to carry VAT.</P>
    <P>I now come to the third matter dealt with in this Financial Resolution, the rate of VAT refund to unregistered farmers. In our amendment No. 5, I am proposing that we substitute the figure 2.5 per cent for 2.3 per cent.  Of course, I should point out that there are two consequential amendments to amendment No. 5, which will be circulated to Members very shortly.  The reason I am raising this amendment is simple and the Taoiseach has admitted the case for it.  The Taoiseach said &mdash; and I think my recollection of what he said a few minutes ago is correct &mdash; that in proposing a rate of 2.3 per cent this year the Government are moving back nearer to where the figure should be.  My contention, and the Taoiseach appears to agree, is that the figure should be more than 2.3 per cent.  In fact, I believe some experts claim that the figure should be around 2.6 per cent or 2.7 per cent &mdash; I am not sure if that is correct but it should certainly be more than 2.3 per cent &mdash; and I propose a figure of 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have to say to Deputy Rabbitte and to Deputy McCartan, who is not in the House at present, that their proposal to delete that section would amount to putting an extra tax on farmers as we would be deleting the refund of VAT trapped <Col N="332" /> in the cost of their inputs and which they cannot reclaim because they are unregistered for VAT.  This Government and their predecessor changed the flat rate refund to unregistered farmers in the first instance because they claimed farmers were not paying their proper share of tax. Ever since that proposal was first made I and my colleagues have argued that whatever may be the truth about whether farmers were paying their proper tax, the way to resolve the issue is not by interfering with the VAT system by looking at the accounting and collection mechanisms so that we can determine what tax individual farmers should be paying and find ways of taking the tax from them legitimately, above board, and in a way that is fair between one farmer and another.</P>
    <P>Trying to resolve this problem by messing with the flat rate of VAT refund is unfair because one has no idea of the circumstances of individual farmers or how they are affected by this.  It is also inefficient.  It gives rise to a great deal of ill informed and misleading comment and belief about the farmers' tax situation. This figure should not have been interfered with in the first place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan was quite right this afternoon when he said to Members on the benches opposite who seemed to be happy that the figure was being changed to 2.3 per cent, and I quote &ldquo;it is like being thankful to the hangman for loosening the noose around one's neck&rdquo;. The interference that this Government and their prodecessor operated in relation to the flat rate of VAT was actually cutting off funds that should have been going to farmers by right to compensate them for VAT that is included in the cost of their inputs.  The rate of 2.3 per cent is not enough and I propose that it should be raised to 2.5 per cent.  I know for a fact that a good many Deputies on that side of the House agree with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I only require clarification on these proposals and Deputy Dukes has referred to one of my concerns.  The Taoiseach has assured us that private consumers of electricity would not suffer because arrangements had been made with the ESB to absorb the VAT charge and that the VAT registered businesses would be able to offset this charge against VAT on their inputs.  However, no reference was made to the small businessman who is not registered for VAT and is striving to survive.  The small shopkeepers at country cross-roads are trying to compete with the big supermarkets and are giving a very necessary social service but they are not in the registered for VAT league.  There is no mention of how they will survice when this charge is passed on to them and no arrangements appear to have been made with the ESB to relieve them of the VAT charge.  I understand why we want to harmonise the VAT rates.  However, if you cannot claim back the VAT and if no arrangements have been made with the ESB, small businesses will be at a disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Dukes' concern about the possible increase in telephone charges to private subscribers.  I have no doubt that the provision in this Financial Resolution will find its way onto the telephone accounts of ordinary subscribers, who are not normally registered for VAT and therefore cannot offset this charge. When the Taoiseach is replying, he might reassure this side of the House about the effects of this on non-registered small businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice of objection to the proposal to increase the rate of VAT from 5 to 10 per cent on electricity supply.  It is similar to the exercise engaged in by the Government in recent years, that of raiding the coffers of the Central Bank.  Here again the Government are putting their hungry claws on what is supposed to be a semi-State company independent of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes has gone in fair detail into the implications of the increase in <Col N="334" /> VAT.  This proposal prompts the question as to why, &ldquo;if the Taoiseach and his Government are satisfied that the ESB have the resources and potential to come up with the £18 million, that £18 million is not being passed on to the consumer by way of reduced electricity charges in future years?  No, the Government will take it.  In effect it constitutes an attack on industry and job creation because certainly it will increase industrial costs.  I am concerned about industries in my constituency, such as Irish Steel, over which there hangs a question mark at present, who are high consumers of electricity. Rather than the Government taking the £18 million within a full year, if that were passed on to industry it would mean much to them, possibly constituting a life line for many.</P>
    <P>I would describe this as an anti-job creation measure on the part of the Government.  It is ironic that a Taoiseach who prides himself on carrying out a Green Presidency in Europe now imposes a tax on one of our cleanest sources of energy.  Despite the environmental action programme being announced with much aplomb over the past few days we now have an alternative source of energy being taxed.  That is the height of hyprocisy.</P>
    <P>I strongly object to the increase in VAT on electricity supply for two reasons, that it is, first, anti-industry and, second, anti-environment.</P>
    <P>In addition the imposition of VAT on telephone charges will also act as a disincentive to job creation.  We are not fools. We know that ultimately that cost will be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the increased VAT on electricity supply. It has to be said that our electricity is under-priced in that the costs of the input to our power stations &mdash; coal, oil and turf &mdash; do not include an allowance for depletion.  Unfortunately the vast bulk of our electricity is generated from nonrenewable resources.  We must endeavour to spin out these precious resources for as long as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This modest increase in tax will tend <Col N="335" /> to encourage us to continue our efforts on energy conservation in its many forms. Reductions in power consumption will also have the effect of reducing the pollution caused by acid rain from the Moneypoint power station.  This power station is an absolute disgrace as it still pumps out this acid rain.</P>
    <P>In addition, we must bear in mind that the burning of fossil fuels in our power stations contributes to global warming, the so-called greenhouse effect.  Contrary to what Deputy Allen says about this move being anti-environment and anti-job creation, I contend it is quite the opposite because the higher one's energy prices the more expensive will be any form of mechanisation in factories.  In fact it encourages labour-intensive industry by maintaining the costs of energy as high as possible.</P>

      <P>I must disagree almost totally with what has been said by the representative of the Green Party.</P>
      <P>Rather I want to attack the Taoiseach and his Government on their attempts to increase energy costs to consumers by the imposition of increased VAT on electricity supply.  The fact that the Minister for Finance should propose to increase the cost of electricity to consumers in the very week that his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has endeavoured to sell himself as a whiter than white antipolluter, as an environmentally friendly Minister, surely exposes the sham of the Taoiseach attempting to be seen as a Green President of the EC.  It is quite unacceptable that in the same week the Minister for the Environment decided to ban the burning of bituminous coals the Minister for Finance should increase the cost of electricity, probably the cleanest of all our energy sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out that any increase in electricity costs will have a severe effect on hard-pressed consumers, particularly low income families or people who opted for the electricity option in smoke controlled zones, for example, those in <Col N="336" /> Ballyfermot.  There is no doubt in my mind that with the increased cost of electricity the poor and low-paid will, in ever-increasing numbers, join queues to community welfare officers in order to obtain assistance in paying their hefty quarterly bills.  Is the Minister not aware that the banning of coal combined with VAT increases on electricity supply will push many more low income families into the poverty trap?</P>

Where is the logic in the suggestion that because this is the case with regard to turf or some other fuel, if it is added on to the cost of electricity nobody will have to pay it?

The Minister for Finance seems to be anxious to establish that in moving towards 1992 and the harmonisation of VAT and other taxes, the problems for this economy will be so enormous that we will have to get some compensation.  Surely then it follows that we are losing our competitive edge by increasing the cost of electricity in this manner.  I do not understand why this energy item should be increased at this time when it plays such an enormous part in the production of the goods and services that we export and that people need for their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would comment on one other matter which has not been mentioned.  While there has been a VAT rebate of 2 per cent in existence for farmers, its administration leaves a lot to be desired.  This figure is now being increased to 2.3 per cent.  The people in the agricultural offices have not been expeditious in their acknowledgement of the claims of these unregistered farmers.  Quite a number of complaints have been received in this regard and I am quite certain that Fianna Fáil Deputies as well as Opposition Deputies have received them.  Reform is needed in this area so that farmers are not left without payments for a long time. The conditions under which people apply for this money should be re-examined and the applicants should be notified in the public press as to what they should do.  The Minister for Agriculture and his Department, who must have the worst <Col N="339" /> record as regards acknowledging representations from Deputies, should do more to expedite the repayments of VAT to farmers.</P>

      <P>I indicated when I was moving my amendments to Financial Resolution No. 8 that I wanted to advert to amendment No. 4 which has been ruled out of order.  I take it that the Fine Gael amendment which proposes to increase the rate from 2.3 to 2.5 per cent is in order.</P>

      <P>I would like to take the opportunity then to make a few remarks in opposition to the Fine Gael proposition that the figure be increased to 2.5 per cent.  The Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dukes, argued that if somebody wished to oppose this amendment, they should come up front and say that the tax collection system or the tax system itself is inadequate, inefficient or not appropriate to farmers.  He may well have a point in that.  I agree that the system is not adequate, that the collection system is not sufficiently policed but even if we had the best and most suitable tax mechanism in place for farmers there would still be serious questions to be raised about this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes said that 2.3 per cent is not adequate and Deputy Carey reiterated that view.  I would like to know what I am being asked to support.  Why is 2.3 per cent not adequate?  For that matter, why is 2 per cent not adequate?  How is one supposed to know this?  The farmers in question are not registered.  Why are they not registered?  I have had occasion <Col N="340" /> in a different capacity to come face to face with the farming community and farming leaders in the last ten years when taxation generally was a very contentious and controversial issue.  During that period farmers said they wanted to be treated equally with the rest of the community. That was one of the favourite catchcries.  Why must other businessmen or traders be registered for VAT before they can lodge any reclaim?  It appears that what is being confirmed here is the practice that has gone on for so long whereby there is no necessity on this section of the farming community to register and yet they may submit such reclaims as we seem to be guesstimating here.  We are all expected in this House, irrespective of our point of view, to support that.</P>
    <P>I can find no figures for the amount of VAT paid by unregistered farmers.  I am not even sure who they are.  How broad a spectrum does it cover?  There are figures available for the refunds and, as the Taoiseach remarked in opening this discussion, there is a history attached to it. In 1979 the refunds were £6.9 million, in 1986 they were £79.4 million; the figure was increased by £12 million last year and we are now being asked to agree to an additional £6 million in this budget.  I cannot understand why one should regard this additional £6 million as other than another hand-out or subsidy to the farming community.  I accept entirely that serious distinctions can be drawn within the farming community.  My overriding perspective in approaching this budget was that it ought to shift some of the burden from the PAYE sector to other sectors of the economy &mdash; the wealthy, the corporate sector and so on but there has been no such shift.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has played around within the flexibility given him, earned, he would say, by the policies he has pursued for the last three years; earned, I would say, on the backs of the PAYE sector and some of the most vulnerable section in our community. There is no shift involved.  It is extraordinary that we seem to be proposing here to hand back in refunds a figure in taxation that we cannot audit or ascertain.  I <Col N="341" /> do not know what kind of inputs are in question.  It may well be that some of the milk parlours around the country &mdash; the Taoiseach has certain familiarity with milk parlours &mdash; are better furnished than many of the people who advise the Minister in the Department of Finance are aware of.  It is extraordinary that we are being asked to hand back roughly twice as much money in VAT refunds and inputs as the entire farming community pay in tax.  I do not think that is equitable, nor do I think it is being anti-farmer.  I certainly do not see any merit in the Fine Gael proposition that the rate should be further increased from 2.3 per cent to 2.5 per cent and I will be voting accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First of all, I would like to discuss briefly the amendment in the names of Deputies Paul Connaughton, Alan Dukes and my name, which proposes to increase the tax rebate from 2.3 to 2.5 per cent.  The term &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; covers a variety of cases.  It ranges from people who are extremely well off to people who are very poor. Only the well off, highly developed farmers are registered for VAT and it was always thought appropriate that those who were not registered for VAT should be able to get a VAT rebate for their inputs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since it would take a multiplicity of civil servants to monitor the registration of several thousand farmers and since the sums involved in many cases would be quite small, this mechanism was derived for giving a notional or generally estimated rebate to farmers.  In 1987 the then Deputy MacSharry as Minister for Finance reduced this in a kind of stick and carrot operation to get farmers to pay the health levies which had run seriously into arrears.  When the Minister reduced <Col N="342" /> the VAT rebate he tied it directly to the payment of the health levy and said that when the health levy was brought back up and the arrears were cancelled out, he would restore it.  I understand there were talks between the farming organisations and officials of the Minister's Department at the time and that they considered that the appropriate level based on their information was 2.5 per cent or 2.6 per cent.  In this amendment we are urging the Minister to fulfil the commitment given by his predecessor and to restore it to the figure agreed by officials of the Department, representatives from Revenue, the IFA and possibly the ICMSA.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Finance in his reply set the VAT increases on electricity and on telecommunications in the overall context of harmonisation?  As I understand it, the agreement which was reached at the end of the French Presidency was that we have an obligation now to move the standard rate of VAT to below 20 per cent by 1993.  Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister is saying something different now. Would he also state if we have a commitment to raise and apply a lower band of VAT than 10 per cent to all fuels, because I understand no such commitment has been entered into yet and we are free, for example, to leave electricity at 5 per cent or we can take it up to 10 per cent or 23 per cent as it is now, or back to zero if we think it an appropriate zero rated item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have set the VAT increases on electricity in a wider context. There is a very strong argument for moving the VAT rate on fuels which are <Col N="343" /> environmentally friendly down to zero and an equally strong argument for moving fuels which are not upwards. Electricity is a very environmentally friendly fuel at the point of use although it is not particularly environmentally friendly at the point of production, especially if we are talking about coal burning stations, but at the point of production it is subject to other forms of remedial measures, particularly the installation of catalytic devices.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the proposal that the ESB should absorb the increase. That is not the way to do business.  The revenue should be separate from the activities of State-sponsored bodies. There should be a clear demarcation line so that there is no doubt about what is included in the balance sheet of any semi-State organisation.  It should have the same rules as any other company, but once there is a nod and wink agreement or a written agreement, it will lead to fudging and the consumer will not know what he should be paying for electricity or to what degree the price of electricity is being forced upward by the Government to enable them to subsidise the revenue.  It should be transparent and it is bad practice to fudge it and make it unclear in this respect.  It was done when the 5 per cent rate was introduced and it is being compounded now, and from some time in the summer it is being extended to Telecom Éireann as well, if the authorities there agree with this device.</P>
    <P>I notice from the table that £11 million is being collected from the ESB on this basis.  I presume that is the 1990 figure and that it will be £18 million in a full year.  I did not realise that the ESB balance sheet was that healthy.  I thought that by any commercial criteria the ESB were over-borrowed, that they had an overhang of borrowing which would not be sustainable if they were a private company exposed to private competition, but because they are a semi-State organisation and a monopoly supplier, they could carry this level of borrowing, and that it is underpinned by the State.  In the <Col N="344" /> final analysis, that means it is underpinned by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I have not got the latest ESB accounts in front of me but my memory is that in 1988 they showed a profit of £5 million.  I cannot see how they can have £18 million now.  This brings me back to my first point.  If they can afford to absorb £18 million, an obligation which the Minister is now imposing on them, could they not better use the money to solve their capital problem or to reduce the cost of electricity? The cost of electricity should be coming down, but it is not.  As long as we keep the inputs into all sorts of activity artificially high, we will lose competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that business can claim it back, but can the farmer using electricity to milk 40 cows claim it back? Can the guesthouse owner taking tourists and using a lot of electricity in the summer claim it back?  They can if they are registered for VAT but, since small farmers are not registered for VAT, they are not in a position to claim a refund. The exemption limits for VAT registration now, with the movement towards tourism and farming and the combined form of agri-tourism, would leave most guesthouse owners below the limit for registration.  I know the Taoiseach has had a long day and that he is weary, but we are all tired.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am sorry if I got to the Taoiseach today.  I appreciate that he is not in the best of humour so I will not enter into a slagging match with him.  I will continue to make my point which is that it is bad commercial practice and bad Department of Finance practice to fudge the issue of VAT collection from the ESB and the collection of revenue.  If generation of electricity adversely affects the environment &mdash; especially when it is generated in large coal burning stations &mdash; would it not be <Col N="345" /> better if the ESB used this £18 million to put in a proper catalytic device in the station giving the problem?  This would ensure that the finger would not be pointed at us across Europe as being one of the contributors to acid rain.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Taoiseach seems to be bored with my speech.  Many people are bored by the budget as they have been reading its details for the last three weeks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on the VAT on electricity.  The Taoiseach, in another context, expressed himself as a great supporter of the traditions of this House, of the Constitution and the rule of law.  That being so, I must express some degree of surprise that the Taoiseach went along with this &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; regarding the extra VAT on the ESB.  It is contrary to the rule of law, it is highly undesirable and a very dangerous precedent to adopt.  The matter of taxation, which of course includes VAT, is one for this House and it must be dealt with by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of arrangements that may <Col N="346" /> take place between a Minister and a semi-State organisation are not a matter of law.  We would not have a say in private arrangements between the Minister and the ESB and the ESB would not be bound by any such arrangement as there would not be a contract.  What is going on?  The imposition of this rate is very serious for the ESB, leaving aside the position of the Taoiseach and the Minister.  The ESB are a semi-State body and a wholly owned subsidiary of the State.  Are they retaining £11 million or £18 million of public money until it suits the convenience of the Coalition Government?</P>
    <P>A long time ago I heard that the board of the ESB were in the pocket of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; I am sure that is not true &mdash; and that they would hold their funds until it suited the Fianna Fáil Government to take them out of the deep recesses of their bookkeeping arrangements. The imposition of extra VAT is strong evidence that there was something in the accusation.  It is not a legal or conventional way to behave in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>How do we know that a sum of £11 million or £18 million is available?  Maybe it is more.  It could be anything.  How do we know what connivance is taking place behind closed doors?  If there is a surplus the public should be told about it.  Even private companies, under regulations, have to publish their full accounts.  If the ESB have a surplus they should reduce the cost of electricity to consumers.  Electricity is crucial for domestic purposes and many of my constituents are in dire financial trouble and their electricity has been cut off because they cannot pay their bills.  If the electricity bills were reduced by the equivalent of £11 million or £18 million per year they might be able to provide heating and lighting because there is no gas in Tallaght.  That would be lawful, appropriate and would make sense.</P>
    <P>They could also use it, as Deputy Noonan suggested, to improve their infrastructure.  If they did not want to do any of those things it would be appropriate to pay it as a dividend to the Minister to be used for general tax and revenue <Col N="347" /> purposes.  If they did that the Minister's need for VAT would be reduced and he could take it into account in his book-keeping arrangements.  The Minister, in saying that he had arranged with the ESB to absorb the increase, has taken the matter outside the domain of this House, the law and the Constitution and brings it into a back room position.  We do not know what exchanges took place but anyone who has seen &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo; can imagine what went on in the clubs over a whiskey and soda.</P>

Where will that sort of arrangement end?  The Tánaiste may laugh but this kind of trickery undermines the democratic process.  It is the thin end of the wedge because when you go down that road the sky is the limit.</P>
      <P>We had this kind of trickery before when the price of oil went down appreciably. The Government took advantage of a price reduction to which the public were properly and lawfully entitled.  A short time afterwards, when the price of oil went up, they did not absorb it.  With respect, I am surprised that the Taoiseach allowed himself to be involved in this.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the level of VAT on electricity.  I will be listening with interest to the Taoiseach's reply because he said the increase is as a result of tax harmonisation in Europe. He made the point that all electricity charges across Europe are taxed at 10 per cent.  Is that true or is he endeavouring to have a rate of 20 per cent agreed? Countries are not being allowed to move out of the 14 to 20 per cent VAT range before 1 January 1993.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House why it is that we are moving toward tax harmonisation in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to Deputies Noonan and Taylor, I am concerned about the <Col N="348" /> ESB, a semi-State body, being made liable for this charge.  The Minister for Finance told us this afternoon that he was arranging that the additional cost involved will be absorbed by the ESB but the board issued a statement this evening to the effect that they were considering the Minister's move.  It appears from their statement that the Minister did not have any discussion with the board prior to introducing his budget and I wonder if it is his intention to direct them to absorb the additional cost.  Will this be the subject of a Government directive to the ESB?  The Taoiseach should clarify the position.  What authority have the Government to issue a directive to a semi-State body that up to now have operated at an arms length from the Government or is the Minister taking it upon himself to direct the board to be responsible for £11 million in VAT this year and £18 million next year?  The procedure being adopted is unusual and it concerns me.</P>

The first point I should like to deal with is one raised by Deputy Ferris. He is right in what he said about small businesses which are not registered for VAT.  In that regard they have, of course, the option to register for VAT.  The House will be aware that the registration limit is £15,000 per annum or £300 per week for industries in the services sector and £1,000 per week for those engaged in the supply of goods.  There is a small anomaly there but I have suggested the way it could be dealt with.</P>

However, I should like to make the simple point that to increase the 2.3 per cent that we propose to 2.5 per cent would cost an extra £4 million.  In fact, it would be over compensating the farmers concerned.</P>

      <P>The point is that the 2.5 per cent would over compensate, would cost £4 million extra and, in any event, it is almost certain that we are not allowed under the EC general directives to over compensate.  In my view 2.3 per cent is a fairly reasonable proposal at this stage having regard, as I mentioned to Deputy Rabbitte, to the whole history of this and how it was introduced in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Rabbitte that the 2.3 or 2.4 per cent can be reasonably accurately calculated.  It is the unregistered farmers who pay VAT on inputs.  Not being registered there is no way they can get back the VAT they pay on their inputs.  It was calculated reasonably accurately by economists, officials in the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance that 2.3 per cent, or something of that order, would be a reasonable amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I just mentioned that small businesses can be exempt.  In the case of farmers there is a very good reason for us encouraging them not to register because it would be only adding an enormous administrative problem without any recompense.  The vast majority of inputs and sales by farmers are zero-rated.  We would be bringing a whole mass of people into the VAT system for no purpose.  The existing system is a good, sensible, working one. The 2.3 per cent is reasonable at this stage.  The full amount was at one time given to farmers but it was reduced for particular reasons.  Now slowly it is being put back up to what is calculated to be the right level.  Deputy Rabbitte has put up a good argument but the answer is <Col N="352" /> that it suits the system not to have all farmers registered for VAT but to have the majority of them dealt with in this way.</P>
      <P>The telephone matter does not arise at this stage, but for the information of the House I would mention that the exemption of the telephone service from VAT was based on a derogation we got when the terms of the sixth VAT directive were announced.  At that time telephone services were provided directly by the State. Now they are provided by Bord Telecom and it is almost certain that the derogation would no longer be valid.  At any rate we will have to put VAT on the telephone service.  The Minister has in mind that the VAT will be paid by Bord Telecom to the State but will be carried by them.  That is a perfectly sensible arrangement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor made a long case which I do not think has any validity.  He talked about the law, the Constitution and the validity of what is being done.  What is being done in regard to VAT is absolutely straightforward.  VAT is being applied to electricity charges.  That is not being done for the first time.  Since last year VAT at the rate of 5 per cent was put on electricity charges.  This year it is being increased to 10 per cent.  It is perfectly legal and straightforward and the same as VAT levelled on any other goods or services.  The Deputy seems to be objecting that the Minister for Finance is making an arrangement with the ESB that they will carry this VAT and not pass it on.  That happens all the time.  On umpteen occasions I have heard Ministers say that they are putting tax or excise on this or that product or service but they are arranging with the company concerned to carry the cost and not pass it on to the consumer.  It is standard practice in the administration of our financial business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Enright seems to suggest that the ESB will not be able to pay this extra 5 per cent.  It has to be found somewhere. Would he not accept that maybe the ESB could find it through increased efficiency <Col N="353" /> or through better operations?  Maybe the price of oil to the ESB will come down.</P>

      <P>If this were a totally new arrangement I could understand some discussion in the House and some surprise that the Minister was able to make this brilliant change in getting in extra revenue from VAT without costing the consumer a penny.  That is what Deputies are giving out about.  I would be prepared to have a long discussion about it tonight and explain it in detail if it were not for the fact that this happened last year.  The Minister then put 5 per cent on the supply of electricity to the domestic consumer and asked the ESB not to pass it on to the consumer.  They did that and there has not been a word about it since.  It is perfectly logical for the Minister to extend that to 10 per cent this year.  This is something we will have to do by 1992 anyway and we will also <Col N="355" /> have to do it with the telephone service. The Minister should be congratulated for moving in all the areas he can without undue disruption towards preparing us for the trauma we will have to endure in 1992 under the VAT harmonisation regulations.

I think this change made by the Minister for Finance in regard to VAT on electricity is a very sensible step and one which is going in the right direction in view of the obligations that tax harmonisation in the Community will place on us.  I could understand that sense of outrage here if we were putting 5 per cent extra on the bills of consumers but we are not.  Please understand that.  The bill will not go out to the consumer.  The ESB will carry that VAT the same as many another commercial concern and work it into their system of cost.</P>

I think that puts the Taoiseach's guarantees in context here tonight.  We can all make nines out of noughts if it suits us but the Taoiseach has turned all logic on its head tonight to pretend that the ESB have some secret source where they can fund £18 million of VAT each year and which does not affect the cost of the ESB or the price of electricity.  The only way the ESB can absorb the VAT is if they borrow more or if they are already in a position to reduce the cost of electricity to the consumer.

      <P>I would like to say that I will be pressing the amendments that are the subject of the discussion because nothing that the Taoiseach has said has caused me to change my mind.  Simply, he has advanced two arguments: one, that because other fuels are VAT rated at 10 per cent, somehow that is an argument for asking the ESB to pay 10 per cent.  For the life of me I cannot follow why that should be the case.  Indeed, there is a very good argument for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance taking the opportunity of this budget to reduce the VAT on smokeless fuels.  It is simply availing of the improvement in the financial situation of the ESB as a handy source of revenue.</P>

On the other hand he tells us that they will not have to pay the 10 per cent VAT on electricity.  The Taoiseach seems to be contradicting himself.</P>

      <P>Placing additional buses on the routes in question would only bring <Col N="106" /> about a marginal improvement in the standard of service.</P>
      <P>The long journey times in question are due predominantly to the geographical dispersion of relatively small numbers of pupils over large areas.  The long journeys cannot be avoided due to the desirability, supported by the wishes of parents, of catering for pupils in special day schools or classes rather than in residential facilities.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, school transport for children attending special schools is provided free of charge.  My Department spend three times as much on average in transporting a pupil to a special school or class as to transport an ordinary pupil to school.  For example, in the case of mentally handicapped pupils, over £3 million was spent on their transport in 1988.  This was 11 per cent of the total budget of £28 million, whereas that category of pupils only accounts for 4 per cent of the total number in receipt of transport.</P>

      <P>The question of the re-organisation of teaching and research in the faculty of general agriculture in UCD has been under consideration for some time by the college authorities.  This consideration includes the necessity for and the extent to which Lyon's Estate is required for teaching and research in the college.  The committee appointed by the governing body to consider this matter has completed its report and a decision has been taken by the college to sell a portion of Lyon's Estate, including the house.  This decision was taken after due consideration of the needs of the faculty of general agriculture for teaching and research.  I have been advised that the college and the Higher Education Authority are satisfied that the sale will not detrimentally affect the capacity of the college to undertake any required agricultural research and development and I accept their judgment in the matter.</P>

      <P>The position regarding payments of grants is that the administration of the higher education grants and the VEC scholarships schemes has been statutorily entrusted to the local rating authorities and the vocational education committees respectively.</P>
      <P>The specimen higher education grants scheme issued by my Department to the local authorities each year contains a provision as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Payment of Grant: Clause 7 of Higher Education Grants Scheme.</P>
      <P>(a)  The appropriate lecture fee will be paid by the relevant local authority in advance of registration to the institution concerned in respect of eligible students on receipt of invoice for the lecture fee from the appropriate third level college. This will be subject to the refund in full of the lecture fee if the student does not register or does not take up a place in the course in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The . . . . . County Council/Corporation ..... shall pay the maintenance element (if any) of a grant-holder's grant in three equal instalments, as early as possible in each term, and the <Col N="113" /> individual paying orders shall be addressed to the grant-holders C/o the Bursar's Office of the University or other educational institution concerned.</P>
    <P>A similar provision is contained in the specimen vocational education committee scholarships scheme issued annually by the Department to each committee.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for each local authority and vocational education committee to apply these provisions in its functional area and I would be concerned if there was any undue delay in the payment of grants or scholarships to students.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Department's ESF training grants scheme, special training grants are paid to participants, monthly in arrears.  The scheme operates in VEC colleges and payment of grant is a matter in the first instance for the VEC concerned whose responsibility it is to ensure prompt payment of grants.  No instances of delay have been brought to my recent attention.</P>

      <P>I am of course aware of the current position regarding St. Kevin's Community College, Clondalkin, and have had many meetings and discussed the matter with interested parties and with representatives of the parents.</P>
      <P>I am equally aware that the former vocational school in Lucan in which the school is temporarily housed will be inadequate to cater for the needs of St. Kevin's Community College in the long term.  Accordingly, I am glad to state that I have decided to sanction the purchase of a site on the Fonthill Road, north Clondalkin from Dublin Corporation in order to provide a permanent school building for St. Kevin's Community College. I have personally got in touch with the Assistant City Manager concerning the purchase of the site.</P>
      <P>There are at present 270 pupils in St. Kevin's Community College and my Department projects an enrolment of 360 in September 1990.  It is my intention that these pupils be provided for in temporary accommodation on the site in question pending completion of a permanent school building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the current school year I am aware that the lease on part of the site adjacent to the old vocational school, Lucan, rented by the County Dublin VEC expires on 31 January, 1990. However, I have been assured by County Dublin VEC that adequate provision of <Col N="116" /> facilities will be made for the pupils and teachers of St. Kevin's Community College from now until the end of the current school year.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that permanent accommodation for 400 pupils will be provided on the Fonthill Road site with additional temporary accommodation provided as required to cater for the anticipated peaking of enrolments in this school later in the decade.</P>
    <P>I am confident that my decision in this matter will meet the needs of St. Kevin's pupils and provide them with the best possible post-primary facilities for the future.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>Schemes of Assistance for Students Pursuing Courses of Third-Level Education</i>
      </P>
      <P>1.  The principal schemes of direct assistance for students pursuing courses of third-level education are:</P>
      <P>(a) (i)  The higher education grants scheme administered by the county councils and county borough corporations.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Scheme of scholarships administered by the Vocational Education Committees for students wishing to pursue courses in regional technical colleges, colleges of technology and other approved institutions of third level education.  In order to qualify for a grant or scholarship under these schemes a candidate must, <i>inter alia,</i> obtain prescribed successes in the leaving certificate examination of the Department of Education and comply with the means test provisions laid down in the schemes.  The same benefits are payable under both schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The EC training grants scheme administered by the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology in respect of certain courses in those colleges. There is no means test prescribed in the scheme.  Trainees have <Col N="122" /> their course fees paid and, in addition, they are paid a maintenance training grant.</P>
    <P>2.  A special scheme of assistance, broadly similar to the higher education grants scheme, is operated by the Department for students in Thomond College, Limerick for teachers of physical education, metalwork and engineering science, woodwork and building science and rural/general science.</P>
    <P>3.  The Department awards scholarships under the following three schemes on the results of the leaving certificate examination:</P>
    <P>(a)  Scheme of scholarships for students from the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>(b)  Scheme of scholarships for students pursuing third level courses through Irish.</P>
    <P>(c)  Easter Week 1916 Commemoration scholarships.</P>
    <P>4.  (a)  Grants scheme for mature women students:</P>
    <P>Each applicant must be female and aged 25 years or over on or before the closing date for receipt of application.</P>
    <P>be unwaged or on a low income;</P>
    <P>be participating in an approved <i>undergraduate</i> degree, diploma or certificate course to the extent that she has completed at least one year of the course;</P>
    <P>not be in receipt of a grant, scholarship or funding from any other source;</P>
    <P>furnish a letter from the relevant college authorities confirming (a) her success in the previous academic year examinations (b) that she has re-enrolled for the academic year and (c) that she is not, to their knowledge, in receipt of a grant, scholarship or funding from any other source;</P>
    <P>provide information on the <Col N="123" /> financial circumstances of the household/individual.</P>
    <P>furnish details on educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>(b)  Fifteen grants are awarded annually under the scheme.</P>
    <P>5.  Since 1985, the amount payable under various schemes of financial assistance in respect of fees and maintenance have increased each year in line with tuition fees charged by colleges and with inflation.  These improvements in the provision of financial support for third level students have taken place during a period of budgetary constraint.</P>
    <P>6.  In the 1989-90 academic year, it is estimated that the percentage of third level students in receipt of financial assistance is in excess of 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>The publishing of a White Paper on non-university third level education would not be appropriate at this time due to a number of important initiatives which are ongoing.</P>
      <P>I have already announced that legislation is currently being prepared to give the VEC colleges a more clearly defined basis and also to expand and enhance the scope of their operations.</P>
      <P>I am also referring in particular to the interdepartmental committee which is examining the provision of student places at third level.  I am referring also to a committee which was established to examine third level courses which lead to awards by the NCEA and other bodies outside the universities.  The draft report of the latter committee has been recently circulated to interested parties for their views.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above I should mention a report on courses in outcentres which is being prepared by the National Council for Educational Awards and which I expect by the end of February.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 108, 160 and 161 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department operate a scheme of aid towards the cost of schoolbooks intended for necessitous pupils.  Therefore, <i>per capita</i> figures are not appropriate in that context.  For the purposes of the scheme, a necessitous pupil is defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family with inadequate means, <Col N="127" /> single parent-family or other circumstances which would connote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
    <P>The scheme is administered through the principals of the schools, who, subject to the amount of money made available to them annually, have complete discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted, in the amount of assistance given to each one and in the form such assistance will take.  I am pleased to say that for the current school year it has been possible to increase the finance for the free books scheme by 20 per cent at post primary and 17 per cent approximately at primary level.  The total provision was £2.89 million, £1.163 million has been allocated to the operation of the scheme in primary schools in 1990 which corresponds to an increase of 20 per cent. The provision at the post-primary level for 1990 is £2.63 million which represents an increase of 23.5 per cent over 1989.</P>
    <P>As the publication and sale of school books are in the hands of private companies it is not open to me to influence their pricing policy.</P>
    <P>The syllabus planners try to avoid overfrequent changes and are conscious that they should avoid any unnecessary increase in costs.  However, text books must be changed from time to time if teachers are to keep their work educationally stimulating, and if content and methodology are to be kept reasonably up to date.</P>
    <P>The Department is aware of the financial strain placed on parents of school pupils in providing school text books for their children, and have drawn the attention of school authorities to the desirability of changing non-prescribed text books as infrequently as possible in order to save parents undue expenditure.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general costs which parents face in relation to their children's education, I understand that, under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, discretionary payments may be made, by community welfare officers, to families with insufficient means to help meet exceptional needs on a once-off basis.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation in relation to St. Patrick's national school, Murlog, County Donegal, and I have approved a major project for the school. It is proposed to provide an extension of five classrooms and a remedial room and the existing building will be adapted so as to provide three standard classrooms, a staff room and stores.  In November 1989 an outline sketch plan was sent to the school authorities who made a number of observations thereon.  The whole matter was discussed last week at a meeting in Murlog between officials of my Department and the school authorities including the teachers' and parents' representatives.  Agreement was reached on the final details of the brief. It is now expected that the developed sketch plan will be completed in a matter of weeks and it will then be sent to the school authorities to enable them to seek planning permission.</P>

      <P>Graduates from the primary training colleges may be employed as permanent temporary or substitute teachers. Approximately 758 teachers, permanent and temporary, leave the service for various reasons each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Temporary teachers are employed to replace teachers on career break, unpaid maternity leave and unpaid sick leave. There are 1,253 teachers on career breaks of one to five years' duration.  The majority of these posts are filled by recent <Col N="130" /> graduates.  Three hundred and thirty four teachers who graduated in 1988 obtained a first appointment as temporary teachers since graduating.</P>
    <P>Graduates are also employed as substitutes. In the analysis of a sample of 1,114 trained teachers employed as substitutes in the 1987-88 and 1988-89 school years 120 teachers who graduated in 1988 were employed as substitutes.</P>
    <P>Twenty six teachers who graduated in 1988 are in permanent employment in primary schools.  This represents 4.5 per cent of the graduates in that year.</P>
    <P>There are many graduates in recent years who have opted to teach abroad to gain experience before seeking employment as national teachers in this country.</P>

      <i>Note:</i> The above data refer to the 1987/88 Academic Year.  Data in brackets are exclusive of schools who returned themselves on the Annual Statistical Return as providing a language to two pupils or less.  In a number of such cases, the language may be provided in association with the school, e.g., by one of the school's teachers outside of normal school hours, rather than by the school within the normal meaning of that phrase.  It would also appear that, in some cases where schools returned themselves as providing a language to a small number of pupils, the pupils concerned were studying the language privately outside the school system.</P>

      <P>On the recommendation of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, revised syllabuses in Spanish and Italian were introduced in September 1989 and these will be examined for the first time in the new Junior Certificate examination in 1992.</P>
      <P>Consideration is being given to the question of how best to cater for senior pupils who may wish to begin the study of a language <i>ab initio</i> but who would not be in a position to take on the Leaving Certificate course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an interim measure, I have decided that where schools so wish pupils who entered the senior cycle in September 1989 may take the Intermediate Certificate syllabus in French, German, <Col N="135" /> Spanish or Italian as part of their senior cycle course.  Pupils doing so will be allowed sit the Intermediate Certificate examination paper in the language studied at the time of sitting their Leaving Certificate examination and will be credited with the appropriate Intermediate Certificate grade.</P>
    <P>In 1988-89 I introduced a scheme for the payment of part-time teaching hours to those schools who introduced an additional modern continental language into their curricula.  This scheme is being continued for the current school year.  Action is currently being taken in relation to the implementation of the Lingua Programme under the auspices of the European Community.  This programme, which involves, <i>inter alia</i>, in-service training abroad for language teachers and student and teacher exchange, will enhance the standard of language teaching and learning in second level schools.</P>

      <P>The pilot project on the use of a set of educational resource materials on AIDS, developed by the Departments of Education and Health, was implemented and completed in 20 post-primary schools during the first term of the current school year.  The revision of the materials has commenced now, taking into account the feedback from the schools involved in the pilot and taking account, as well, of the views of the bodies which have been asked to provide comments on the materials.</P>
      <P>These bodies were: the Catholic Bishops' Commission on Education; the Church of Ireland Board of Education; the Methodist Board of Education; the Presbyterian Commission for Education; the Conference of Major Religious Superiors; the Joint Managerial Body for Secondary Schools; the Irish Vocational Education Association; the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools; the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland; the Teachers' Union of Ireland and the National Parents Council (Secondary Section).</P>
      <P>When the revision is completed it is intended to make the materials available to post-primary schools generally.  Comments have not been received yet from all the bodies invited to provide views but it is expected that they will do so in the near future.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to give a definite date for completion of the revision of the materials but it is hoped that they will be finalised before the end of the present school year.</P>

    <P>From 1987 there was a change in the way the national schools building programme was being administered. Because of the changed financial environment and the large number of acute cases needing attention any case which proceeded did so on a modified basis. Substantial savings on the building programme were achieved as a result and the number of cases needing attention was reduced greatly.</P>

      <P>In the context of promoting mutual understanding the European Studies (Ireland and Great Britain) project (1986-1992) has been jointly organised and funded by the Department of Education (Northern Ireland), the Department of Education (Republic of Ireland) and the Department of Education and Science (England).  Among its aims are the following: (i) to allow pupils in Ireland, North and South, and in England to undertake joint investigation of historical and geographical topics; (ii) to provide opportunity for pupils to see the perspectives of other pupils through the collaborative analysis of historical/ environmental topics and (iii) to help pupils to understand relationships within Ireland and between Ireland and Great Britain within the context of Europe.</P>
      <P>In addition many of our schools participate in the Co-operation North programme, and in the Wider Horizons programme funded by the International Fund for Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>The recent introduction of computeristation has already improved, and will improve over the next few years, many aspects of the work of the Examinations Branch of my Department.</P>
      <P>The major benefits in 1989 were (1) the intermediate certificate results which issued on 22 September was one week earlier than the results which issued in 1988, (2) the early publication of detailed examination statistics and (3) the earlier issue of certificates.</P>
      <P>The number of candidates taking the certificate examinations has increased by 27 per cent approximately since 1980 and this has, of course, resulted in an increase in the number of candidates' scripts to be corrected.  In 1989 approximately 1.3 million scripts were processed.  Given that the examiners appointed to correct the candidates' scripts must still be given a reasonable length of time to complete this work, there is little scope for issuing the leaving certificate results any earlier than at present.  The Deputy can be assured that full use will be made of computerisation to have the results available at the earliest possible date.  This will include issuing a separate results sheet for every candidate in addition to the list of results issued to each school.  The latter is a further benefit made possible in 1989 because of computerisation.</P>
      <P>While I cannot give a precise date for the issue of the intermediate certificate results in 1990, I can assure the Deputies that it will be much earlier than heretofore.</P>
      <P>With regard to rechecks, every effort is made to expedite the review of results. The process of having a review completed necessarily takes time particularly as many of the examiners concerned will by that stage have resumed their other duties after the summer vacation period.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 128, 129 and 130 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The E-routes are designated in the 1975 European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries prepared under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.  The network of E-routes is intended as a co-ordinated plan for the construction and development of roads of international importance and consists of a grid system of reference roads having a general north-south and west-east orientation together with intermediate roads, branch, link and connecting roads.  The roads designated in the agreement are seen as part of an international network &mdash; the E01 for <Col N="154" /> example runs from Larne via Dublin and Rosslare through Portugal and Spain, terminating at Seville and the E20 runs from Shannon to Leningrad.  The agreement also sets down detailed technical standards to which E-routes should conform. A proposal to designate additional E-routes can only be made by a party to the agreement and requires the approval of a majority ot states who are parties to the agreement.</P>
    <P>Designation of a road as an E-route does not accord it any special status in respect of EC Structural Fund assistance under the Community Support Framework for Ireland.  The question of designating further E-routes for this purpose does not therefore arise.</P>
    <P>Priorities for investment in national routes are determined on the basis of need and are not influenced by the classification or otherwise of a route as an E-route.</P>

Those who satisfactorily pass the examination at the end of the course receive a certificate in the principles and practice of food hygiene. This course has been in operation since 1977 and several thousand persons in the hotel and catering industry have already completed these courses at various venues throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A new six hour training course for food workers was introduced under the CLEANWATCH programme in 1988. This course was designed by the Irish Hotel and Catering Institute in Co-operation with CERT, the health boards and the Environmental Health Officers' Association.  This course is directed at personnel in the catering industry who have had no formal training in food hygiene and is designed to give an appreciation of the fundamentals of good hygiene practice.

      <i>Note:</i> The above data refer to the 1987-88 academic year.  Data in brackets are exclusive of schools who returned themselves on the annual statistical return as providing a language to two pupils or less.  In a number of such cases, the language may be provided in association with the school, e.g., by one of the school's teachers outside of normal school hours, rather than by the school within the normal meaning of that phrase.  It would also appear that, in some cases where schools returned themselves as providing a language to a small number of pupils, the pupils concerned were studying the language privately outside the school system.</P>
