      <P>I would like to raise two matters on the Order of Business, the first being the matter raised by Deputy Bruton.  Will the Taoiseach afford the Minister for Justice an opportunity to make a statement to the House or send <Col N="1566" /> a message clearly from this Parliament that the conduct of the fans in O'Connell Street yesterday was totally unacceptable given the exemplary conduct of the Irish supporters over the last 12 months?  I wish time to be made available to the Minister for Justice, who will have the support of all Members of the House in relation to the way the matter was handled by the Garda yesterday.  Secondly, perhaps the Taoiseach can indicate when the Book of Estimates will be published. It was promised for early November.  The days are slipping by and I would like some indication now as to when it will be published.</P>

    <Title>Public Hospitals (Amendment) Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Public Charitable Hospitals Acts, 1930 to 1932, and the Public Hospitals Acts 1933 to 1976, so that any unclaimed prize money, and accrued interest, arising from the operation of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes may be vested in the Minister for Health and disposed of by him in respect of service by certain former employees of Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited, the private company which promoted and operated the hospitals sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are familiar with the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes.  When they were operating, the governing legislation required that in relation to each individual sweepstake, sufficient funds were deposited to secure the total value <Col N="1570" /> of prizes in that sweepstake.  Trustees were appointed to be responsible for these deposits.</P>
    <P>Inevitably some prizes &mdash; mostly small ones &mdash; were not claimed and the parties entitled to these prizes were never identified nor did they submit valid claims. Over the years these funds remained on deposit and now, with interest, amount to approximately £480,000.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited was placed in voluntary liquidation in March 1987.  In effect, this signalled the demise of the sweepstakes.  The last sweepstake was run in January 1986 and all the company's employees were made redundant in March 1987.  Following that, the trustees of the prize fund deposits indicated that they wished to be relieved of their trusteeship, largely because they felt that few, if any, of the unclaimed prizes would become legitimately payable in the future.  In the circumstances, the Government decided that the unclaimed prize money, together with accrued interest, should be taken over by the State and used for the benefit of former employees. Basically that is why I am sponsoring this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to briefly run through the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides that the deposit funds will be vested in the Minister for Health.  Section 3 authorises the Minister for Health to disburse these funds, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Section 4 indemnifies the trustees against future claims.  Section 5 provides for the audit of accounts and their presentation to the Dáil and Seanad.  Section 6 covers any future liabilities which may arise &mdash; these will be met from the Exchequer.  Section 7 provides that future claims against the funds must be made within four years unless some legal disability is established.</P>
    <P>Further sections provide that the expenses involved in disbursing these funds will fall on the Exchequer, that the sweepstakes Acts may be repealed if there is no longer any need for the legislation and in that event, any moneys payable into the Hospitals' Trust Fund <Col N="1571" /> shall instead be disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, the Bill has emerged as a short one which provides a simple and easily managed system to take over and disburse these funds and one which will not give rise to any drain on these funds to meet distribution costs.  I am very anxious &mdash; as I am sure every Member of the House is &mdash; to have the legislation enacted during this session to ensure that these funds are paid out before Christmas.</P>
    <P>In that context I would like to make two points.  It has been suggested that additional funds be made available to assist the former employees, specifically from receipts from the sale of the Hospitals' Trust Board's premises in Ballsbridge or indeed grants from the Exchequer.  It is not open to the Hospitals' Trust Board or to the Minister for Health to direct that the proceeds of the sale of the premises in Ballsbridge be diverted for the benefit of employees of the private company which rented it. Indeed, virtually all the proceeds of that sale have now been used up, the bulk of it supporting the public health capital programme.  In relation to Exchequer assistance, many people have suggested that funds should be provided to help the liquidator meet additional redundancy payments which have been recommended by the Labour Court.  Here again I have to point out that as Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited is a private company I have no function in this matter and there is no action I can take to ensure the recommendations of the Labour Court are implemented.  While I have every sympathy with the position of these workers I am sure the House will appreciate from what I have said that there is no way open to the Minister for Health to assist them.</P>
    <P>In all there are about 650 former employees and the vast majority were in receipt of non-contributory pensions or were in full-time employment on the date of liquidation.  Unfortunately, the <i>ex gratia</i> element attaching to the pensions <Col N="1572" /> of these former employees was withdrawn when the company was placed in voluntary liquidation and those in full-time employment who might reasonably have anticipated similar pension arrangements also lost out.  These people have certainly been disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>It is my view that people who were in permanent full-time employment when Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited was placed in voluntary liquidation in March 1987 are, in fact, the most seriously disadvantaged of all the former employees and that consequently they should receive a greater portion of the funds available.  I would welcome comments from the House and will take them into account when deciding how best to distribute the money arising from unclaimed prizes.</P>
    <P>I recommend the legislation to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the Bill and the proposal that it be enacted as soon as possible.  It is only proper that the Minister for Health and the Government should step in to ensure that this element of the affairs of the former Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes is finalised.  I should say at the outset that the former employees of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes in particular the full-time employees, were very harshly treated when the company went into liquidation.  I believe it is the view of this House that these employees should now be paid whatever <i>ex gratia</i> or severence payments they may be entitled to, which was the recommendation of the Labour Court.  This House should pay tribute to the staff and the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes for the very valuable contribution they made to the health service and in particular for providing capital funding.  The proper way to recognise that contribution is to look after those staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the staff lobbied the liquidator and public representatives at the time the very valuable property belonging to the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes at Ballsbridge went on sale, greater regard should have been paid to the requirements of the staff.  It is my understanding that they only received their statutory <Col N="1573" /> redundancy payments and nothing else. I ask the Minister to ensure that a <i>pro rata</i> arrangement is agreed to after a process of consultation with the staff representatives, bearing in mind the Labour Court recommendation, whereby the moneys will be paid out perhaps on the basis of a flat rate payment for each year of service.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two further points which are slightly extraneous to the Bill before going on to deal with the content of the sections.  First, we are all aware that the national lottery has displaced the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes as a major fund raiser and that the advent of the national lottery signalled the demise of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes.  It is a matter of some concern to me, given that we have moved from a situation where all the proceeds of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes went to the health service that now only a small proportion of the revenue of the national lottery goes to the health service.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that the voluntary fund raising activities of many organisations concerned with the handicapped, the disabled and the health sector generally have had their income reduced by 50 per cent to 70 per cent. We have to look at a situation where I understand £10.6 million of national lottery money this year went to the health sector.  That is less than the fall in revenue they have had from their voluntary fund raising, some of which is only substituting mainline health expenditure that would have already reached its way to the health sector by virtue of mainline Exchequer spending.  I do not wish to delay the House on that point but the health sector as a whole and the voluntary health sector have lost out badly because of the demise of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes and the new arrangements of the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The second point I would like to make is slightly extraneous to the Bill.  It relates to public voluntary hospitals, as distinct from health board hospitals, which received money under the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes and by way of annual budgets.  I am concerned that the Minister <Col N="1574" /> has no representative on the board of some of the major hospitals &mdash; the Mater, St. Vincent's and so on.  This is wrong.  He should make arrangements to appoint immediately a representative, either from his Department or his own nominee, to the board so that he is directly briefed in relation to what is happening. Because he has stepped in to tidy up this area there is a principle here that he should now establish clear representation of at least one member on all the boards of voluntary public hospitals.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Bill itself I would like the Minister to give some details on exactly how the administration will work, whether it will be his own staff or others who will administer it and what its lifetime will be.  Perhaps he will clarify the matter of indemnity.  In other words if, say, the grand-daughter of the winner of one of the unclaimed prizes comes out of the woodwork next year and says: &ldquo;My grandfather &mdash; and I am his only remaining descendant &mdash; won £100,000 in 1954 and I have not any of the money,&rdquo; what is the legal position in relation to her rights?  I am aware that section 4 attempts to deal with this issue but I wonder whether, under the rules which prevailed at the time of purchase, there would be that type of indemnity conferring on trustees, and whether that could now extend to the Minister.  I would like to hear the Minister's proposals on how he intends the money to be spent between pensioners and former full-time employees at the time of the liquidation. When the Minister is summing up on Second Stage perhaps he would let us have an explicit outline as to his intentions.</P>
    <P>In summary I have to say that it was a sad day that the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes met their demise in the way it happened.  It is important that their affairs be wound up in an orderly fashion and in doing so the overriding concern must be for those who lost out so heavily &mdash; the former employees.  I hope the Minister will be able to ensure that they get their full entitlement at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset on behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the legislation before us.  It is a short enabling Bill to begin to provide something, however inadequate, for the former employees and pensioners of Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes. We all realise the role the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes played in the formative years of the health services in this country when the State was trying to establish a comprehensive health service. They recognised the need for capital funding to build a hospital network in the fact of major health problems such as tuberculosis.  The Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes was a very important arm in giving the then Minister for Health the freedom to take a dramatic initiative and solve the scourge of tuberculosis.  The Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes which, for many decades, was a reason for making Ireland noted throughout the world, particularly in the United States, have an honourable record of service to this country.  For that reason we have a responsibility &mdash; those of us who have a concern for our health services &mdash; to recognise the role of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes and, more especially and more importantly, to recognise the role played by the former employees of the sweepstakes.  Quite frankly most of us would agree that the treatment meted out to those former employees was shabby.  While the Minister may say that neither he nor the Government has responsibility for them we all have a moral responsibility in recognition of the role they played over the years.  Workers were disenchanted to be paid merely the statutory requirements once the company went into liquidation.  The company went into liquidation primarily because their day had passed and the national lottery came on stream and because the type of sweepstake that was in vogue in the forties and fifties no longer held its sway and no longer had a role to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The notion of dispersing the unclaimed prize money of some £480,000 is welcome. If you divide that among 147 workers and all the other pensioners it will amount to less than £3,000 each which is a very small sum indeed and will <Col N="1576" /> be poor compensation to those people. However, it should be paid and we should give a fair wind to this legislation to enable the money to be paid as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>The pensioners who lost out on their <i>ex gratia</i> pensions must also be taken care of to some degree.  When the Minister is responding I would welcome his thoughts on this matter because obviously his Department will have worked out some mechanism for the payment of the funds. As I have said, the funds are inadequate but at least they are something and I hope those involved will have the money in their hands before Christmas.  Perhaps the Minister can share with us in the House his thoughts on the mechanism for distribution of the funds, the rate of payment to the ex-pensioners who lost out and the former employees, many of whom are now totally dependent on unemployment assistance rather than benefit as their stamps are exhausted at this stage.  I am very concerned about thoses two categories and I am anxious to see how the money will be distributed to them.</P>
    <P>It is very important to underscore to the Minister &mdash; perhaps he has given some thought to this &mdash; that any payment made must be maximised and must be regarded as a severance payment.  I do not know how that can be done legally. In essence it would be an extra act of heartlessness if out of a sum of money paid to these people a significant chunk of it was clawed back by way of taxation by the Revenue Commissioners.  I appeal to the Minister to find a mechanism &mdash; perhaps this can be done by way of amendment on Committee Stage &mdash; to enable any payment made to be regarded as a severance payment and not subject to the clawback in taxation which would be a severe blow to the already meagre sum of money that will become available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates indicated that the national lottery has supplanted the Sweepstakes in relation to funding for the health services. That is true but, as he rightly said, while the bulk of available <Col N="1577" /> resources and profits from the Sweepstakes went to the capital programme for hospitals obviously the same cannot be said of the national lottery when only a small percentage of lottery funds go to the health services.  During 1990 the sum will be about £10.6 million.  The Minister will be aware of the serious concern among voluntary agencies, in particular those involved in health, about the double effect of this, (1)  the immediate effect it has on their fund-raising efforts because the lottery sucks up so much money on a twice weekly basis and (2) the actual distribution of money.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House I want to give a rough estimate of the disbursal of money from the national lottery this year: some £2 million will be spent on hospital buildings; £3 million on services for the elderly; £1 million for the National Social Services Board and National Council for the Elderly; £800,000 towards the mentally handicapped; £500,000 for child care services; £500,000 on child abuse services; £100,000 on AIDS prevention and £2.7 million in block grants to health boards.  The voluntary groups are not well served by that allocation of money and there is great concern that the distribution mechanism runs counter to the recommendations made by the all-party committee on the lottery.</P>
    <P>I want to take issue with Deputy Yates and say that, as a matter of principle, I do not regard, nor have I ever regarded, any lottery as an acceptable core funding element for the health services.  I feel very strongly &mdash; the Commission on Health Funding and the all-party committee on the lottery agreed with this &mdash; that there should not be any dependence, or even a significant dependence, for core funding for essential services on any lottery which is subject to the vagaries of people's inclination to gamble.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a health service it must be funded virtually exclusively from the Central Fund.  It is only then that this House can make a determination on the level and quality of the services provided and then live up to the responsibility of providing, from taxpayers' money, the <Col N="1578" /> funding for those services.  The Commission on Health Funding were strongly of the view that the national lottery was a supplement and should not be regarded as a core element of health funding.  I want to make this point very firmly in case the view would be allowed gain momentum &mdash; this happened during the last general election &mdash; that somehow one could depend on the lottery or a mechanism like that for funding.  I understand that in times of desperation people look for funding from areas like that but I want to emphasise that core funding for essential health services must come from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, a measure which will enable the Minister to determine how this sum of £480,000 should be distributed. It is clearly enabling legislation; there is no detailed mechanism involved in the Bill.  The Minister should indicate to the House his thoughts in relation to that mechanism which clearly was worked out in his Department before the Bill was presented to us.  I re-emphasise my wish that the meagre sum of £480,000 will be maximised by ensuring that there is no Revenue clawback from the recipients who get it and that they will receive it as expeditiously as possible.  Certainly the Minister will have the goodwill of the Labour Party in ensuring that the Bill passes expeditiously through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  The treatment of the former workers of the Irish Hospitals' Trust was appalling and I am glad that at last there has been a change of heart on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Hospitals' Trust, which was established in the thirties, was one of the great success stories of this country for several decades.  The Sweepstakes provided badly needed funds for the development of hospitals but there was a great contrast in the returns it delivered for those who effectively owned it and those who worked for it.  It made millionaires of the McGrath family but the wages paid to the staff, a large number of whom were women, were poor and generally <Col N="1579" /> below the rates paid to people in similar employment.</P>
    <P>Time and changing fashions caught up with the Sweepstakes by the eighties and it was already in decline when the final nail was driven into its coffin by the decision to establish the national lottery. The Irish Hospitals' Trust applied to the Government to run the national lottery but the then Fine Gael-Labour Administration wisely decided that it was preferable that the lottery should come under the umbrella of An Post.  Given that the decision by the then Government contributed to the collapse of the Sweepstakes there was clearly an obligation on the Government to ensure that the interests of those who had served the Irish Hospitals' Trust so well, and for so long, were looked after.  It is deplorable that the Fine Gael-Labour Government who took that decision did nothing in that regard and that the later Fianna Fáil Administration refused for so long to do anything for those workers.  As recently as February of last year the Minister told my colleague, Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla, that this was a private company, the responsibility for making payments to former employees rested solely with the company and, consequently, it was not possible to provide Exchequer or national lottery funds to finance the suggestions by Deputy Mac Giolla.</P>
    <P>I am glad there has been a change of heart and that the Government have come up with this formula to assist former employees of the Hospitals' Trust.  Much of the hardship and distress experienced by the 147 former employees who were made redundant would have been avoided if this decision had been taken three years ago.  The closure of the Hospitals Trust not only affected those who were made redundant but also former employees whose pensions were slashed because the pension fund was not a contributory one but funded on an <i>ex-gratia</i> basis with payments being made from current funds.  I want to give some examples of this.  A woman cashier who spent 40 years working for the Hospitals' Trust got a miserable £3,337 for such <Col N="1580" /> loyal service.  This amounts to about £80 for each year of service.  A boilerman who had 27 years service got a sum of £2,500 while a former employee with 34 years service had his pension of £107 per month slashed to £31.25 per month.  They are examples of how people who had given loyal service were disregarded in a brutal and heartless way.  The fact that they had given such loyal service and helped to build up the Hospitals' Trust counted for nothing.</P>
    <P>Without the staff, the Hospitals' Trust and the sweepstakes they ran, would have been nothing.  The McGrath family did not suffer at all.  They had their land, horses, an interest in Waterford Glass, trust funds and tax havens such as the Isle of Man to fall back on while the staff had nothing.  In their claim to the Labour Court the staff association sought three weeks pay for each year of service. However, the Labour Court in its judgment recommended two weeks pay for each year of service.  While section 3 of the Bill does not specify the amount which will be paid to the former employees, I hope the Minister will in the circumstances be generous and meet the original claim and also provide the actuarial sum necessary to put their pension scheme on a sound basis, while restoring the value of the pensions paid prior to the collapse.  I understand that the cost of the claim would be around £1.1 million.  This has to be viewed against, for instance, the revenue from the sale of the Ballsbridge site which amounted to £6.6 million, insurance compensation of some £500,000 arising from Hurricane Charlie and the money raised by the liquidation sale.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill, my only concern is that it does not specify exactly how the funds will be applied and what sums will be made available to the former employees.  Section 3 is very vague and loose.  There is no guarantee under the section that all the redundant employees will be covered.  On the other hand, a loose interpretation of it could mean that ex-employees who had left 20 years ago and who were not victimised by being made redundant or losing pension rights <Col N="1581" /> could benefit.  If this were the case clearly the amount available for those who were made redundant when the trust closed would be significantly decreased.  I would ask the Minister to consider the matter and to come back on Committee Stage with a precise amendment which spells out in clear detail exactly who will qualify and how much they will be entitled to receive.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are discussing a welcome Bill designed to undo to some extent the terrible injustice done to the former employees of the Hospitals' Trust we should spare a thought for another group of workers who have also been treated in an appalling manner.  Many of these employees have also given 30 or 40 years of loyal service to their company.  In this case the employer was not a private company but the State.  I am, of course, referring to Irish Shipping which was put into liquidation by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government six years ago yesterday. The Irish Shipping workers, like those in the Hospitals' Trust, were thrown on the scrap heap and found that loyalty and commitment counted for nothing.  They have also found that the lavish promises made by the present Government prior to the 1987 election were worthless.  The betrayal of Irish Shipping workers by Fianna Fáil is one of the most shameful episodes of Irish political history.  I hope they will not lose heart but will continue to struggle for fair play and draw inspiration from the final success of the Hospitals' Trust workers.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides that the sum of £480,000, made up of unclaimed prize money and accrued interest arising from the former Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes, should be used for the benefit of former employees.  I want to put on record my support for this move.  It is encouraging that all the previous speakers have also supported it.  I am sure the Minister would be very happy if every Bill he introduced received similar support.</P>

      <P>Keep up the momentum. Most of the previous speakers referred to the Minister's desire to have payments paid prior to Christmas, which I wholeheartedly support.  Some questions have been asked about the exact timescale of the payment.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the vehicle he proposes to use to dispense the money to the former employees.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to go through the various provisions of the Bill but the Minister stated that he would welcome comments from the House regarding the division of funds.  The employees belong to three categories.  In the first category are those who are in receipt of a pension. I understand that those in the second category had a pension which they lost. The third category consists of people who were in full-time permanent employment when the Hospitals' Trust was put into liquidation.  I suggest that the Minister might look favourably at the second and third categories, namely, the former employees who lost their pensions and those who were employed full-time and are now most seriously disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill, which I fully support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the Bill and the proposals in the Minister's speech. We all remember the work done by the Hospitals' Trust, which filled an important role in years gone by when services were heavily dependent on funding from that area.  While many people have been critical of the operations of the Hospitals' Trust in its latter years, this is somewhat unfair.  Unfortunately, as time passed the trust became less efficient and there was a lesser pay-out while administration costs increased.  That same trend is not unknown in many similar agencies and warnings should be taken from what happened in that case.  It was not because of malpractice by any members of the organisation but because the system became inefficient and costs increased and, as a result, the net benefit to potential beneficiaries became less and less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite a number of Hospitals' Trust employees are constituents of mine and <Col N="1583" /> I welcome the suggestion to dispose of residual funds.  It would be a way of making up to those people for the disappointment and hurt caused when they became redundant.  That has happened in countless other concerns, both public and private, and employees have always been very much the losers.  In this case many people had given long years of service and they found it difficult to get similar or alternative employment.  Those people were particularly vulnerable because they were thrown out of their jobs and also because their long service in a particular niche made it more difficult for them to obtain other employment. The funds proposed to be distributed under the provisions of this Bill will be of some little recompense to them.  I notice the Minister did not say he would dispose of all of the funds in that fashion. No doubt all Members will have many suggestions as to what should be done with them, but, bearing in mind the amount of money involved, if one chops and changes or breaks it up, it would become worthless.  The obvious thing to do is dispose of it in the manner proposed by the Minister, which is by way of making up the losses by one means or another to former employees, pensioners and so on.</P>
    <P>A Bill like this should not go through the House without our raising one question &mdash; which I know arose before and to which I used know the answer: what happens to all the residual funds that must remain in various accounts of insurance companies, banks, dare I say, building societies, indeed with every conceivable financial agency, public and private, in the country?  Amazingly, occasionally, one hears of some proposal in relation to some of these funds.  I would put it to the House that those sums are huge in comparison with what we are talking about under the provisions of this Bill.  Anybody who works in such agencies worldwide will tell of the unclaimed benefits of one kind or another.  There is the case of the person who dies with no immediate relatives and huge amounts of interest accrue to the <Col N="1584" /> relevant account over a long period. There is a good case for introducing legislation some time so that the amounts standing in such unclaimed accounts over long periods could be put to some good use.  If the agencies themselves want to do so, that is fine but that matter should be examined.</P>
    <P>Under the system which has replaced the Irish Hospitals' Trust &mdash; in terms of funding of voluntary hospitals, there is felt a certain amount of disquiet that, with the gradual, accepted demise of the Hospitals' Trust on account of diminishing efficiency, the funds being allocated from the national lottery appeared first to be of greater potential help than is now apparent.  My view is that the method of funding the voluntary health services has been under strain for some considerable time past and, as time progresses, will be subjected to even greater stress.  Then there are the VHI scheme and the direct public hospital services.  There was the &ldquo;in between&rdquo; service, which used be assisted by the Hospitals' Trust which no longer exists.  As time goes on I predict we will see the development on a large scale of the luxury-type hospital establishments that have come on stream over the past couple of years.  I predict that, simultaneously, we will see a diminution of investment in the public health services; by that I mean total investment in terms of staffing, equipment, technology and so on.  Obviously those establishments to which the public will resort most frequently will be those appearing to be best equipped, providing the best, most efficient services and so on, establishments to which they have easy access.</P>
    <P>Although this is a matter for another debate I would hope the Minister would bear that overall development in mind in the future; I know he has done so to date. I know that has been raised at various discussions over the past couple of years since the spotlight focused on the health services generally.  It is an aspect that will bear much attention in future years.  If it does not receive such attention I predict we are likely to see the development of a new system and the total disappearance of what we had come to accept as a public <Col N="1585" /> health service.  Otherwise we will have to incur much greater expenditure than we do at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope that the moneys accruing to the former employees of the Hospitals' Trust as a result of its passage will go some way towards helping them and repairing any damage that may have been done as a result of their unfortunate, untimely cessation of employment.  It would be my hope also that the lessons to be learned from the demise of the Hospitals' Trust will be taken on board and kept in the forefront of the minds of the people who will operate a similar system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this badly needed Bill.  I note that it is the Minister's hope to have the Bill passed and the relevant moneys paid out before Christmas, which is greatly to be welcomed. We would be remiss in our duties here if we did not avail of this opportunity to thank the former employees of the Hospitals Trust for the great work they did over many years in improving our health services generally.  It can rightly be said that in the forties, into the fifties, they took up much of the slack not taken up by central Government, providing hospitals, institutions and money for their running.  I can name one such hospital in my area &mdash; Blanchardstown Hospital &mdash; at that time built to combat the ravages of TB, built mainly out of Hospitals Trust funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Howlin when he said that our health services should be funded out of central funds and that we should not rely on national lottery allocations to constitute the main thrust of their financing.  Nonetheless it has to be said that national lottery allocations do provide money where it is badly needed. For example, in Deputy Yates' constituency there is the day centre for elderly in Gorey and the Dawn Centre for mentally handicapped in Wexford, where it will be seen to be a useful topping up exercise.  In my constituency there is the establishment known as St. Michael's House for Mentally Handicapped which <Col N="1586" /> has benefited enormously over the years from national lottery funding.</P>
    <P>I would be anxious that the moneys to be distributed under the provisions of this Bill would be done on the basis of need. We are not talking about a large number of former employees of the Hospitals' Trust.  I would assume many of them would be in receipt of means-tested entitlements.  It would be my hope that any moneys they might receive as a result of the passage of this Bill would not diminish their present incomes, in other words, I would be anxious that we would not be seen to give with one hand and take with the other.  That is an important principle to be observed here and my sole worry is about its distribution.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of the Bill and wish it a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill comparatively quickly.  It is good to see a measure of such great importance being treated expeditiously, welcomed and pushed through the House.  It marks the end of an era in Dublin.  We all grew up seeing as the ideal in life a win in the Sweepstakes.  We considered that all our problems would be solved if we won. The feeling was similar to that about the lottery.  The sale of Sweepstakes tickets was more relevant to the US than to Ireland.  We knew about the big wins from the publicity they got.  The demise of the Sweepstakes was due to the fact that some states in America developed their own lotteries and this led to a reduction in the sale of tickets in the US. People there opted for their own state lotteries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the distribution of the money, I understand the doling out this money will be a matter for the Exchequer.  I am concerned that the expenses involved be kept low and do not eat into the money.  It will be a substantial fund.  However, when divided among 650 former employees it will amount to nothing more than a nice little nestegg. Will the Minister give us an idea of how much he thinks each employee will get? <Col N="1587" /> It will make a huge difference to the people who came to see me.  Six women who live in my constituency called to see me at my clinics and told me of their tremendous distress and how they were thrown into total disarray when they realised the Sweepstakes was finished and their jobs were being faded out.  At the time nobody could tell them what was happening, what was likely to happen to the building or what they would be entitled to.</P>
    <P>It is wonderful that their sadness and disappointment at that time has been turned around.  The money will be very useful to them at Christmas.  The Minister said that in his opinion the most disadvantaged group were the permanent full-time employees at the time of the liquidation of the company.  I hope all former employees who have a social need will be identified, their plight recognised and they will benefit from this fund.  The Sweepstakes offices in Ballsbridge became a sort of social service.  Legions of widows were employed there.  The way many families were reared, fed and looked after is a testimony to the work and the pay their mothers got in the Sweepstakes offices.  The pay was very small and in present day term, very inadequate, but it was a lifesaver for many widows.  I do not know what the staff breakdown was even among the 650 people we are talking about in the Bill, but I am sure a huge proportion were widows who were taken on to do fairly menial work but work they did well.</P>
    <P>I am happy to support this Bill and I am pleased that it is getting the support of all sides.  I hope the money to be divided will make Christmas, and the future, happy for the people who felt they were badly let down a few years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleasant to contribute, albeit briefly, to a good news Bill, and that is what we have today.  As previous speakers have said, we are talking about the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes which was part of our culture, heritage and recent history.  It was set up in 1930 and the Hospitals' Trust was set up in 1940. <Col N="1588" /> I join with previous speakers in paying tribute to the employees of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes and the contribution they made directly to the development of our health services and health care.</P>
      <P>In 1987, shortly after my election to this House, I was on what has become a very famous TV programme, &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;.  It was my first appearance on such a programme and one of the questions that came spontaneouly from the audience was one of the &ldquo;what about&rdquo; questons, &ldquo;what about the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes workers?&rdquo;  I admit my answer was not very substantial, but I said I was aware of the predicament &mdash; I was &mdash; and I would take the issue up at Government level.  Subsequently I did so.  I raised it first with the Minister for Labour and then with the Minister for Health.  Subsequently a number of my constituents contacted me.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fennell referred to the number of our constituents who have a direct interst in this issue.  My one concern at the time was, how quickly we could get something done for those people.  One of the participants on that programme was Deputy Alan Dukes, who was then seeking leadership of the Fine Gael Party. How time moves on.  However, since then there have been delays and we have had an election.  From the Minister's speech I can understand why those delays occurred.  The procedures were very complex and that was the crux of the matter.</P>
      <P>Now we have the good news and I welcome it greatly.  I compliment the Minister on setting up what is really a simple management system to distribute the not huge amount of money but the £480,000 will be very much appreciated by the people who have come to me and to many other Deputies about this.  The Minister's ambition to have this paid out before Christmas is most praiseworthy. It is a very humane approach to the matter and we should co-operate with him, as I know we will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the lottery. One of my colleagues referred to St. <Col N="1589" /> Michael's House, which is in my constitutency, and other very worthy beneficiaries of the lottery money.  That is filtering through to the sectors in our society that need assistance, particularly in the area of health care.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in a practical way, has done something feasible within his remit. As he said, there are 650 former employees.  Reference was made to the possibility that the Minister could get some of the proceeds from the sale of the premises of the Hospitals' Trust to benefit the employees directly.  This has been cleared up.  It was a private company and the bulk of the proceeds went to supporting the health programme.  The Minister has done all be can.  I agree with him that the people who were in permanent full-time employment when the Hospitals' Trust (1940) were put in voluntary liquidation are those most in need of assistance.  That is something with which I would totally agree.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I very much welcome what the Minister has brought before us today.  I think the most important thing now is that we allow the Minister to ensure that the procedures are set in place so that these people will benefit directly before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief comments.  Like others, I would like to pay tribute to the national institution of Hospitals' Trust which for a number of decades provided valuable funds for our health services.  I would like to link the tribute to the former company to the work and commitment of the former employees.</P>
      <P>The focus of the Bill is on those former employees and, like others, I welcome this amending legislation which provides the legal mechanism to transfer the unclaimed prize money and the accrued interest arising from the operation of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes to the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has underlined, of course, that Hospitals Trust was a private company and this immediately sets legal limits on what it is possible for the Minister or any other Minister to do in <Col N="1590" /> relation to the former employees.  The company went into voluntary liquidation in 1987 and all of the employees at that time became redundant.  I, like other speakers in the Dublin area in particular, have met some of these former employees in my own constituency and they feel aggrieved about the deal they received.  It is to the credit of the Government, therefore, that the unclaimed prize money and the accrued interest which has made the sum that much larger, will now be taken over by the State and used for the benefit of those former employees.  I view it as an enlightened and imaginative approach to a deserving group of 650 people.</P>
    <P>The sum involved is obviously modest but nonetheless it could make an important difference especially to the elderly pensioners on very modest means.  It is particularly important that the legislation pass as quickly as possible so that the sums that will be paid to individual former employees will be paid out before Christmas.  There is no question but that those employees &mdash; as in any liquidation of this sort but especially here &mdash; are particularly vulnerable.  They did receive the statutory entitlements that applied in their cases.</P>
    <P>Rather than repeat what other people have said, I want to make one general point before concluding.  It relates to the pension schemes.  This case of the former employees of the Hospitals' Trust underlines the need for secure well funded pension schemes where contributions are made to fund such schemes.  There are still too many companies where pensions are paid out of current payroll leaving employees particularly vulnerable when these companies go out of business.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I too join in the welcome for the Bill and wish to commend the Minister for his enlightened approach in using these unclaimed prize sums.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join with my colleagues in welcoming this Bill. The Minister has made an effort to relieve a lot of distress which the Hospitals' Trusts employees have endured since the collapse of that company.  The <Col N="1591" /> Minister outlined why he could not make additional funds available and he spoke about the health capital programme.  I do not know how the health capital programme is devised but in my constitutency there are two particular difficulties which have not been addressed.  In Shannon Airport, which has the largest young population, there is an extensive programme of health given by the Mid-Western Health Board. However, the clinic facilities available in Shannon Airport are something like one would experience in Vietnam with the building falling down.  While the Minister might take some pride in the way he has disbursed capital in his own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, I do not think he can take any pride in what he has done in County Clare, with the disaster he has left us down there.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had this proposal on his desk for some time and, like the Hospitals Trusts employees, the people in Shannon are very frustrated with the lack of decisiveness in the Department of Health.  I would like to appeal to the Minister to at least fulfil the promise that was made on his behalf by the Fianna Fáil campaigners at the last general election who said that the clinic at Shannon would be erected within days.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Hospitals Trust employees who were not paid immediately. Deputy Hillery spoke about the accumulating sum.  Of course the employees should have benefited from that and there will still be some shortfall because the interest would have gone directly to them had they been paid immediately.  This delay has brought hardship so the Minister should dispose of the funds as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill but the sum involved is trivial.  The ex-employees would each get about £1,300. It is a damning indictment of that company that so many of these former employees are in receipt of non-contributory pensions.  As employers that company represent, in my opinion, the worst in Irish life.  They treated their employees <Col N="1592" /> very badly.  They resisted any attempts by these employees to join unions and the conditions of those employees were far from satisfactory.  I would hope that we might highlight this and make it known to employers that the conditions under which those employees worked and what was given to them in the end would not be tolerated in present day society.</P>
      <P>We may think that the Hospitals' Sweepstakes benefited our hospitals but they also greatly benefited the organisers and the people who controlled them.  I condemn a Minister in the Fine Gael Coalition Government who decided, in the latter years of the Hospitals' Sweepstakes, to increase the moneys that would be paid to the directors to the disadvantage of the employees.  The percentage given to them was increased, unreasonably in my opinion at the time. It is a sad reflection on us that we could not have devised a means to pay these employees from the sale of those premises. I know the Minister says he can do nothing about it but in the absence of that company taking responsibility, there was an obligation on the State to help these people.  Because the funds realised from the sale of those premises were enormous the employees should have got some contribution from the sale.  I would like to make it absolutely clear that I condemn the organisers of the sweepstakes for the way they treated their employees.  To think that those employees will get a miserable, maximum sum of £1,300 each is a disgrace.</P>

      <P>First I, would like to thank the number of Deputies who contributed.  I thank them for their support for the Bill and for their very constructive remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal briefly with a number of points that were made.  Deputy Yates suggested that the demise of the sweepstakes was as a result of the national lottery.  His colleague, Deputy Fennell, was closer to the mark when she spoke about lotteries being established in other countries around the world such as the <Col N="1593" /> United States, Canada and Australia.  I understand that a state lottery in California established in the mid-eighties was the deathknell for the sweepstakes in this country.  The loss of the sweepstakes was not in anyway related to the establishment of the national lottery here.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made about the national lottery.  Most of the national lottery fund that goes to health is additional and is used for community-based voluntary organisations to pursue their activities in a whole range of areas. Deputy Carey was flying far away from the substance of this Bill.  His own county might well be a good example of how lottery funds have been spent for the benefit of people in a number of areas. For example, Kilrush has received £45,000 in each of the last three years towards the provision of a community facility for the elderly, supported enthusiastically by their own community.  It would be well worth Deputy Carey's while going to see that facility.  A day care centre in Ennistymon has been supported to the tune of £40,000 a year for the last three years.  A workshop for the disabled in Shannon has been supported by the national lottery as has Busby Park treatment centre for alcoholism while a cardiac ambulance service in the Mid-Western Health Board area has been supported to the tune of £25,000.  That is just an example, in one county, of a range of facilities that benefit the elderly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and those with mental and physical handicap which are supported by national lottery funds.  As the Deputies are aware, this year the national lottery funding for health services at local level is distributed by the health boards, and it is the health board members who decide what projects will benefit.  That is as a result of an all-party committee decision.  I am glad that has been implemented by my Department and has worked very successfully in the current year.  Of course, I stipulated to the health boards that they could not <Col N="1594" /> use the lottery money in substitution of section 65 grants.  It had to be seen to be additional to what the health boards were already providing.  I do not accept that the lottery funding from the health services is used as substitution for money that should be provided from the Exchequer.  It has been of great benefit to numerous people and voluntary organisations around the country.</P>
      <P>Another question raised by a number of Deputies is that of the administration of the unclaimed prize funds and its distribution to former employees of Hospitals Trust.  It will be administered by my Department and of course we are very anxious to keep the administration costs to a minimum.  The administration costs will be paid by the Department and not out of the prize money that is available.</P>
      <P>The question of future claims was also raised.  There is provision in the Bill that there can be no claims after a period of four years unless by a person who has some disability and is unable to claim within the four years.  I would expect that in all probability there will be no claims. Some of the prize money that is there goes back to the year 1930.  I understand two prizes were unclaimed in that year. Much of the £480,000 that is available for distribution is interest on the prize money.  Most of the prizes that were unclaimed were small prizes, as I have said, going back 60 years.  Most of them are from over 20 years ago and therefore it is highly unlikely that people will claim them now, but if a valid claim is made the prizes will be paid from the Exchequer. What we intend to do is to distribute all the money at our disposal, the unclaimed prize money and the interest accruing, to the former employees of the Hospitals Trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin, Deputy Callely and a number of other Deputies outlined who they would like to see benefit from this fund.  There is general agreement that the most disadvantaged group are those who were full time employees at the time of the liquidation, who received just the statutory redundancy and did not receive their entitlement from the company. <Col N="1595" /> There is also a group of pensioners who were in receipt of a very small pension from the company but when the company went into liquidation they lost that element of their pension and now receive just social welfare benefit.  We are in consultation with the Irish Pensions Trust, who were involved in the payment of pensions and indeed have the register of pensioners, with Craig Gardner, who were involved with the unclaimed prize money, and also with representatives of former employees of Hospitals' Trust. Following those consultations we will decide exactly how we will distribute the money, what groups will benefit and in what proportion they will benefit.  I hope to have that information for the Deputies when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock said there was a change of heart on the part of the Government but that is not the case. Deputy Kitt made the point very clearly that he had made representations to the Minister for Labour who has spoken on a number of occasions about trying to do something for the former employees of Hospitals' Trust.  Deputy Sherlock, in speaking about a question from Deputy Mac Giolla, to which I replied, referred to providing Exchequer funds for these employees.  I pointed out in my opening speech that it was not possible for me as Minister for Health to provide Exchequer funding for these former employees.  Neither could we provide national lottery funding to compensate these employees for what effectively was a difficulty with a private company.  The point was made very strongly by Deputy O'Connell that that private company did not discharge their responsibility.  There was no avenue open to me as Minister for Health or indeed, in my view, to any other Minister, to provide moneys from the Exchequer.  What we did, because of the concern referred to by Deputy Kitt and many other Deputies &mdash; my colleague, the Minister for Labour, referred to this a number of times &mdash; was look for some way in which we might be able to help.  It was at that stage that the Government decided we should set up a <Col N="1596" /> fund in my Department comprising the unclaimed prize money and the accrued interest and distribute it for the benefit of those former employees of Hospitals' Trust.  I want to assure Deputy Sherlock that there was no change of heart on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Deputies agree that the course we took to use the funding that has been there, some of it as I have said dating back for 60 years, was the right and proper one.  I accept that £480,000 is not an exorbitant amount of money, particularly when it is divided among a number of employees, but at least it shows a concern for the plight of these workers.  I am very pleased that we were able to find a way to assist these people. I would like again to thank the Deputies for their very constructive remarks on Second Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution of £12,740,000 by the Irish Government to the Ninth Replenishment of the Resources of the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>The International Development Association, or IDA, an affiliate organisation of the World Bank, came into being in September 1960.  Both organisations have a common objective &mdash; to support the economic development of the developing countries by lending funds, providing advice and serving as a catalyst to stimulate investment by others.  The World Bank raises most of its funds by borrowing on the world's capital markets and onlends these funds at more or less commercial rates to a wide range of developing countries.  IDA, on the other hand, is funded by regular replenishments, or grant contributions, from its richer member countries and by repayments of past IDA credits.  It can, therefore, provide highly concessionary assistance to the very poorest of the developing countries which cannot afford to borrow from the World Bank.  Loans are interest free and are given for periods of 35-40 years, with a grace period of ten years.  IDA remain the largest multilateral source of concessional funding to these countries, accounting for about 50 per cent of the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA lend almost exclusively to the very poorest countries &mdash; those with a <i>per capita</i> GNP below $700.  It is active in all regions, but especially in sub-Saharan Africa and the low income countries of Asia.  It finances projects in many sectors, with agriculture, rural development, <Col N="1598" /> transport and telecommunications taking the lion's share of the resources of the last replenishment &mdash; IDA 8.  While financing specific investment projects has traditionally been and continues to be the mainstay of its operations, IDA, like the World Bank, has in recent years become increasingly concerned with lending in support of policy reform and economic adjustment.  In IDA 8, the share of quick-disbursing adjustment lending was around 25 per cent of total IDA lending and it is proposed that this level be maintained during IDA 9.</P>
    <P>The negotiations to replenish IDA resources, which are generally held every three years, have become increasingly difficult over the years.  Since the amounts involved are large, care must be taken to ensure that contributions, while voluntary, are shared between donors on an equitable basis.  Donors also have diverse objectives, which must be reconciled, and the end result must be consistent with the developmental mandate of IDA.  The negotiations on the ninth replenishment of IDA, which is the subject of the Bill before the House today, took place in 1989 and were conducted by officials representing each of the donor countries, including Ireland.  The discussions started with a review of IDA's programmes and there was broad support for the way IDA's role has evolved in recent years.  It was agreed that, in the coming years, IDA should increase its anti-poverty initiatives, strengthen its assistance to countries pursuing economic policy reforms and place more emphasis on critical environmental issues.</P>
    <P>Poverty reduction has been central to IDA's mandate and donors have encouraged an even stronger emphasis on poverty reduction in IDA's future programmes.  To underline their concern, they urged that, in allocating resources between countries, greater weight be given to the performance of the authorities concerned in alleviating poverty. This is an aspect of the evolution of IDA policy in recent years that Ireland has strongly supported.  In seeking to secure long term growth, through adjustment, <Col N="1599" /> in the low income countries, we cannot ignore the needs of those suffering in conditions of acute poverty.  Many countries have courageously undertaken reform programmes which involve very difficult choices and they need our support to carry them out.  The effects on the poor must be given priority attention.</P>
    <P>Of great importance, too, is the need to ensure the maximum involvement by governments themselves in the preparation of reform programmes and their unswerving commitment to their implementation.  These programmes cannot be imposed on a country by outside agencies if they are to have any hope of success.  I welcome, therefore, the increasing stress being placed by IDA on the need for governments to &ldquo;own&rdquo; their adjustment programmes.  The development of strong working partnerships between governments and voluntary agencies, both domestic and foreign, is also vital.  These organisations, with their practical insight into the development process and their close ties with local communties have a very important role to play and I am glad to see that IDA has, in recent years, put considerable effort into strengthening its relationships with the non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>Environmental degradation wrought by economic progress is now recognised as one of the most serious problems facing mankind.  We have finally realised that care for the environment is important, both for its own sake and because it is vital to sustainable economic progress. IDA has made great strides in recent years in building an environmental consciousness into all its activities.  New environmental assessment procedures, now in place for IDA projects, ensure a rigorous technical review at an early stage &mdash; before decisions are taken on site selection or project design.  IDA intends to complete environmental action plans for all its borrowers during the IDA 9 period, giving priority to those countries where major problems have been identified. It is also attempting to promote a constructive dialogue with concerned <Col N="1600" /> public groups and has promised to involve them at all stages of the environmental assessment process.</P>
    <P>The size of the ninth replenishment was discussed extensively during the negotiations.  There was general agreement on the need for a substantial expansion of its resources if IDA was to support accelerated growth and adjustment in its member countries.  Consideration had to be given to the possibility of additional demands on IDA by potential new members like Angola, or from the resumption of lending to countries like Afghanistan and Vietnam who have borrowed little or not at all from IDA in recent years.  The negotiators were, therefore, faced with the task of reconciling the needs of IDA's borrowers with the budgetary realities of their own Governments.  It became clear that, at any realistic replenishment size, important unmet demands would remain.  After prolonged discussions, the donors agreed to recommend a replenishment of 11.68 billion SDRs, which would maintain, in real terms, the value of IDA 8.</P>
    <P>With the decision on the overall size of the replenishment, the donors set about determining the relative contributions of the different countries.  The system of burden sharing eventually agreed took members' percentage share in the eighth replenishment as the starting position and adjusted those shares to take account of inflation and exchange rate changes in member countries in the interim. Because of variations in the inflation and exchange rates of the different countries, this led to significant changes in the relative contributions of some donors <i>vis-à-vis</i> their IDA 8 shares.  The shares of Belgium, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the US declined while those of Austria, Finland and Spain increased.  Ireland's percentage share went down marginally from 0.11 per cent to 0.10 per cent. However, the sum of these potential contributions did not reach the 11.68 billion SDRs required to maintain the real value of IDA 8.  In order to fill the remaining gap a number of countries, including Ireland, pledged supplementary contributions, over and above their agreed <Col N="1601" /> share.  Switzerland, which was not at the time a member of IDA but has since applied to join, agreed to make available a grant of 184 million SDRs.  Repayments of 1.58 billion SDRs due from earlier IDA loans, will futher swell the resources available for commitment by IDA over the three year period covered by IDA 9, bringing the total to 13.26 billion SDRs equivalent to some IR£12 billion.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been a strong supporter of IDA whose concern with the needs of the poorest developing countries closely reflects the priorities of our own IDA programme.  We have been regular contributors to the replenishments and participated in two special facilities which were needed to top up IDA's resources in 1984 and 1985.  For IDA 8, we provided an extra contribution of IR£260,000 over our basic share of IR£9.4 million.  Though small, this voluntary addition was evidence of our firm commitment to IDA, at a time of serious budgetary constraints on the domestic front.  This commitment was more forcefully demonstrated when, in the recent efforts to reach a replenishment level of 11.68 billion SDRs for IDA 9, we agreed &mdash; subject to legislative approval &mdash; to provide a supplementary contribution of 2 million SDRs, on top of our basic share of 12 million SDRs.  As a percentage of our basic contribution, this voluntary payment is among the highest of all donors.</P>
    <P>The resources pledged for IDA 9 will be available to IDA for commitment during the three-year period of the replenishment.  However, disbursement of the cash will take place only as the projects financed by those loans are implemented.  Donors, therefore, have the option of initially depositing demand notes with the IDA for the amount of their contributions.  Calls on these notes are expected to be phased over a ten-year period beginning in 1991.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of IDA was authorised by the International Development Association Act, 1960.  Our contributions to the various replenishments have each been authorised by amendments to that Act.  This Bill amends the <Col N="1602" /> International Development Association Act, 1960, by including the payments in respect of the Ninth Replenishment in the schedule of payments which may be made to IDA.  When enacted, it will affirm our continued commitment to the objectives of IDA.  Ireland's contributions to IDA are part of our official development assistance programme.</P>
    <P>The successful conclusion of the IDA 9 negotiations has reaffirmed the strong donor support for IDA and the role it is expected to play in the next three years in providing concessional development financing to the poorest countries. The resources provided in the Ninth Replenishment will enable IDA to continue to be an effective partner in the efforts of its members to reduce poverty and achieve a higher rate of sustainable growth.  While we would have supported a somewhat larger replenishment, we are satisfied that the level agreed was the highest on which consensus could be reached given the budgetary constraints being faced by donors.  We are particularly pleased to have played a role &mdash; through our supplementary contribution &mdash; in achieving a figure that will allow for the continuation of the present level of activity.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, recommend this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill.  We will support it. However, the amount is disappointing but not so much from Ireland's point of view.  Our commitment has increased from the last replenishment in March 1986 of £9.6 million to £12.74 million. The overall figure of US$11.68 billion is down from the US$12.4 billion replenishment in 1988.  This is extremely worrying and it is disastrous at a time when the least developed countries are getting poorer and more countries are joining the ranks of the least developed countries.  It probably is a measure of the concern of always attracts so little support with few few people willing or wanting to conpeople willing or wanting to contribute to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" /> Hospitals' Sweepstakes allocation of money and many Deputies came in to contribute.  If I was very cynical I would say it is because their constituents are around the House and are listening to what they have to say.  Unfortunately, the people who will or will not gain from what we are doing here today, live many thousands of miles away and certainly do not have the benefit of radio, television and newspapers to know what is being said here or in other countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that IDA are continuing their poverty orientated policy. This became clear in the last replenishment in the IDA Bill before this House in 1987-88.  That is to be welcomed.  When Ireland became associated with IDA the thrust of development was on big infrastructural projects, such as roads, rails, airports and so on.  I welcomed the shift in emphasis towards the more primary type development projects in education, health, agriculture products, village water systems, and so on.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity to visit a number of African countries and the Philippines and it is very easy to become depressed and pessimistic about the future of some of those countries.  Conditions are deteriorating despite pouring millions of dollars, pounds, kroners and other curencies into these countries.  The lot of the poorest people seems to be getting worse.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that in his speech the Minister for Finance did not talk about the responsibility of the European Banks and the European Community to look at debt reduction.  I realise the Minister did not want to get into a wider area in relation to our commitments to overseas development, but the Government's record in the amount of money that has been axed from our ODA programme is so abysmal that I am not surprised the Minister did not even go as far as his predecessor, ex-Deputy MacSharry, did in the 1988 Bill, in that speech, at least the then Deputy MacSharry made a vague reference to our bilateral aid programme.  Even that reference is not in this Minister's speech.  I <Col N="1604" /> suspect that might be because there is a great deal of embarrassment in the Department at the savage reductions in our ODA progamme.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill, although not directly related to our national programme, gives me and other Deputies an opportunity to highlight and to express our shame at what has happened to our ODA programme.  Last November when the 1989 Book of Estimates was published, quite a fuss was made that our ODA programme was being increased by £.5 million.  I had a series of questions down and each time I was told that despite the financial constraints, there had been an increase, but lo and behold, when the budget was introduced in January £1 million had disappeared.  I will remind the House of the cynicism with which that £1 million disappeared, and how it was described to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in reply to a question on 7 February 1990, at column 1039 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The £1 million not required for the European Development Fund has not been spent by my Department.  The allocation for this has been reduced by £1 million which has been taken into account as a reduction in the 1990 budget arithmetic.</P>
    <P>The Vote for International Co-operation in the post-budget revised Estimates Volume will show a reduction of £1 million in the relevant subhead and in the Vote as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates published in November 1989 showed a will-o'-the-wisp potential increase in our mandatory payment which quickly disappeared. Instead of responsible action being taken by the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs and the Junior Minister for Overseas Development, what happened?  It became part of the budgetary arithmetic. Would the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs go to one of the Third World countries and talk to one of those children with the swollen bellies, poor clothing, running eyes and no food and tell them they are part of the budgetary arithmetic in Ireland?  Can one imagine the shame <Col N="1605" /> of saying to a mother nursing a dying child &ldquo;I am sorry this £1 million we had allocated for ODA, irrespective of whether it was mandatory or bilateral, is needed for something else?&rdquo;  At the time I commented that we had managed to find in our Budget £3 million for horses and dogs, but the Government did not even have the generosity to leave that £1 million which was not needed, as a mandatory payment with our bilateral aid programme.  Hence we see savage things happening in our bilateral aid programme.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, who at this time is putting the finishing touches to the Book of Estimates, will not add to our disgraceful record in relation to overseas development aid.  I should remind the House, in the context of this Bill, that our percentage share to the International Development Association has been reduced from 0.11 per cent, the level it was at in 1988, to 0.10 per cent.  Furthermore, since 1986 our overseas development aid budget has been reduced from 0.256 per cent of GNP to 0.158 per cent.  The figure is often given as 0.16 per cent as it sounds just a little better but whatever way we read the figure there has been a reduction with the result that shame continues to be brought to this country.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid must find it very embarrassing to sit with their European colleagues given that our contribution is the lowest of the OECD countries as a percentage of GNP.  I hope the Minister will see to it that the budget is increased this year.</P>
    <P>Ministers stand up in this House, or outside when they consider it appropriate, to make major speeches, which will receive plenty of publicity, in which they will talk about the country's improved economic circumstances.  I acknowledge that there are some indications that circumstances have improved in some areas of the economy but the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues should put their money where their mouth is.  Year after year the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats before they entered <Col N="1606" /> Government stated that our contribution should reach 0.7 per cent of GNP, yet we have seen no moves to attain such a target.  The Minister now has an opportunity to take some steps to increase the budget.  I have been getting hints from non-governmental organisations that they fear this will not happen but I hope their fears are not justified.  I wish to take this opportunity to say to the Minister, woe betide the Government if they do not increase their overseas development aid budget.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the difficulties facing many developing countries who benefit from the International Development Association fund are increasing. During the summer I received as did, I am sure, many of my colleagues, a letter asking me to sign a petition calling on European banks and governments to take initiatives to reduce the debt burden. According to the World Bank there are 69 countries who find themselves in deep trouble because of the debt burden.  It is important to consider what this means. Between 1982 and 1988 the net transfer of resources from debt burdened countries to banks outside those countries totalled US $144 billion.  On reading those figures I was reminded of the old song, &ldquo;There is a hole in the bucket&rdquo;&mdash; as water was being poured in it was pouring out at the other end, so it is with the money being poured in by Ireland, the European Community and all other donor countries, it is pouring out at an even quicker rate at the other side.  The effect of this on the countries concerned has to be seen to be believed.  It is very easy for a Minister for Finance to sit in a plush office in Brussels or wherever to discuss figures, statistics and percentages but has he ever wondered what these figures and percentages mean for these countries?  The other day at a local hotel I watched a video film on Sudan.  I saw hungry children with sore infested mouths and eyes, wearing raggy bits of shirts and in shelters which were no better than animal shelters.  Indeed most animal houses in this country are of a far higher quality than the ones shown on that video.  Each day over 40,000 children die <Col N="1607" /> and it was estimated in a United Nations report in 1988 that children are bearing the heaviest burden.  It stated that &ldquo;it can be estimated that 500,000 young children have died in the last 12 months as a result of the slowing down or the reversal of progress in the developing world&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We just cannot talk about figures and statistics, we have to recognise that people are dying.  Indeed, since the Minister and I stood up to make our contributions many children have died of hunger because the international world have reneged on their responsibilities to them.  Until such time as we increase our budget we cannot hope to sit with dignity at the tables and fora in Europe and the United Nations.  It is interesting to note that in September the Taoiseach attended the European Summit on children, signed the Book of Intent and promised that we would ratify the United Nations convention on children.  In signing that book even the Taoiseach must have felt great embarrassment given that we had made no allocation to the United Nations world food programme in 1987 or 1988; yet, we saw him being photographed and getting the publicity leaders of countries receive on such occasions. He must have felt his words turn to clay in his mouth.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to tell us that this Bill has not been forced upon him and that he means what he says, that along with the World Bank and the United Nations we want to see an improvement in the quality of life and the lot of people in the least developed countries.  It is not enough to just say this, he has to put his money where his mouth is.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I say to the Minister that we have to recognise that the excellent non-governmental organisations in this country, in Europe and throughout the world, cannot solve the problems of under-development in the Third World; only governments and large institutions can tackle the major underlying problem involved.  The non-governmental organisations in this country have increasingly found in recent years that they are carrying out projects in Third World countries <Col N="1608" /> that the Governments of those countries should be looking after but because too much emphasis is placed on the need to produce cash crops, export crops, to pay back the debts owed to the developed and richer world, they cannot meet the very basic needs of their communities. Therefore these non-governmental organisations have to do work which they hoped they would never have to do. These organisations will never be able to solve the underlying problems of these countries.  I ask the Minister for Finance, who has a significant role to play, to try to get that point across at EC level.  The non-governmental organisations play a very important role but it is not the top role in these countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement, for which the Minister will take credit perhaps, that, in a haphazard way, we have agreed to give an extra 2 million SDRs on top of our share of 12 million SDRs. I will never look a gift horse in the mouth but it seems from the tone of the Minister's speech that the Part 1 countries were reluctant to tackle the issue of under-development in a proper way, that with great reluctance, then, supposedly maintained the value of IDA 9 at the IDA 8 level.  I do not believe that was the case.  We should be looking for more than the equivalent value.  We should be looking for an increase at a time when more and more people are dying from underdevelopment and starvation.  I hope the Minister will see from the debate this morning that he should not allow the Department of Foreign Affairs to continue to look to our own national ODA budget as a piggy-bank for the Department of Foreign Affairs in a general way or for any other Department of State.  It should have status and priority in its own right and I hope in a short time to bring proposals to this Chamber that would ensure that no Minister can touch the budget of whatever Government until we have reached the stage of contributing at the rate of 0.7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>I hope the Progressive Democrat section of the Government will take more interest in what is happening in the Department of Foreign Affairs and in the <Col N="1609" /> development area than their spokesperson took on 3 March 1988 when this Bill was introduced.  The then spokesperson, former Deputy McDowell, had three and a half lines to contribute to this debate.  I will remind the House of what he said on that occasion and I hope that things have improved in that party since. He said &mdash; column 1610 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats support the Bill and I have nothing further, relevant or irrelevant, to add to that.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that none of their members is present but I hope they will play a significant role in this area.  They issued a document a few weeks ago commiting themselves to an improvement in the ODA budget.  I hope that is a real commitment and a little more than the three and a half lines used in the introduction of this Bill in 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point that needs to be made in relation to Ireland's ODA, apart from the deplorable fact that it has been cut over the past two or three years, is that we are takers and not givers. This country receives far more from Third World countries in payment for services provided, consultancies and so on, than we give by way of official aid.</P>
      <P>Ireland trades on its history as a post-colonial country when it addresses the Third World and, in the European Community, Ireland leads the peripheral areas in our insistence on the obligation of the rich to help the poor to help ourselves. In both respects large doses of hypocrisy are evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's history puts us in a better position than almost any other European state to understand the political, social and economic needs of countries which are still dominated by colonial and neo-colonial interests.  Ireland benefits more than most EC states from transfers of European Community funds, RDF funds, CAP funds, ESF funds etc, which are provided to reduce the difference between the Community's rich heartlands and the less developed periphery. When it comes to the question of the <Col N="1610" /> sincerity of what they say about playing an effective role in dealing with global problems, the leaders of recent Irish Governments have succeeded only in proving that they are indulging in so much guff.  Irish Overseas Development Aid has, in the past few years, been sacrificed on the altar of fiscal rectitude.</P>
    <P>The United Nations' target for aid from the developed to the underdeveloped or Third World is 0.7 per cent of gross national product.  By any standards it is a modest target but no Irish Government has done better than come close to half of that figure.  Since 1987 the level of official Government aid to the Third World has fallen year after year.  It is now lower in real terms than it has ever been, although the Taoiseach and his Ministers persist in telling the Irish people that the economy is in better shape than it has ever been.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the Taoiseach's reply to a question from me on 14 June 1990, as reported at column 2499 of the Official Report, in which he said:</P>
    <P>I know the Deputy is aware that Ireland's contribution to the Third World is not confined to our financial contribution under the Overseas Development Aid programme; we make enormous contributions in other ways at a personal level.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Government are hiding behind the very real generosity of the ordinary man and woman of this country who refuse to let people die when they are made aware of natural and manmade disasters.</P>
    <P>One example makes the point with brutal clarity.  While Ireland received an 80 per cent increase in its allocation from the European Community by way of Structural Funds, the Government at the end of the eighties were cutting their bilateral aid to Sudan by exactly the same percentage.  The very politicians who had talked about playing an enlightened role in world affairs &mdash; particularly in relation to the Third World &mdash; cut their miserly assistance to the poorest of the poor by 80 per cent.  As Mr. Colm Roddy, the <Col N="1611" /> administrator of Campaign-Aid put it recently in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 26 June 1990:</P>
    <P>We are seen far and wide to insist on the principle of rich helping the poor where Europe is concerned while jettisoning it in our relations with poorer countries.</P>
    <P>Irish Overseas Development Aid has been cut in each year since 1986.  We give the equivalent of only 2.5p per person daily in official aid.  A recent survey shows that of the 18 wealthiest member states of the OECD, Ireland comes bottom of the league in terms of its contribution to Overseas Development Aid.  Ireland gives a lower proportion of ODA than even Mrs. Thatcher's Britain whose philosophy is that each individual is responsible for their own plight and if they were only enterprising enough they would not be hungry or thirsty or dying of disease.</P>
    <P>Given our own history, we should understand better than most the appalling impact of famine, yet our Government are turning their back on the hunger and suffering of the Third World.  This is not in any way to belittle the efforts of voluntary organisations or the thousands of Irish volunteers &mdash; teachers, nurses, doctors, scientists, agricultural instructors, engineers, priests and nuns &mdash; who devote their talents and energy to helping the people of the developing world, nor is it in any way to deny the generosity of the Irish people.  Very often, it is the poorest among us who respond so generously to appeals on behalf of those who have fallen victim to natural or man-made disasters.</P>
    <P>The fact is, however, that the work of the volunteers is belittled and the generosity of the Irish people is done a bitter injustice by a Government who refuses in the meanest and most short-sighted way to back up the work of non-Governmental and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The Government now have an opportunity in the Estimates which are due to undo some of the damage that has been done by their mean and niggardly attitude <Col N="1612" /> to ODA.  A substantial increase is required in ODA.  The very minimum that should be done is to restore it to the 1986 level which is being requested by the Campaign-Aid organisation.  A timetable should be set to bring it up to the United Nations' figure of 0.7 per cent of GNP which was set in 1970 &mdash; 20 years ago. The target should be reached within five years.</P>
    <P>I would argue also that the commitment to bringing our ODA up to the UN target should be in some way enshrined in legislation so that Governments can be prevented from back-tracking on it by a simple stroke of the pen behind closed doors.  There is also a need to reinstate the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Development Co-operation which played an important role in maintaining both the interests of the Oireachtas and the interests of the public in the whole question of the Third World and developing countries.  There are wider political and economic questions regarding development and development aid.</P>
    <P>The north-south division of the world's wealth, which makes the north, with some exceptions, rich and the south, with some exceptions, poor is not an accident. The world's resources are not all, or even substantially, in the territories of the rich. The raw materials which ensured that the developed countries could and did develop their industries came in great part from countries that remained underdeveloped or undeveloped.  This element of colonialism is understood by almost everyone in the two hemispheres, north and south, but it is in the north that most can be done to drive the lesson home.</P>
    <P>What might be less clearly understood is that even where there is a reduced degree of dependence on the resources of the Third World &mdash; because of technology, for example &mdash; the relationship continues through financial and political links, almost always manifest in debt and in the popping up of corrupt local or regional regimes.  These corrupt powers frequently borrow not for the benefit of their populations but to suppress them or threaten their equally poor neighbours. <Col N="1613" /> If the international banking system occasionally shudder at the thought of unpaid debts which have to be written off the arms industry is usually the ultimate beneficiary and not the subsistence farmers of Africa or South America.</P>
    <P>There are several different ways in which aid can be given to the Third World.  In the short term, for instance, it can be provided by giving relief in the event of disaster, which is done by this country on a regular basis because of the generosity of the Irish people.  However, in the long term the structural changes required can only be achieved by governments in the developed countries deciding as a matter of policy to live up to their obligations, obligations imposed on them not only by the benefits they have enjoyed from the exploitation of the poor but obligations imposed on them because of the need to pre-empt the cataclysm which may well overwhelm them if they do nothing to change their approach.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Lomé IV.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has tabled a motion seeking to ratify Lomé IV.  When I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business when it was proposed to have a debate on that Convention I was told it would be a matter for the Whips.  There are two points which need to be made initially in this regard.  First, it would be deplorable if this Convention which has taken a considerable time to emerge was ratified here without a debate.  Very serious questions arise in relation to the Convention.  I know that there are a vast range of non-governmental organisations both in the developed world, the European Community and the APC countries who are dissatisfied with the direction of Lomé IV and who are conscious that despite three previous agreements, Lomé IV has not, in effect, led to development in the APC countries.  They believe that the current agreement, which is due to be ratified, will not lead to development either.  Indeed, the remark has been made that the letter is still there but the spirit has gone.</P>
    <P>It is important that this House is given an opportunity to discuss specifically what is in that agreement.  There is still <Col N="1614" /> time to put pressure on European Governments, and indeed the European Community, to make some concessions on the fundamental issues which arise in that agreement.  In addition to continuing the focus on agricultural development there is a major need to link this to industrial expansion.  This would allow developing countries to move to value-added processing of their raw materials and allow them to break out of the strait-jacket of primary commodity production.</P>
    <P>Some of the areas which need to be addressed are agreement on a strategy towards global stimulation of growth and demand, stabilisation of exchange rates, increasing use of non-currency agreements and active encourgagement of the south-south trade, that is, preferential trade between the less developed countries.  There is an example of such trade in the preferential trade area operated by a number of countries in Southern and Eastern Asia.  The overall objective towards which all inputs should be directed is to facilitate a higher level of self-sufficiency and economic self-determination for less developed countries, which are at present extremely vulnerable to price fluctuations on international commodity and currency markets.  These moves should be combinded with an extension of development grants instead of loans.  The cancellation, or at least a radical rescheduling, of many or all loans to APC countries is also required.  While cash arrangements or transfers in the order of a minimum of $20 billion by the year 2000, as mentioned in recent negotiations, cannot of themselves stimulate the desired development of less developed countries they are, however, an essential component in any overall package.</P>
    <P>There is another sacred cow which must be challenged in this whole area of development, development assistance and aid, that is, the insistence by the group of ten industrialised nations that the private sector is the only potential engine for Third World development. They cite the experience of newly industrialised countries such as South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines as <Col N="1615" /> examples to be followed by other countries seeking to develop their economies. However, the actual situation in these countries has been characterised by a strong interventionist policy on the part of the State, controls on hard currency and industrial credit, and selective incentives and support funding targeted at the most productive sectors of the economy. In addition, we should not forget that these countries have had draconian forms of government with wealth and power concentrated in an oligarchy while the great majority of the population live under conditions of dire exploitation.</P>
    <P>This last point brings me to a necessary emphasis on our overall approach to development &mdash; the protection of human, civil, economic, social and cultural rights. Aid projects should be linked to observance by the host country of the United Nations Covenants on these areas.  This, in turn, requires a strengthening of the institutions of the United Nations, in particular, those involved with advancing economic, social and cultural rights such as the ILO, WHO, UNESCO, UNICEF, FAO and the UNDP.</P>
    <P>It is important that we bear in mind the points I have made when discussing the question of development aid and the Third World.  It is not simply a matter of charity or of being kind to people who are less well off than ourselves.  In a very real sense it is a question of survival, the survival of the countries which are already developed, and of applying a sense of humanity to the rest of the world and acknowledging that in many respects our prosperity depends on the development of these countries.  Indeed, our current level of prosperity &mdash; many would argue about how unequally that prosperity is shared &mdash; depends to a very large degree on the fact that the people of the Third World are exploited unmercifully. It is in that light that the Government, and the House, have a responsibility to ensure in the first place that the quantity of aid is at least brought up to the level indicated by the United Nations 20 years ago and that the quality of our aid and of <Col N="1616" /> the policies and politics we apply internationally, within the European Community and elsewhere, is taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief comments on the Bill and to say that the Labour Party will, of course, support this measure.  I should like to be associated with the general comments made by Deputies Owen and De Rossa on the level of contributions both by this country and by other countries which are perhaps much better geared to providing a higher percentage of their GNP than we in Ireland are.  We are a small country with our own difficulties.  Nonetheless we could do somewhat better in the area of Third World aid.  It is a great pity that we do not have a forum in which to discuss these matters on a more regular basis. The opportunity arises for the most part when Bills such as these are brought before the House.  One can only hark back to the constant calls by the Labour Party spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, for a Foreign Affairs Committee of this House, calls with which many Deputies agree. These matters could then be examined a more regular basis and new developments or tragedies could be examined without having to wait for Bills to come into the House at intervals of two, three or more years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate in 1988 my colleague, Deputy Higgins, spoke at some length on the issue of armaments and drew the comparison between the expenditure by the big powers and other countries on armament production and the pathetically small contribution to relieve deaths on a daily basis among children and adults in Third World countries.  If anything, the situation has worsened.  Armament expenditure increases and escalates across the world in power hungry countries who take the view that a few crumbs from their enormous budgets are adequate to salve their consciences.  They do not really care about what is happening in the Third World, about the havoc being caused in <Col N="1617" /> those countries and the appalling incidence of death, disease and illness, apart from natural disasters.</P>
    <P>One must consider the level of support given to the Third World by those countries which support that concept.  I was surprised by a reply given on the last occasion by the then Minister for Finance to the effect that the USSR does not contribute at all to these funds.  I do not know whether that position has changed. If not, it is a sad reflection.  I am sorry to have to say, as one who is and has been a sympathiser of the position of the USSR, that it is unforgiveable that no contribution should be made.  They are having their own economic difficulties, as we all know, but when the question of priorities comes up and the need of one's neighbour is concerned &mdash; the people who live in the Third World are our neighbours &mdash; I find it unacceptable that the USSR should not make even a token contribution.</P>
    <P>I see that the shares of Belgium, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the US have declined since 1988.  This should be highlighted. In considering what would be reasonable contributions to the Third World one must look at the relative income and wealth of other countries. The OPEC countries are the wealthiest nations at present, even without the 50 to 70 per cent increase in the price of their oil product.  The transfer of wealth to OPEC countries which has taken place in the past decade has been enormous and it affects us in the western world. Have oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Indonesia and so on made a commensurate increase in their contributions to alleviating the suffering of those countries which are geographically nearer to them than to us? They have certainly not gone any way towards making a commensurate contribution. Rarely if ever is a word uttered in criticism of the OPEC countries, with the enormous funds coming from their escalating oil revenues.  Escalating prices for oil hit Third World countries very hard.  The energy produced by that oil is a crucial factor in the tenuous and tentative development steps that have to <Col N="1618" /> be taken in Third World countries if they are to have any hope of lifting themselves off the floor.  The increase in oil prices draws out further from the Third World countries what little resources they have. Are they making any allowances for that or making any assessment of the needs of those Third World countries or taking into account the effect on them of the vast increase in prices?  Europe is better equipped to meet these oil price increases.  Oil and energy are esential in the Third World yet there is a transfer of wealth from the Third World to the OPEC countries.  Where is that commented on or assessed?  The Minister's telling comment is that the shares in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the US have declined over this period.  That is a very sad reflection and I wonder if anything can be done about it.</P>
    <P>It is sad to think of what is going on in the Third World and what little progress has been made.  The contributions made by the west and by the OPEC countries over the years have not helped to any significant extent.  The overall position has worsened.  Are we content to say we will just carry on in this way and will not get together and decide that all of us should make some more effective contribution? We can afford a bit more than that and <i>a fortiori</i> the US can afford more than they have contributed, the USSR can afford something and the OPEC countries can afford a hell of a lot more than they have been contributing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech.  We are contributing £12,740,000 to the International Development Association.  I will deal later with the debate which has taken place on ODA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it has to be said that, as a nation, we have been very vocal within the framework of the International Development Association.  Looking at the figures the Minister presented to the House today it is obvious that we are giving more than stronger economies. This financial support goes to the economic development of developing countries, by lending funds, providing advice <Col N="1619" /> and stimulating investment.  It is obvious that there is a whole world order debate taking place, something about which I have spoken before, referred to as the north/south divide.  I contend the more international agencies that become involved in this debate the better within the framework of the IDA, and the more State-binding directives and agreements the better.  In saying that, we are all simultaneously closely watching the development of the EC.</P>
    <P>I said before, in a debate on the Third World, that the acid test of the success of the Community will be its treatment of the Third World.  There is a separate simultaneous debate taking place within Europe on political and economic union, indeed on how the Community will support Eastern Europe as it joins more closely the remainder of Europe.  That can be achieved; there is no great problem to be encountered when dealing with our near neighbours.  But there is always a problem for strong economies.  There is a challenge held out to the EC, looking to the Third World, whether it be the sub-Saharan region or parts of Asia, regions more distant from us.  There is also the grave danger that we might leave them to their own devices.  One comforting thought is that &mdash; by way of modern communication systems, television in particular &mdash; the harsh realities of what is taking place throughout the world are brought home to us daily.  To that end we must all warmly applaud the media, people who have brought those harsh realities into our homes, people like John Pilger on the work he has done on bringing to us the harsh realities of Cambodia.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the success of the EC in helping the Third World will depend on how the Community, as a body, treats those who are starving and more disadvantaged worldwide.  Through the mechanism of the International Development Association the World Bank raises funds, by borrowing moneys from richer member countries, with loans given, interest free, for periods of up to 40 years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact also that many former world leaders, people like Willy <Col N="1620" /> Brandt and others, are closely involved in this debate.  People like him have led great nations and have more time now to devote to this issue.  It is enormously important that they continue their good work in this area.</P>
    <P>I contend that the International Development Association gets to the core of the problem affording low income countries &mdash; in particular in the sub-Saharan region of Africa &mdash; an opportunity to tackle their problems of agriculture, rural development, transport and other basic services.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we have been experiencing serious problems within our economy.  In recent years our Government have had to tackle problems in respect of health care, social welfare and so on.  In saying that I appreciate that the debate on this Bill takes place within the overall context of our real problems.  We have been a strong supporter of the Third World within the IDA system, recognising the sense of urgency required.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the International Development Association builds up a strong relationship between strong economy nations.  A number of speakers have pointed out that some of these stronger economies should contribute more and there is no doubt about that. The IDA structure ensures the maintenance of the relationship between stronger economies and, indeed, with non-governmental agencies, which is most important.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the overall question of our environment worldwide. There is no doubt but that in the past the environment suffered seriously worldwide as a result of prevailing poverty, of large corporate businesses taking advantage of poorer regions.  Therefore, it is a welcome observation that they are not merely economic concerns that are being debated here.  I notice that every programme being proposed by the new regime will have an environmental perspective, in particular with reference to the damage done already to those poorer regions.  I might instance cases of forests having been cleared for economic development purposes with quick profits <Col N="1621" /> having been made by outside businesses, people who moved on leaving untold destruction behind them and enormous suffering for local communities.  I welcome the fact that an environmental action plan will be built-in for all borrowers during the ninth replenishment period of the International Development Association, with priority being given to countries that have suffered to date. Indeed, many such countries and regions have been irreparably damaged, making it extremely difficult for them to retrieve anything as a consequence.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about today is a three-year programme.  I am pleased Ireland has given, in effect, 0.12 per cent of GNP if one ties in the voluntary contribution which I understand to have been two million SDRs.  It is regrettable that some strong economies, such as the United States, have not seen fit to increase their contribution along the lines desired.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to our overseas development aid, our official development assistance contribution.  I have spoken about this in the past.  I recognise that there have been constraints on us in endeavouring to improve our contribution.  There have been many letters to the press about this also, with a public awareness of the need to increase our ODA.  I welcome that reasoned debate.  The position of the Government has been that they have had to tackle serious financial problems with many bills having to be paid at home.  I might refer to just two of those bills.  Let me take the example of the period 1986-90 &mdash; referred to today &mdash; when health expenditure rose by 13.7 per cent and social welfare, by 7.9 per cent, at a time when serious cutbacks were implemented.  Our ODA budget has dropped by 15 per cent within that period.  That puts the ODA issue into perspective in that while the Government have been endeavouring to get their own house in order the ODA budget has been reduced.  Deputy Owen pointed out that our contribution had dropped from 0.25 per cent to 0.16 per cent, from £40.5 million to £34.5 million.</P>
    <P>Acknowledging, as we must, that we <Col N="1622" /> are very low in the OECD league of aid contributors, taking into account that our economy is beginning to move very steadily, I urge our Government to consider turning the graph upwards with regard to ODA.  I appreciate the constraints still obtaining.  Speaking to members of the public, particularly young people, about many problems of their own in the health area and others, I have found tremendous support and acceptance of the need to at least turn the graph.  It is well known that the United Nations' recommendation on ODA is 0.7 per cent of GDP.  The Government have accepted that recommendation and are endeavouring to achieve it.  However, we have experienced a number of difficult years. Indeed, we must acknowledge the work undertaken by the Government to correct our economic problems.</P>
    <P>While many economic and social challenges will face us in the future I contend the time is ripe to turn the graph upwards as our economic and financial position improves.  I say that not merely for moral reasons but for material ones also in that providing aid to the Third World opens up many potential commercial doors.</P>
    <P>In 1989 Irish State agencies exported £84 million worth of services to developing countries.  A great deal of trade is facilitated by Irish aid, and it obviously makes it easier for Irish semi-State and other companies to break into those overseas markets and build up business in the Third World.  It provides contact and good will for our entrepreneurs.  Irish staff get training.  Therefore there is not just a moral reason to turn the graph; there are also economic reasons.  As the economic and financial position, which is a great credit to this Government, improves we should increase our assistance to the development of the Third World.  Givers are receivers.</P>
    <P>We are into new times.  People are beginning to look outwards, and not just in Europe.  Young people especially are beginning to look outwards and to see the responsibilities we have outside our shores.  I, for one, will be pleased to see even a small improvement in our Overseas Development Aid brought into place <Col N="1623" /> as soon as possible.  Of course, I will be delighted to see some improvement in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>Our record under the umbrella of the International Development Association is one we can be proud of.  We have spoken with a very clear voice and, at all levels, have urged those stronger economies to contribute even more to the Third World.  To our credit we have ensured that our contribution is even more than it was three years ago &mdash; 0.12 per cent of GDP on this occasion.  Therefore, we have something to welcome warmly.  It is time to look at the ODA and I hope to see some progress on that issue very soon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill, I was quite relieved to see that the IDA are giving these loans interest free for a period of 35-40 years.  We can be proud of that.  We are not cashing in on the fact that people are poor, they have to get money and we should not make money out of them.  At this stage I want to pay tribute to my colleague because I had the privilege of being on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Third World Development which has <Col N="1624" /> been left in abeyance since this Government came in.  I regret that.  Deputy Nora Owen has played a leading role as chair-person on that committee, on which I served for four years, and she did a great deal to highlight the importance of giving aid to Third World countries.  I wonder why this Government did not renew that committee because they did a great deal of good work.</P>
    <P>I have a few quotations I wish to put on the record.  I quote a paragraph from <i>The World Summit for Children</i> a UNICEF contribution, that highlights what this is all about:</P>
    <P>A major renewal of effort, by both industrialised and developing countries, to protect the rising generation is therefore necessary not only as a response to one of the greatest humanitarian causes of our times but also as a means of making what is possibly the greatest investment the human race could now make in its future economic prosperity, political stability, and environmental integrity.</P>
    <P>Dealing as it does with children, UNICEF knows exactly what is going on, as do Comhlámh, an association of volunteers and workers who have given their time in the Third World to help those who cannot help themselves.  They represent some of the finest people this country has produced.  I know personally some who went out there, young married and unmarried people, and gave their time working in all kinds of places and in all kinds of poverty.  It is a pity that people with such expertise and who know exactly what is happening in the Third World are not brought together as a committee or an advisory group to tell the Minister and the Government the best way to invest our money.</P>
    <P>We have quite an amount of money invested in Third World aid.  We have the voluntary groups and Government funds but maybe we could get better value for our money if we used these people's expertise.  They have been on the frontline. They know the abuse that is going on.  The Minister should seriously consider callng in these people, officially or <Col N="1625" /> unofficially, and using their knowledge. Over 400 such workers have returned and they know what they are talking about. They have put facts together.  It is just as easy for me to read them from this leaflet from Comhlámh as it is to make up my own version.  They tell us that 40,000 children die unnecessarily every day from disease and malnutrition.  When you read this leaflet you begin to wonder whether they made a mistake.  It is shocking that any country that is doing even reasonably well should tolerate this and not do more to prevent it.  The Comhlámh leaflet tells us also that people in poor countries pay for cutbacks with their lives.</P>
    <P>Ireland's allocation to the world food programme has been cut by 99 per cent. Again I thought this was a mistake.  If you cut something by 99 per cent why not cut it 100 per cent?  It would be far easier than having somebody keeping statistics for 1 per cent.  This statistic does not make me very proud.  The answer may be that an extra contribution is given in some other way, but if we are to give a contribution to the world food programme, and we cut our existing contribution by 99 per cent, it is a cause for shame.</P>
    <P>The leaflet says that we Irish are top in the league for generosity to the poorest. However, we are at the bottom of the league for what counts internationally. This has been referred to by other speakers.</P>
    <P>In fairness, we have to accept that very few countries do as much as we do on a voluntary basis.  Whether that should be a reason for the Government not to spend its money is another question.  I accept the arguments that there are a lot of demands on us as a Government and people want more, but very few would object to helping those who are starving. All one has to do is look at some of the dreadful pictures one sees on television of children dying with flies crawling all over them, unable even to remove a fly from their faces.  It is very sad.</P>
    <P>This leaflet says that Ireland is the 23rd richest of 185 countries; we give the equivalent of 2.5p per person daily in official aid and spend 16 times as much <Col N="1626" /> on tobacco products.  If we give 2.5p per person daily in official aid, I suppose there surely is room for improvement. The Minister heard his colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, explain how well the economy is doing at the moment, and I am sure that in the budget the Minister will be able to improve on our contribution.</P>
    <P>We can all argue about how much should be given, but it is such a serious problem that there is very little excuse for not increasing this aid.  To back up what I am saying, Dr. Whitaker, who does not need any introduction from me, said in a news release when Trócaire Development Review, 1990, was being published: &ldquo;As our own economic financial position improves we should feel in honour bound to contribute steadily more to Third World development and not think only of ourselves&rdquo;.  If Dr. Whitaker said that, he was a man who said it on the road to survival, and we cannot improve on it.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we are dealing with an important factor life.  Any money we can give, if it is well spent, will improve the lot of so many people and will probably save the lives of thousands of people.  I want to make one reference to organisations like Gorta that use their money to grow crops.  We should help in every way possible to get value for money by seeing that people are trained.  Giving money for food is one thing, but sometimes our money is wasted because cow-boys or guerillas confiscate the food.</P>
    <P>As far as training is concerned we should do everything possible to help.  I would appeal to the Minister to use the vast amount of experience of over 400 people who have served abroad.  He should bring them together to advise even on the spending of the money we are giving at the moment so we can feel we are getting value for money.  It is an important cause, and tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are making this allocation which will be the source of interest free loans.  The Irish people, certainly in the recent past, <Col N="1627" /> have indicated total support for the general concept of helping Third World countries as much as we possibly can.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that we have to do it within the financial constraints that are on us at the moment.  The simple fact is that we still owe £25.5 million or thereabouts and some of the people who are now saying we should give more were, in 1987, describing our own economy as similar to a Third World economy.  That is the background we are working against.  I would agree with Deputy Tom Kitt that the improved situation we have seen since 1987 should be reflected in our own contribution, and hopefully we will see a great contribution to the official development assistance.  We can put money in under a number of headings and we should do all that we possibly can.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt raised another important issue that we should not lose sight of, that is, how we can influence European Community thinking on the Third World. Our sphere of influence has to go way beyond the direct financial contribution we can make.  The Minister mentioned the important matter of imposing regulations on programmes imposed on Third World countries by outside agencies.  We only have to look at our own situation to see how very often restraints or regulations imposed by the European Community have been found to be detrimental to our own situation.  We could fall into the trap of imposing our views on many of these countries and we should be careful there.  We could, however, greatly influence the European Community.  That is one area where I would like to see us pushing, and we have a general consensus of support from the public for taking that approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brown mentioned Comhlámh and the work they have done.  We must separate the voluntary from the professional. When people want to sneer at Governments or Ministers they reflect on the voluntary input compared to Government input and how things are left to the voluntary workers, as though that was a second class area.  I do not agree.  He simply could not achieve what we are <Col N="1628" /> achieving under many headings and much of the work being done in our own country could not be done without voluntary agencies.  The same applies in Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Comhlámh is a most welcome movement because many of us who would not be familiar with the internal workings of Third World countries can meet people coming back from Third World countries through these organisations.  They are in a position to point out the economic benefits of Ireland's participation in and contribution to assisting Third World countries.  In 1988 we had about 650 Irish personnel working on projects officially associated with APSO and DFA.  The purchase of Irish goods and services associated with those projects in that year was £6.5 million.  We have gained to the tune of £25 million in the past few years from EC funded projects; in World Bank projects we have gained another £8 million; we have also gained from United Nations projects and so on down the line. There is a financial return to the country on the employment side as well as on the sales and services side.  We should bear this in mind when the budget is being formulated.</P>
    <P>There are also indirect benefits.  People who went out there as teachers or nurses came back with extraordinary experience. They also helped to establish Ireland's track record and set up contacts in these emerging countries.  There is a lot of goodwill for us nationally directly arising from the involvement of these people.  Unfortunately at home we tend to sneer at the Irish voluntary workers. We see them on a higher plain, but we should not look at it that way.  There is a tremendous return from their involvement.</P>
    <P>There are selfish reasons we should help the people of the Third World.  The environmental reason has been mentioned by the Minister but there are other reasons.  Outside of the humanitarian approach there are practical reasons we should help these people.  We have a fair national consensus but we had a little bit of argument earlier about the type of <Col N="1629" /> Government, whether socialist or whatever. This is not the arena for this kind of discussion.</P>
    <P>We should put our heads together to see what assistance we can give under all headings.  The imposition of a particular ideology on these countries is the last thing they need from us.  We certainly should not lecture the people involved. By and large they will have to solve their own problems.  They are getting direct education from people going out to those countries, from Comhlamh and other organisations but what we have before us today is a practical expression of the assistance that is needed.  I take the point that there is a danger, as has happened in the past, of money being squandered. That is something that must be monitored. We should give whatever help we can in that regard also.  By and large the provision of interest free loans and direct payment grants is essential and must continue.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is totally receptive to the push that is being made, particularly from Fianna Fáil in this regard. Like Deputy Tom Kitt, I urge that the greatest assistance be given under each of the programmes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne and I have discussed the national debt on a number of occasions here.  I think we have managed to at least put the brakes on that debt and I would like to see that improvement reflected positively in our assistance to the Third World.  Many people give out about the black babies' box.  In the old days people were probably less knowledgeable about what needed to be done in this area but even then the Irish people contributed to the Third World, and I think they will continue to do so.  We should work on that avenue and also use our position within the European Community to ensure that the programmes are right and that the conditions on financing will not be in conflict with local requirements just because some bureaucrat decides that something must be done in a certain way.  I welcome any discussion in the House on this issue. Increasingly we are being made aware of what is happening in other countries by <Col N="1630" /> direct contact with returning workers and others, and we are heading in the right direction.  I welcome the issue before us and give it my full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start my brief contribution to this debate by putting on the record the following quotation:</P>
      <P>I was hungry</P>
      <P>... and you told me to wait.</P>
      <P>... and you blamed it on the weather.</P>
      <P>... and you said: &ldquo;So were my ancestors&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>... and you circled the moon.</P>
      <P>... and you said: &ldquo;The poor are always with us&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>... and you set up a commission.</P>
      <P>... and you said: &ldquo;God helps those ...&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>...and you blamed it on my family.</P>
      <P>...and you destroyed your surplus food.</P>
      <P>...and you squandered your money on weapons.</P>
      <P>But, friend, when did you ever go hungry?</P>
      <P>That quotation summarises a great deal that has been graphically described by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Could I trouble the Deputy to give the source of his quotation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>To be perfectly truthful I do not know where it originally came from but it is reproduced in a magazine called <i>Ireland, Europe and the Third World.</i>  It summarises in a graphic way a great deal of the content of the speeches made by a number of people who have contributed to this debate.  I welcome the measure before us but it is inadequate.  It must be one of the great paradoxes of modern society that despite the massive range of aid programmes from the modern industrialised countries to the developing world, it is the former who continue to expand their economies while the latter continue to sink further into economic crisis.  Why should this be, <Col N="1631" /> given the highly detailed Lomé Convention, various bilateral aid agreements and other aid packages which have been developed in the period since the last world war?  The answer can probably best be found in the phrase that there is no such thing as a free lunch.</P>
      <P>If we take Ireland, for instance, an examination of the 1987 spending on aid by our Government shows that the allocation for bilateral assistance was just about £14.5 million.  Yet in the same year Irish semi-State companies earned consultancy and technical assistance contracts from Third World countries worth a total of £86 million, a tidy profit of about £70 million, and that excludes figures for the private sector.</P>
      <P>Have things improved since?  Not on your life.  By 1989 our aid allocation was slashed to a mere £9 million and the cutbacks were implemented in an arbitrary manner without even the courtesy of informing partner Governments in many cases.  I have no doubt that this is mirrored in most, if not all, the EC and developed countries.  Given these huge imbalances, it is not surprising that Third World economies are unable to break out of the strait jacket of under development. Indeed, it throws a new perspective on the term &ldquo;aid&rdquo;.  As applied by many Governments it is something closer to a necessary investment which opens the door for trade and other contacts with the recipient countries.  Yet there is every indication that people in Ireland and other developed countries recognise the need for greater financial assistance to the Third World.  Deputy Browne and others have dealt with the voluntary response on many occasions from the Irish people, the most enduring example probably being Bob Geldof's Live Aid project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here in Ireland, for example, following large-scale flooding in Sudan and Bangladesh in 1988 public outcry forced the Government to triple their admittedly small contributions to disaster relief in both countries.  There is a continuous high level of support among the public for the work of development agencies <Col N="1632" /> such as Trócaire, Concern, GOAL and Oxfam.  Similarly the contribution of returned aid workers through Comhlámh, which has already been referred to, illustrates the depth of commitment to genuine aid for the people in developing countries.</P>
    <P>In May of this year a very interesting survey of attitudes of Irish people to the Third World was published by the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation. It showed that 89 per cent favour helping Third World countries while the same percentage said they personally had contributed to the Third World in the past two years.  More interestingly, perhaps, 91 per cent feel that Ireland has a responsibility to help the poor in Third World countries while only 6 per cent say we have no responsibility whatever. These figures confirm the strong public support for a real increase in our commitment to developing countries, and the Government have a duty to respond.</P>
    <P>Speakers from the Government benches, while I do not question the sincerity of the views they have articulated, ought to bear that survey of attitudes of Irish people in mind when seeking to defend the policy of Government in recent years in reducing our contribution to overseas development aid.  Notwithstanding all the pressing needs that have been outlined from Government benches, there is still a wish on the part of the Irish people that we make a decent, humane contribution to the Third World. In this respect I would refer to the organisation, Campaign Aid.  This is an organisation which have been campaigning for an increase in overseas development assistance.  Their stated aim is to have the ODA restored to its 1986 level of 0.25 per cent of GNP for the rest of the decade, 0.25 per cent of GNP in the 1991 Estimates and to have it increased by 0.05 per cent per annum after that for the rest of the decade.  This would ensure that Ireland would keep its promise to achieve the UN aid target of 0.7 per cent of GNP which was set in 1970.</P>
    <P>Campaign Aid have initiated this year a petition and campaign to achieve that target and now have something like <Col N="1633" /> 21,000 signatures for submission to the Taoiseach.  The organisation wanted to make a submission directly to the Taoiseach and sought to meet him to consider the implications of the petition in the context of the 1991 Estimates of public spending.  They wrote to the Taoiseach on a couple of occasions, most recently I think in September, when they asked, as an organisation, to meet him directly. According to Campaign Aid the Taoiseach replied turning down their request to meet him.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach must carry out a great many functions and responsibilities, but there must be some sense of priority and, if he could not meet Campaign Aid, the appropriate Minister should have been delegated to meet them to hear their arguments which mirror the arguments which have been made in the House today and which reflect the views of the Irish people in a survey of attitudes to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Some move along those lines by the Government is now vital if we are to make any dent in the appalling poverty and suffering which breaks through on our television screens with every latest emergency or fire brigade measure in the Third World.  Perhaps the greatest challenge, as we approach the 21st century, is to devise and campaign for a new international economic order which will conform with the principle of &ldquo;to each according to his needs and from each according to his means&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The survey to which I referred shows that Irish people see no conflict of interest in principle between the welfare of our own people and those in developing countries.  Indeed, there is a strong argument that the unrelenting struggle for social justice in Ireland is identical to that in the world as a whole.  Unlike Deputy Dennehy, I do not want to go down the road of querying whether this debate should be about what kind of Government we should seek to foist on these countries, whether we should seek to impose an ideology on them and all the rest.  It is not, of course, a matter for us to foist any system of Government on the <Col N="1634" /> developing world.  However, it is important not to permit the debate to close by accepting the pretence that an ideology has not effectively already been imposed on them because, just as these people suffered from colonialist policies from their imperialist past, the developing countries continue to be victims of an exploitative and international monetary and trade system.  Until that basic cause of their exploitation is tackled it is unlikely that they will become self-sufficient which should be our objective at the end of this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, is iontach an rud é go bhfuil seans agam labhairt sa díospóireacht seo agus tagairt a dhéanamh do nithe áirithe a bhaineann leis an cheist ghinearálta maidir le forbairt an Tríú Domhain.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate and to make a number of general comments on the whole area of overseas assistance.  A number of fundamental points must be made apart from the mere question of allocating relief in the form of cash, loans or funds.  Without doubt, poverty in the Third World is the greatest scandal in the world and it is a severe indictment on the western world in many respects, particularly on the major powers, that the scandal has been allowed to continue.  There appears to be a lack of urgency and cohesion between the major powers &mdash; especially the wealthy and politically strong powers &mdash; to seriously tackle the problems of Third World poverty. The problem can only be tackled by a significant and fundamental change in the world political order because one is led to believe &mdash; and inclined to think &mdash; that any major development in the developing countries is feared by many of the Super Powers.  They seem to be unwilling or reluctant to see the emergence in the Third World of stable developed economies because they might, in the fullness of time, threaten the pre-eminent position of western political democracies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last few years we have witnessed revolutionary and tremendous changes in Eastern Europe, and indeed in South <Col N="1635" /> Africa, which we all welcome.  There is almost a palpable sense of living in a period where tremendous and fundamental changes have taken place. However, even though the shackles of the repressive and dictatorial states in Eastern Europe imposed a severe burden on the people of these countries, one could argue that the sufferings they endured during their period in relative captivity pales into insignificance compared to the ongoing suffering and poverty which the people of the Third World suffered for many years and &mdash; it seems &mdash; will continue to suffer for quite a number of decades to come.</P>
    <P>The tremendous welcome for the changes in Eastern Europe surely imposes a greater responsibility on the West to move much more urgently to improve the lot of Third World countries. Indeed, as I said, the winds of change have not just been confined to Eastern Europe, apartheid is breaking down in South Africa, something we did not believe could happen so soon is taking place before our eyes.  It is a pity that we do not attempt to extend that fundamental change to the Third World.  It needs much more than the mere allocation of finance; it also needs a radical altering of the world's political balance.</P>
    <P>We should be in the vanguard in assisting Third World countries to develop a political system which can respond to their needs and which will help them to develop.  I am not talking about imposing a political ideology or anything like that, I am merely saying that we should, through the United Nations or some other organisation, help to create conditions where democratic political systems are put in place.  This would enable them to use the resources allocated to them in a much better way and would also allow them to develop.  In many ways, it is dependent on the people themselves to develop self-confidence and to order their own affairs. It is only when we can instil an element of self-confidence and self-belief in the people of the Third World that we will see major developments taking place.</P>
    <P>We could play a major part through <Col N="1636" /> international relief aid organisations, particularly the UN, to ensure that every possible effort is made to develop democracies in those countries and improve political systems there.  There is concern that a lot of aid does not go where it is urgently needed, that it is diverted.  That is not an excuse for not sending aid, but there is a general concern that aid is being diverted, basically because of the political set-ups in those countries.</P>
    <P>It is important that we play a moral role and contribute as much as we can to overseas development aid.  I am concerned with the level of aid we are currently allocating and I urge the Minister, in the context of the 1991 budget, to incrase the level of aid to the Third World, and try to move towards a position where we can fulfil our obligations under the UN.  Admittedly, the domestic economic situation in the last few years was in crisis, but we all agree now that we have more room for manoeuvre in the economic sense to address the level of aid Ireland is allocating to Third World countries.  Such a policy would meet with general political consensus and an overwhelming consensus among the people as demonstrated by their wonderful contributions to many voluntary relief agencies, to disaster funds, famine relief funds and so on.  The Irish people have never been found wanting in that respect. That should meet with a political response and I have no doubt that it will in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I endorse the Minister's comment that we must develop a strong working partnership between ourselves and Third World countries.  It is very important to have a &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; relationship with the countries concerned.  Any grant assistance or loans advanced should be project-led and project-driven.  We should have strategic objectives in mind.  That is happening in many projects administered by concern and other bodies.  Tremendous progress has been made in certain areas with project-led aid although at times the volunteers will say that it is like chipping <Col N="1637" /> away at an iceberg.  We must have a progressive and strategic approach to this issue.</P>
    <P>We should try to maintain the level of co-ordination that exists among voluntary relief agencies.  At times people have expressed concern about the multiplicity of organisations.  Each agency has its own aims and objectives and one wonders if we would get better value for money with a more concerted and cohesive effort.  That is a matter the Government and the relief agencies could discuss and work on.</P>
    <P>It is important that semi-State bodies and companies become more actively involved in giving of their expertise to Third World developing countries.  In some respects they have done this but it should be done in a more vigorous way. We have a lot to offer as has been demonstrated in the past by companies like the ESB.  Bord na Móna, for instance, could be of considerable use as could An Bord Telecom and various State agencies.  We were of great use to our neighbours across the water some years ago when they had a major problem related to electricity.  Our expertise was at a level to assist them.  In time this will rebound to our benefit.  It would help to develop relationships.  In helping countries to develop we would get a feedback on the use of services and personnel as the countries developed into stronger economies.  There would be a self-interest motive involved here as well as an altruistic motive.</P>
    <P>In many respects there is cross-party support for the general principles invovled in this debate.  We should not become involved in attacking each other for the sake of party political gain.  We should endeavour to achieve as much consensus as we can on this issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's reference to the environment and the impact of economic progress in the Third World on the environment.  I am glad the IDA made great strides in building and environmental consciousness into all of their activities and that there are now new environment assessment procedures in place for projects assisted by the IDA. <Col N="1638" /> There was a fear that there was a degree of environmental exploitation in the Third World by some multi-nationals who because of difficulties in siting particularly sensitive plants in the west, because of the vigorous controls in existence, tended to move some of their operations to Third World countries.  There was a fear that the strictest environmental standards were not applied.  It is important to tie in an environmental dimension to any development assistance offered by the governments of the west and ensure that the most rigorous standards are applied.</P>
    <P>The problem is more than just the allocation of aid.  It is very important that we concentrate on endeavouring to create a climate in which political systems emerge which will chart the development of these countries for the future.  That is something to which world powers should give greater attention.  The greatest scandal in the world today is highlighted when we consider the tremendous efforts being made in Europe to help and integrate Eastern Europe and the tremendous efforts being made in the Middle East and in South Africa.  One must question whether the same level of urgency is being applied to Third World countries. I suggest that it is not.  It is up to the major powers in the West to move on that issue.  It would represent a glorious end to this century if we could by the end of this decade say that we have made serious and dramatic progress, as dramatic as has been made in Eastern Europe, on the question of Third World aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate on this important Bill.  I am particularly happy that my colleague Deputy Owen is present while I make this contribution because of her long term commitment to mobilising opinion here, and throughout the European Community, in favour of increasing overseas development aid. Fine Gael welcome the Bill in so far as it goes.  It is very clear that we as a society have failed dismally to live up to our responsibility to the Third World.  It <Col N="1639" /> would not be exaggerating to say that, given the trend of the financial allocations for bilateral aid since Fianna Fáil returned to power in 1987, it appears to be the Government's intention to entirely phase out bilateral aid.  As the House is aware, this year's provision is £9.5 million while the figure for the last year in which Fine Gael were in office was over £14 million.  If we adjust the figures, taking into account inflation we will see the gap is much greater than the £5 million implied by those figures.</P>
      <P>During the term of office of the 1982-87 Coalition Government led by Deputy Garret FitzGerald, notwithstanding the horrendous financial and economic difficulties that Government had to wrestle with, overseas development aid was increased.  I recall very well Deputy FitzGerald insisting that no matter what else had to be cut, overseas development aid would not be cut.  I submit that there is an absolute and urgent duty on us as one of the 25 wealthiest countries in the world to stop the slide in the value of the provision for overseas development aid in the Estimates.  Indeed, I would go further and submit that we should set a deadline, even if it is ten or 15 years from now, by which time we will attain the figure of 0.7 per cent of GNP which we are committed to attaining by virtue of our vote at the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no votes in overseas development aid but this did not stop Deputy Garret FitzGerald from defending it with all the power at his command when he was Taoiseach.  The reason overseas development aid has been reduced during the tenure of office of the Government led by Deputy Haughey is because there are no votes in it.  I say shame on the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, and shame on his Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance.  This country more than any other European country has a right to be concerned about the Third World given on the one hand our great missionary tradition and our history of famine on the other.  Even though there are no votes in it because no one in <Col N="1640" /> this country will benefit from an increase in the provision for overseas development aid, we would receive considerable public support if we committed ourselves to attaining the figure of 0.7 per cent by a given date and made provision for precise increases so that we would get there by the fixed date and would not be diverted because of election pressure to provide some funds for some give-away at home or because of some temporary economic hiccup.</P>
    <P>We often hear on television and radio and read in our newspapers that we are a poor country.  We are not a poor country. Indeed, we are one of the 25 richest countries in the world and anyone who has had the opportunity to travel outside the continent of Europe and North America will know of the horrendous poverty being experienced in so many parts of the world.  Indeed, even within the continent of Europe, especially in the eastern part, very considerable poverty is being experienced.  Earlier this year I had the opportunity to visit Turkey which is a developing country and certainly is an awful lot better off than some of the other countries in the world I have visited.  It is only when one visits countries such as Turkey, becomes aware of their <i>per capita</i> income and choice of retail goods and notes the lack of health, welfare and education provisions that one realises just how wealthy we are as a people.</P>
    <P>When Minister, I had the opportunity to visit India where I witnessed at first hand in Calcutta the gyrating poverty being experienced where the best of people live in sewer pipes and where the worst off have to fight for a little space on the pavement if there is one.  There is no doubt but that anyone who has witnessed that will come back to Europe to insist that not only should their own country meet their obligations in relation to overseas development aid but that the entire European Community should have this as one of its major or top priorities.</P>
    <P>We should take the lead within the European Community in this respect given not only the Irish missionary empire which still exists around the world <Col N="1641" /> and which has given us a great understanding and great contacts in so many parts of the Third World &mdash; regrettably, this is now beginning to vanish because of the lack of vocations &mdash; but also that in the last century the people of this island experienced the poverty and hunger which so many people in many parts of the world are experiencing this century. One would have thought during our Presidency of the European Community that one of our top priorities would have been an escalation in the provision for overseas development aid but far from it. The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, along with Deputies Collins and Reynolds reduced the provision domestically at a time when they should have been pressing the Council and the Commission to attach greater priority and give a greater commitment in the future to increasing overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>What puzzles the citizens of the European Community most is that at a time when they hear about milk and wine lakes as well as beef and other food mountains they hear reports on television almost daily about hunger and poverty.  I accept that there is no simple answer but I submit this question is not being adequately addressed in any of the Twelve European Community countries or in the EC itself.</P>
    <P>We must find a way of diverting our surpluses to alleviate or eliminate hunger wherever it exists.  We must find a way to ensure that the developing world is given sufficient resources by the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; to enable them develop their economies and their countries, and at least to provide the basic services for their people and their children.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about enormous sums of money.  The £5 million reduction in the bilateral aid provision, since Fianna Fáil returned to power, is only a drop in the ocean in our annual budget.  If we had increased the amount by £5 million in the last three years there would be £10 million more to give this year than we are giving.  While £10 million is only two drops in the ocean out of our Estimates it could do an enormous amount in the developed world where many items are <Col N="1642" /> much cheaper.  It may help to save tens of thousands of lives.  What defence have the Government for their miserly attitude to bilateral aid?  How can they defend the indefensible?  How can they justify reduced expenditure on bilateral aid when we are spending £13 million on improvements in Government buildings which many of us think are unnecessary? Should we not all be thoroughly ashamed?</P>

      <P>The fact is there are <Col N="1643" /> no votes in the Third World.  That is the shame of Fianna Fáil's record in office. It can be truly said that the record of the Government has been shameful.  I mentioned already that notwithstanding the enormous financial and economic difficulties with which the FitzGerald Government had to grapple, the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, insisted that there would be no cuts in bilateral aid.  The record speaks for itself. That Government laid the foundations for economic growth by bringing about low inflation and turning an enormous trade deficit into a trade surplus and by turning around all the State companies from loss making to profit making in five years.  As a result there has been economic growth.  I would be the last to pretend that the Government have had nothing to do with that.  They have built on the foundations laid by the FitzGerald Government.  Far from the overseas development aid sharing in the economic growth in the last three or four years it has been cut back.  Niggardly sums have been provided because there are no votes for Fianna Fáil in Ethiopia, Somalia, Senegal, Lesotho or in Calcutta.  If those criteria are applied adequate overseas development aid will never be provided.</P>
      <P>I do not mind being very critical of the performance of the Government in this respect.  It is no exaggeration to say that they are in the business of phasing out bilateral aid almost completely.  That was indicated by the trajectory and trends of the provisions of bilateral aid during the past three years.  I will finish my contribution with a strong appeal to the Government to reverse the trend, make up for what they cut back in the last five years and dedicate themselves to growth in the bilateral aid provisions next year and the years ahead.  I propose specifically that we set a deadline by which we will reach the 0.7 per cent of GDP provision, to which we committed ourselves many years ago at the United Nations, but which has never been taken seriously by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael proposals to expand the <Col N="1644" /> Presidency suggested that by law overseas development aid should be assigned to a commission of which the President of Ireland would be the chairperson and first commissioner.  That would take the issue out of the party political arena.  It could only happen if there was prior agreement to an ear-marked sum for overseas development aid because, of course, the President could not be involved in controversy with the Government about the provision of overseas development aid.  Controversy would be avoided if the Dáil and Seanad agreed in advance to my proposal to ear-mark a sum which, by say year 15, would reach the 0.7 per cent of GDP recommended by the United Nations.  I ask the Government to seriously consider these proposals. If we do not put ourselves into some form of straitjacket in this respect the babies of Calcutta, Lesotho and Somalia will continue to die.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on a very important subject, that of international development or overseas development aid.  They are both intrinsically linked because they have similar objectives.  It would be a pity if we had to decide that this development association, and its funding, should be categorised as areas of national development or works that need to be done nationally.  As Deputy Mitchell said this area is very difficult to compete with when it comes to prioritising Government expenditure.  We all feel that this is an issue about which the Government, and previous Governments, would have a consciousness.  In other words, we need to be aware of the needs of others who are less well off than ourselves.  Occasionally it is perceived that we are not a very wealthy country but in comparable terms Ireland is relatively wealthy for its population, size and economic development. Generally speaking it has always been perceived that Ireland has an awareness and consciousness about the needs of others who are less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous Governments have given commitments in this area.  Although this <Col N="1645" /> Government have reduced our contribution somewhat I believe all of us, whether in Government or in Opposition realise that it is an area we should not neglect.  We should continue to analyse the needs of the peoples of the Third World and continue to play the international role we, as a small country, have always played in this area.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, Ireland's contribution to the Third World can be measured in two ways: first, our monetary contribution and, second, our human resource contribution.  Our monetary contribution can be measured by the Government's contribution in this Bill to overseas development aid and the contributions by voluntary agencies, for example, Trócaire, which has been spearheaded by Bishop Casey, and GOAL which has been spearheaded by John O'Shea and the Third World Endeavour which was founded by Archbishop Dermot Clifford of Cashel and Emly. the Third World Endeavour is an unusual link between the existing FÁS schemes run by the Department of Labour and those generous people who give disused equipment to a central location.  When this equipment and machinery is repaired it makes a major contribution to the Third World Endeavour. This is an interesting scheme because it has managed to take people off the dole queues and give them work in centres throughout County Tipperary repairing bicycles, washing machines, etc.  When this equipment is repaired it is shipped, with no capital expenditure, to Third World countries where it is used by the missionaries and people who care for underprivileged people.  This brainchild of Archbishop Clifford recently came to fruition in Rockwell College where media attention was given to the delivery and repair of this equipment.</P>
    <P>This is an indication that it is not always necessary to judge how we in Ireland perform <i>vis-á-vis</i> the less well off countries in money terms.  Money is important but it is not everything.  Any reduction in the contribution made by the Government will have repercussions in the assistance which can be given to Third World <Col N="1646" /> countries.  This country has made a huge contribution to the Third World in human terms through the work that has been carried out by our missionaries and voluntary workers.  The contribution made by these people cannot be valued in money terms.  Ireland's record in this area is as good if not better than most countries. The media coverage which has been given to the famine in Ethiopia and other areas and the pictures of starving childrent crying for the want of food has triggered an awarenes in all our minds that these people need assistance from this country and other wealthy nations. Some wealthy nations do not give as much, proportionately, to these countries as we do.  I believe the Government welcome the work carried out by charitable organisations who collect money for Third World countries.  No Government could fill the void in this area on their own.</P>
    <P>We tend to forget those areas which do not receive media coverage.  I want to bring to the attention of the Minister &mdash; I brought it to the attention of his predecessor and Deputy Peter Barry when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; the contribution of UNRWA, the United National Relief and Work Agency, which was specifically set up under a UN Charter to assist the Palestinian people.  Those of us who have had consultations with UNRWA know that unless there is a considerable increase in the contributions made by governments who have an interest in the rights of the Palestinian people they will be faced with serious difficulties.  They need capital to provide health care so that they can cater for those people who have been maimed and injured in serious incidents following Intifada.  This has led to widespread demands on existing services which are stretched to the limit.</P>
    <P>We cannot stand aside and ignore those people who do not have a homeland and who need the assistance of United Nations organisations such as UNRWA to help them survive.  UNRWA also make a major contribution to their educational services and the distribution of food.  UNRWA will not be able to survive <Col N="1647" /> on the present contributions they receive. An urgent request has been made to all the member states who have addressed this problem, the Council of Ministers and the Commission for extra funds for UNRWA so that they can treat, educate and distribute food to these people.  I want to make a special plea to the Government to consider significantly increasing this year's contribution to UNRWA to help them cope with the extreme problems which have arisen in the Palestine occupied territories over the past three to four months.  A request for extra funds has been made by the United Nations people who are working on the ground in the most extraordinary circumstances, in deserts and refugee camps where toilet facilities and food are needed.  As I have said UNRWA are a recognised United Nations organisation. I hope the Minister will give this matter urgent attention so that we can report back to the people working in these areas. There are many Irish nurses and missionaries working in that part of the world.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I hope the Government understand that there will always be a need for more money in this area.  I believe that in future organisations such as GOAL and Trócaire will play their role with the Government in ensuring that Ireland will not be found wanting in our contribution to the Third World.</P>

We pursue the development of self-governing, self-reliant and yet interdependent world economies.  The humanitarian ideal &ldquo;give and you shall receive&rdquo; has seldom been termed unfair or unjust, although it has often been ignored.  We challenge that ignorance today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In May 1987, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce decided to reopen export credit insurance cover for exports to Iraq within a specified limit.  Cover with one exception had been suspended since May 1986.  The decision to reopen cover was taken because of what was perceived at the time as the potential of the Iraqi market for several Irish companies from whom <Col N="1649" /> applications for cover were on hands. Representations were made by and on behalf of some of the applicant companies.</P>
      <P>The considerations and circumstances leading to the decision in October 1989 to void certain export credit insurance policies in respect of beef exports to Iraq were spelled out in my statement of 18 October 1989 which I read into the record of the House when replying to questions on 1 November 1989.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but unfortunately he has not covered all aspects of the question in relation to the manner in which the cover was reintroduced.  I accept that he was not Minister at the time but there must be files in his Department to give us the information required.  Were any contacts made between members of the Goodman Group and any Minister or Ministers of the day in 1987?  While the Minister said representations were made from a number of companies, he must be aware that all the cover granted was given to one company.  Why was the figure of £120 million agreed in relation to the level of cover given?  Were there any indications from the Department's files regarding discussions as to where this meat would be sourced?  Were questions asked as to whether the amount of beef spoken about would be available solely in Ireland?  My understanding is that it was not all available in Ireland and that this was made clear to the Minister of the day.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's statement that all the cover made available in 1987 went to one company is not correct. There were, to the best of my recollection, five or six companies, but the great bulk of the cover certainly went to one company.  I think there were five others in all.  Representations are frequently made to Ministers and Departments. The files in my Department which I have looked at show that written representations were made by one Minister at the time to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but those representations were on behalf of a pharmaceutical company in the Minister's own constituency and the amount of cover concerned was very small in comparison with what we are dealing with here.</P>
      <P>Regarding the statement attributed to the examiner, I am not aware of the grounds on which the examiner made the statement.  I will, of course, be contesting vigorously these proceedings against the State and it would not be opportune for me or the Deputy to pursue that aspect any further in this House.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Industry and Commerce</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any plans to assist industry with sales of and promotion of goods in Japan; his views on whether only limited success has been achieved under the GATT in having Japanese markets opened up to EC trade and that Japan's current trade policy is still complex and difficult to penetrate for Irish and EC goods; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The promotion of the sale of Irish goods and services in the Japanese market is primarily a matter for Córas Tráchtála Teoranta who have been very active in assisting Irish companies with their sales efforts in Japan.  Córas Tráchtála Teoranta have an office in Tokyo since 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Japan is a priority market for Córas Tráchtála Teoranta and they are continuing to commit significant resources <Col N="1651" /> to further develop penetration of that market by Irish companies.  This year, for example, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta initiated 16 separate activities on behalf of Irish exporting companies.  these activities included a ministerial trade mission for 20 companies in October, a Japanese inward buyer mission to Ireland and separate sectoral missions to Japan in such areas as automotive components, fashion goods, services and packaging technology.</P>
    <P>The success of such activities is borne out by the performance of Irish exports to Japan.  Irish exports to Japan rose from £238 million in 1988 to £317 million last year, a rise of 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition, I and officials of my Department meet regularly with our counterparts from MITI, the Japanese Ministry for International Trade and Industry, for discussions on many issues including bilateral trade matters.  These discussions further the interests of Irish exporters in Japan.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Japanese Goverenment announced a major import expansion programme at an estimated cost of US $3 billion with the objective of reducing Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world.  The main elements of the programme are: tax incentives for importers; elimination of tariffs on over 1,000 items; budget allocations to promote imports; soft loans for importers; and inclusion of 1,500 Irish companies on a Japanese-based import databank.</P>
    <P>In order to maximise the benefits of this programme, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta have entered into an agreement with JETRO, the Japan External Trade Organisation, to ensure that the full potential of Ireland as a supplier of quality goods and services is brought to the attention of the Japanese business community.</P>
    <P>As regards EC and GATT efforts to open the Japanese market, I can tell the Deputy that in April 1988 the EC Council of Ministers agreed a range of measures aimed at freeing access to that market, by identifying and seeking the removal of barriers affecting individual sectors such <Col N="1652" /> as liquor, pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles, cosmetics, medical equipment, intellectual property and agriculture.</P>
    <P>These measures are perceived as having been successful in tackling particular sectoral barriers.  For example, the Community resorted to the GATT dispute settlement procedure in the case of the discriminatory taxation system operated by Japan on imported spirits.  This was found to be damaging Community exports.  The Japanese government have subsequently begun to amend their taxation system and this is resulting in an increase in Community exports of spirits to Japan.</P>
    <P>In addition to these bilateral efforts, the present round of GATT talks will provide another opportunity to improve access to the Japanese market since Japan will be expected to participate fully in any market opening measures agreed at the conclusion of the round.</P>
    <P>The Japanese market is very competitive and difficult to penetrate.  The Japanese consumer is very highly selective and demands very high quality products and service.  However, it is important to bear in mind that freeing up of access to the Japanese market benefits all exporting countries worldwide and consequently we must continue to fight for our share of any expansion of imports into that market.  It should be noted that the biggest increase in manufactured exports to Japan since 1985 has come not from the US or the EC but from Taiwan, Thailand and South Korea.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the difficulties which have arisen with the workings of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, since the appointment of the examiner to the Goodman Group, he has any proposals to amend this legislation in order to make it more effective; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, had its origins in Part IX of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  When this Bill was being considered by the Special Committee of this House, a number of matters were raised which I undertook to reflect on before Report Stage.  Time did not permit me to complete my consideration of these matters before the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990 was moved.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I expect to be bringing forward some amendments to the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, at Report Stage of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, not only in relation to the points raised at Special Committee, but also in regard to other matters that have come to my attention in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>How does one ask supplementaries on a reply like that when one does not know what amendments the Minister proposes tabling?  In relation to the operation of the Act since it came into being, would the Minister agree that it is quite clear that a number of factors have arisen, in particular in relation to the availability of finance to the examiner and the control of the company by the existing directors when the examiner had been appointed and that it is obvious that it will be much more difficult in the future for Irish businesses to obtain loans abroad at competitive interest rates because of the provisions of parts of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990?. Would the Minister agree with the points I have made and assure me that, when we come to deal with the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, these matters will be tackled because, as matters stand at present, the obvious costs involved for any business in the appointment of an examiner&mdash; bearing in mind that we will have to revert <Col N="1654" /> to the courts so often &mdash; must bear heavily on the funds available for distribution among creditors after those costs have been met and excluded?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the scheme of arrangements that can be put in place with a bare majority of one class of creditors is seen to be totally unfair, and, as I would see it, unconstitutional compared with what happens in other countries and will have serious effects on Irish businesses in the future if amendments to the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, are not brought in as quickly as possible?</P>

One, it is wrong for the Deputy, or the public at large, to form judgments in regard to the Act passed here in August by virtue of the experience of the first examinership which took place under its provisions because that is unusually large and complex, in that there were 61 companies taken into examinership altogether, that is most, but not all, of the group in question. The examiner in that case has faced a monumental task.  Since August there have been three other examinerships of the kind we would have envisaged as the norm.  I understand that they are proceeding very smoothly and without difficulty. They are relatively small companies and relatively uncomplicated. I believe the Act is working very well in regard to them.  We will bring forward amendments based on experience.  But experience in regard to the main examinership that has arisen since August is not experience that will be valid into the <Col N="1655" /> future because I hope we will never again be faced with such a large and unusually complicated procedure as that.</P>
    <P>The other point the Deputy made to which I want to reply now is his suggestion that that Act has made it more difficult for Irish companies to borrow money.  I categorically want to say that we have no evidence of that.  International banks, with whom Irish companies are dealing, have made it clear to us that our legislation is not dissimilar from that in the United States or Britain in these matters but is preferable, from a banking point of view, because it is not as open-ended as that prevailing in the two countries I mentioned.  There are great advantages, even in as large and complex a case as the one we have seen, in having a time limit.  That has focused people's attention on the fact that it is necessary to have that examinership completed in the month of December and decisions have had to be faced up to that might otherwise have been postponed.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the many serious questions which remain unanswered about the circumstances of and leading to the financial difficulties of the Goodman Group, he will use the powers available to him to establish a tribunal of inquiry into the affair; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, provides a framework within which companies experiencing difficulties, but which are <Col N="1656" /> considered viable in the longer term, can be put under the protection of the court. The examiner appointed to 61 of the companies in the Goodman Group has now furnished his initial report and is in the course of discussing his proposals for a compromise or scheme of arrangement with interested parties, with a view to submitting a further report to the court as required by section 18.  At least until this report is finalised and decided on by the parties and the court, I am satisfied that it would not be appropriate to consider establishing any form of inquiry for the purpose mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that, in preparing his first report, the examiner is required by section 16 (i) to give his opinion as to whether the facts disclosed would warrant further inquiries under section 33, which deals with civil liability for fraudulent and reckless trading, and section 34, which deals with criminal liability for fraudulent trading.</P>
      <P>In any event, as the Deputy is well aware, the current powers available to appoint inspectors under sections 165 to 173 of the Companies Act, 1963, have proved ineffective.  I am at present replacing these provisions in Part II of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1987. I think it would be wasteful of scarce resources to make any appointment under the existing provisions and, until the new provisions are accepted by the Oireachtas, it would be premature to reach any decision in relation to their use.</P>

      <P>Do I understand the Minister is saying that, at the end of the examinership process, he may well end up considering setting up such a tribunal of inquiry, particularly within the context of this group having been entrusted with the largest ever industrial investment plan for Irish business in the history of this country; having regard to the manner in which that company abused the trust placed in it by Government, the serious questions concerning the probity of its affaris and the interaction between political and commercial considerations? Does he not agree that there is a need <Col N="1657" /> for us &mdash; speaking from the point of view of industrial policy &mdash; to learn from the lessons of the Goodman fiasco?  Would he not agree that at the end of the examinership process, we can do that only by way of a tribunal of inquiry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot prejudge the end of the examinership process.  The examiner has produced one report and will produce a final report, I think, within the next three weeks.  That will be put to the relevant parties, the creditors and others. If they approve of his proposals, it will then be put to the court.  I have no way of foreseeing what attitude the court will take in the final resort.  Certainly, I am not applying my mind to what might or might not be done until (a) that procedure is completed and (b) the proposed new legislation &mdash; now at Report Stage &mdash; is completed.  That would be the time to begin to apply one's mind to the matters raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Since taking office, I have been endeavouring to have the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which was first introduced in the Seanad in May 1987, enacted.  In this regard, Report Stage consideration of the Bill was commenced in this House on 24 October 1990, and I proposed to try to ensure that it is completed with the least possible delay.</P>
      <P>This Bill will update those areas of company law which, since the enactment of the main Companies Act, 1963, have been shown to be less than effective in dealing with problems which have arisen in the company law area.  I am satisfied that in the many new provisions contained in the Bill, in particular those dealing with investigations in Part II, winding-up in Part VI, and disqualification and restriction of directors and other officers in Part VII, we will have the necessary legislative provisions to tackle most problems which may arise in the company law area in the future, including those of the kind which arose in the company referred to by the Deputy.  The important point now is to have the Bill enacted without any undue delay.</P>

      <P>I concur entirely with the Minister on the last point about the urgency of enacting the Companies Bill, but will he confirm in the House whether, under the mechanism of appointing an inspector, he can hold out to the 590 depositors, some of whom lost their life savings, redundancy money and so on, the hope of retrieving some of the losses? Will he appoint such an inspector when the Bill is enacted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal way to retrieve losses of depositors or other creditors would be by the appointment of <Col N="1659" /> a liquidator.  In this case a liquidator was appointed.  He acted as such for a number of years and he got very little indeed in the way of assets of which there were very few.  He reported to the High Court that he could get no more and, I understand, he was not in a position to pay a dividend.  This was after two years. Therefore, an inspector would certainly not be in a better position to retrieve any moneys.  I note, though, in the case referred to by the Deputy that in Northern Ireland as a result of a criminal prosecution brought by the authorities there the defendant in that case, who, I understand was the managing director of the company concerned, contributed a sum of £500,000 towards the losses that had been incurred by the Northern Ireland depositors.  A criminal prosecution here might have brought about some contribution towards the losses of the depositors and other creditors, but the Director of Public Prosecutions here decided recently not to institute such a prosecution.</P>

      <P>The EC Council of Industry Ministers' meeting which was scheduled originally to take place on 21 September 1990 was cancelled and took place instead on 15 October 1990. Among the items discussed by the Council were the Community's industrial policy, the effects of competition rules on industrial policy, industrial co-operation with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and the European aeronautical industry.</P>
      <P>There was an initial discussion on the question of developing an industrial policy for the Community facing into the nineties.  The subject is to be discussed in more depth at the next Industry Council on the basis of a communication from the Commission.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss this subject with our Community partners.  I believe that a suitable agreed approach to industrial policy, which brings together the disparate policy elements involved, could assist the further development of industry in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Member states had a detailed exchange of views on the effects of competition <Col N="1661" /> rules on industrial policy.  The Council noted the offer by the Commission to present its annual report on competition policy to the Council for discussion each year, to have twice-yearly meetings of experts from member states to discuss state aid issues and to publish a collection of texts on procedures, rules and judgments on state aids.  These new procedures will increase the level of transparency in regard to rules on state aids and will provide Ireland with further opportunities to press its demands for a reduction in the levels of aid available in the Community, particularly in the more developed regions.</P>
    <P>The Commission presented a general report to the Council on industrial co-operation with Central and Eastern Europe.  The Commission explained that the aim was to assist these countries in moving towards a situation where they could function industrially in a free market convertible currency system.  In time, Ireland and the rest of the Community can expect to benefit from the achievement of open market economies in these states.</P>
    <P>The Commission also presented a communication to the Council on the European aeronautics industry.  This is an industry in which we have a growing and important interest through aircraft servicing, financing and component manufacture. I expect that the policy being contemplated by the Commission will benefit these interests as part of the entire aeronautics industry in all the member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>While there were important and interesting discussions at that Council meeting, no important decisions were made.  The decisions will be taken at the next Industry Council <Col N="1662" /> meeting which, as far as I recall, will be within the next couple of weeks.  As far as Central and Eastern Europe is concerned, my Department and particularly Córas Tráchtála Teoranta have been looking carefully at developments there over the past year.  It is not going to be the bonanza in the short term that many people thought it would be.  It is generally found that the economies of these countries are, unfortunately, in an even worse state than was thought and the economic difficulties they face are very considerable. I see them as medium- to long term prospects rather than substantial short term prospects in terms of trade from this country.  Nonetheless, obviously at a political level, I welcome greatly the developments that are taking place there.  Apart from whatever benefits we can get from trade in the long term, this Government's and this country's desire would be to be as helpful as possible to countries and peoples who are gradually getting themselves back into democracy and a market system and whose economies as a result are in a fragile state at present.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I realise there is a lot of detail involved in each of the directives.  Would the Minister agree, however, that it is sad to see that we must be at the lower end of the league table as to the implementation of important directives?  I realise the Minister is not directly responsible, having only taken office a short time ago, but will he explain the reason it has taken so long and why so many of these important directives have not been implemented?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the opportunity to dispel the misapprehension the Deputy has that we are close to the bottom of the league table in relation to the implementation of directives. The contrary is the case.  We are very close to the top of the league table in this respect.  We fell behind somewhat in our steady programme of implementation in the first six months of this year because the officials who carry out the great bulk of the implementation work were themselves involved full-time on Presidency duty in the Community.  That work has caught up again since July/August of this year.  I expect that by the end of this year many of these directives will have been cleared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give the Deputy an example of it, <Col N="1671" /> as far as I recall, five of them are contained in the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987.  One of the reasons the Bill keeps getting bigger all the time is that these directives have to be brought into it.  Five of this arrears total will disappear when the Bill is enacted and most of the others will be enacted by way of Statutory Instrument and in many of the cases that will be done before the end of December.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he is taking to protect the Irish clothing industry from the challenge of increasing imports from low-cost countries; if he has satisfied himself that sufficient help and assistance is being made available to this industry to enable it to continue its process of restructuring before it faces the difficulties resulting from the ending of the multi-fibre arrangement in 1991; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take oral Question No. 9 and written Question No. 33 together.</P>
      <P>Irish industry generally derives considerable benefits from membership of the multilateral trading system regulated by GATT.  As a small open economy we depend heavily on export trade for the creation of employment.  Such trade needs to be sustained by clear and fair rules on access to international markets. A successful conclusion to the Uruguay round should enhance the capacity of Irish industry to trade abroad, with consequent benefits for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the textiles and clothing industry, Ireland is seeking in the context of the EC position in the GATT negotiations to ensure, as far as possible, that <Col N="1672" /> the integration of textiles trade into a strengthened GATT, in other words the phase out of the multi-fibre arrangement after 1991, will be achieved in such a way as to allow the industry to adapt and to continue to restructure in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>The inevitable liberalisation of trade in textiles which will result from the GATT negotiations is being taken into account in the implementation of the wide range of measures in place to address the weaknesses identified in the textile and clothing sectors.  These measures are aimed at building strong competitive companies which will be able to withstand the impact of increased imports from low cost sources by exploiting the advantages of design, quality and quick response to consumer demands.  A wide range of advisory and grant support services is available from the various State agencies for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but I would refer him to his own expressed apprehension that agriculture was not the only industry at risk in the present round of GATT talks.  Specifically let me refer to the US Bill &mdash; I do not know whether it has been enacted &mdash; in respect of textiles and clothing which would restrict imports to the United States of Irish and EC products, presumably, having an adverse effect on this economy.  Has the Minister any specific measures in mind that could contain that adverse impact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not up to date information on the US Bill available to me but to the best of my knowledge &mdash; and I may be wrong &mdash; it has not been enacted.  Even if it has, however, it is flagrantly in contravention of the GATT spirit and, I would suggest, rules also and I think they would have to amend it or, hopefully, repeal it if the Uruguay round is successfully completed.  Let me say in that context that the United States offer in Geneva on textiles is entirely unacceptable not just from the point of view of the Community but from the point of view of virtually every other country in <Col N="1673" /> the world, with the exception of Canada who have not complained about it because they have themselves a free trade area with the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that while Ireland want to be good Europeans and to co-operate in every way we can, with the advance of the Community there are many times when it is obvious to many of us that, in the process of being good Europeans, Irish industry is in danger of being screwed into the ground?  Would he agree that the clothing industry is a typical example of that?</P>
      <P>I concur with what Deputy Rabbitte said in relation to the activities of the United States.  Will the Minister give us an assurance that nothing will be put in place that will hinder the advancement and development of, particularly, the clothing industry which is a vital industrial sector and employs a large number of people?  Would he agree that in the context of competition, and unfair competition, when one considers where the bulk of the low cost clothing is imported from, there is no such thing as fair competition as many of these countries are presently retaining work practices and paying wages not equivalent to what is being paid here, not because they cannot afford it but simply because of the type of government those countries have? Would the Minister not agree, in the interest of fairness to developing countries &mdash; I put a question mark on that in relation to the unfortunate people living in some of those countries &mdash; that he, as Minister, should protect and ensure that provisions are included at all times that will give our industry a chance of developing on a fair basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it will have such a fair chance.  The Declaration at Punta Del Este in 1986 set out as its objective in regard to textiles and clothing &ldquo;the aim of formulating modalities that would permit the eventual integration of trade in textiles and clothing into GATT on the basis of strengthened GATT rules and principles&rdquo;.  That is an <Col N="1674" /> objective with which we would concur.  If other countries as well as the European Community are prepared to approach this matter in a reasonable way then I think that next month in Brussels a reasonable agreement can be achieved. I am well aware of the importance of clothing and textiles within our industrial economy.  Those who are most at risk are those who are at the very bottom of the market.  Those whose quality is of a higher order will not necessarily have to fear greatly an increase of imports from low cost countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

      <P>Would the Minister agree that in relation to multi-fibre agreements our agreements with countries outside the EC or outside the main trading blocs of the western world, countries such as China, can flood the western world with cheap products because of the unfair manner in which they treat their citizens when producing these products?  In entering into negotiations we should ensure that there is fairness in competition.  The cost of producing a product, the method in which it is produced and the manner in which Governments see that it is produced should be taken into account.</P>

      <P>To reply to the example the Deputy gives, we can of course resist entirely exports from China because as far as I recall China is not a member of the GATT.

      <askee>Minister for Industry and Commerce</askee>
      <Quest>the opportunities afforded to various categories of Irish business to make submissions prior to the drafting of EC Directives; the mechanisms, if any, which are in place at present for the making of such submissions: if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is grave concern among many Irish businesses at the lack of consultation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The initiative and responsibility for drafting EC Directives rests with the EC Commission.  It is common practice for the Commission, before preparing a draft directive, to consult, in appropriate cases, with the relevant organisation representing the sector or sectors concerned at Community level, about the intended provisions of the directive and the organisations' views on those provisions. Irish business, through its national representative bodies, fully avails of such opportunity to make its views known to the Commission at such a vital, early stage in the life of directives.</P>
      <P>In the case of proposals within my direct area of responsibility &mdash; and where a working group representative of member states is convened by the Commission to consider a proposal for a directive, it is my Department's practice, in the normal course of events, to consult with the industry or sector directly affected and to take their views into account in the course of negotiations on the final terms of such proposals for directives.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any concern among Irish business in the area of consultation between it and my Department on directives at the pre-drafting stage but if the Deputy would let me have details I will be glad to pursue the matter further.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that, in the course of further consideration of proposed directives at Council group level, further opportunities exist for businesses to influence the content and final format of a directive.

Would he agree that it is essential that we have in place a proper procedure where adequate discussions can take place between Irish industry and his Department?  Would he also agree that because of a lack of facilities and staff in his Department this can be extremely difficult?  Would he further agree that it is in the interest of this country that a system should be set up, particularly in this House, where directives can be discussed at an early stage and there will be a platform where individual companies which could be affected by a certain proposal or directive in the future would have an opportunity to present their case to a committee of the Oireachtas and we in turn could pass on that information to the Minister through the proper political channels?

      <Quest>if he will give details of the Iraq export credit insurance scheme; the cost to the Government of the scheme for each year to date; the companies covered by the scheme; and the amount of cover each company has received yearly to date.</Quest>

      <P>Iraq is one of a large number of countries for which cover has been provided under the export credit insurance scheme.  This scheme is operated on my behalf by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and is designed to give exporters protection against non-payment by foreign buyers.  Cover for Iraq was suspended in early 1989 because of the high level of payments which were then overdue to Irish exporters.  No new liabilities have been underwritten in that market since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> The export credit insurance scheme operates on the basis that exporters pay a premium for the insurance they receive. To date the operation of the scheme in relation to Iraq has not resulted in any net cost to the Exchequer.  It would be virtually impossible for me to give the Deputy details of the number of companies that have held export credit insurance for Iraq since the inception of the scheme in 1971.  A single comprehensive policy covering one company's export turnover might cover 150 buyers in 15 markets at any one time.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Deputy, however, that since 1983, approximately 13 companies have held export credit insurance for Iraq at one time or another.  It has never been the practice to disclose the names of companies availing of the scheme or to give details of the amount of cover they received.  This is confidential information relating to the commercial operation of the companies concerned.  Its disclosure would be inappropriate and would not be in the best interests of the companies concerned.</P>

      <P>There certainly will not be any forced sales by the IDA but, in the course of their normal business, the IDA sell land to industrialists to enable them to build plants on it or to sell it when the plants have already been built. There is constant buying and selling in that business, that will have to continue in the normal course of business.  I do not propose at the moment to give any direction to the IDA to sell off things simply for the sake of selling them.  It would be as well for the House to bear in mind that the IDA hold a lot of land and a great deal of empty industrial buildings comprising many hundreds of thousands of square feet.  It would be in the public interest if they were occupied or, in default of that, if they were put to the best possible use in the national interest.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Industry and Commerce</askee>
      <Quest>whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that no insurance company will now provide new insurance cover for holiday homes; if he will address this problem as a matter of urgency due to its major implications for the development of tourism; and if he will make a statement on the action he proposes to take.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy, that my primary and indeed statutory duty as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements. I must, therefore, respect the right of insurance firms to make their own underwriting decisions including the acceptance or rejection of any risk in the light of their particular underwriting experience.  No legal obligation can be placed on an insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote at any particular premium or in any particular manner.  I am not responsible for the day to day running of insurance companies or the exercise of business acumen on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurers deal with applications for household insurance cover, including holiday homes, on a case by case basis. As with all forms of non-life insurance, difficulties can be experienced by some <Col N="1687" /> people in obtaining cover.  However, in cases where property cover cannot be obtained despite reasonable efforts to place the risk in the Irish market, the Irish Insurance Federation, following discussions in February, 1987, agreed that its property standing committee would re-examine such cases on the strict understanding that it cannot guarantee that cover will be provided.</P>
    <P>Before any case can be submitted to the federation for consideration it is necessary that at least half the market, approximately 12 companies including Lloyds, be approached without success. Evidence of these approaches, e.g. a letter from a broker, together with a brief synopsis of the risk should be forwarded to the insurance section of my Department who will refer the matter to the federation.  I must emphasise that, while this arrangement is reasonably successful, no guarantee can be given that cover will be forthcoming in each individual case.</P>
    <P>Thus it can be seen that facilities already exist to assist in cases where difficulty arises in obtaining insurance cover for property, including holiday homes.</P>

      <P>My question No. 5 is related to this.  Would the Minister agree that as a member of the Government he has responsibility to see to it that this economy is developed in whatever way possible?  Would he agree also that tourism happens to be one of our main industries, that part of that industry relates to the development of the holiday home type holiday, and that it is insufficient to say that his only responsibility is to see to it that insurance companies remain viable?  Would the Minister agree also that he has a responsibility to see to it that law and order is maintained so that premiums will not escalate and so that markets are made available to the people we represent to insure their homes, to insure homes for individuals who live abroad but want to come here to spend their money during the summertime? Would the Minister not agree that it is not good enough to say to young people <Col N="1688" />&ldquo;you cannot get motor insurance, you have to traipse around 12 companies before you come near my Department&rdquo;? Would the Minister not agree that it is not good enough to say that insurance premiums that cost £1,500 here, if they can be got, would cost only £600 in Northern Ireland?  Would he not agree also that statistics recently produced clearly indicate that there are more fatalities on the roads in Northern Ireland than on the roads here bearing in mind the number of cars and the number of accidents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These were identified as reductions in costs, including payroll costs, to bring Irish Steel Limited further into line with their international competitors, more flexible working arrangements in line with best practice and more appropriate pay arrangements in large part allied to performance.

The Deputy will be aware that the <Col N="1694" /> Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade is a statutory officer who is independent in the performance of his duties.</P>
      <P>The director informs me that over 200 petrol and diesel retailers were visited in July by inspectors under his control.  So far, the director has referred 41 cases to his solicitors for the commencement of court proceedings in respect of various offences relating to overcharging and display of prices and, in the case of two of those establishments, for obstruction of his inspectors in the performance of their duties.  The director expects that these cases will be listed for hearing over the next few months.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the figures he has given of over 200 visits in July and 40 possible convictions seem to confirm the widely held view that there does not seem to be sufficient personnel to monitor and police the outlets; that a minority of retail outlets are ruthlessly exploiting the position as prices begin to fluctuate and that by and large there is a perception that retail outlets are slow to invoke reductions, very quick to impose increases and are ripping off the customer?</P>

      <Col N="1695" /> However, in the case of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, as a result of my raising the matter in Government and discussing it with the Minister for Finance, I am glad to say that in the month of August the Department of Finance conveyed sanction for the appointment of seven additional people to the Office.

      <P>I would like to say there would be far more prosecutions if there were more staff but one of the things it is worth drawing to the attention of the House is the fact that in the five prosecutions which have been completed before July, before this round of inspections, convictions were obtained in all cases and, with the exception of one, either the Probation Act was applied or derisory fines were imposed.  It is a great discouragement to both the director and me that the view taken by many members of the District Court, but not all, is, unfortunately, that blatant overcharging is not a serious matter.  I regard the blatant overcharging which is going on widely in the petrol and diesel business as a very serious matter and I hope the President of the District Court can draw the attention of his colleagues in that court to the seriousness of this matter and the damage it does to the economy.</P>

The accounts of the tiny Irish subsidiaries of companies such as Exxon, Shell and so on, are produced on the basis that here on the face of it they lose money but, of course the organisation as a whole makes large sums of money elsewhere out of what they sell here.  The Irish accounts, while they are accurate for the Irish subsidiary, do not reflect the reality so far as the group or the multinational as a whole is concerned.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now continue my contribution which I started before Question Time.  Reductions in developmental aid are an ideological wrong.  Clearly the Government fail to recognise our responsibility on the one hand and the world's needs on the other.  With our own economic well-being we should, and are honour bound to, contribute more whereas we have contributed less and less over the years to the less developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986 we contributed 0.25 per cent of our GNP to international development endeavours.  With our increased GNP in 1988 our contribution lessened to 0.18 per cent and now in 1990 we are contributing only 0.16 per cent.  That is an absolute scandal.  The Catholic Agency for World Development &mdash; Trócaire &mdash; recently investigated Irish economic benefits of developmental aid contributions.  Their principal conclusion is that aid is of considerable benefit to Ireland in simple commercial terms.  It is a very important, in view of our high unemployment, that Irish people can and do obtain work in developing countries.  Trócaire condemn <Col N="1719" /> Ireland for our miserable contributions compared to our present GNP.  I agree with them totally.</P>
    <P>The fact is that Ireland is at the bottom of the official aid list in the OECD development assistance committee.  Why cannot we on the periphery of the EC, and as an ex-colonial country, recognise the needs of the undeveloped countries. In my appeal for more aid for the Third World I would stress that much aid in the past has been misspent.  There are many examples of this such as the large hi-tech hospitals in countries where there are not even the basic medical necessities.  The provision of tractors and chemicals designed to produce cash crops for export is another area which has gone wrong. We have made many mistakes in the manner in which development aid has been channelled.  Intermediate technology is needed for the Third World to encourage a level of self sufficiency where possible.</P>
    <P>For all the lofty talk about the help we give to the Third World we frequently forget the oppression of the international banks who are bleeding the Third World dry.  The repayments of interest and principal on these debts more than compensates for any aid given.  I call on the Government to speak out on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation for the constructive contributions we have had in the debate, with one or two exceptions which I would prefer to ignore.  It reflects the view held right in the House that we need to continue to contribute to developing countries as we have done in the past. There is a general recognition that in the serious financial situation in which we found ourselves a few years ago there was a necessity to review all areas of expenditure. This has been reflected right across the board.  While I appreciate the concerns expressed by the Deputies today about the necessity to maintain a high <Col N="1720" /> level of commitment, it has to be recognised that we were in a critical financial position for a few years and that all areas of Government expenditure had to be looked at very closely.  This in no way diminished our desire to reach the target which has been set down and which we aim to achieve.</P>
      <P>In 1980 Ireland committed itself to achieving the United Nations target for developed countries of providing 0.07 per cent of annual GNP for overseas development assistance, ODA.  We did not commit ourselves at that time or since setting a specific date for reaching the target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister do so now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>All development assistance has at least a 25 per cent grant element provided from governmental sources. Therefore, ODA does not include assistance from non-governmental agencies such as Concern and Trocaire.  Like Deputy Ferris I should like to pay tribute to the work of organisations such as Goal and Trocaire, and of outstanding clergymen such as Archbishop Clifford and Bishop Casey who have been to the forefront of the campaign for increasing aid and encouraging non-governmental agencies and voluntary organisations to continue to make the same level of contribution and commitment as they have done in the past.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nora Owen made reference to that commitment.  All sides will agree that Government action on its own would never be sufficient to deal effectively with the problems in the underdeveloped regions.  To a large extent what will be required in the future will be concentrated action by Government agencies and voluntary organisations, to co-ordinate the overall approach.  That would make a significant change for people in the Third World.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large the contributions by Deputies today were constructive and <Col N="1721" /> expressed the general view on this issue. I disagree to an extent with Deputy Mitchell who said there are no votes in this. On reflection the Deputy will reconsider his position.  There is a general acceptance and recognition &mdash; his own Party benefited from this &mdash; of the contribution made by Deputy Garret FitzGerald in the development of policies and initiatives in this area.  Rather than saying there are no votes in this the public at large are aware of how important it is that we play our full part and make our contributions. People in the Community recognise that when Governments have to deal with difficult financial problems they can supplement that by making increased contributions to the voluntary agencies, which they have done.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa made similar statements in the course of his contribution.  I was not here when the Deputy spoke but I understand he reiterated the necessity to continue to increase our contribution as far as possible and that the amount was inadequate.  The Deputy will appreciate that we all would like to see more being done in regard to a whole range of activities but when resources are limited and we are faced with economic pressures within our community we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tom Kitt, and other Deputies, referred to the practice of imposing Western economic recovery strategies on developing countries which are unrelated to their needs.  The accusation was made that Western economic recovery strategies are unsuited to the needs of developing countries.  This is being taken seriously by the World Bank and the IDA who are now acutely aware of the importance of relating assistance to the needs of the recipients and of involving developing countries in the structuring of development assistance.  They are also placing greater emphasis on the social dimension of adjustment, particularly the impact of policy reforms on the poor and the need to maintain essential social programmes.  Therefore, the World Bank and the IDA have been increasing their efforts to help recipient Governments design and implement better programmes which will not only contribute more strongly to growth and development but will also ensure that the benefits are directed more effectively to the poorer members of developing societies. They are also strengthening their relationships with non-governmental organisations and involving these organisations in the preparation and implementation of programmes and projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This socially concerned approach to development is being enhanced by a growing awareness of the value of the market and of competition especially in those developing countries which previously practiced central planning to various degrees.  More and more policymakers accept the contribution which can be made by greater openness in trade and competition, the need for <Col N="1723" /> proper sectoral initiatives and incentives and the importance of sustainable macro-economic policies.  I am satisfied that in the long run the interests of developing countries will be best served by increasing emphasis being placed by the IDA on the human face of development and the simultaneous acceptance by developing nations of the benefits of a market economy.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the environmental aspects.  I am conscious that the World Bank and the IDA, have been the subject of criticism because of the adverse environmental impact of some of the projects they have funded in the past.  It is true to say that far from ignoring these criticisms the bank has taken them very seriously.  It has openly acknowledged that mistakes were made in the past and has set about ensuring that its future activities will have no harmful effects on the environment.</P>
    <P>On assuming office the current President placed the improvement of the World Bank's operations in the environmental area as one of his highest priorities. Positive and constructive action is now being taken on foot of that commitment and progress already made was welcomed by the donors during the recent IDA 9 negotiations.  The IDA now bring environmental issues into their policy dialogue with Governments so as to ensure that the investment projects, and adjustment programmes, support positive environmental actions and minimise potentially adverse impacts.  They have given an undertaking to complete environmental action plans for all IDA borrowers during the period of the Ninth Replenishment.  In the preparation of individual projects the people immediately affected, the non-governmental organisations, will be consulted both at planning and project implementation stages.</P>
    <P>The World Bank has also been playing an increasing role in global environmental issues and the bank is currently <Col N="1724" /> considering a proposal to establish a global environmental facility which would provide funds to help developing countries play a role in combating the depletion of the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect and the loss of biological diversity.  A number of Deputies raised these issues.  The World Bank is conscious of the criticisms made in the past and they are taking action to deal effectively with these matters in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed some concern about the recent reductions in Ireland's offical development assistance. While these are regrettable, the reductions have been necessary as part of the overall Government programme to bring the State's finances under control. Deputy Jim Mitchell, like many others, complained for years about the necessity to bring Government finances under control by exercising very stringent control on spending right across the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We did it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have it both ways.  All areas of Government activity have had to be subjected to cutbacks in the interests of reaching this goal.  While we might wish otherwise, it has not been possible to make an exception for ODA. I would point out, however, that the Government remain committed to reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent and will move towards this target as soon as economic circumstances permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been criticism that Ireland is at the bottom of the list of developed country donors.  This criticism presumably relates to our ranking among our fellow members of the OECD's development aid committee.  While in the 1989 statistics we do rank at the bottom in actual terms, this is hardly surprising given the relative size of our economy. In terms of ODA as a percentage of GNP the USA ranks below us.  Some other members of the Community such as Spain, Greece and Portugal, are not <Col N="1725" /> included in this committee.  Official development assistance contributions from these countries are well below the contribution from Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ireland's bilateral aid programme has been complimented by the committee for its quality.  Our four priority countries are among the least developed and our whole programme concentrates on Africa, the continent facing the most severe difficulties. Our official development assistance aid is always in the form of grants and it is united, whereas significant proportions of aid disbursed by many other countries must be expended on goods and services of the donor nation.  We impose no conditions about buying Irish.  Our approach is highly practical, reflecting the lessons we have learned in our own recent development.</P>
    <P>Another factor which should not be lost sight of is Ireland's very high rate of voluntary aid contributions to the developing world, the highest of any developed country according to the latest OECD statistics.  The net grants for development assistance by Irish private and voluntary organisations are estimated at £17.5 million in 1987, £15 million in 1988 and £18 million in 1989. These are significant additions to ODA in Ireland's overall contribution to Third World development.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the contributions which have been made.  By and large Deputies offered constructive criticism and there was a willingness to be constructive in the approach to this area.  I thank Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Government <Col N="1726" /> are slightly blind to the need for a permanent Garda-military checkpoint at Lifford Bridge.  I am a native of Lifford and I know what happens there.  It is as easy as taking a lollipop from a child for any group of people, whether IRA super-Republicans or hooligans, to hijack a vehicle in Lifford which they leave on the bridge.  It can be done any day of the week at any hour of the day, particularly when the bush telegraph relates where the Garda patrol car is.  One remembers what happened further down the river at Cushquin between Derry and Buncrana last weekend and the same thing can happen at Lifford any day.  A car can be hijacked and left at the military checkpoint at Strabane and kill human beings, whether they are wearing British Army uniforms or not.  It does not really matter.</P>
      <P>There used to be an Army-Garda checkpoint at Lifford Bridge but during the February election of 1982 Deputy Blaney, for reasons better known to himself, made it a condition in that campaign that if the Fianna Fáil Party got into power and needed his vote then the checkpoint would have to be shifted. There was no secret about that.  It was said from every platform on which Deputy Blaney spoke.  When the Taoiseach formed the Government in 1982 he needed that support and the checkpoint was shifted, the argument being put forward was that a roving patrol car would be just as effective.  This has proved not to be the case.  Three miles up the river there is a constant Garda checkpoint at Clady Bridge, but the amount of traffic crossing there is infinitesimal compared with that crossing the bridge at Lifford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking with the unanimous voice of the people of Lifford, people of all parties and all shades of opinion, when I say to the Minister that he must put a Garda checkpoint at Lifford Bridge to stop the kind of carry on which can be repeated any day of the week.  I am asking the Minister to forget other considerations and to put a permanent Garda checkpoint there with a back-up military <Col N="1727" /> presence.  It does not have to be a fortress like that on the other side of the bridge. It just means that there is someone there to stop hoodlums from leaving a vehicle on the bridge, putting it across the bridge to the other side, or putting it into the military checkpoint at the Camel's Hump in Strabane.  It is as easy as kissing one's hand for people to do that, to walk undisturbed without giving any account of what they are doing and go back into the Republic across the bridge.</P>
    <P>There is no argument whatsoever to be advanced by the Minister for not doing what I am requesting.  There are no politics in this.  This is the voice of the people of Lifford saying to me: &ldquo;Would you please put pressure on the Government; please argue strongly; please ask the Minister for Justice to concede to our request; we have lost count of the number of times vehicles have been hijacked in Lifford and left on Lifford Bridge.&rdquo;  It causes so much inconvenience to ordinary people, people who live on one side of the Border and work on the other, who have to make a detour over Clady, down over the Craigavaon Bridge in Derry or, alternatively, not go to work at all.  It prevents pedestrians from using the bridge.  Above all, I might say that within 100 yards of the bridge, across a garden there is a district hospital which now caters for the elderly more than the sick and infirm.  The elderly are being catered for in Lifford Hospital. When this type of occurrence happens &mdash; whether it be a real bomb or a decoy &mdash; attention focuses on the nursing and domestic staff and, above all, on the patients.  To say the least it is criminal to allow this continue.</P>
    <P>I am pleading with the Minister to do as I request.  I know that were I in Government and had the authority he has I would not hesitate for one moment to have a constant Garda checkpoint at Lifford Bridge backed up by a military presence which is the only way the nonsense going on there at present can be stopped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to what the Deputy has said and appreciate the reasons for his concern.  However, I must emphasise that the deployment of Garda resources in any given situation is not a matter for me, as Minister for Justice, but one for the Garda authorities acting on the basis of their professional judgment and expertise and depending on the particular circumstances of any given situation.  I agree with the Deputy there are no politics in it.  It is a matter for the professional judgment of the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is quite entitled, if he so wishes, to convey his views to the Garda Commissioner and make representations along the lines he has outlined here today.  I invite him to do so.  Having said that, I would like to inform him that he is more than likely to receive the same response I received when I consulted the Garda authorities generally about the use of permanent checkpoints, that is that the Garda have long been of the view that there is a better way of using scarce Garda resources.</P>
      <P>The Garda viewpoint &mdash; based on their professional judgment and expertise in this area &mdash; is that permanent vehicle checkpoints make heavy demands on Garda resources and reduce overall mobility and flexibility, From a policing perspective, a system of intensive patrolling with snap checkpoints, for example, is considered to be a more effective and efficient method of using the same resources.  This is generally the accepted professional view on an international level.  Snap checkpoints and patrols present subversives with an unknown factor and are more likely to inhibit their plans and movements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A permanent vehicle checkpoint requires a considerable manpower allocation and therefore is extremely demanding.  It also has the major disadvantage of signposting the location of Garda and Army personnel at any given time and provides subversives with the knowledge of when and where they can <Col N="1729" /> by-pass security checks.  Experience has shown that, where permanent checkpoints have existed in the past, subversives have simply travelled another route or used the information concerning the location of the checkpoint to carry out their deeds in some other nearby location.</P>
    <P>In addition, a permanent checkpoint exposes those manning the checkpoint to a certain amount of risk.  Recent tragic incidents on the northern side serve only too well to remind us of that.  Therefore, the reality is that, in general, such checkpoints are a disadvantage in policing terms as well as being perceived by the local populace as introducing a type of policing that is not standard and which is not generally experienced in a normal society.  I should also say that where such permanent checkpoints have existed in the past they have tended to result in complaints from the local population who find themselves inconvenienced due to delays and checks being made by the personnel manning such checkpoints. This can lead to a circumstances in which hostility can be generated in those who see such checkpoints as a nuisance.  As the Deputy will appreciate, such a development can be counter-productive in local policing terms.</P>
    <P>I accept that in some instances there can be very particular circumstances that permanent checkpoints may be considered necessary to deal with specific situations, but I am advised by the Garda that such circumstances do not exist with regard to Lifford Bridge.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to ensuring that the Garda have the necessary resources to enable them prevent the type of occurrence which took place on Lifford Bridge in October where possible and, where such incidents do occur, we are committed to ensuring that as much co-operation as possible will be afforded to their counterparts north of the Border to enable the devices to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I know that the House will join me in <Col N="1730" /> condemning those who engage in these activities and in giving our full support to the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces in dealing with them.  In conclusion, I might say to the Deputy that it is strictly a matter of the best police professional advice in relation to the use of resources to their maximum for the protection and benefit of the community to which we resort.</P>

      <P>I am sure all Members of the House will want to join me in condemning the disgraceful scenes of violence witnessed in the centre of Dublin last night following the Ireland/England soccer international.</P>
      <P>As this country has managed to avoid the level of violence which has been all too common a part of sporting events in some other countries, the events of last evening are all the more shocking.  While many of those involved in the violence clearly were football fans it seems clear also that many of those who took part in and encouraged the violence had nothing to do with the match but simply exploited the circumstances to their own political ends, in this case the Provo-led and inspired campaign against extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Justifiably we have been proud of the reputation of Irish followers who have travelled all over the world with the international soccer team, who have always <Col N="1731" /> conducted themselves in an exemplary manner.  But it is clear that there were supporters of both sides involved in the violence of last evening.  The English football follower has a bad reputation but we should be cautious about allowing ourselves to indulge in racial stereotyping. The image of the British football follower as a lager-swilling skinhead is as far removed from reality as is the manner in which Irish people are often depicted in the British tabloid press.  The fact is that the majority of football followers, English and Irish, are decent people who want only to enjoy themselves, watch a good match and totally deplore the sort of violence we saw last evening.  A minority of followers only on either side was involved last evening but, as we saw, a minority can cause enormous trouble.</P>
    <P>I recognise that, once the violence started last night, the Garda took decisive action to end it as rapidly as possible. Indeed, had the Garda not acted so rapidly, the trouble could have been much worse with the possibility of more serious injury and even death.  However, I am concerned that such a large number of fans were allowed congregate in the city centre following the match and that the Garda seemed, to some extent, to have been taken unawares by the violence. This match always was going to be a potential flashpoint.  Clearly the dangers were increased by the fact that it coincided with the Supreme Court judgment in the Ellis case.</P>
    <P>In Britain, where there have been major problems of soccer violence, where the British police have more experience of dealing with soccer thuggery, the underlying strategy adopted by the police is to ensure that potentially hostile fans are not allowed to congregate before or after a match.  As I understand it, in accordance with normal practice at such matches, all of the English fans at Lansdowne Road were segregated in one part of the ground but that, following <Col N="1732" /> the match, they were allowed disperse around the city centre.</P>
    <P>Given the fact that most of the English fans were day-trippers, it would have been preferable had they been escorted in groups to the airport, ferryport or railway station.  This is standard practice in other countries.  Had it been done in Dublin yesterday &mdash; especially as anti-extradition demonstrators were known to be gathering in the city centre &mdash; much of the violence and trouble could have been avoided.  I would ask the Minister to explain why that was not done.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I acknowledge the prompt action taken by the Garda but I am concerned also at allegations that a number of newspaper photographers were assaulted by the Garda and had their films confiscated.  This morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> contains a graphic account by two of the paper's photographers of their alleged treatment by gardaí which I hope the Minister or the Garda Commissioner will have investigated. While some gardaí may consider the presence of reporters or photographers to be an irritant in such cases, the public have a right to know what is going on and we must protect the right of newspaper staff to be free from violence or intimidation.</P>
    <P>The most important thing is that we must now learn the lessons of yesterday's events.  We must discover why, despite months of planning on the part of all those involved, there was mayhem in the city centre last night.  I hope the Department of Justice will join with the Garda and the FAI and carry out a full investigation into yesterday's violence and ensure that such scenes are not repeated after any future sporting event in this city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the events of yesterday evening.  I consider it important to put last night's events in perspective. Irish soccer fans have travelled far and wide in support of their team and <Col N="1733" /> have always conducted themselves in the most exemplary and sporting manner whether at home or abroad.</P>
      <P>Over 45,000 people were in attendance at Lansdowne Road yesterday for this match and the vast majority of them continued the fine tradition of being among the best football supporters in the world as they were referred to during the recent World Cup.  It is a pity that a very small handful of people attempted last evening to tarnish this fine reputation.  However, I am glad to say that with effective crowd control and swift and decisive action by the Garda the situation was brought quickly under control with the trouble-makers being identified and dealt with appropriately.</P>
      <P>As to the actual events which took place on the streets of Dublin yesterday evening, the Garda authorities report that from 4.15 p.m. onwards a large crowd gathered in the city centre.  There was a considerable Garda presence in the vicinity of Lansdowne Road itself and on all routes converging on the stadium.  The Commissioner and I are both satisfied that the Garda resources and equipment were adequate in all respects and at all times.  A number of incidents broke out between rival supporters but the gardaí took swift and professional action to deal with the problems which arose.  This action resulted in the arrest of 45 persons who have been, or will be, dealt with by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Garda on their handling of the situation.  The Garda have for many years now used prepared guidelines on operational planning for crowd control. As part of their planning for major events of this kind the Garda authorities meet the organisers and the necessary arrangements are planned well in advance.  It is very clear that the behind the scenes work and planning which the Garda put into this operation and the excellent liaison and co-operation which have been ongoing with the organisers of the game paid dividends yesterday <Col N="1734" /> evening.  A very controlled and organised strategy enabled the situation to be brought quickly and effectively under control.  There was a very clear message given to those who would try to ruin these events by turning our streets into playgrounds for their aggressiveness. This behaviour is not, and never will be, accepted and those who attempt to flout the law and interfere with the peaceful enjoyment of an occasion such as an international soccer match can expect to be brought to face the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>The incidents yesterday evening will of course be the subject of careful scrutiny by the Garda.  If any lessons have to be learned from the operation, the House can rest assured that they will be noted and strategies will be revised as necessary to ensure that the Garda will continue to be in a position to take a fully professional approach to these matters.</P>
    <P>I am sure the vast majority of Irish supporters would wish to disassociate themselves from the unsavory events of last night.  I am also confident that our fans can continue to hold their heads high when they travel abroad to soccer fixtures in the future in support of the Irish soccer team.  Let me say to the visiting fans who come to our country in support of their team &mdash; they are more than welcome in Ireland at any time as long as they come here to enjoy the sporting fixture, not to cause trouble.</P>
    <P>In relation to the photographers I can tell the House that matter is being investigated by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>Finally, and most importantly, I say through you, Sir, to the people of Dublin, that as Minister for Justice and on behalf of the Government, I am determined that our citizens will be able to go about their lawful business and that whatever Garda resources are necessary to ensure this will be provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In Waterford there is a <Col N="1735" /> very strong impression now that we are being conned in terms of any serious intent on the Government's part to decentralise a Government Department to Waterford.  I have raised this matter a number of times in the House during the past 12 months, and in a recent question which I had down to the Minister on 1 November, I stated that the Government earlier this year had contacted Telecom Éireann to identify sections within their organisation for transfer to Waterford and requested that the Government decision would be followed through by taking the necessary steps for such transfer of staff.</P>
      <P>Recently a letter was sent by J. Joyce, an executive director of Telecom Éireann to the Mayor of Waterford on this very issue, and I quote:</P>
      <P>With reference to your recent letter to Dr. Michael Smurfit, the position is that Telecom Éireann has for some years been pursuing a policy of decentralising management and operation of the service and dispersing staff close to the customer.  Pursuant to that policy, staff and operations have been relocated from Dublin to provincial centres throughout the country.  At the same time, technological developments have resulted in the Company's overall staff numbers reducing from 18,270 at our vesting in 1984 to 13,700 now.  The prospects are for further significant overall staff reductions over the next few years.  At this stage, Telecom has no current proposals for transfer of staff to Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue which is relevant here is the powers the Minister has under the Postal and Telecomunications Services Act, 1983, Part VII of which provides that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; who obviously is the Minister for Communications &mdash; may issue directions in writing to either company requiring that the company comply with policy decisions of a general kind made by the <Col N="1736" /> Government concerning the development of postal or telecommunications services of which he may advise the company from time to time.  I have taken counsel's opinion on that and the advice I received was that the Minister has powers in a general way in regard to policy but he has not got specific powers. In other words, he has not the powers to instruct or compel Telecom Éireann to decentralise part of their staff to Waterford. Therefore, I believe this business of transferring part of the BTE operation to Waterford is just a red herring the Government are using to give the impression they are doing something about decentralisation when, in fact, they are not.</P>
    <P>Dr. Michael Bannon did a survey some years ago which showed that Waterford was very deficient in the service sector and the 400 jobs that were promised to Waterford would be very important at that time.  A shopping development is going on in the centre of Waterford at the moment.  It is a very large development, something of the order of £18 million. A decentralisation to Waterford would have a big effect on the time of completion of that development.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister this evening to come clean about this.  All the evidence and information available show that BTE have no intention of decentralising any part of their staff to Waterford.  Furthermore, the Minister would not seem to have the powers to instruct them to do so but if he has such powers, he should use them quickly.  Waterford Corporation paid £100,000 for a site of three acres which was part of a five acre site previously purchased by the Board of Works to implement the previous decision of decentralising the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs to Waterford.</P>
    <P>We have had enough messing about.  I accuse the Minister and the Government of going on and on with this red herring when they know as well as I do that there is absolutely no prospect of this coming <Col N="1737" /> to Waterford.  The Minister must tell us the truth, come out front about it.  If he has the powers to direct BTE to do this, let him use those powers but let us not be going on and on in this ridiculous way when he and his Government have no intention of facilitating the people of Waterford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke) Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position on this matter is that in 1980 the Government decided that a number of staff of the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be transferred to Dundalk and Waterford.  It was envisaged that approximately 400 staff would go to Waterford.  However, since that date the position has changed significantly. In January 1984 Telecom Éireann were set up and given responsibility for the operation of telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>At the time of its establishment Telecom Éireann had a staff of 18,270.  This has now fallen to 14,000, in parallel with overall reductions in numbers.  BTE have followed a programme of decentralisation of functions and devolution to provincial centres to give ease of access to customers and to improve the speed of response and the level of customer service.  Pursuant to that policy staff and operations have been relocated from Dublin to provincial centres throughout the country involving quite considerable relocation costs.  In addition the staff arrangements for the type of telecommunciations network that existed in 1980 are no longer relevant.  The network has benefitted from over £1 billion investment and technology has changed radically so that the number of operational and maintenance staff required in various locations to operate the network has been reduced dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me mention that the function originally envisaged for a transfer to Waterford of the telephone accounts function, now called customer accounts, has been computerised and the overall number of staff reduced.  At the same time the <Col N="1738" /> working staff has been distributed to various provincial centres.</P>
    <P>At a meeting on 5 April 1990 the Government reaffirmed their 1980 decision and decided that An Posts and Telecom Éireann be requested to identify sections from within their organisations for transfer to Dundalk and Waterford and if it was not feasible to transfer the full quota, a reduced level of staff should be sought.  In accordance with that decision I have asked Telecom Éireann to see if they could locate the head office of one of their existing or future subsidiary companies in Waterford.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a constituent who had an accident in August 1984 and who applied to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  Eventually in January of this year they sent his solicitor the offer of an award.  This was signed by his solicitor and returned within the week.  He has now been told that, all going well, he is in line for payment in or about September 1991 because, at the time of the acceptance of the award, the allocation of £2 million to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal had already been fully committed and a further £1.5 million from future funds had also already been committed.  In my view this is a gross and <Col N="1739" /> total distortion of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal in the context of both their terms of reference and the objectives for which they were set up. The justice of the whole thing is, in my view, totally corrupt by the fact that the funds are not made available to them.  It seems extraordinary, and totally unacceptable, that somebody who had an accident in 1984 should have to wait until September 1991 at best.</P>

    <P>In the case of awards now being paid by the tribunal the delay from date of acceptance to date of payment has been approximately one year.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy that my main and indeed statutory duty as the insurance supervisory authority, is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements. In this regard I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience. There is no legal obligation on any insurer to quote in respect of any risk or class of insurance.  Similarly there is no obligation on a company to quote in any manner or at any particular premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motor insurance is the class of liability insurance which the public at large would most often be seeking to obtain.  The Deputy will be aware that price control was removed by Government in January 1986.  Since then motor insurers are required only to notify my Department of any alterations to their rates.  These <Col N="1698" /> alterations are neither sanctioned nor approved by myself or my Department, they are merely noted.</P>
    <P>Since January 1990, motor insurers have notified my Department of increases in their premiums resulting in an overall increase in rates of 22 per cent on average.  However, I consider it only right to point out that the fundamental cause of high motor insurance prices for all motorists in Ireland is the high claims rate which, regrettably, is on the increase, allied to the high cost of individual claims which is also rising.  In 1989 the number of claims increased by 6.5 per cent and the number of claims as a proportion of the number of vehicles increased by 2 per cent.  In the same year the average cost of claims increased by 12 per cent.  One cannot reasonably expect the price of motor insurance to reduce, or even stabilise in these conditions.</P>
    <P>In 1988, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £48 million on their motor portfolios, the corresponding figure for 1989 was more than double that at £116 million.  Confronted with losses of this magnitude and in order to maintain their viability insurers have considered it necessary to increase their premiums in line with their claims experience.</P>
    <P>While I can assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to improving the environment for insurance generally, Government action of itself will not reduce or stabilise motor insurance costs.  Consumers must play their part by increased awareness of the need for safety.  In this respect I am hopeful that the year long road safety campaign launched recently by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, with the backing of the insurance industry will help to highlight the need for safety awareness and higher driving standards in the minds of our motorists.  This should help reduce the number of accidents on our roads and, ultimately, the number of claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations was launched in September 1986 to reinforce the multilateral trading system and to combat protectionist pressures.  It is scheduled to conclude in December of this year.</P>
      <P>The negotiations are organised into 15 different groups dealing with different aspects of multilateral trade.  All participants may table negotiating proposals in the individual groups.  Ireland's membership of the European Community determines our participation in GATT as part of the EC voting bloc.  The Community has submitted detailed proposals for new trade rules affecting industry in all of the areas under negotiation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that Ireland has had ample opportunity to contribute fully to the development of these proposals through Community procedures, and in particular through the Article 113 Committee which co-ordinates the Community's overall policy at the highest official level, and through the Council of Ministers who decide on the actual negotiating mandates for the Commission in each area.</P>
      <P>Throughout, it has been an Irish objective that the internal liberalisation to be achieved by the Single European Act and the completion of the Internal Market will be reinforced by the achievements of the Uruguay Round in opening up wider international markets for our exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC proposals, currently under negotiation in the GATT, fully reflect Irish objectives from an industrial viewpoint and their adoption will further enhance the capacity of Irish industry to trade successfully abroad.  As a small open economy with a significant trade surplus, an open and fair multilateral trading system is clearly to our advantage. A successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round should give us a clear set of rules for international trade into the next century.  Failure could lead to increased protectionism, particularly in the US, and a likely decline in world <Col N="1701" /> trade, resulting in fewer and less open markets for Irish exports.</P>

      <P>The supply and distribution of motor fuels was the subject of a public inquiry carried out by the Fair Trade Commission.  The interim report on the inquiry was published in September 1989 and I hope that the final report will be submitted to me before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the inquiry included a review of the operation of the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit and Motor Vehicle Lubricating Oil) Order, 1981.  The terms of reference did not explicitly refer to the orders made monthly under the Prices Acts.  However, the interim report said that, in their full report, the Fair Trade Commission would recommend that price control on petrol and motor diesel be removed completely.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the final report I will give consideration to any measures which will lead to an increased level of competition in this sector, including a review of the existing orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The operational programme for industry is an integrated, milti-annual programme covering the five <Col N="1702" /> years 1989-1993.  It was approved by the Commission of the European Communities on 21 December 1989 and copies of the programme were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and placed in the library of the House in January last.</P>
      <P>The programme covers, in the form of nine separate sub-programmes and related measures, the main industrial development activities of the IDA, SFADCo, CTT, the Irish Goods Council, EOLAS, the Office of Science and Technology, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the Irish Productivity Centre and the industrial training activities for which the Department of Labour have the lead responsibility. The programme provides a detailed description of the objectives, activities and projected annual expenditure under each sub-programme and for 41 separate measures.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the programme is undertaken by the agencies already listed.  Progress in relation to implementation is overseen by a monitoring committee chaired by the Department of Industry and Commerce and including representatives of the implementing agencies, Government Departments, the Commission of the European Communities, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industry, Under the programme there is a requirement for this committee to meet at least twice every year and to prepare annual reports on implementation which I will arrange to have placed in the Library of the House when available. The implementation of the programme will also be subjected to objective external evaluation by consultants to be engaged by the Department of Industry and Commerce in consultation with the Commission and reporting to the monitoring committee. It is anticipated that the consultants will be appointed within the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moneys available to Ireland under the programme are in ECUs and were committed as part of the Community Support Framework agreed between Ireland and the Commission in October <Col N="1703" /> 1989.  The total commitment under the industry programme amounts to 1,019 million ECUs.  Of that amount 534 million ECUs are committed under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and 485.5 million ECUs are committed under the European Social Fund (ESF).  In Irish punt terms these figures amount approximately to a total of £794 million made up of £416 million to ERDF moneys and £378 million of ESF moneys.</P>
    <P>The conditions which apply to funding under the programme are set out in annex 5 of the programme, copies of which, as I have indicated already, were laid before the House and placed in the Library of the House in January last.  A final version of this annex has subsequently been forwarded by the Commission, a copy of which I will arrange to have conveyed to the Deputy, and copies will also be placed in the Library of the House.  The conditions are of a detailed and technical nature to a large extent and include the requirements and proposals of the Commission in relation to accounting and payment procedures, financial control, monitoring and evaluation procedures, information and publicity observation of Community policies, supplementary information requirements and so on.</P>

      <P>As regards companies which owe money to Fóir Teoranta, the company took a decision in 1982 not to publish details of client firms as this might <Col N="1704" /> damage the credit standing of such firms. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to give information in respect of such companies.</P>
      <P>Information as to the amounts owing to Fóir as at the balance sheet dates are set out in its annual reports and accounts which are available in the Library of the House, the most recent being that for the year ended 31 December 1989 which was published on 23 October 1990.  As of 30 September 1990, the total owned to Fóir, less provisions was £11.8 million being £10.6 million in loans and £1.2 million in investments.</P>
      <P>As regards the amount of interest due on loans, as indicated in the annual accounts, it is not the company's policy to accrue interest on loans; it is accounted for when received.</P>
      <P>Fóir Teoranta is at present winding down though it continues to be responsible for collecting all outstanding amounts due to it.  The company will be abolished at the end of the winding down period and its assets and liabilities, including its portfolio of loans and investments, will be transferred to the Industrial Credit Corporation plc under the terms of the Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Bill, 1990, which is at present before the House.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 47 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> Under Section 11 (2) (b) of the Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompair Eireann) Act, 1986 the directors of Dublin Bus are appointed by the Chairman of CIE, with my consent.  Following the resignation of the managing director of Dublin Bus, the vacancy was advertised extensively by CIE both externally and within the CIE group of companies. There was a large number of applicants for the position, including internal applicants, other Irish applicants and applicants from the UK.  Following a comprehensive selection process, the successful candidate was unanimously selected by a sub-committee of the board of CIE, including the chairman, and unanimously endorsed by the board of CIE.  I have given my consent to the appointment.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals under consideration for the privatisation of Dublin Bus.</P>

      <P>Arising from my recent decision to authorise CIE to incur expenditure of up to £18 million on new diesel railcars, I have been informed by the chairman of CIE that the construction of these railcars at Inchicore, or alternatively, their acquisition from other sources is being considered by the company.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive proposals in this regard from the board shortly.  The matter will then be the subject of detailed discussions between CIE and my Department.</P>
