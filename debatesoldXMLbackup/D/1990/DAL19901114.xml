    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this section there is an anomaly which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister. This Bill deals with secondary teachers, primary teachers, and teachers in community and comprehensive schools but the pensions of the 6,500 TUI members in the vocational sector are dealt with by the Department of the Environment.  Is there any way in which the Minister could address this problem?  It creates problems for local authorities in that where a regional college is set up in an area the local authority will be in funds for a period but there is a major difficulty for them when pensions fall due.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point that emerged during the relatively non-contentious Second Stage debate was that it had taken so long to put the pension arrangements of teachers on a sound statutory basis.  It is to the Minister's credit that she is the one who has put it on a statutory basis.  Doubts arise however &mdash; I put this to her at the time &mdash; that other aspects of the Department's work, for example, the payment of teachers who are employed by private institutions but paid by the State, might not have clear statutory authority.  Will the Minister indicate if she has any plans to introduce legislation to put other aspects of her Department's work on a sound statutory basis?  This should be done so that educational policy can be debated in the House and that there be accountability to the House for it.  The only way to develop such a policy is to debate it in the House.  Everyone has a contribution to make in this area and democratically elected politicians have a constructive role to play.  I hope the Minister will give a commitment to introduce, at an early date, a comprehensive education Bill. My party have initiated work with the aid of senior legal people on the drafting of such a Bill.  If the Minister is in any sense tardy in introducing her legislation our work will serve to contribute usefully in this area.  Such a Bill should have clear objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Ahern, Browne and O'Shea, spoke strongly in favour of the introduction of early retirement for teachers. This relates to the Bill in that we are talking about pension arrangements for teachers.  Obviously some teachers will not retire early and make places available for younger teachers many of whom are trained in the most up to date educational techniques available.  They have to leave the country.  However other teachers who were trained perhaps as long ago as 30 years are staying on in schools reluctantly. They would wish to retire but cannot do so because of the pension <Col N="1359" /> arrangements.  It is important to introduce early retirement.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries about tabling an amendment to the Bill to give the Minister power to introduce early retirement but I was advised that it would probably be ruled out of order and that it was likely the Minister had power to do this anyway. Obviously there was no point in pursuing that course so I am raising it now on the section.  Will the Minister confirm that she has power to introduce early retirement and will she give an indication of her intention in this regard?  I know that the introduction of early retirement has cost implications.  It is not something that could be done without taking account of the cost but it would be a valuable initiative from an educational point of view and one which would be much appreciated by young unemployed teachers many of whom have had to emigrate or are contemplating emigration in order to find employment.  They are a great loss to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As there is no amendment to the Bill in a specific sense I will reply in a broad way to the two points raised by Deputy John Bruton.  He raised a point about the statutory basis for education in general.  At a public interview in August last I made my intention very clear about this.  I see the very strong need for an education Act and I said so five months ago.  I am awaiting reports from the OECD, and Dr. Tom Murphy, which addressed this matter.  However, I can say I do intend to proceed along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that there is a need for wide ranging national, if you like, legislative debate on education.  This matter tends to crop up only when debates such as this arise or within the sporadic sparring exchanges that take place within the limited time available to us at Question Time.  At best that is quite unsatisfactory with regard to any discussion on education, none of which allows for in-depth analysis, debate or fruitful interaction between the various groups of people about the true basis of <Col N="1360" /> education and the need for an education Act.  The short answer is: yes, I hope to proceed in that direction.  I thank the Deputy for his co-operative words and gestures today.</P>
    <P>The second point he raised was that of early retirement.  The Deputy asked me to confirm that I had that right.  I confirm that I have.  The age and conditions under which teachers may retire with a pension and lump sums are contained in schemes implemented under the provisions of the 1928 Act.  In the case of national teachers the relevant paragraph is paragraph 11 of the national school teachers' superannuation scheme of 1929.  In respect of secondary teachers the relevant paragraph is paragraph 18 of the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme of 1929.  Both schemes were implemented under the existing legislative provisions contained in the Teachers Superannuation Act, 1928 and can be amended by Ministers for Education with the consent of Ministers for Finance.  Therefore, the House will see that further legislative powers are not required.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other points raised by Deputies John Bruton and O'Shea &mdash; which correctly do not arise under this Bill &mdash; I can say they will be given consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Deputy Bruton referred to the fact that early retirement would cost money, which is true of course.  However, there is another cost involved in this.  There are teachers, teaching at this moment, who embarked on a completely different career when they joined the profession. Circumstances have changed so much in the interim that it amounts almost to cruelty to expect them to continue fulfilling a role they never set out to fulfil. Indeed, there is a more costly aspect altogether to this in that children being taught by teachers who are unhappy lose out as well.  We must remember that everybody is given one opportunity only to be educated.  Therefore, we should do everything possible to ensure that that one opportunity pupils receive is to their maximum benefit.  We must remember <Col N="1361" /> also that, if that is not the case, it is not the fault of some teachers who may have grown somewhat older or who grew up in an era in which there was quietness and discipline in class.  It is unfair to ask them to continue in present circumstances to fulfil an impossible role. Many of our children may have to emigrate, despite our best efforts.  Nonetheless, the least we can give them is the best possible educational opportunity in their school years.  Even if there is extra cost involved the Minister should balance that against the cost of not doing anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I might raise two brief points and refer again to the position of teachers in the vocational sector.  The TUI have no rights to negotiate pensions on behalf of their members.  They cannot negotiate at the teachers' conciliation council or at the local government staff negotiation board.  This is unfair and anomalous.  I would ask the Minister to examine this matter within whatever context is open to her.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to raise is that while national teachers can retire after 35 years service the same does not obtain with regard to teachers in the second level sector.  This anomaly should be dealt with effectively and urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Teachers in the vocational sector are employees of local government, now the Department of the Environment.  I understand that is the ambit or sphere within which they wish their duties and activities to remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter the Deputy raised was the difference in years service, the age at which a national teacher can retire as compared with his or her counterpart in second-level.  If ever an effort or start is to be made at examining this issue of early retirement &mdash; it is a hypothetical position &mdash; that anomaly would have to <Col N="1362" /> be addressed before one could progress further.  I take the Deputy's point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point the Minister has not dealt with is that the TUI have no forum at which they can negotiate with regard to their members' pensions. Can something be done about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In a general way it is not relevant to this Bill.  However, the point the Deputy is making is relevant since we are dealing with superannuation. The point the Deputy is making is that those people do not have, if you like, a court of redress.  I will bear that aspect in mind in any further discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a question to the Minister.  Members of the TUI teaching in vocational schools &mdash; I think it was back in 1976 when I was a relatively young teacher and when pensions and superannuation were not then my priorities &mdash; were given an option, in that we had to sign a document stating whether we would opt to receive our superannuation award and reduced pension if we opted for early retirement for whatever reason; or whether we opted to leave all such rewards until we had reached the statutory age of retirement which was then 65.  Does that proviso still stand?  Is there any leeway in the provisions of the Bill to deal with that? At that time many teachers did not fully realise its implications.  I know of many teachers who, if early retirement was introduced, might opt for it.  However, were they tied to an option they chose at that time &mdash; to defer any payment or pension until the statutory retirement age &mdash; it would lead to an inequality.  How do TUI members stand in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>While I know it is up to the Ceann Comhairle to decide, I might say that all of these matters have nothing to do with the Bill before us.  But, as they are educational matters I will seek to get the information Deputy Ahearn has requested.  However, I should like to inform her that in 1976 the statutory basis <Col N="1363" /> of the code was changed to enable the Minister for Finance to devise schemes amending the superannuation terms of civil servants and have such schemes ratified or confirmed by the Oireachtas. Similar statutory provisions were introduced for local authority employees, including vocational teachers, under the Local Government Superannuation Act, 1980.  While that may not fully answer Deputy Ahearn's question, in that she asked whether such teachers were still tied to the option they chose as young teachers, I will endeavour to get an answer for her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a point on Second Stage in regard to caretakers in national schools.  Has the Minister any plans to include caretakers in national schools in pension schemes?  I might add they are the only group working within the national school sector who have not got a pension scheme.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> In page 3, line 21, in the definition of &ldquo;marine&rdquo;, after &ldquo;sea&rdquo; to insert&ldquo;, sea-floor&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a definition amendment dealing with the term &ldquo;marine&rdquo;.  In the Bill as passed by the Seanad, &ldquo;marine&rdquo; was defined as, &ldquo;of, in, near, concerned with or belonging to the sea and tidal waters, inhabiting, found or got from the sea or from non-tidal waters&rdquo;.  There is a need in this Bill to define &ldquo;marine&rdquo; and to define the seas in a way which recognises the fact that the body of water to which we normally refer as the sea is part of the total system which incorporates not just the waters but the sea bed and the air as well.  I propose to extend the definition of &ldquo;marine&rdquo; to include the sea floor, and there are a number of immediate practical reasons that definition should apply.</P>
    <P>First, we already have a number of examples where, as the land based resources are expiring, exploration is taking place on the resources of the sea floor.  A typical example of this would be the extent of oil exploration which is taking place.  It seems that an institute which is being established for marine research should have as its brief the research into areas related to the sea floor.  We have had a number of examples of dumping.  Much concern has been expressed about the possibility, for example, that nuclear wastes may be embedded in the sea floor and the implication that has for us.  We know the big military blocs have a considerable interest in the sea floor and that they are doing quite an amount of research on it. We know also that we need to know what is taking place on the sea floor.  For example, the mid-Atlantic ridge, which would have some relevance for us, is fairly volcanic and I think it would be appropriate that we know what is happening there.</P>
    <P>The amendment is to extend the definition of &ldquo;marine&rdquo;.  I do not imagine it should be a very controversial proposal to include the sea floor as well as the body of water we normally refer to as the sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West</i>): I am opposed to this amendment and I will outline my reasons.  In my view &ldquo;marine&rdquo; is defined in the Bill to mean &ldquo;of, in, near, concerned with or belonging to the sea and tidal waters, inhabiting, found or got from the sea or from non-tidal waters&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since I feel the definition is sufficiently comprehensive to allow the institute, when established, to address all relevant issues in a very meaningful way, I cannot see my way to accept this amendment, because &ldquo;marine&rdquo; is already covered in that part of the section.  If I were to accept that amendment it would be stating what is already included in the Bill.  For that reason, in my view, there is no need to include the amendment set out by Deputy Gilmore.  I can accept what Deputy Gilmore is stating, but what he requires is already comprehensively covered and dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two observations. First, I do not propose to take up the time of the House pressing something if the Minister states that the sea floor is already incorporated in the definition provided in the Bill, but this is important legislation.  It is not likely to set the passions of the nation on fire, and I hope the Minister's straight off rejection of the very first non-contentious amendment on this Bill is not going to set the tone for the debate or that we are going to have amendments rejected purely for the sake of rejecting them.  We could make the same argument as the Minister for including the amendment in the Bill.  If it is not included in the definition already there, why not have it expressly stated? However, it is not something I want to press.  I understand the Minister has said that the sea floor is already incorporated in the definition of &ldquo;marine&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, line 25, in the definition of &ldquo;research and development&rdquo; after <Col N="1366" />&ldquo;social sciences,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;hydrography and oceanography,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like this section to be elaborated by extending the definition to include research and development and social sciences and to include also hydrography and oceanography.  Both of these are extremely important.  The research and development aspect of it is highly important so it is necessary that this insertion be made at this stage.  Research in relation to this entire area is vital for the co-ordinated future of the marine industry, and the marine institute should have the power to involve itself in that type of work.  Hydrography and oceanography are not included.  We have very valuable assets around our coast and we know very little about the larger ocean around our coast and are relying on information from other countries about what is out there. That is particularly unsatisfactory when there is anything of value out there, particularly minerals.  The institute can do fine work in this area.  It is important that that is specified in this section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> If we were to outline every field in detail it would not fit in this Bill without resulting in many more pages.  In defining areas of development and research one can only outline in broad terms.  In the Bill &ldquo;research and development&rdquo; includes research in all pure and applied sciences, including economics and social sciences, investigations, tests, experiments, analysis and other studies and the application of science and technology to innovation and development.  What is outlined there is broad enough to cover the specific areas which the Deputy has in mind.  Its interpretation of &ldquo;research and development&rdquo; is sufficiently broad to take in the areas outlined by her.  The disciplines in question will be addressed by the institute under the Bill as drafted.  I want to assure the Deputy very forcibly that the disciplines she has in mind will certainly be tackled.  For that reason I am satisfied that what is in the amendment is already covered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 33, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the headquarters of the Institute shall be established in Galway&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> This is an extremely important amendment. Since we initially discussed this Bill in the House on Second Stage an important development has taken place in that Dr. Tony Ryan set up the Martin Ryan University Foundation and allocated over £5 million for the development of a marine institute in Galway University.  This is a major development. It is very important that the Department of the Marine and all the bodies involved in this area should get together in one place.  We now have a major development taking place in Galway University, possibly more ambitious than was considered initially.  I would like to take this opportunity of complimenting Dr. Tony Ryan on his initiative in relation to this matter and also Dr. Colm Ó hEocha of UCG who has done everything to further this development both with the sponsor concerned and the European Community. This is very significant and I believe this is an opportune time for the Minister and for this House to recognise the project that is taking place there.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity for the Minister, along with University College Galway, to locate the Marine Institute in Galway.  There would be no difficulty in locating it in this new building in University College Galway.  It is particularly significant, seeing that in University College Galway there is an extensive group of people &mdash; about 38 people in all, I gather &mdash; from many faculties working in marine-related areas.  This will draw together all of these people in the one base in Galway.  This is a real opportunity and it is vital that we consider this matter seriously in this House and not just dismiss it or treat it in a casual, bureaucratic way that there is a tendency to do within the House.  There is a real opportunity for the Minister to react in a positive way and for the Department, the university and private interests to get together and do a very good job in relation to marine research and to putting together a very solid marine institute.  I strongly support the idea of basing the institute in Galway.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on Second Stage I understood there would be some developments but I never believed they would be quite <Col N="1369" /> as ambitious or as significant as what will take place.  This is a major step forward for all marine based industry in Ireland and it is an opportunity for us in this House to make a positive response.  I commend this amendment to the House and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Taylor-Quinn to agree to my amendment for the simple reason that I do not want to get into a Galway versus Cork situation as it would be wrong to do so.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn has made a very good case for Galway but I could make an equally good case for Cork, and I am sure Deputy Eamon Gilmore could do the same for Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is a much broader one.  It ties in with the Government's decentralisation programme and I am sure the Minister will give recognition to that fact.  There is a case to be made for taking a department like the Marine Institute out of the capital, Dublin.  A very important feature of my amendment is that it specifically refers to a maritime county.  There is a lot of sense in that type of approach.  I have no doubt that many counties and cities will be promoting their area as the one for that type of development but I would ask that the matter be looked at in a broader sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, UCC have done tremendous work in maritime development.  Since Cork has a major port and everything going for it, it would probably be the ideal place to locate this institute.  This is a major development in Government policy and we should look at it in the broader sense.  While we accept that it would be more suited to some areas than to others, the Minister should consider my amendment.  I would also ask Deputy Taylor-Quinn to accept the amendment because it does not take from her case.  I am making my case for Cork and I have no doubt Deputy Gilmore will do the same for his area.  I hope the Minister <Col N="1370" /> will recognise that the institute should be located outside Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Bill is the place to decide the location of the headquarters of the Marine Institute but no doubt the debate on its location will make interesting local reading.  First we have to look at what exactly is being proposed here.  To listen to Deputy Taylor-Quinn and Deputy O'Sullivan you would think that the Marine Institute Bill was going to create an enormous centre of marine research but unfortunately that is far from the case.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage, this Bill proposes to establish an administrative umbrella for existing research activity. The Minister, on Second Stage, said the intention is that the Marine Institute, so far as it would carry out research, would be a multi-campus institution with its many faceted areas of research taking place in different locations &mdash; in Carna, Abbotstown or wherever.  All we are talking about here is an administrative office.  To judge from the functions the Government see the Marine Institute having, I do not imagine it will be a very big or very well populated office.  I do not see it as the kind of prize that is normally sought after by Deputies for their respective constituencies.</P>
      <P>The second point I would like to make is that there is a necessity for the Marine Institute to have a degree of independence, not just from the Department of the Marine and the Government but also from the universities or the agencies and bodies which will be part of the institute or which will come under its aegis one way or other.  I see a great danger that the Marine Institute will be overly associated with one university, research body or whatever, and that might have the effect of undermining its independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third issue I want to deal with is decentralisation.  When decentralisation is mentioned people usually mean dispatching a number of civil servants to offices outside Dublin without any reference to the decentralisation of functions. Later we will be debating the fact <Col N="1371" /> that the Department of the Marine intend to hold onto the purse strings, to all the meaningful functions and all the policy areas in relation to marine research.  I would much prefer if the functions relating to marine research and development were devolved to the Marine Institute. That, in my view, is real decentralisation rather than dispatching a number of public servants to Galway, Cork or wherever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I respectfully suggest that the matters to which he refers now are dealt with rather extensively in section 4.  That section deals with the general functions of the institute and those remarks might be left until we come to that section.  This section is a short one dealing with the establishment of the institute as such, but the functions are dealt with extensively in section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the distinction but I am specifically addressing Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment in which he is seeking that the offices be located outside Dublin.  I am questioning the logic behind the general desire to locate offices outside Dublin because I do not think there is a case for it.  Indeed from a constituency point of view I had a certain attraction to the formula proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan, that the offices be located outside Dublin because I thought Dún Laoghaire would be considered to be outside Dublin until I saw that the reference is to the County of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the location of the headquarters of the Marine Institute, if not already occupying the mind of the Minister, will be doing so in the not too distant future.  I would like to make the case for the headquarters to be situated in Dún Laoghaire.  There is a number of very strong reasons for that.  First, the Maritime Museum, and the headquarters of the existing Maritime Institute, are already located there.  BIM are also located there and the harbour of Dún Laoghaire is owned by the Department <Col N="1372" /> of the Marine.  There is an international dimension to be considered because it is quite clear from the Bill that it is intended the Marine Institute will have an international dimension, particularly in relation to European funding and relationships with European research. Dún Laoghaire is ideally placed to fulfil those needs.  It is something the Minister will have to consider.  I do not support the amendments tabled by Deputies Taylor-Quinn and Gerry O'Sullivan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting listening to the special pleadings by Deputies Taylor-Quinn and Gilmore to have this institute situated in their constituencies; it says a lot about the way politics work here.  The Marine Institute should be set up in the best possible location to give service to the community in general.  All things being equal it should be outside Dublin.  The purpose behind Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment is good as he is not trying to ingratiate himself with his constituents.  He is genuinely trying to put into operation some of the principles all political parties espouse &mdash; decentralisation.  However, if decentralisation interferes with the efficiency and the proper running of the institute then, unfortunately, it will have to be situated in a major population centre, perhaps Dublin.  This is not the time or place to make this decision and, consequently, I do not support either of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I listened with interest to the points made by Deputies Taylor-Quinn, Gerry O'Sullivan, Gilmore and Garland.  I will certainly carefully consider all the points made by them with regard to the location of the headquarters of the institute. However, having said that, the location of the headquarters is not a matter that should be enshrined or specified in legislation and it normally is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to make the point that the institute is primarily an institutional arrangement and, as I indicated in the Seanad and in my reply to the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, it is first a means <Col N="1373" /> whereby the existing areas of marine research, which are divided over a number of locations, would be co-ordinated instead of having a bricks and mortar structure.  It is a co-ordinating effort in a very meaningful way, which is the purpose of the legislation.  It will be a State body with a large measure of Exchequer funding.  Its independence has already been referred to by Deputy Gilmore and it must be looked at in that context.  There must be accountability to the Minister and the Dáil for the reasons I have just outlined.  Indeed, I join Deputy Taylor-Quinn is welcoming the Martin Ryan development in Galway and we look forward to fruitful co-operation between the Marine Institute and the Ryan Institute in Galway when the Marine Institute is established.</P>
    <P>The institute is a co-ordinating body to bring together all the different trends in and areas of marine research and development instead of just having a building.  As I said, it would be inappropriate to outline in legislation where the headquarters should be.  Nevertheless, the points raised by Deputies will be carefully considered when the time comes to make a decision in regard to the headquarters.  I assure the House that the best decision will be made and that the best location will be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the reaction to my amendment.  I compliment Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan for making a strong case for Cork in such a skilful manner.  Deputy Gilmore also made an excellent case.  He has obviously benefited from his days in UCG and from his trade union negotiation experience. He went into the reasons for there not being a need for a specific place as it was just an administrative umbrella for research and he elaborated on the need for independence of the Department and the other relevant bodies.  He also spoke about the decentralisation of functions rather than the decentralisation of people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>However, he ended by making a case for Dún Laoghaire and so he contradicted himself as constituency factors came into play.  I agree with Deputy Garland's comment that the institute should be put in the best place possible to give service to the nation.  He also referred to parochialism in terms of talking about one's own constituency. I should like to remind Deputy Garland that Clare is my constituency &mdash; not Galway West &mdash; and I am not pushing anything for my constituency.  I am putting a case in the best interests of servicing the nation.</P>
      <P>Part of the difficulty in relation to marine matters is that there are so many bits and pieces scattered right across the country.  That is one of the defects in the industry and part of the reason for it not developing to its full potential or as significantly as it should over the years. It is also part of the reason why, within the European system and within our negotiations in Europe, we are not in a strong position because we have not engaged in as much research as other countries on whom we have relied for information.  Within the fishing industry there are so many different types of fishermen and organisations that there is no co-ordination.  As a small island we should get our act together, once and for all, and develop proper co-ordination and management, which we have not done to date.  There is a real opportunity to do that in conjunction with the development taking place in UCG and it will be unfortunate if we do not do so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments are taking place in the EC and the fish quotas will be reviewed in 1992.  We do not have the back-up, research or support mechanisms as other countries.  The result is that we are at a disadvantage.  While we remain split and scattered in relation to marine development we will not have a forceful progressive industry.  By comparison to the unity in areas like agriculture and the modern technological industries there is division in marine matters.  Unity brings strength.  We have a real opportunity here to create a unified approach.  I do not doubt that the Minister will examine the <Col N="1375" /> position to try to make the best possible decision but I do not believe that the Department will consider this with a view to change.  They will not delegate some of their powers thus diminishing their importance.  When it comes to brass tacks, in the bureaucracy, individuals will want to maintain their position and standing and they will not confront the bottom line.  I am disappointed with the attitude expressed in the House today.  I can appreciate some of the views expressed but until we pull together we will not go anywhere in relation to marine matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the argument to develop into a parochial debate.  I accept that the Minister will look at all the aspects of the location of the Marine Institute.  This is not just a transfer of civil servants from one location to another.  We are talking about the development of a major resource. The Marine Institute will be very important in the future.  The marine industry is our last great natural resource and the location of the institute is very important and that is why the amendment is down. I accept that there is a certain amount of political lobbying in relation to locating various Departments.  However, my amendment has given recognition to all aspects in relation to the location of the institute.  The establishment of this institute is probably one of the major forward steps of the Government in the last ten years in the development of our marine industry.  In the light of the guarantee the Minister has given that he will look at all aspects carefully, I accept that the institute will be located in the best available place.  I have no doubt that between now and the time the location is announced there will be much political lobbying with regard to the location of this institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Gilmore, this is not just a transfer of civil servants and an administration block.  I feel very strongly on this issue.  It has been indicated that a fairly high level of funding will be given to the institute, and given that and the <Col N="1376" /> guarantee given by the Minister, I am sure it will be located in the best possible place.  Galway will make a case as will Cork and I will also make a strong case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me clear up a couple of things, first the question of simply relocating civil servants.  I dearly wish this institute to be something a lot more substantial than simply relocating a number of civil servants to Galway, Cork or wherever. Unfortunately, and this will become apparent as we debate the Bill, the institute as it is proposed, will amount to no more than that.</P>
      <P>For Deputy Garland's benefit, I make no apology whatever for staking the claim of my own constituency to be the headquarters of the Marine Institute.  I am sure many Deputies, as Deputy O'Sullivan has said, will be doing that in the course of the next months.  It is part of the process of public representation.  I do it in the House, I do it openly and I do not dress it up in a sophisticated formula by way of an amendment to the Bill.  Since the criterion that has been advanced by everybody else is the &ldquo;best location&rdquo; argument, I contend that my consitituency is the best location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with this argument about the &ldquo;outside Dublin&rdquo; case that Deputies who have spoken here have advanced.  Does this argument stand up?  I have, in another amendment which I do not propose to debate now, listed the bodies already engaged in marine research, who will have to be catered for by the Marine Institute.  There are 11 such bodies, eight of whom are Dublin based.  We are talking about establishing a marine institute which will incorporate these bodies. Deputies have talked about the need for co-ordination, for greater contact and efficiency and so on.  Eight of the 11 existing agencies dealing with marine research are based in Dublin.  How does one argue then that the location for the headquarters of the co-ordinating body should be removed from Dublin?  I accept that some bodies are based in different parts of the country, but it is clear that the majority are Dublin-based.  What this comes down to, and it should be called <Col N="1377" /> what it is, is a latent anti-Dublin prejudice and bias, that so often breaks out and is then wrapped up in a cloak of respectability called decentralisation. There is nothing other than that behind it.  If one is talking about the best location for the headquarters of the Marine Institute, clearly the best location is in a position where it can co-ordinate effectively and efficiently the bodies that are already doing research.</P>

      <P>It does not look as if I will win if I do, but I feel strongly about it.  There is no such thing as an anti-Dublin bias in relation to this proposal, and Deputy Gilmore knows that.  While the Deputy has made a great argument for the Dublin-Dún Laoghaire scenario in relation to the number of agencies based in Dublin, the number does not compare with the number of faculties out of UCG working in the marine-related area.  The combination of all of those in UCG would supersede the eight agencies that Deputy Gilmore talked about.  I do not accept the Deputy's argument.  I am not arguing the case for my constituency; I honestly believe, in relation to marine development, here, that my suggestion is the best possible one.  I appreciate that the institute is only the pulse and that other areas will branch out from there and will not necessarily be based there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we have one central place well equipped with a modern computer system and technology which can relate important information to other interests right across the country.  I believe that University College, Galway, is very important in this respect and that the pulse of the Marine Institute, as proposed in the Bill, would be of tremendous benefit to the marine sector if based in Galway.  To do what I suggest will take courage and gumption and will ruffle the system but I ask the Minister to take the bull by the horns and to seriously consider locating the pulse of the Marine Institute in Galway.  Great developments could take place and all marine related activities <Col N="1378" /> could have a great future if the institute is based in Galway.  I am making a special plea to the Minister to take this matter in hand.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Institute shall incorporate the marine research and technology functions currently undertaken by the following institutions or parts of institutions as appropriate:</P>
      <P>(a)  The Fisheries Research Centre,</P>
      <P>(b)  The Salmon Research Trust,</P>
      <P>(c)  The Central Fisheries Board,</P>
      <P>(d)  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara,</P>
      <P>(e)  The Shellfish Laboratory at Carna,</P>
      <P>(f)  Eolas,</P>
      <P>(g)  The Marine Research vessel <i>Lough Beltra</i>,</P>
      <P>(h)  The Marine Ecology section of the Geological Survey Office,</P>
      <P>(i)  The Hydraulics Research Laboratory at U.C.C.,</P>
      <P>(j)  The Department of the Environment, and</P>
      <P>(k)  Údarás na Gaeltachta.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With this amendment I hope to flush out whether the Marine Institute is going to be a small administrative office effectively operating as an umbrella over existing research activity and research bodies or a bureaucratic layer inserted between the people doing the research and the Department of the Marine who will control the purse strings.  It has to be said that a great deal of marine research is already being carried out and the bodies listed in the amendment are testimony to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should consider where the idea of <Col N="1379" /> a marine institute came from.  Proposals were made back in the seventies; for example, the OECD proposed that there should be a marine institute and one surfaced in the 1987 Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  The previous Government established a task force under Mr. Manahan to examine and report on the establishment of a marine institute.  The Manahan task force involved people already involved in research, a representative cross-section of expert opinion.  In their report they made a number of very clear recommendations which, unfortunately, have not been honoured in the Bill before us.  One of the specific recommendations made was that the Marine Institute, when established, should incorporate the different bodies already engaged in research and should not simply be a kind of umbrella; in other words, it should incorporate the Fisheries Research Centre, the Central Fisheries Board, UCG and all the other bodies which would continue to work separately but incorporated in a single Marine Institute which would be the marine research and development body in the country.</P>
    <P>If the House will bear with me I would like to quote from this report.  It states specifically:</P>
    <P>The Institute should, as a minimum, incorporate the research and technology functions currently undertaken by the following institutions, or parts of institutions as appropriate.</P>
    <P>It goes on to list them, and they are as listed in my amendment.  The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>It is inherent in the foregoing that the Institute should assure control of the related staff.  Since elements of third level institutions associated with them could not be integrated into the Institute special arrangements will be necessary for the activities of these to be linked into its co-ordination functions. These would include particularly, but not exclusively, such elements as the Shell Fish Laboratory at Carna, the Hydraulics Research <Col N="1380" /> Laboratory at UCC.  The Institute should also encompass and integrate other relevant R and D facilities and programmes which will be required both immediately and in the long term, such as a national data centre for all Irish marine data, the Irish involvement in a European centre for marine science and technology, when established, and an Irish centre for coastal zone management.  It should be ensured that all new activities and the filling of gap areas fall within the control of the Institute.  Failure to so arrange could bring about a return to the fragmentation situation which has so inhibited the development of the marine resources and fisheries areas to date.</P>
    <P>The task force quite clearly identified that the fragmentation which currently exists is one of the impediments operating against the co-ordination of research activity and saw as the solution the establishment of a marine institute incorporating these bodies.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill, for example, for the transfer of staff between these bodies and the institute.  However, no provision is made in the Bill for the transfer of functions.  The purpose of the Bill as it stands is to establish a Marine Institute which will operate at one remove from the people actually carrying out the research, it will not incorporate them, and I fail to see how it will be able to co-ordinate or advance policy unless it incorporates these bodies.  I appreciate that when one talks about amalgamation and the incorporation of bodies into a larger institution we are in danger of treading upon sensitivities and it would seem that the Minister is taking the line of least resistance; rather than run the risk of incurring the displeasure of some people in some of these institutions he has taken the line of least resistance and is going to establish a loose body to oversee their work, but far from facilitating them, it may become a bureaucratic impediment to these bodies carrying out their normal work.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Manahan task <Col N="1381" /> force included many people from these bodies so the idea of incorporating their functions would not be entirely alien to them.  It is essential that we decide whether the Marine Institute is going to be a loose administrative body or if it will be, as the task force originally intended, a proper single research and development body for marine activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am certainly opposed to this amendment which is inappropriate.  Let me outline my reasons.  There are sufficient mechanisms available to allow the transfer of staff and functions to the institute and these will be used after the proper consultation processes have been gone through.  I am sure Deputy Gilmore knows better than anyone else that proper consultation has to take place.  It is not my intention to use a big stick or to force anybody into a situation without proper consultation taking place and proper explanations being outlined.  I am sure Deputy Gilmore understands what I am talking about.  I would like to remind the Deputy that the Bill is an enabling measure.</P>
      <P>In relation to the staffing of the institute the Minister for the Marine is empowered to transfer his own staff to the institute.  In relation to staff from other agencies, there will be detailed consultation between my Department, my Minister and other Ministers regarding staff numbers and functions to be transferred, first, to the Department of the Marine after agreement has been reached.  I should like to emphasise that no big stick will be used.  Consultation will take place and everything will be taken into consideration.  Such staff will subsequently be transferred to the institute under the terms of the Bill when enacted but not until there has been due consideration and consultation.  That is how the Government have operated successfully. Agreement will be reached by consensus rather than by dictation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reject Deputy Gilmore's notion that the institute will be another bureaucratic layer.  That will certainly not be the case.  The Department of the Marine are not taking the line of <Col N="1382" /> least resistance but are taking the line of reasonable negotiations by bringing everybody together by consensus.  This legislation will bring effective management to bear on an area which needs co-ordination because up to now there has been fragmentation.  I am satisfied that the Bill as drafted is adequate to meet the needs of the Marine Institute and will enable, after appropriate consultation, the transfer of further staff and functions to the institute.  This is the first serious effort to end the fragmentation which we all acknowledge exists.</P>
    <P>Regarding the functions of the institute, the Bill outlines in detail what the institute can do.  Staff will be transferred as appropriate to the institute and the various functions will be outlined.  It is not proper to enshrine that in legislation This is not the Minister taking the line of least resistance.  The Deputy should know this, the Bill addresses the serious problem of fragmentation.  I appreciate the view expressed by Deputy Taylor-Quinn that it was important when coming up to a review of the Common Fisheries Policy that we should have all the results of all available research.  The Bill will enable us get those results.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate forcibly the importance of the legislation which will give the institute independence.  It will be a State body with a large measure of Exchequer funding and under the control of the Minister for the Marine.  There has to be accountability.  If there was not proper accountability to the Minister, and the Dáil many Deputies would bring this to the Minister's attention.  I ask Deputy Gilmore to withdraw his amendment for the reasons I have outlined. There are adequate measures in the Bill to deal with the points he has raised. Agreement will be reached by consensus and there will be consultation with all concerned.  The Minister will make the right decision following due consideration and consultation.  I can assure Deputy Taylor-Quinn that this matter will be tackled forcibly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is great to hear that <Col N="1383" /> the Government have been converted to the principle of consensus and consultation. It is an awful pity we did not get it before the Broadcasting Bill was passed but, nevertheless, it is great to hear it and I look forward to all Government legislation being based on the principle of consensus and consultation.</P>
      <P>It is disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that my amendment is in some way at variance with those principles. Where we are talking about the amalgamation of different bodies and the transfer of functions, clearly the bodies concerned, the trade unions representing staff should be fully consulted before any such steps are taken.  Let us look at this area.  When FÁS were established the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO and the National Manpower Service, were incorporated.  When Teagasc were established ACOT and An Foras Talúntais were incorporated into that body.  That is not what is happening here.  In this case 11 different bodies &mdash; and possibly more &mdash; engaged in marine research and development will continue to do their own thing as they have been doing.  The extent to which the Marine Institute will have a co-ordinating role over them is very loose.  The extent to which the Marine Institute will be able to exercise that role is very doubtful given that the finance and, indeed, most of the powers of the institute will continue to be controlled by the Department of the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot find in the Bill any organic way in which the Marine Institute can bring about a co-ordinated approach to marine research and development.  The Minister made reference to the Bill allowing for the transfer of staff and functions. Yes, the Bill does allow for the transfer of staff and section 8 deals with that. Also, section 20 deals with the transfer of property.  I have gone through the Bill a few times and I have not found anything in it which allows for the transfer of functions but, perhaps, I have missed it.  I would like to invite the Minister to tell me where in the Bill there is an allowance for the transfer of functions from existing agencies to the new Marine Institute.  If <Col N="1384" /> the Minister can tell me the provision in the Bill under which it will be possible to transfer functions perhaps I will give some reconsideration to the amendment I have put down.  I certainly was not able to find any provision in the Bill under which the transfer of functions would be allowed and where it was intended that the functions of particular agencies would be transferred to the Marine Institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good amendment.  One of the criticisms I made of the Bill on Second Stage was that it did not have teeth and was very much enabling legislation.  In fact, the Minister's attitude to this amendment confirms that belief even further.  If the institute cannot bring together all the bodies listed here, I wonder what will be the purpose of putting this Bill through the House.  All the bodies listed, bar one, are State and semi-State operations.  The Minister may intend having consensus and consultation on the matter so that it can be resolved but, as we know from experience, the level of consensus and consultation needed to achieve the proposal in this amendment would not be achieved for another 50 years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore and I are very much on the same wavelength in regard to this issue.  In the previous amendment I was concentrating very much on locating everything in one centre in Galway and having that as the nucleus and power base from which everything would emanate. But we are not talking now about physical location.  I believe that unless the institute have the power and the co-ordinating ability to bring all these bodies under their ambit and jurisdiction they will not serve any purpose and we will be back to the position where everything will be scattered all over the place, nobody will be accountable to anybody else and there will be no obligation or onus on them to give information to a central agency, which should be the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some very fine work is being done by the agencies and bodies listed in this amendment and, as I stated on the previous amendment, it is important that they be brought together.  However, it <Col N="1385" /> will take something above the ordinary in terms of approach, attitude and effort on the part of the Minister to do this.  I am not satisfied, given the Minister's reply to this amendment, that he has the will or the strength of purpose to deal with this issue head on.  This is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>This is a very important matter.  This is a tremendous resource but unless there is one co-ordinating body, the institute, we may as well not be in this House today discussing the matter.  This is a major weakness in the Bill.  On the previous amendment I referred to this matter from a location point of view.  This amendment is vitally important and I ask the Minister to accept it and to review what he has already said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little puzzled at the Minister's strong resistance to this amendment because I had assumed that it would be a natural development to include all these bodies in the Bill.  I was more than surprised to hear him say that it was an umbrella body and that this was the first real effort to stop the splintering of the Department.  I would be totally opposed to the use of any big stick &mdash; I do not think Deputy Gilmore would even entertain the thought of anything like that &mdash; to force different bodies to do something they did not want to do. However, I believe that anyone looking at the issue from a common sense point of view would agree that the amendment before us is a natural progression from what is provided in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I am somewhat puzzled at the Minister's strong resistance to this amendment which would give teeth to the Bill and would deal with the kernel of the problem.  If we believe that the Marine Institute is a positive development, something for which we have waited a long time and which will be welcomed by all then I believe it is only natural that the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big stick aspect &mdash; perhaps this is the wrong phrase to use &mdash; is relevant to this amendment.  I support the amendment because it gives teeth to something we felt was necessary for a long time. <Col N="1386" /> Rather than having a talking shop here about the Marine Institute, the incorporation of these amendments into the Bill will mean we will have a positive proposal which we can present to the people as the first major step in developing our natural marine resource.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I want to re-emphasise &mdash; it is important that the Deputies concerned realise this &mdash; that this will be a co-ordinating agency. We all agree that there is fragmentation in marine research and development.  The Government are now tackling that problem and will bring all the agencies under the umbrella of the Marine Institute by way of co-ordination.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore was correct up to a point in what he said about Teagasc and FÁS; the organisations which existed before the new bodies were formed were dismantled.  However, in the case of the Marine Institute, there is no question of dismantling the organisations referred to in the amendment.  Some of their functions may be transferred to the institute but I want to point out clearly that this is not an organisation or a building of bricks and mortar; the function of the institute will be to co-ordinate and bring together the areas which are now carrying out research and development and which are, to a large extent, fragmented.  This is the first serious effort which has been made to resolve this problem, and it will be done.</P>
      <P>There is no dispute about the point made by Deputy Gilmore in regard to a controlling role for the Marine Institute. Indeed, when we come to discuss amendment No. 12 it will be seen that it is the intention to give the institute powers of control and co-ordination of the marine research and development currently being undertaken.  This, again, will end the fragmentation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore asked me to outline where the functions of the Marine Institute are set out in the Bill: they are outlined in section 4.  I am not able to deal with section 4 now but their functions are outlined very clearly in this section and the staff who are transferred will engage <Col N="1387" /> in those functions.  Section 4 deals with the functions of the institute and will enable the institute to look at the work of those organisations and after agreement to take over, where appropriate, some of the functions which are carried out at present by the agencies listed.  I want to emphasise the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;. It is not a question of weakness or the Minister taking the line of least resistance; good tactics are being used to co-ordinate the services and functions carried out by the existing organisations. It will be by agreement.  Many discussions will take place.  By its very nature it is an area which requires protracted discussion and I assure the House that we are not running away from the issue.  We are ensuring that there will be proper co-ordination and that discussions will take place.  At the end of the day we will have a Marine Institute Bill which will be agreed by all concerned.  There are a number of agencies and Ministers involved in this.  I want to ensure that the fragmentation that is taking place will be ended once and for all.  It is to the detriment of the Common Fisheries Policy. We want to co-ordinate the existing agencies so that we will have the best possible research at our finger tips in our review of the Common Fisheries Policy.  I say in all sencerity that we are making a great effort in this area and I ask for the support of the House in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the question I asked which was to state where in the Bill the functions of the existing bodies engaged in research will be transferred to the Marine Institute. I know there is a clause in the Bill which allows the Minister to assign functions to the Marine Institute but there is no specific reference in the Bill to where the Minister may transfer the functions of one of the existing bodies to the Marine Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is proposing the establishment of a body which will have a loose co-ordinating role over the existing research and development bodies performing a <Col N="1388" /> range of functions which are very restricted. They can organise seminars, conferences and lectures.  The Minister referred to a later amendment which he has tabled which would widen the functions of the Marine Institute from co-ordination to control of proposals for marine research and development and so on.  Those bodies which are already doing research will end up with the worst of both worlds.  On the one hand they will continue to perform their research functions separately and, on the other hand, they will have this layer through which they will have to put their proposals for research.  They will have a body which will control it.  Organisations which are quite happily and effectively doing marine research, albeit in a fragmented and uncontrolled way, now having to deal with control from a body of which they will not be a part and in which they may not have any great deal of influence.  That is the worst of both worlds for such organisations.</P>
    <P>The terminology of my amendment is lifted from the task force report &mdash; that it should incorporate the research and technology functions currently undertaken by these institutions.  The task force report was produced by a task force whose representatives included people from University College Cork, University College Galway, the NBST, the Geological Survey Office, Bradán Mara Teoranta, the IIRS and the Fisheries Research Centre and they came up with the recommendation that the Marine Institute should incorporate the functions of the different bodies.  Will the Minister explain why the recommendation of the task force was turned down?  What we have is an off the peg Bill, an emasculation of what was proposed which will not give the punch and the clout that people in the business wanted before the Marine Institute was proposed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to unnecessarily press amendments if there is some way of resolving the difficulty but this is a fundamental issue.  Will the Marine Institute be an umbrella organisation or will it be a body carrying out research in its own right?  In the light of the Minister's later <Col N="1389" /> amendment he may wish to consider whether the Marine Institute should remain as an umbrella body or have real teeth.  If he was prepared to consider that we could return to it on Report Stage.  If he is not prepared to do so we will have to dispose of the question now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Of course the body will have clout and teeth. All that Deputy Gilmore has said will follow by agreement.  All the functions of the other agencies as listed will be considered in consultation with the agencies concerned, with the Departments under whose control they are and with the Ministers concerned.  There has to be negotiation and consultation and everything will follow by agreement.  The detail Deputy Gilmore is anxious for me to enshrine in legislation is not normally enshrined in legislation.  It can be done by order of the Minister.  I am talking about such things as the transfer of the functions from the agencies concerned to the Department of the Marine and thence to the Marine Institute.  The transfer of civil servants or other personnel from the agencies concerned to any Department <Col N="1390" /> must come under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  This will not be easy.  It will involve intricate consultation.  I assure the House that the establishment of the Marine Institute will put an end to fragmentation. That is the purpose of the legislation.  Rather than running away from the issue, we are tackling it head on.  Tough negotiations will have to take place, but only by consultation and consensus can we reach the position which we all want.  We must have legislation that will stand the test of time.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 32 is related to this amendment.  Amendment No. 32 deals with the Schedule to the Bill and the membership of the institute.  I am proposing in the amendment that each of the bodies whose functions or part of whose functions would be incorporated into the institute under section 3 should nominate one member to the institute, who should be appointed by the Minister. The functions of these bodies would be incorporated and the bodies would in turn have the right to nominate the membership of the institute.  Obviously that amendment will fall if the proposal in relation to functions is defeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 6, 9, 11, 24 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations commenced in September 1986 when almost 100 GATT contracting parties agreed, <i>inter alia,</i> to bring greater liberalisation to world trade in agriculture. This agreement specifically involved a commitment to reduce import barriers and to improve the competitive environment by increasing discipline on the use of all direct and indirect subsidies affecting agricultural trade, including the phased reduction of their negative effects.  The European Community is a party to this agreement and has thus been committed to reducing support and protection for agriculture since that time. Ireland, represented by the then Minister for Education, former Deputy Paddy Cooney, was a member of the Community delegation who participated at the meeting in Punta del Este at which this agreement was reached.</P>
    <P>What is now on the table is the precise outlining of the European Community's final position elaborating on a number of more general Community statements made in the intervening negotiating period and all stemming directly from the 1986 commitments.</P>
    <P>The firming up of the Community's final position began with the suggestion by Commissioner MacSharry at the informal QUINT meeting in Ireland in late July that the Community would be prepared to commit itself to a 30 per cent reduction in aggregate support over the ten year period from 1986.  At that time I indicated the strongest possible reservations about the extent of the cut unless it was framed in a way that protected the principles and mechanisms of the CAP and was accompanied by clear guarantees in regard to offsetting complementary measures.  Much of the discussion since then has centred on these precise issues.</P>
    <P>The Commission put forward its formal proposal on 5 October.  This provided for a 30 per cent reduction in support over the ten years from 1986, measured by an aggregate support measurement unit.  The proposal also involved the conversion of the current import levies into tariffs, which would <Col N="1395" /> also be subject to the 30 per cent reduction.  The tariffication proposal was subject to certain conditions including the securing of increased protection against cereal substitutes and other products but only in respect of quantities well in excess of current supply levels.  There was also some implied degree of ambiguity about whether separate concessions might be considered in regard to export refunds.  The proposal was accompanied by no commitment to complementary measures.</P>
    <P>The Council finally reached a decision on the proposal last week after protracted discussion at seven meetings over four weeks.  Significant changes were made in the proposal I have referred to in order to secure agreement: (a) the position that the community's approach is global, that is individual policies cannot be singled out, has been reaffirmed and, in particular, there is a specific Council statement that any separate undertaking on export subsidies would be incompatible with maintaining the fundamental principles of the CAP; (b) a major amendment allowing for a modification of the rate of reduction in border protection was accepted by the Commission which adds greatly to assurances that Community preference against imports will be maintained in the future; (c) the Community's offer is now conditional on equivalent commitments being undertaken by others; (d) any further adaptations to support arrangements that may be necessary will take account of, in particular, the difficult situation of certain categories of producers and certain regions.  In particular, the Commission has stated that it considers that the total level of assistance to the less favoured regions should not be reduced as a result of the implementation of the outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations.  This is a particularly important declaration for Ireland given that 58 per cent of Ireland is already classified as &ldquo;less favoured&rdquo; and this will be increased to about 72 per cent when Community approval is secured for additional areas; (e) effective protection <Col N="1396" /> against imports of cereal substitutes, oil-seeds, etc. will now be secured for quantities above recent average imports. Under the Commission's original proposal, effective protection would only have commenced at average 1986-88 levels plus 8 per cent; (f) the Commission has also undertaken to submit rapidly concrete proposals, supported by appropriate financial solidarity, to ensure a viable future to Community farmers based on <i>inter alia</i> reorientation of support to producers taking as a basis the diversity of the structure of farms and production; reinforcing structural assistance, including production neutral income subsidies, concentrating on producers and regions which have most difficulties in adapting to changes and measures to protect the environment and to improve product quality; (g) the Commission may change the policy measures to be subjected to disciplines in the light of the offers made by other parties in the negotiations.  This would enable the Community to exempt certain support measures from the disciplines being undertaken.</P>
    <P>Given that it was already committed to defining its position for the concluding stages of the negotiations for agriculture, the Community was obliged to submit an offer at this time.  While I would have preferred a less ambitious approach, I believe that considerable safeguards have now been built into the offer which the Community submitted in Geneva last week and in the associated Council and Commission declarations adopted by the Council on 6 November.  The essential conditions which I indicated at the time of the QUINT meeting as being a prerequisite for agreement are largely in place.  In particular, the safeguarding of the fundamental principles of the CAP, the special recognition of the areas and groups of farmers which could be worst affected and the clear commitments to complementary measures are all especially important.  Ireland was among the member states that fought hardest and most successfully for these improvements. Nothing would have been gained &mdash; indeed many of the advances would <Col N="1397" /> have been lost &mdash; by holding out for any longer.</P>
    <P>The GATT negotiations are now in a critical phase.  The community has, in my view, put forward a realistic offer consistent with the international commitments entered into at Punta del Este in 1986 and recognising the realities of agriculture in the EC.  It should ensure that agriculture and the agri-food industry in Ireland and in the Community remains viable and that farm incomes are adequately supported though, perhaps, in a different manner to the one we have been used to up to now.  A successful and balanced conclusion to the GATT round should ensure a much more stable agricultural trading environment in the future than has obtained in the recent past.  In the long run this more stable environment should, provided the undertakings given are honoured, allow for the continued development of our agri-food sector.</P>
    <P>Given the commitments entered into in 1986 and subsequently, what we have now tabled is clearly the best that we could reasonably put forward.  If adopted it would provide the basis for a balanced outcome.  That put forward by some other contracting parties would not.  All our efforts must now be applied to ensure that any final agreement in the GATT is on the basis of our approach.  That particular aim would not necessarily be advanced by having the issue raised again in the European Council, the next meeting of which is, in any event, after the dates set aside for the critical ministerial meeting on the Uruguay Round.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain the logic of statements made by him and Commissioner MacSharry that there could be a drop in farm subsidy prices of 30 per cent and still tell farmers they were going to be all right?  Will he explain the logic of that to me after that long rigmarole of an answer he has given? Can he explain how the 40,000 farmers most vulnerable at the moment could believe their future is secure after the deal he made in Brussels last week?</P>

      <Quest>the total number of applicants deemed to be ineligible for the special beef premium to date; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that farmers are being disqualified for very insignificant inventory mistakes on the application; if his attention has been drawn to the fact for some elderly farmers the application form may prove difficult to complete properly; and if he proposes to re-examine the cases now refused.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still too early to say how many applicants will be deemed ineligible under this year's special beef premium scheme.  I am aware that certain problems have arisen in relation to the manner in which some application forms have been completed.  Officials of my Department have discussed the matter with the EC Commission and a flexible approach will be adopted in so far as this is possible.  There are, of course, certain conditions which must be strictly adhered to and the two month retention period is one of these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise the tremendous hardship the rules <Col N="1400" /> governing this scheme have created in this, the worst year that Irish farmers have gone through?  Let me refer briefly to the case of a farmer with 40 bullocks. One of them died but that death was not recorded or sent to the local DVO office and the person in question will lose £1,400 this year and is debarred from taking part in the scheme next year.  Does the Minister believe that that is fair and reasonable?  Is that the way to properly administer a scheme?</P>

      <P>The European Commission laid down the regulations which will entitle anybody to be paid from European Community funds.  They are the regulations that are being put in place here.  Let me tell the Deputy, for what it is worth, that many farmers were under the impression they should fill in a lot of details of all animals on their holding as distinct from just those in respect of which they were applying for a premium. We have now got agreement from the Commission, for this year alone, to enable such applications to be treated but they must all correspond with the other conditions particularly the one in regard to the two month retention period.  I want to assure the Deputy, and the House, that everything that is open to us to do is being done and every case is being treated with the maximum amount of flexibility.</P>

I am not making a case for people who are not bona fide applicants.  If people do something wrong they should be penalised.  Anybody prosecuted for using angel dust would not be fined as much as £2,000.  I am asking the Minister, on behalf of thousands of farmers, to go through those files again and, where there is a bona fide case, to pay out the money before Christmas.</P>

I want to make it clear that unless it can be shown to the Commission that the delay was due to something outside the control of the farmer concerned, or arose through no fault of the farmer, the Commission will not be satisfied to pay. As far as later applications are concerned the regulations are there and I am doing my best to persuade the Commission to modify or ignore them.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>when O4 category bullocks will be eligible for intervention; if he has any plans to pay a slaughter premium type grant on heifers; when live exports of cattle to Libya and other countries is likely to commence; and the expected price per kg liveweight.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware I have requested the European Commission to extend intervention to include O4 category steers and to introduce a slaughter premium for heifers and cows.  While these requests have not been acted on, intervention purchasing has increased dramatically in the meantime, in an effort to promote an effective floor under the whole market.  Total Community beef purchased into intervention this year will reach some 530,000 tonnes by the end of this week.  In Ireland's case, over 190,000 tonnes will have been purchased by the end of this week &mdash; 31,000 tonnes in the last three weeks alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total for Ireland is likely to be over 220,000 tonnes for the year as a whole, <Col N="1402" /> at a capital cost of about £540 million. I have repeatedly emphasised that it is absolutely essential for farmers to be given cattle prices which reflect the benefits of these intervention purchases.  In order to ensure that no barrier &mdash; however small &mdash; would get in the way of the benefits being passed back to farmers my Department recently made improvements in the implementation of intervention arrangements.  This resulted in a very welcome 2 per cent increase in cattle prices.</P>
    <P>In so far as live exports to Libya are concerned I recently visited that country for discussions with my counterpart and the veterinary authorities there with a view to reopening the live cattle trade. Arising from my visit some progress has been made on resolving a number of technical aspects relating to BSE and a Libyan delegation will be soon visiting Ireland in this regard.  I am hopeful that following further discussions live exports will be able to recommence.  As the Deputy is well aware the matter of prices paid by individual exporters is primarily a commercial matter between them and individual farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

That alone is testament to the fact that my negotiating strategy has been very successful indeed.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Receiver was not appointed by the Minister or the Government.

I can give him information on applicants who are waiting four and five months for payment of the farm improvement grant, having already paid the Department the £30 per visit.  I was in contact with the Department yesterday about a claim by a person in my constituency and I was told that clearance for payment was received on 14 September and, with a little luck, the person could expect payment by Christmas.

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably one of the briefest answers that have been given in this House here.  Would the Minister not agree that with the reduction in the price of milk, by agreement with the National Dairies Association and the IFA, the missing link is the consumer?  The price per gallon for the farming community was reduced by 8p in September this year, which is equal to a reduction of 1p per pint but that reduction has not been passed on to the consumer.  Is the Minister denying that he has any role, function or interest in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Deputy to misinterpret what I said.  I said I have no statutory function in this regard and, therefore, I have no responsibility or authority.  The Deputy should not misrepresent that as saying that I have no interest.  If this House were to give me the statutory power, maybe I could have authority and responsibility.  I have been in contact informally with the liquid milk <Col N="1409" /> producers concerned with a view to ensuring that the price reductions on the world market would be handed on to the consumer.  I hope the Deputy will understand that all I can use in this case is persuasion and goodwill.  I have neither authority not responsibility but that does not suggest that I have no interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Minister that the present price of a pint of milk to the consumer at 31p is quite expensive.  Given the nutritional value of milk surely the Minister wants to see an increase in its consumption, particularly by the poor and those on low income in urban areas.  To ensure that there is an increase in the consumption of milk the price should be kept as low as possible. Will the Minister do all in his power to ensure that when the farmer gets a reduction in the price of a gallon of milk, ultimately it will be passed on to the consumer?</P>

Maybe the fact that the question has been raised in the House will also help to expedite the matter.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>EC Directive 75/268, as amended, allows for the classification as disadvantaged of &ldquo;farming areas which are homogeneous from the point of view of natural production conditions&rdquo; and this description clearly implies areas and not individual farms.  The directive also allows for the limited classification of &ldquo;small areas affected by specific handicaps&rdquo;. How small these latter areas may be has never been previously specified in writing by the EC but our clear understanding is that they would have to be much larger than the size of any farm in Ireland.  Accordingly, the Deputy's suggestion does not fall within the definitions applicable in the directive as it now stands and I see little hope of having the relevant provisions revised in the way suggested.</P>
      <P>There is also the practical requirement that disadvantaged areas must be defined in terms of map references and territorial constants such as townlands and DEDs which do not vary in size over time as individual farms do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept, of course, that there is a problem that some individual farms in otherwise well structured areas, because of a variety of factors, may be relatively disadvantaged.  While it does not appear <Col N="1411" /> possible to deal with these under the disadvantaged areas directive, I will continue to seek solutions to their problems in other ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure the Minister is aware of the anomalies that exist in this area.  Originally the classification was district electoral division and then it was townland.  As the Minister recognises that there are anomalies, why does he not seek to have this matter brought under the directive which allows for the establishment of disadvantaged areas to enable headage payments to be paid? Because the anomalies are so serious I ask the Minister to give further consideration to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable understanding of and sympathy for the kind of individual cases to which the Deputy referred and I have taken up this matter vigorously with the Commission and my Council colleagues.  However, there will always be anomalies in classification of disadvantaged farming areas. There will be individual farmers outside a handicapped area who will probably, individually, be worse off than some individual farmers inside the area.  As long as there are boundaries and a definition of areas such anomalies will arise. For that reason, I have been pressing the Commission and the Council to find a specific target for disadvantaged individual farmers in otherwise non-disadvantaged areas.  I have asked the Commissioner to bring forward proposals at an early stage on a constant basis to deal with those cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As official policy, will the Minister be seeking support for the type of assessment he mentioned? Will there eventually be a concept of disadvantaged farms or farmers instead of disadvantaged areas?  Surely there is not a problem with the assessment of the incomes of people concerned because we are very good at assessing people.  There must be about ten different types of assessment of income for small farmers.</P>

Is he aware that 80 per cent of our farmers are only getting 5 per cent of the total budget?  In case that sounds extraordinary, only 25 per cent of the total budget benefits farmers and only 20 per cent of it goes to 80 per cent of the farmers.  There is enough money &mdash; there always has been &mdash; and with this cut there still is and, therefore, I am asking whether the Minister has seriously considered and submitted to the EC that differentiated price support is the only answer to save the small and medium sized farmers before they are totally decimated? They have already left in their hundreds of thousands all over Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have already pressed the case at the Commission and with my Council colleagues, not all of whom, of course, are remotely in agreement with the suggestions.  Nonetheless, in the reorientation of the support for the Common Agricultural Policy, the primary &mdash; if not exclusive &mdash; target should be the family farm.  I agree that the primary producers and the family farmers, here or elsewhere, are the fundamental priority target.  I assure the Deputy and the House that that will be my case as I do not want to see reduced expenditure applied to them and increased expenditure applied to factory farmers or others engaged in various forms of processing throughout the European Community.</P>

Will the Minister use his influence with the Minister for Finance to ensure that EC grant aid is made available as a matter of urgency?

      <Quest>when his attention was first drawn to the difficulties facing the Goodman Group as a result of the situation in the Middle East; the action he took as a result; the discussions he had with the EC Commissioner for Agriculture regarding the difficulties of the Goodman Group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the Taoiseach indicated to the House on 24 October 1990, on being informed on 18 August last by the Investment Bank of Ireland of the difficulties facing the Goodman <Col N="1422" /> Group, he summoned a meeting of available relevant Ministers and senior officials to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>This was the point at which I first became aware of the group's difficulties, apart from some media reports and suggestions that the group was in difficulty in the week or so preceding 18 August.  The Taoiseach has already indicated to the House on 24 October the action taken to deal with the situation.  I had no discussions with Commissioner MacSharry regarding the difficulties of the Goodman Group as such; the Commissioner and I discussed on a number of occasions at the time measures to assist the beef sector as a whole in the light of the difficult market facing the sector and of the implications for the sector of the Goodman Group's difficulties.</P>

Let me also state, categorically and emphatically, in response to the suggestion by Deputy Rabbitte in this House that I, on the instructions of the Taoiseach, changed an Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food which had been fixed by the Government &mdash; I regret that Deputy Rabbitte is not here now &mdash; that it was a total fabrication and I hope Deputy Rabbitte will have the grace to come in to withdraw the implication against both the Taoiseach and me.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Gilmore</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>the number of cases of BSE reported in this country so far in 1990; if he has satisfied himself that all possible measures are being taken to prevent the spread of the condition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten cases of BSE have been confirmed this year, by comparison with 15 last year.  The decline in that very isolated incidence in a cattle population of seven million is very welcome. There is no comparison between <Col N="1424" /> the situations in Ireland and the United Kingdom, where over 20,000 cases have been confirmed in a cattle population of 12 million.  I am satisfied that we do not have an indigenous BSE problem and that we are dealing with a spillover from the UK.</P>
      <P>A series of stringent precautionary measures have been put in place. Immediately the condition became known in the UK in July 1988 a ban was imposed on the importation of meat and bonemeal from that country.  At the same time a prohibition was imposed on the importation of animals from those UK herds in which BSE had been diagnosed; a campaign to alert my Department's veterinary staff and private veterinary practitioners as to the symptoms of the disease was initiated.  This included the use of relevant video material obtained from the UK authorities; the veterinary research laboratories of my Department undertook minute examinations of the brains of all cattle referred to them; following confirmation of our first BSE case the disease was made compulsorily notifiable in April 1989.  Affected or suspected animals are slaughtered and destroyed.  Compensation at market value is paid; the progeny of affected dams have been purchased and are held at the veterinary research laboratory farm at Abbotstown; routine monitoring is carried out at meat plants and suspicious cases are referred for diagnosis; the export of cattle born before July 1988 from the UK to other member states was banned by the EC in July 1989.  This was later extended to a total ban on all cattle exports &mdash; except for veal calves &mdash; from the UK to other member states with effect from March 1990; the use of ruminant material &mdash; e.g. meat and bonemeal &mdash; in ruminant feedingstuffs has been banned; and restrictions have been placed on the herds in which BSE has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, aware that the restrictions which have been placed on the herds are causing problems.  I have devised arrangements whereby my Department will assist the herdowners affected in the <Col N="1425" /> voluntary depopulation of their herds and this process is now under way.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must emphasise that there is no evidence whatever that BSE is transmissible from animal to animal or that it poses any threat to public health.  At the same time, I am conscious that consumers demand, and are entitled to receive, the necessary assurances as to the safety and quality of Irish beef.  The measures I have taken are the most stringent possible.  I am satisfied that they provide these assurances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the information the Minister has given on the reduction in the incidence of BSE. Despite the precautionary measures which have been taken, is the Minister concerned that some cases of BSE are still being reported?  Can he offer some explanation why this should continue to be the case?  Secondly, in relation to the final part of his reply dealing with the transmission of the disease from animal and animal or from animal to humans, would he inform the House if the Food Safety Advisory Committee, to whom the question of the transmission of the disease from animal to humans was referred, have yet reported and what is the nature of that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>From the highest level of veterinary and scientific research which has been conducted into this condition, be it in Europe, the United Kingdom, here or anywhere else, the conclusion which has been reached by those scientific experts is that it is not transmissible from animal to animal or from animal to humans.  That is their conclusion, not mine.  In relation to the declining incidence of the disease here, which was only a mere trickle in any event, the Deputy will be aware that each of the 15 cases reported last year and each of the ten cases reported so far this year, has either been traced to animals directly imported in pedigree herds from Britain, which have been banned long since, or to imported feed which has also been banned.  In case there is even a remote risk that it came from a domestic <Col N="1426" /> source of ruminant feeding namely meat and bone meal, I have also banned the use of it.  Irish consumers, and the people who buy our product, have the best possible guarantees and I hope that very shortly &mdash; at least as far as Ireland is concerned &mdash; there will be no question about our status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Minister, and everybody concerned is to be congratulated that the incidence of this disease is falling.  That is extremely important for Ireland.  There is a problem concerning herdowners who have been waiting for compensation under the voluntary buy-out which the Minister referred to.  Will the Minister inform the House if those who have been involved with herds that had BSE have been paid or has agreement been reached with his Department?  Great financial hardship has been caused to those herdowners. Not only could they not trade but I understand the factories would not deal with them and buy their animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand arrangements for the voluntary depopulation is proceeding very satisfactorily.  My information is that while a number of them have been depopulated, with full co-operation, shortly it will extend to all infected herds.  It is because of the importance the Government attach to this issue that they gave me authority to pay considerable grants of money to those herds that have been affected.  It has been a considerable success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give the House an assurance, having regard to the unusually long BSE incubation period, that all possible sources of infection, contamination or transmission have been identified?  For example, have feed supplies been investigated by the Department to identify all possible sources of infection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to tell the Deputy that as in any matter of veterinary medicine and because of the importance of this to our farmers and the economy <Col N="1427" /> generally, we are the most vigilant of all member states.  At every possible level we monitor, control and restrict importation.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to import any animals since we introduced the ban.  It is not possible to import meat and bone meal since we banned it.  They are the changed circumstances associated with the disease. Neither is there any possibility of our exporting meat or bone meal though I have to say there was never any evidence that our meat and bone meal was in any way a source of the problem.  However, I banned their exportation so it should be clear to all concerned that we have taken the most stringent precautions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that of the ten cases this year he has evidence that the source of infection can be traced to sources outside the country?  Will he agree that the policy of slaughtering herds where an incidence occurs, is more desirable than the policy presently being pursued? Will he take the opportunity, arising from this question, to clear up the matter concerning statements made in the House by a Government backbencher that head staggers and mad cow disease are the same?  That matter needs to be clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. The Deputy will recall the appeal I made to him some time ago and I am glad he has acceded to that.  There is no risk whatsoever of BSE in view of the <Col N="1428" /> monitoring and controls we have in place both by my own veterinary officers and by private veterinary surgeons.  If there was even a remote trace of something that could look like BSE it would be immediately taken out.  We have slaughtered many more animals in the course of the BSE scare than were found to have the disease following laboratory examination. That is an indication of our vigilance in the matter.</P>

      <P>Concerning the question of transmission, about which there is still some public concern as cases of BSE were confirmed in cats it is my understanding that the Food Safety Advisory Council have been asked to re-examine the transmission of the disease between animals and between animals and humans.

      <P>I have no evidence from that committee, or from the highest level of veterinary or university research in the matter, that there is any evidence of transmissibility.  I am aware that a concentrated programme of huge dosage <Col N="1429" /> of the virus was conducted deliberately in the United Kingdom, over a protracted period, into pigs and that after months the pigs showed some traces of BSE.  Subject to that I am not aware of any transmissibility.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and No. 27 together.  The Goodman Group's involvement in the Irish food industry is of major significance only in relation to the beef sector.  The short term difficulties facing the beef sector have been addressed by increasing the intake of Irish beef into intervention.</P>

We must certainly learn a lesson from allowing one firm, or, indeed, one individual to have so much control.

      <P>The current difficulties being experienced by the beef industry are related to two separate matters, first, the Middle East difficulties and, second, the BSE problems.  To cope with those short term difficulties, due to the skilled negotiating of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, we got a major increase in the amount of beef going into intervention.  That has been a tremendous advantage.  We also secured an increase in the export refunds which, again, has been a tremendous advantage to the farming community.  A policy review group was established in the Department and their report will be available in the next few weeks.  It will signpost the future of the industry.</P>

      <Quest>the reason he has not communicated to the farm development offices around the country the decision to approve farm building projects on the basis of the increased costings as announced in early August; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is a backlog of such applications on hand in the local offices; if his attention has further been drawn to the inconvenience and financial hardship being caused to farmers as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The revised costings under the farm improvement schemes have been communicated to the local offices.  The costings apply to all projects approved after 15 August last.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in processing the unprecedented number of applications received in recent years for farm development work, particularly in relation to pollution control.  The remaining applications are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>The new costings which will mean a substantial increase in the size of grants should help considerably to ease the cost to farmers of ongoing investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5a:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 3 to 7, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Institute shall have the following general functions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to promote greater understanding and awareness of the marine environment, and of the importance of the oceans to Ireland, Europe and the World;</P>
      <P>(b)  to promote an increasing awareness of the intrinsic value and importance of marine research for its own sake;</P>
      <P>(c)  to undertake, co-ordinate, promote and assist in marine research generally;</P>
      <P>(d)  to undertake, co-ordinate, promote and assist in technical development and demonstration projects;</P>
      <P>(e)  to provide appropriate support services related to marine research and development; and</P>
      <P>(f)  promote sustainable economic development and create suitable employment through wise management of our marine resources and technical skills.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very serious weakness in <Col N="1454" /> section 4 (1).  It must be read very carefully in order to realise how dangerous it is.  Subsection (1) deals with the general functions of the Marine Institute, what it should undertake, co-ordinate and so on. It gives a short and a very inadequate list. The punchline comes at the end with the words &ldquo;that in the opinion of the Institute will promote economic development and create employment&rdquo;.  Has everything in this country been reduced to pounds, shillings and pence?  Are there no other criteria by which things can be judged?  This is an absolutely outrageous section.  It has not gone unnoticed by other Deputies. Deputy Gilmore has put down amendments to soften it and I would support his amendments, but they by no means go far enough.  We need to give the Marine Institute a much greater profile than this Bill attempts to do.  Hence I have sought in my amendment to delineate more fully the functions as opposed to the duties of the institute.  The functions come first and the duties second.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the functions of the institute are six-fold, as set out in my amendment. The first is to promote greater understanding and awareness of the marine environment, and of the importance of the oceans to Ireland, Europe and the world.  That speaks for itself.  We must attach a great deal of importance to marine affairs.  The second is to promote an increasing awareness of the intrinsic value and importance of marine research for its own sake.  That goes back to what I said at the beginning.  This institute must be about more than just money and creating jobs.  It must be about learning for its own sake, discovering more about the mysteries of the sea.</P>
    <P>The third function of the institute should be to undertake, co-ordinate, promote and assist in marine research generally. The fourth would be to undertake, co-ordinate, promote and assist in technical development and demonstration projects.  We must have a strong bias towards the various practical aspects of marine research and not have all this work taking place in offices.  The fifth function should be to provide appropriate support services related to marine <Col N="1455" /> research and development.  The sixth proposal is to promote sustainable economic development and create suitable employment through wise management of our marine resources and technical skills. &ldquo;Sustainable&rdquo; is the word Deputy Gilmore uses in his amendment.  The word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; is also important.</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to the scourge of the unregulated expansion of the fin fish industry which is not creating sustainable long term jobs.  It looks to be destroying more jobs than it is creating.  This matter will have to be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I am disappointed Deputy Garland has chosen this course rather than pursue the important matter of the establishment of the <Col N="1456" /> Marine Institute, which has major implications for the marine environment, the development of our seas and so on.  I understand we are taking together all these amendments dealing with the functions of the institute.  Amendment No. 7 in my name proposes to insert the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;economic development&rdquo;.  It is important that we do not view the sea as a big pond to be plundered for various financial interests and that we should have learned from the manner in which the land-based resources of the earth have been exploited that we need to build into legislation the whole concept of sustainable economic development, the need to renew and conserve resources and to treat the earth's resources with the sensitivity they require.</P>
      <P>Consequently it is important that the term &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; be incorporated in this Bill.  My amendment, No. 17, relates to section 4 also.  I might refer again to the task force which was quite specific about what should be the functions of the Marine Institute.  My amendment specifies the functions of the institute, as recommended in the report of the task force.  Their functions, as set out in the Bill, are a far cry from those specified in my amendment.  For example, in the Bill, as drafted, there is reference to advising the Minister on policy relating to marine research and development, on carrying out policy as may be specified by him on marine research and development and so on, a whole range of activities, all of which require the Minister's say-so before they can be undertaken.  It is important that the Marine Institute have clear-cut functions, that they have the requisite authority to pursue them.  My amendment, No. 17, was tabled with that purpose in mind.</P>
      <P>My amendment, No. 19, together with No. 6 tabled by Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, is an appropriate one for us to be dealing with today since this is the sixth anniversary of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.  The amendment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> In page 4, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>(4)  The Institute shall examine the strategic and economic necessity for a national deep sea merchant shipping fleet and shall advise the Minister on the reconstitution of such a fleet.</P>
    <P>Clearly with the onset of 1992, given our peripheral position &mdash; quite apart from the £100 million plus it has cost Irish taxpayers since 1984 &mdash; we have been very badly served by the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.  One of the functions of the Marine Institute should be to seek the reconstitution of a merchant shipping fleet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment, No. 6, seeks the insertion of the words, &ldquo;including the development of the fishing industry generally, and of a merchant marine&rdquo;.  I cannot overstress the importance of this addition or that of the fishing industry to this nation which, with the advent of 1992, will be rendered extremely vulnerable.  Specific reference to the fishing industry in the Bill would go a long way to safeguarding that important industry.  We have heard much talk about the advent of the single European market.  At present it is no secret that Scandinavian and continental industries are looking to our fishing industry to ascertain whether and where they might be able to take over since we will be in a vulnerable position from 1992 onwards. Unless the Marine Institute have a strong, prominent role to play in the promotion of our fishing industry, those people dependent on it for their livelihood will suffer enormously.  That was my reason for referring specifically to the fishing industry in my amendment.  Most Members would agree that it is our most under-utilised resource.  I feel very strongly about this issue and would request the Minister to take that addition on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a merchant marine it would be inconceivable to have a Marine Institute with no input in formulating some policy on a merchant marine.  I would broaden the term &ldquo;merchant <Col N="1458" /> marine&rdquo; to include ferry services to this country, since henceforth we will be confronted by circumstances in which our neighbour, Britain, will be linked to continental Europe by the tunnel, when we shall be even more isolated on the periphery of Europe.  It is more important than ever that a proper working merchant marine should be envisaged and included in the provisions of this Bill.  I welcomed the Minister's announcement some months ago to the effect that he was preparing documentation with regard to a merchant marine service here.  It is most important that such service be in place.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to include both matters as specified in my amendment. It is important that any institute with teeth should be able to argue that we, as an island nation, have a strong policy on fishing and a merchant marine.</P>

      <P>Thank you for your advice on a technicality, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might stress the importance of the contents of my amendment, No. 16, and of the continental shelf around Ireland as an under-explored asset, something on which we have insufficient knowledge and on which we have not carried out sufficient research.  Indeed it is something that in the long term can be used to our benefit and prosperity particularly in the creation of employment along our west coast.  Generally this matter does not assume its rightful importance until some exploratory or research work is undertaken which establishes that there is a valuable asset out there.  It is at that point that the delineation lines become extremely important.  Therefore it is <Col N="1459" /> advisable that, in advance of any such development, we have clearly established these lines of delineation in relation to the continental shelf.  Once some exploration work shows that there is a valuable asset out there various diplomatic interventions and cross-hackling begin to establish who owns what, where the lines of demarcation begin and end.  It is important that we clarify this matter at an early stage and lay down our markers clearly showing the boundaries of our control.  This would lead to a clear-cut position in the future and therefore, would not be the cause of any aggravation or hassle and, additionally, be in our national interest.  Our share of the continental shelf is a great asset.  Yet we do not know sufficient about it.  Given the extensive emigration that takes place from communities along our west coast it is particularly important that we use this resource sooner rather than later to generate employment and prosperity along that coast.  For that reason I am requesting that these two additional subsections be added to section 4 of the Bill, as drafted, which deals with the functions of the institute.  Indeed they should be listed as priority activities of the Marine Institute, that is to mark out clearly the delineation lines of our claim to the continental shelf.</P>
    <P>In relation to quantifying, mapping and delineating Ireland's marine and fishery resources, I am puzzled as to how we assess our fishery resources.  EC member states have an extraordinary claim on fishery resources around our island based on historical and traditional fishing patterns. I find this difficult to accept.  The Government have a real responsibility to take a very hard line on this issue, and the sooner the better we set out clear standards and clear demands in relation to the quantity of fish, where exactly we are allowed to fish and the species we are allowed to fish.  I know we have maps at the moment, but I question how they were drawn up, the value of many of them and the areas that have been allocated to Ireland for different species.</P>
    <P>On maps it may look well that the <Col N="1460" /> Irish fishing fleet have rights to fish for a particular species in zone X, Y or Z, but when you examine this more closely you find some of those zones are appallingly poor for the production of the species, or in the areas which seem to be good for fishing a species, we find the species is not very attractive or popular.  Therefore, there is a need for a very determined, vigorous effort in this area.</P>
    <P>We have heard this Government talk extensively of the potential for job creation in the fishing industry and over two years ago BIM had a major launch to create 4,400 jobs.  I believe very little, if anything, has happened in this area and I am most disappointed.  Part of the reason is that we do not have a clear view or a clear knowledge of our position nor do we have the determination and aggressive approach at European level to get a fair slice of the cake in relation to fishing quotas.  This is fundamentally important to the future of the fishing industry and the creation of employment in that area.  It is imperative that urgent action be taken on this.  Therefore, I am requesting that what I propose be added to section 4 in relation to the functions of the institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I took particular note of these amendments over lunchtime and I have studied them once again in detail with my officials.  I am quite satisfied that the functions of the institute as provided in section 4 cover all the points raised by the Deputies as outlined in the various amendments we are discussing under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that the institute will have the following general functions, namely, &ldquo;to undertake, to co-ordinate, to promote and to assist in marine research and development and to provide such services related to marine research and development, that in the opinion of the Institute&rdquo;&mdash; that is important &mdash;&ldquo;will promote economic development and create employment&rdquo;.  That clearly portrays that the institute have teeth and power and will carry out the functions I have just <Col N="1461" /> outlined.  The section provides that the institute will advise the Minister on policy relating to marine research and development, will carry out policy as may be specified by the Minister on marine research and development, undertake, develop, promote and market marine research and development services, promote and assist the improvement, development and application of technical and other processes for the exploitation and development of the marine resource, and collect, maintain, and disseminate information relating to marine matters. All those areas are detailed in the section.</P>
    <P>Let me draw the attention of the House to section 4 (4) which provides that:  &ldquo;The Minister may confer on the Institute by order such other additional functions as he may from time to time consider necessary which said order may be amended or revoked by order by the said Minister.&rdquo; Therefore, the areas outlined in the amendment in my view are adequately covered.</P>
    <P>Of course, the section covers everything Deputy Garland has outlined and, indeed, much more.  As a matter of fact, the amendment set out by Deputy Garland is much more inadequate than what is in the section.  In other words, what he has outlined is enshrined in section 4, and much more.  That is the point I want to make.</P>
    <P>A point was made by Deputy Garland with regard to economic development. Of course economic development is necessary and it will be part of the functions of the Marine Institute.  Along with the creation of employment in the marine area it is totally linked with conservation and environmental protection issues.  All these are considered very carefully and will be part and parcel of the functions of the Marine Institute.  Not only the Government, who are giving the lead, are involved in the protection of the environment.  I can assure the House that the Marine Institute, when they are up and running, will have as their priority the protection of the environment.  You cannot allow developments in our waters without assessing on a continuous basis their environmental impact.  As a Deputy <Col N="1462" /> said earlier in the fin fish sector these projects are now underpinned by full environmental impact assessments. Again let me emphasise that environmental protection is a priority.  All evidence available to me indicates a great awareness of the environment and the need for marine conservation.  A sector cannot survive in a degraded environment.</P>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy as outlined by Deputy Taylor-Quinn is important. It is not particularly relevant to this Bill but we are very concerned that the Marine Institute will provide the Minister and the Department with the very best possible research and advice in the forthcoming review of the CFP.  I look forward very much to that advice and guidance from the institute when established.</P>
    <P>I thought I had explained fully that the institute will have teeth.  They will have a strong board comprised of persons with experience and expertise and knowledge of the industry.  They will have an adequate budget and the full support of the Government in exercising their remit, and that will be a very full remit as outlined in section 4.  Usually it is not necessary in legislation of this sort to spell out functions as Deputy O'Sullivan suggested. The functions will be identified within the broad remit of the Bill, as I have already stated.  In addition, from time to time the Minister may specify policy to be carried out by the institute. The Bill is an enabling framework which can accommodate the recommendations of the ministerial task force.</P>
    <P>I am happy that Deputy Garland's amendment is not necessary.  The Bill as drafted provides sufficient scope in relation to the remit of the institute.  I feel also that the other amendments &mdash; amendments Nos. 6, 7, 16, 17 and 19 &mdash; are unnecessary.  In particular amendment No. 6, put down by Deputy O'Sullivan, is unnecessary in that it relates to the merchant marine.  It is inappropriate to legislation of this kind and does not necessarily have to be enshrined in it. Nevertheless it may not be precluded from being discussed by the institute in their deliberations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> Research and development as defined in the Bill is already sufficiently comprehensive to address all matters relating to fisheries and fisheries development. On the question of the merchant marine, this is a matter for transport economics and is not directly relevant to this Bill but, again, may not necessarily be precluded. Indeed, so far as those areas are concerned, I am not ruling anything out at this stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 7 which seeks to insert the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;, again the Bill as drafted provides the institute with a remit which covers the promotion of economic development and the creation of employment.  That is a clear cut brief which does not need any further elaboration.  The Deputy's suggested amendment does not in any way enhance the section.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 16 in the name of Deputy Madeleine Taylor-Quinn, again I am opposed to it because it is not necessary.  The Bill as drafted allows sufficient scope to the institute to deal with all those matters outlined by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 in the name of Deputy Gilmore is similar to the one I have just spoken about, amendment No. 16.  I understand the other amendment we are taking within that group has not been moved.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat disappointed with the way the Minister is acting today.  It is not unusual to yield a little, to accommodate somewhat here and there.  Some of the amendments tabled are not by any means dramatically controversial and would not in any way <Col N="1464" /> detract from the Bill but would add substantially to it.  There is plenty of room to manoeuvre here if the Minister was prepared to be a little more flexible.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 16 is very straightforward. There is nothing controversial in it.  It is specific, but it is also valuable and has something to commend it.  The continental shelf is an important issue. The Minister says it is covered in the first section of the functions of the institute in section 4 and that the broad terms of that section can accommodate the delineation of Ireland's continental shelf.  Maybe it could, but I think we need to be a bit more specific and I would urge the Minister to look at this very seriously and take this amendment on board and accommodate it.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is adopting a rather narrow attitude on this issue.  All he is really doing is adhering strictly to what was originally published in the Bill.  At no stage to date has he accommodated any of our amendments, none of which has been controversial.  I would ask the Minister to look at this.  In amendment No. 16 I am suggesting that we delineate Ireland's continental shelf and to quantify, map and delineate Ireland's marine and fisheries resources.  That could be very easily inserted there and make section 4 a much more specific and better section.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 is the one I am interested in at present. I think the Minister is being very sincere when he says that will be covered under the institute.  As we all know, however, Ministers come and go, Deputies come and go and civil servants come and go. I am asking specifically that the fishing industry and the merchant marine be stitched into the Bill so that the terms of reference for the institute will be laid down, whoever comes or goes.  The merchant marine and the fishing industry are of vital importance to us as an island nation.  I am sure the fishermen around our coasts would agree with me that we are so far behind the other nations that some impetus in legislation is needed.  I <Col N="1465" /> believe the Minister is sincere when he says that the Bill covers most aspects of what we have been concerned about but, as Deputy Madeleine Taylor-Quinn has rightly said, these amendments are not controversial and are really only cementing into the Bill specific parts which we feel are important.</P>
      <P>I have read the terms of reference of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment because it would give an added importance to the legislation.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.  I will push it to a vote if necessary because I feel very strongly about it.</P>

      <P>I rise to support amendment No. 6.  I am sure the Minister and the Government are well aware that over the years everybody has been bemoaning the fact that the fishing industry has never been properly developed.  There is an opportunity for the Minister in this Bill to be specific about the promotion of the fishing industry.  The section as it stands is very general.  In regard to amendment No. 7 the Minister's rejection of the inclusion of the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; is an indication that he has made a decision not to accept any amendments but to let the section as proposed stand, and that is a pity.  Why should one object to the inclusion of the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo;?  I support wholeheartedly amendment No. 6.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 7, after &ldquo;employment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and protect the environment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is very important in relation to maintaining employment especially in the west where there is high emigration and the social fabric of the communities is rapidly changing.</P>
      <P>The creation of employment in the marine industry is very important but the creation of such employment will be impossible without protecting the environment. It is vital to protect the environment. We are aware of major damage which has been done in places like Norway and Scotland due to over development and lack of environmental awareness.  I refer particularly to the haphazard development of fin fish farming. We cannot have enough protection of the environment in this area.  At the moment developments are taking place where sufficient thought has not been given to environmental protection.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to accept the insertion of the words &ldquo;and protect the environment&rdquo;.  While there may be short term gains in employment in the marine industries, jobs will not be maintained unless we protect the environment.</P>
      <P>I hope the Marine Institute when established will closely examine the coastline to ascertain areas suitable for different types of marine development. This type of work has been done in a very skimpy fashion to date mainly because the Department have not had sufficient personnel to do a detailed job.</P>
      <P>We are unique in that we have not damaged our marine environment in the way in which other countries have, so we have something to protect.  It would be unfortunate if we created short term employment without considering the long term effects of marine development.  This amendment is suggested with a view to protecting the long term maintenance of employment.  There is no point in creating jobs that will only last from four to six years because proper environmental awareness was not promoted initially.</P>

      <P>This amendment is also in my name.  We have had a bad record <Col N="1471" /> here today, with the Minister rejecting amendments completely out of hand.  I do not want to anticipate what the Minister might say, but I would find it difficult to understand his rejection of this amendment, given the Government's stated commitment to protect the environment and given the fact that Ireland's Presidency of the European Community was designated the Green Presidency and that between the months of January and June we heard a lot from the Government about the need to protect the environment. It is hardly asking too much in a Bill dealing essentially with marine research and development that one of the general functions of the institute would be related to protection of the environment. I hope the Minister will respond generously in relation to this amendment, and agree to accept it.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  There is a new awareness in relation to environmental protection. There has been an increased abuse of the sea over the past number of years.  In the Marine Institute scientific knowledge can be put to good use in order to protect our coastal waters and our coastlines.  The Minister will probably say that the Bill covers this aspect, but I can understand the reasoning behind the argument that a further reference to environmental protection should be included in the Bill. This bears out the concern Deputies have, not alone about the environment, but also about the need to give the Bill sufficient teeth.  I fail to understand the reason the Minister cannot accept the amendment which states that the environment should be protected.  I fully support the amendment.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> As I have already stated, the Bill is broad enough and lays emphasis on the need to protect the environment.  Indeed, as Deputy O'Sullivan rightly pointed out, there has been abuse of the sea.  The purpose in setting up this institute is to prevent such abuse.  I am quite satisfied <Col N="1472" /> that the Bill is sufficiently strong enough and that the chairman and members of the Marine Institute will have sufficient power under the legislation to do exactly what the Members of the House are asking me to do but having said that, without giving any commitment, I am prepared to examine the matter and discuss it again on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>We now proceed to amendment No. 9.  Amendment No. 10 is an alternative and amendments Nos. 11, 13, 14, 15, 20 and 21 are related.  Therefore I propose that we take amendments Nos. 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20 and 21 together by agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2) (a), line 10, to delete &ldquo;to advise the Minister on&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;to formulate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I put down this amendment is that I am concerned the Bill does not have enough real teeth or sufficient powers to allow the institute do something positive.  Everyone can give advice but the taking of advice is another matter. The Marine Institute should be given a very specific function to formulate policy rather than just to advise the Minister. After all, if the Marine Institute are to be the expert institute in this area who better to formulate policy than the experts and personnel within the institute? For this reason I would like to have the words &ldquo;to advise the Minister on&rdquo; deleted and replaced with the words &ldquo;to formulate&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Taylor-Quinn, I also seek the inclusion of the word &ldquo;formulate&rdquo;.  The Minister indicated this morning that he will be appointing to this institute a panel of experts who have great knowledge of maritime affairs.  In not giving the people to be appointed the power to formulate <Col N="1473" /> policy on coming to a conclusion on various matters we are wasting resources.  I have been a member of a health advisory board for a number of years and I find it most frustrating, having had discussions, to come up with a solution and passing it on to the health board or the Minister to find that the matter has been ignored. While this may not seem to be a very important matter, if we are serious about maritime affairs, expanding our resources, developing our economy by making greater use of our maritime resources and the protection of our environment, we must give people the power to formulate policy and in turn present it to the Minister who along with the Government will decide on what policy should be implemented.  I believe it would be a mistake to appoint the members in an advisory capacity in this instance.  There has been much talk about the work the institute are going to do but until such time as they are in a position to formulate maritime policy we are only wasting valuable time and money.  I feel very strongly about this issue and ask the Minister to consider making this change in the wording of this section, to insert the words &ldquo;to formulate&rdquo;.  I appreciate that it is the Government who will implement the policy but it is very important that we include the word &ldquo;formulate&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The question we are debating now is whether this institute will be allowed do anything on their own.  We have already debated the question as to what extent the functions of existing research bodies should be incorporated into the institute and have had a general debate on the functions of the institute. What we are now dealing with is the Minister's hand.  What we have here is the classic question of whether certain functions in relation to co-ordination, the making of proposals and so on should be devolved to the institute if they are to have any meaning at all.  Almost every subparagraph of this section of the Bill contains a reference to the &ldquo;carrying out of policy, as may be specified by the Minister, on marine research and <Col N="1474" /> development&rdquo;.  Therefore the institute will have no authority, independent of the Minister, to carry out policy on marine research and development.  Sub-paragraph (f) of subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>To co-ordinate proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State-owned or controlled body or such other body as the Minister may from time to time direct,</P>
      <P>Subparagraph (g) reads:</P>
      <P>To evaluate for the Minister proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State-owned or controlled body or such other body as the Minister may from time to time direct,</P>
      <P>Subparagraph (h) reads:</P>
      <P>To advise the Minister on proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State-owned or controlled body or such other body as the Minister may from time to time direct,</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) states that the institute may, at the request of the Minister, represent the State in European Community programmes of marine research and development.  They may not do so of their own accord.  We are aware that there is a substantial number of European Community programmes on marine research. Because we have not had a marine institute to date we have not been able to benefit to the extent we could have from European Community programmes on marine research.  Yet, we have a situation where the institute may not participate in the STRIDE programme unless requested to do so by the Minister.  Subsection (3) (f) goes on in the same vein. It reads:</P>
      <P>engage in any other activities relating to marine research and development as may be approved of by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a recipe for an institute that will <Col N="1475" /> not work.  It is clear from section 4 that the Minister has no intention of allowing this institute to act or to grow independently. In these amendments we are attempting to take the ministerial constraints that are being put on the institute. There is no way in practice that the Minister can engage himself in the day to day activities of the institute as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It has taken three years for the Minister to bring this legislation before the House. I am aware, and I am sure the Members of the House are aware, of the many commitments on the Minister's time.  I do not see the Minister for the Marine having the time to examine individual proposals for the carrying out of particular functions that would be required by him under the provisions of this Bill. What will be the end result?  We will end up with a three tier bureaucratic arrangement for marine research.  There will be a researcher or a group of researchers in the fisheries research centre, the central fisheries board, the Geological Survey Office, UCG or whatever, who identify that there is a need to carry out research or development in some area of marine activity.  What is the first thing they will do?  They will have to apply to the Marine Institute before they can do anything but the Marine Institute may not be able to do anything about it unless they get the specific approval of the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn referred this morning to the fine work being done in University College Galway.  I agree with her.  The people in University College Galway want to identify some area of research for which they can get European funding.  They may well identify that there is an area in which they could carry out certain research on behalf of the European Community but under the provisions in this Bill they would not have the right to do that; they would have to go through two stages &mdash; first, they would go to the institute and then the institute could not make a decision unless they had a request from the Minister to particpate in a European Community programme.  All these ties to <Col N="1476" /> the Minister will result in the Marine Institute being unable to do anything.  It will handicap the institute when it comes to the work they are intended to do.  It will handicap them from participating in European Community ventures and from engaging and co-operating with other agencies.  It will strangle them.</P>
    <P>I understand the reluctance on the part of Departments to let go of areas of policy or areas of interest.  If the Minister insists on keeping a grip on the Marine Institute, then the institute will be absolutely useless. Anyone who is involved in any public body and has to seek departmental approval for day to day activities knows all the administrative difficulties, these difficulties arise not through any fault of the people involved but because of the sheer volume of work.  This is an over-centralised, over-bureaucratic approach to an institute that should be able to develop on their own initiative but that, unfortunately, will not happen under the formula presented here.  This is a test of whether the Minister has confidence in the body he is setting up.  You do not have confidence in a body if you insist on the right to rubber-stamp every activity they wish to carry out.  I ask the Minister to give a vote of confidence to the Marine Institute we are debating today by releasing them from ministerial ties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I want to make it quite clear that the Marine Institute is a very important subsidiary organ of the State.  A subsidiary organ cannot take over functions which are proper to the Minister.  The State has a substantial interest and role in marine research.  The new arrangements which I am now introducing will allow that to be more effective and to work much more efficiently.  There is no question of handicapping the work of the institute as was pointed out by Deputy Gilmore.  There is no question of putting constraints on the institute.  Neither is there any question of dealing with the day to day activities of the institute.  The institute will not be handicaped in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is the same as legislation setting up any other semi-State <Col N="1477" /> organisation or, indeed, any other subsidiary organ of the State.  It would be wrong that this Government would tie the hands of any future Government. Policy is a matter for the Government and the Minister for the Marine to determine with advice, as appropriate, from the Marine Institute.  In other words, I am saying that policy is the prerogative of the Minister of the day and it would be very wrong of this House to have enshrined in legislation, a section which would inhibit the policy or the prerogative of this Government or of any future Government.  It never happened and it certainly will not happen on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Marine Institute will have scope to do all the things the Deputies opposite, and particularly Deputy Gilmore, think they will not have under section 4 (2) (c) of this Bill.  The European Community deals at member state level with any individual country and not with any research organisation.  National governments have the primary role in this area in dealing with the European Community. There is no way any Government or any Minister can devolve that function to a subsidiary organisation.  I want to repeat as often as I can that policy is the prerogative of the Government of the day and it would be very wrong of any Government to tie the hands of any future Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy O'Sullivan that the board of the institute will not act in an advisory capacity.  As section 4 clearly outlines, they will have teeth and will operate under the policies of the Minister and the Government of the day.  The board will be comprised of members who have experience and expertise in this area.  They will have adequate finance to support their research programme and to carry out their remit to the fullest.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I cannot accept amendments Nos. 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20 and 21; they are all more or less the same.  The functions of the institute are set out clearly in the Bill.  To all intents and purposes they will be an independent research body who will have to keep in mind that they are a subsidiary organ of <Col N="1478" /> the State and will have to carry out the policy of the Government and the Minister for the Marine of the day.  I cannot accept any one of those amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think listening to the Minister that the amendments are tantamount to setting up some kind of a government in exile who would deal with marine affairs and undermine the position of the Government.  That is far from the case.  Nobody is disputing the fact that what is being established is a State body and that that State body are clearly subordinate to State policy, but let us look at this in practice.</P>
      <P>What is being proposed is a body to which the Minister will appoint the members and, if I recall correctly, he may, at his discretion, remove the chairman or members of that body.  The Minister will receive an annual report from the body and he will know what is taking place.  Under provisions in the Bill the Minister may direct the institute to carry out research into a specific area which the Government may decide needs to be researched.  For example, they may decide, and I hope they will, that the radioactive contamination of the east coast, which has never been researched by any Government, should be examined to see the extent to which the beaches on the east coast have been radioactively polluted by the Sellafield plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is open to the Minister to ask the Marine Institute to carry out this research, this is a far cry from saying to the Marine Institute that they will have to go back to the Minister for approval for every substantial function they have to perform, which effectively, is what is being proposed.  The institute will not function under the declarations made by the Minister this afternoon.  They will function under the provisions of the Bill. Section 4 (2) (b) provides that the institute shall carry out policy as may be specified by the Minister on marine research and development.  I read that to mean that the Marine Institute may not carry out policy other than that which has been specified by the Minister.  If my reading of the subsection is incorrect, I would like <Col N="1479" /> the Minister to put his view on record because it needs to be made very clear. The institute will need to know the extent to which they can or cannot do things.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) (f) provides that the institute shall co-ordinate proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State owned or controlled body or such other body as the Minister may from time to time direct.  Let us take the example Deputy Taylor-Quinn gave this morning of Guinness Peat Aviation making finance available or having an interest in a particular area of marine research.  If a private commercial company believe that there is a need to carry out research in some area the Marine Institute may not co-ordinate those proposals for marine research and development unless the Minister has directed them to do so.  Subsection (g) states that the institute shall evaluate proposals for marine research and development for the Minister but if the Minister has not directed the institute to evaluate proposals, they may not evaluate them.  That is the way I read that section.</P>
    <P>If the Marine Institute become aware, for example, that there are proposals for marine research and development which should be evaluated they cannot do anything unless they get the green light from the Minister.  I am not suggesting that the Marine Institute should represent the State at meetings of the Council of Ministers or anything of that nature but section 4 (3) (a) provides that the institute may represent the State in European Community programmes of marine research and development.  If we establish a national marine institute obviously that is the body who will represent the State.  We know there are European Community programmes of marine research and development.  Long ago we should have had a body able to plug into what is happening at European Community level.  Yet, the Marine Institute may not, of their own volition, do that unless requested to do so by the Minister. That is what it says in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to face up to <Col N="1480" /> this.  Nobody is suggesting for a moment that there should not be accountability. Accountability is clearly provided for in the appointment of the institute, in the provision for the sacking of the members of the institute and in the provisions under which the institute report to the Minister.  There are clear lines of accountability in those provisions.  The Bill also provides a clear procedure whereby the institute may be given a direction to carry out research and development in a particular area. However, there is a distinction between that and placing a requirement on the institute to go back to the Minister for the green light on what really should be their day-to-day function.  Unfortunately, that is what is being proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the attitude the Minister had adopted to these amendments.  They were put down for one common purpose &mdash; this is very clear from the proposals in them &mdash; to give independence to the institute so that they will have the opportunity of initiating work, formulating policy and carrying out research without having to wait for a direction from the Minister or his Department.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept any of these amendments, I will have to question his sincerity and that of his Department in regard to the establishment of the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is just another layer of bureaucracy set up as a puppet for the Department of the Marine and the Minister. The response to all these amendments suggests that this is the way the Minister and his Department want it.  It is unfortunate that this attitude is being adopted because it will restict the creativity and initiative of talented people.  Anything that restricts people in this way is bad.  It inhibits development and stifles talents and interest in work.  If the institute is to be set up as the Minister intends in the Bill and he is not prepared to accept these amendments, we will have another body which will be different for a year or so but then will fall into the same old routine <Col N="1481" /> and become a humdrum operation waiting to be directed by the Department. This is not in the interests of the necessary development and research in modern industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take a serious view of the matter.  Rather than looking on this as an enabling Bill, he should see it as something which will set up a body to make a major contribution to the development of a resource which to date has been underdeveloped.  Unless the people involved are given the opportunity to do what they feel is necessary rather than wait to be directed by the Minister, this is a waste of time.  Accountability is provided for within the Bill.</P>
    <P>The various subsections of section 4 are totally restrictive and inhibiting.  They are not conducive to the independent development of ideas or the formulation of policy.  People of initiative and talent will not want to work in the institute and we will end up with a humdrum operation which will be insignificant in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is new legislation setting up a new body with new ideas and giving a fresh input into our marine development.  I am disappointed that the Minister has taken a blinkered view of the amendments before us.  We who are spokespersons on the Marine have tried to point out to the Minister that if we want talented people to work in this body we must give them freedom. We must not restrict their views and they should be able to come back with certain decisions they have made.  The Minister is to appoint experts to the institute and we should know who these experts are. It is very difficult for someone to sit on a board or panel knowing that a decision taken will mean nothing if the Minister decides to knock it on the head.  Unless the institute is given a proper role to play in maritime affairs, we are wasting out time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted when I heard that this legislation was to be brought forward.  I saw it as a step forward which would bring us into the twentieth century.  We are so far behind that we need the <Col N="1482" /> impetus which would be supplied by the establishment of the Marine Institute. They must have the initiative to bring forward ideas and policies to the Minister but unless they are given independence, we will not attract the proper people.</P>
    <P>The Minister attacked rather than discussed the amendments.  I came here with the objective of putting forward a reasonable amendment.  I still feel it is reasonable to ask a group of people picked for their expertise to formulate policy and to come back with their ideas so that they can be incorporated into the Government's marine policy.  I accept that the Government of the day will make decisions, but if freedom and independence are not given to the institute it will become merely a talking shop, like the health advisory committees throughout the country.  It will be only a symbol of marine affairs.  Unless we grasp the opportunity provided by this legislation and make it work in a positive manner we will slip back into the old ways.  Other nations including the Scandanavians, the French, the Spanish and the British will go far ahead of us again.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the amendments before us.  The bona fides of those who tabled them is beyond reproach.  This has been a very well ordered debate and I am sorry the Minister has not given recognition to the amendments.  Perhaps he will reconsider his attitude.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Marine Institute, just like the organisations I have mentioned, will have wide scope on policy matters within their remit.  For example, appointments to the board will confirm that it is envisaged that the approach of the board, the role of the institute and their powers will be utilised in the most effective way.  There is no doubt about that.  I cannot understand why Deputies are taking such an extraordinary view.  I have given them examples of four organisations where there is no restriction whatsoever on their day to day operations.  It is not true to say that the institute will be restricted in their day to day operations; far from it, the Minister will not interfere in their day to day activities.  The institute will have adequate scope to develop policies and innovations within their remit as outlined by Government policy, that is, any Government in power and the relevant Minister for the Marine.</P>
      <P>All of this must be read within the context of section 4 (1) which describes the general functions of the institute.  The facts are that this will be a State body largely funded by the taxpayer.  Therefore, the Minister must be able to influence their policy in line with Government policy and public thinking from time to time.  No Government would be worth their salt were they to give those powers to any other organisation.</P>
      <P>I might say that section 4 (3) (a) does not prevent the institute taking part in EC programmes on their own account. That subsection merely makes the point that the institute will take part in such programmes on behalf of the State, a point that needed to be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised a point about radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea.  These levels are monitored constantly by the Nuclear Energy Board assisted by the fisheries research sector of my Department. The Deputy need have no worries on that score.  I might reiterate that it will not amount to another layer of bureaucracy.  Indeed, it is very wrong for <Col N="1484" /> any Deputy to maintain that it will be such because clearly it will not be.  The institute will have its independence. Indeed the emphasis being laid on this point by Deputies opposite is not in keeping with the functions of the institute as outlined in section 4.  The House will appreciate that the institute will have flexibility and independence working within the framework of the provisions of section 4.  I must reiterate that they will not be hamstrung or restricted but rather will have full scope and flexibility in carrying out their functions as laid down in section 4.</P>
    <P>For that reason I cannot understand the views being expressed by Deputies opposite.  The new institute will be no different from any other subsidiary organ of State established by this, previous or indeed future Governments.  I have no doubt but that the same Deputies will be coming back to me in 12 months' or two years' time saying how wrong they were in advancing such suggestions during the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions the Minister has strongly asserted that the institute will have a degree of independence which I contend will not be compatible with what is contained in the Bill as drafted.  However, I am open to being convinced.  With the agreement of the Chair I might request the Minister &mdash; going down the sections we seek to amend &mdash; to clarify a couple of matters for me.  First, let me take section 4 (2) (b) which reads:</P>
      <P>(b) to carry out policy as may be specified by the Minister on marine research and development,</P>

      <P>Let me cite a practical position.  Let me deal with section 4 (2) (f) which reads:</P>
      <P>(f) to co-ordinate proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State owned or controlled body...</P>
      <P>I understand all that; we are talking about bodies such as An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or others who might want to inject money into the project.  Here is the piece of the subsection in which I am particularly interested:</P>
      <P>...or such other body as the Minister may from time to time direct,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does that mean?  I know some Members do not like references to individual constituencies.  But let me take an example with which I am familiar.  In the shipping area where we have a Sea Pollution Bill, let us suppose that Sealink, based in my constituency, were anxious to have examined a particular aspect of shipping pollution by ships or whatever and wanted research conducted and let us suppose they were prepared to put forward some finance for that purpose and that his research proposal required co-ordination &mdash; for example, it might require co-ordination with the B &amp; I, a State owned body; it might necessitate co-ordination between the Department of the Marine and a number of different <Col N="1486" /> bodies, such I understand that to be one of the functions of the new institute &mdash; would the institute have to revert to the Minister to get the all clear or could they simply go ahead with the co-ordination of the proposal concerned?</P>

      <P>I am not clear on that. Let me give a practical example.  We have a Sea Pollution Bill dealing with emissions from ships.  There is a proposal in that Bill that facilities be provided at the ports.  We know there is a problem in relation to the provision of facilities at ports.  Let us say that Sealink, B &amp; I, Bell Lines or whoever else is involved in the area come up with a proposal that they want an aspect of it researched.  Let us say they want to develop port reception facilities for waste and are prepared to come in with State-sponsored bodies or whatever on it.  They ask the Marine Institute to co-ordinate the proposal.  The proposal comes before a meeting of the institute.  What advice is the chief executive of the institute to give to the members of the institute?  Is he to advise them that for that proposal, because it is <Col N="1487" /> a body that has not been directed by the Minister, they must go back to the Minister for approval for it, or can the institute make a decision to say, &ldquo;Yes, this is a great proposal; let us go ahead with it&rdquo;?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Deputy fails to understand what I am indicating.  There is a clear distinction between policy and research and development, as the Deputy knows.  The carrying out of policy into which the institute will have an input comes within section 4 (2) (a) of the Bill.  That is one thing, and in line with that the institute will have regard to all policy issues assigned to them in any area.  Therefore, this is determined by the Government's policy.  I am not going into specifics here this afternoon, but if what the Deputy has just outlined comes within the remit of this legislation or within the remit of the Sea Pollution Bill which is before the House at present, of course the institute can carry out research into the area the Deputy has just outlined, provided it is within the total remit and within the policy as outlined by the Government and the Minister of the day.  Therefore, the institute do not have to go back to the Minister on a day to day basis on an issue to issue basis.  They have the freedom to carry out their work under the policy as determined by the Government and the Minister, so they are not hamstrung in that way at all.</P>

      <P>If a proposal comes to the institute from, say, University College, Galway to the effect: &ldquo;We have a proposal for the development of a particular project.  This is going to involve the following bodies: UCG, the local authority, UCC and, let us say, one or two private companies&rdquo;, do I understand the Minister correctly that the institute will have the authority to go ahead with that proposal and the co-ordination of that proposal with no further reference to the Minister other than to satisfy themselves that they are complying with general policy guidelines as laid down by the <Col N="1488" /> Government, but they do not have to go back and check for individual proposals with the Minister?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Deputy seems to be misreading the section. The Minister's power to direct regarding another body does not preclude the institute from dealing with research as outlined by the Deputy in the example he has given.  If there is a request for research and development by another organisation and it comes within the remit of the institute, there is no reason the institute cannot carry out that research and development without any contact or association with the Minister provided it is within the general guidelines.</P>

      <P>We seem to be going around in circles.  My amendment is very clear.  It says: &ldquo;to formulate policy and to advise&rdquo;.  Of course it is the Minister's prerogative and that of the Government of the day to implement the policy.  If we are to be serious about giving people the independence we are talking about, together with the power and finance, we should be able to give them the right to formulate policy and then present it to the Minister of the day.  If the Minister and Government of the day wish to implement it, that is a matter for them. Further on the legislation provides that the report will be laid before the Oireachtas.  I have sought the publication of that report.  Then I have no doubt the Minister, whoever he or she is, will come into the House and answer as to why the policy was not implemented.  I am not going back over the word &ldquo;teeth&rdquo;; we have said so often this morning that this institute should get the muscle, the teeth, in order to present to the Government a policy on marine affairs.  Let me say once more that this is new legislation and we cannot compare the institute with Teagasc or FÁS or any other such body in real terms.  It is a new venture.  It is going to tap into one of our most valuable resources, we hope, for the benefit of all the people.  That is why it is very important to get the legislation right at <Col N="1489" /> the start, to get it in place to give these people, whoever they may be, who will be appointed by the Minister, the freedom to act and present policy to Government for the Government to implement. If the Government do not wish to implement the policy, the Minister will come back and give the reasons.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I want to clarify and to confirm beyond a shadow of doubt what I have been stating over the past half hour or so.  Section 4 (3) (c) of the Bill says: &ldquo;enter into joint-ventures so as to undertake or further the application of marine research and development&rdquo;. I think that clarifies what is worrying Deputy Gilmore.  If the Deputy agrees with me that policy is ultimately a matter for Government, there is no difference between his concept of &ldquo;formulate&rdquo; and the Bill's concept of &ldquo;advise&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Advise&rdquo; is correct and in line with what the Deputy is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come to section 19 (1) to confirm what has already been stated if you, Sir, will allow me to mention it.  It provides that at the end of each financial year the institute shall furnish to the Minister a report in writing drawn up in consultation with relevant Ministers &ldquo;(a) <Col N="1490" /> outlining its proposed activities (other than day-to-day activities) in the financial year immediately following&rdquo;.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2) (f), line 21, after &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and control&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment adverts to what we have been discussing this afternoon and indeed this morning.  It is designed to enhance the role of the institute in the execution of its brief.  It is the intention of the Government that the institute will make a meaningful contribution in the area of marine research and will, therefore, have a lead role in relation to Exchequer or State-sponsored funding of proposals for marine research and development.  I have already adverted to that matter this morning during the course of the debate on other amendments which were put forward by the Deputies opposite.  I pointed out then, and I want to reiterate, that it is the firm intention, as illustrated by this amendment, to provide for proper and appropriate powers of meaningful control for the institute over research and development proposals.  This institute will most certainly have teeth.  The Bill as drafted, with the enhancement of this amendment, will ensure that there is effective control by the institute over all matters pertaining to its statutory remit. I commend the amendment to the House on the basis of what I have outlined.  I have no doubt that it will help to reassure Deputies in relation to the concerns they expressed this morning and afternoon in this context.  To put it briefly, this amendment strengthens section 4 in a very meaningful way because it gives a certain priority to research and development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I know what it means.  The Minister, quite rightly, referred to our discussions earlier this morning.  I understand what &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo; means, different bodies engaged in different areas of research. <Col N="1494" /> Quite clearly, I understand the role of the institute as far as co-ordination of those proposals is concerned but what does &ldquo;control of the proposals&rdquo; mean? Does it mean that if an individual research body, various research centres, one of the universities, the Central Fisheries Board, BIM, or any of the bodies which are carrying out marine research and development, have a proposal for marine research and development they cannot develop it of their own accord but must go through the Marine Institute?  Is that what &ldquo;control&rdquo; means?  I would be unhappy about the Minister having a controlling hand in the workings of the institute and, equally, particularly in the context of the amendment in my name which was defeated this morning, I would be unhappy about the institute controlling the activities of the various research bodies.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Deputy misrepresents my words all the time.  I will repeat what I already said; it is the intention of the Government that the institute will make a meaningful contribution in the area of marine research and will, therefore, have a lead role in relation to Exchequer or State-sponsored funding or proposals for marine research and development.  That is as simple as it could be.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Gilmore, I find it difficult to understand exactly what is meant.  I understand &ldquo;co-ordination&rdquo; but the Minister is saying that the proposal can only go so far and no further.  That is control.  In other words, the Minister is limiting the extent of a proposal if it is controlled.  That is the way I interpret it but maybe I am wrong.  I should like to know exactly what is in the mind of the Minister and the Department in relation to controlling. Will the Minister put limitations on the proposals?  Will he not give the bodies concerned the freedom to make their proposal as broad-based or as extensive as they may feel is necessary or desirable for that proposal?  It is desirable to co-ordinate and present a proposal to have <Col N="1495" /> it examined, but to control it is an unacceptable degree of interference.</P>

      <P>I want to try to tease this out.  In practice, will it mean that whatever State funding is available for marine research and development will be allocated to the Marine Institute which will then disburse it among the various bodies?  Is it the intention that individual bodies, when they want to advance a project or put forward a proposal, will go to the Marine Institute?  Who will decide whether it will go ahead?  If it does go ahead, will the Marine Institute supervise that project or proposal?  Is that what is intended by &ldquo;control&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>There was a lengthy debate on this Bill in the Seanad and it passed Second Stage in this House.  On none of those Stages was there any intimation that the Minister intended to introduce an amendment to add the term &ldquo;control&rdquo;.  Clearly, something happened after the Bill was passed by the Seanad and had gone through Second Stage here to cause the Minister to include the term &ldquo;control&rdquo; in the functions of the institute.</P>
      <P>Why is the Minister introducing this amendment now when it was not introduced earlier?  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, it appears to be very much an afterthought. Who asked to have it introduced? Were represenations made to the Minister that this would strengthen the Bill?  The House should be informed.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in trying to explain why he introduced the word &ldquo;control&rdquo;, said he did so to enhance the co-ordination role of the institute.  I do not see how the word &ldquo;control&rdquo; could enhance co-ordination.  Controlling is totally unrelated to co-ordinating.  The two words have different meanings.  Control does not enhance co-ordination, as the Minister suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a relationship between subsection (2) (b) and subsection (2) (f) because under subsection (2) (b) the institute shall carry out policy as may be specified by the Minister on marine research <Col N="1497" /> and development.  Subsection (2) (f) talks about research and development which may be specified by the Minister but which now will be co-ordinated and controlled. To get down to brass tacks, by introducing this word the Minister is taking even tighter control of marine research and development.  It is ridiculous, and it is going down a tunnel which is becoming increasingly narrow and further inhibiting the independence of the institute.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the word &ldquo;control&rdquo; is being introduced to enhance co-ordination and give greater independence, but in essence it will give tighter control to the Minister and the Department in relation to proposals for which funding will be sought.  It is about time the Minister came clean on why he is introducing the word &ldquo;control&rdquo;.  The amendment is not at all as well intentioned as it may appear on the surface.  I am somewhat suspicious as to why it is being introduced at this point.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The intention is to empower a national institute, the Marine Institute, to control the overall national approach in the allocation of funds for worthwhile research.

      <P>For the information of Deputy Gilmore, the Chair tries to co-ordinate and control, and co-ordination would not be much use unless the Chair also had control.  Would the Deputy not think that maybe we have exhausted anything worthwhile to be said here?</P>

      <P>The analogy is a very useful one, because we often get more control than co-ordination in this House. That is very much what I am afraid of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an open mind on the Minister's amendment.  I do not know whether the amendment will improve the provision or make it worse.  I fear that it will make it worse, that what is proposed is to give the institute not independence from the Minister or the Department of the Marine which is what we were seeking, but a role which will allow them to meddle in the activities of individual agencies.  For example, UCC could have proposals for research and development in the area of wave energy.  If they went <Col N="1499" /> to the Marine Institute with their proposal and the Department of the Environment had a proposal in the same area, I could understand the institute's role in co-ordinating the two.  I understand the concept of co-ordination but I want to understand the concept of control.  Will the Minister clarify whether that means that if the institute decide to fund a proposal on wave energy advanced by UCC, the people responsible for that project in Cork will have officials from the Marine Institute coming along to inspect what they are doing?  In addition to having to advance the project, will they also be inundated with requests for reports and will people come to look over their shoulders to see what they are doing?  Will we witness that kind of bureaucratic rigmarole? I fear that is what is being put in place.  The Minister has not satisfied me on that point.  He has read the dictionary but he has not explained what &ldquo;control&rdquo; will mean in practice.  The institute have not been given the role they should be given.  Instead they are going to be set up as some kind of policeman for the Department to look at what the existing agencies are doing already and to duplicate it.</P>

It will simply be a matter of steering our efforts in the proper direction as funds become available from the Exchequer in the first instance.  As I said, the function of the institute when established will be to have an overview of the research being carried out and the overall finances and attach priority to certain areas.  As I also said, the board will be comprised of experts who are <i>au fait</i> with what is happening. They are the people who will make the decisions.  Rather than diminishing their powers, as has been suggested, we are giving them more powers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Institute shall have particular responsibilities&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to research the effects on the marine environment of the discharge of radioactive wastes from any source into the Irish Sea, the operation of nuclear generation and reprocessing plants near the Irish Sea and the transportation of nuclear waste through the Irish Sea,</P>
      <P>(b)  to monitor the discharge of radioactive wastes from any source into the Irish Sea, the operation of nuclear generation and re-processing plants near the Irish Sea and the transportation of nuclear wastes through the Irish Sea, and</P>
      <P>(c)  to participate in European initiatives in relation to these functions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important amendment and seeks to give the institute particular <Col N="1501" /> responsibilities.  We have spoken at length in this House about the serious threat posed to the security and safety of our people, the environment and our seas by the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield. Unfortunately, there has been more rhetoric than action.  Everybody wants it closed down and people are out-bidding each other in the degree they condemn it, but one of the problems we constantly face is that this State has not seriously researched the consequences of Sellafield.  We rely totally on the research being carried out by bodies such as Greenpeace, CORE &mdash; the Cumbrian organisation opposed to reprocessing and consultants appointed to work with groups such as Large and Associates. Here, the State most seriously affected by Sellafield has not got its act together. For example, we do not know to what extent our beaches have been polluted; we do not know with certainty to what extent fish life has been affected by Sellafield. We know that a number of developments are taking place.  The Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant &mdash; THORP &mdash; is due to commence operations in 1992. It will be the largest nuclear reprocessing plant in the world and will reprocess waste from all over Europe and as far away as Japan.  That nuclear waste will be transported through the Irish Sea without us knowing what condition the vessels are in or the standard of the containers with the result that an additional threat will be posed to this country and its people.</P>
    <P>The institute should be given the responsibility to assemble the information required to make the best possible case both to the British Government and to Europe.  I recall putting questions to the Minister for Energy at Question Time about the proposed case the Government were to take to Europe on the issue of Sellafield.  The Minister for Energy told me in reply that the case could not be taken to the European Court because we did not have enough evidence.  Why do we not have enough evidence?  The answer is that the Government have not gone out and systematically collected and collated the information.  It is no longer good enough that this State has to rely <Col N="1502" /> on the information and research carried out by voluntary organisations who are pitted against the well funded and well provided for, in terms of public relations, British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  What I am proposing is that the Marine Institute should now be given a specific responsibility in this area as it is the Irish Sea and the area around it which is most at risk from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>I have not mentioned Sellafield specifically in the amendment because, as the House is aware, there are other nuclear installations in Britain particularly on the west coast which pose a threat to us and the Irish Sea.  I mention Sellafield in particular because once THORP comes into operation in 1992 nuclear waste from Japan and other countries will be transported through the Irish Sea.  What will happen if one of those ships is involved in a collision? There already have been accidents and incidents involving relatively new vessels. This is one very serious matter which the Marine Institute should look at and the Government should take a case to Europe on the issue of Sellafield.  I have only the word of the Minister for Energy that the Irish Government do not have sufficient evidence to sustain a case in Europe.  I propose that the institute be given the specific job of doing the research and coming up with the information to be used in a European case or simply to persuade the British Government to close Sellafield or, at the very least, to stop reprocessing there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  It is a very important amendment and one that the Minister, and the Department, must take extremely seriously.  The dangers to us from radioactive waste released into the Irish Sea, not to talk of the reprocessing plant that will be in operation in 1992, are mindboggling and frightening.  I am worried about the lack of information available to the public in Ireland on what is happening.  Any information we have comes from voluntary organisations such as Greenpeace, groups interested in the <Col N="1503" /> general environment and specialists who have done research in that area.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the radioactive reprocessing plant and the carrying of substances in and out of the Irish Sea and around our coast.  One wonders what type of protection will be put in place in relation to the carriage at sea of such substances, what accountability there will be to the Irish Government, what information we will receive on the movement of ships that will carry such substances and what powers we will have to prevent the movement of such ships. It is a frightening prospect to think of this substance being moved so close to our country when we have no control over that movement.  Yet, if an accident were to occur Ireland would suffer most.</P>
      <P>In relation to the quality of vessels we do not know what standards will be imposed.  We know there are general world standards but, nevertheless, last year on the west coast serious accidents occurred involving ships of eight to ten years old.  The structure of those ships was highly questionable.  There is no point in telling us we will have the most modern up to date equipment because in recent times the most modern up to date shipping equipment has proved to be faulty.  It failed in circumstances where it should have survived without any difficulty.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Irish Sea, and the transportation of nuclear waste through it, we as a nation, and the Government representing us, should adopt a strong stance and object at every level, particularly at European level, to this.  The Marine Institute could play a vital role in regard to this.  They should have responsibility and power to carry out research on what is taking place, monitor it very closely and give the necessary information to put a strong case to Europe and to the offending Governments, if they can be termed as such.  We have been offended by what is happening at Sellafield and the attitude of the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that within various Departments, particularly in the Department of Energy, there is information <Col N="1504" /> which, if the general public were to become aware of, would result in a rising taking place in Ireland.  Perhaps I am wrong but I have an instinctive belief that information is available at present, as a result of Chernobyl fall-out, that is frightening. We have a responsibility to do everything possible to protect our people from any future disasters.  We have no way of monitoring the discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea not to mention controlling it.  Yet, we all know about the currents around this island and that fish are being caught and consumed by the Irish people.  What research is being done on the fish caught which is being consumed by our population?  This is a very serious issue and relates very fundamentally to the health of the Irish nation.  It must be taken extremely seriously by the Minister.  There is an opportunity for the Minister, and his colleague in the Department of Energy, to get together and give the Marine Institute specific responsibility in this area.  I urge the Minister to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  The Marine Institute would be the ideal vehicle to monitor, report on and, hopefully, to act on the nuclear discharge into the Irish Sea.  We all agree, and Government spokesmen have said over the past number of years, that Sellafield is the greatest threat to our waters. We should have some way of monitoring the discharge and the movement of nuclear waste through the Irish Sea.  Up to now we did not have the scientific knowledge we needed.  The Marine Institute will be the best organisation to check and control this the greatest threat to our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, I put down a question to the Minister for Defence regarding nuclear submarines in the Irish Sea and his reply was to the effect that they had a right to travel on the surface through our waters once they were flying their flag.  That <Col N="1505" /> is completely unacceptable because the threat from nuclear submarines is under water and not on the surface.  The monitoring of the movement of nuclear vessels in the Irish Sea should be part of the brief of the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment. The Minister has denied us the right to have the institute involved in the fishing industry.  I ask the Minister, even at this late stage to accept the amendment put down by Deputy Gilmore because it is vitally important.  The Marine Institute should have a special responsibility in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate last night I had expressed my regret at the introduction of this Bill <Col N="1506" /> by Fine Gael.  I did so because I felt it was a slur on the locally elected and other members of the vocational education committee and on vocational education committee teachers and members of staff.  I rejected the slur and I want to reject it again tonight.</P>
      <P>I should like to praise the dedication, enthusiasm and professionalism of all members of vocational education committee staff, particularly the teaching staff.  They have done a very good job, often in very difficult circumstances, down the years, they have catered for a sector of Irish society who would have been left behind if we did not have the vocational education committee system. They have looked after sectors of the community who would not have got an education otherwise within our education system.  For those reasons I reject any slur or innuendoes which might be cast on members of the vocational education committees by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
      <P>As I stated last night, the Bill proposes to remove the right of an employer, that is, the vocational education committee, to appoint their own employees.  What other similar organisation would hand over the right to select its own employees to an outside body?  I do not know of any such organisation.  I should like to ask why the vocational education committees should do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sat here last night hoping to be enlightened by the contributions of Deputy Bruton and Deputy Deenihan and I listened carefully to the arguments. I must say I was not very enlightened by their arguments and they did not put forward any reasons which would convince me to agree with this Bill.  The only reason given by Deputy Bruton last night, was, and I quote: &ldquo;There is the possibility that people might think that there was political influence in the appointment of teachers&rdquo;.  Is Deputy Bruton so naïve that he honestly believes any system could be put in place which would give rise to a situation where no one would believe there was the possibility that political influence might be used?  I think it would <Col N="1507" /> be impossible to try to meet those criteria. It does not matter how independent a body may seem to be or is meant to be by this House or the Minister concerned; I do not know of any body which everyone will agree is non-political or will not be influenced politically one way or the other.  Even though they may not be influenced politically that will not stop people believing political influence was exerted.  The argument put forward by Deputy Bruton last night that he wanted to remove &ldquo;the possibility that people might think that there was political influence in the appointment of teachers&rdquo; cannot be sustained.  He went on to say that 99.99 per cent of appointments made by the vocational education committees are excellent.  He also said that this Bill is designed to tackle the 0.01 per cent of appointments which he alleges may be tainted.</P>
    <P>To put the Bill in context, Deputy Bruton is asking this House to change a system of appointment which, at the current rate of recruitment, produces one so-called, to use his word, &ldquo;tainted&rdquo; decision in 10,000.  He wants to overturn a system which has worked exceedingly well for the past 60 years.  To put it further into context, at the current rate of recruitment, that means there is a possibility of one so-called &ldquo;tainted&rdquo; appointment over a period of 35 years.  I should like Deputy Bruton or any other Deputy to name any other body, independent or otherwise, which could boast such a record &mdash; one possible &ldquo;tainted&rdquo; appointment in 35 years.  Are Deputy Bruton and Deputy Deenihan seriously asking this House to remove such an effective and fair system of appointment and replace it with a Local Appointments Commission?  That is what they asked us to do last night but I do not understand why.</P>
    <P>He also said last night that members of the vocational education committee should not be the people to decide appointments to vocational education committee positions and that those who have experience of teaching should make the decisions.  I know Deputy Bruton never served on any local authority or <Col N="1508" /> vocational education committee and he may not be aware that in many cases the members of the vocational education committee have experience of teaching or are serving teachers.  Over and above that, the majority of the members of the vocational education committees are parents who have a wide range of experience of the educational system, whether primary, vocational or secondary.  For instance, in the case of my local vocational education committee the members of the board include a professor, a vocational teacher, a secondary teacher and a primary teacher together with a variety of other people who are professionals in their own spheres&mdash; farmers, auctioneers and so on.  There is quite a broad spectrum of society represented on the board of that vocational education committee and they, through their experience, are capable of making teacher appointments, or any other appointments, for the vocational education committee.  The fact that we have such a broad spectrum of opinion on the vocational education committee ensures that the process is fair and independent and that the teachers appointed to the scheme are not just educationally qualified but are suitable to meet all the other needs of the pupils and the schools in the vocational education committee system.</P>
    <P>The only other excuse for putting forward this Bill which I could discern in Deputy Bruton's or Deputy Deenihan's contributions was the need to introduce safeguards to the system and to establish an independent set of principles by which decisions could be made on appointments. There is probably some excuse for Deputy Bruton making a statement like that, but I am very surprised that Deputy Deenihan should say so because he has been a member of a local authority and a vocational education committee.  The statement shows a complete lack of understanding of the system as it operates currently.  The Minister referred to this last night.</P>
    <P>There are safeguards and independent principles in relation to the appointment of teachers.  The criteria and the principles that Deputy Bruton is seeking have <Col N="1509" /> been outlined in various circulars issued by the Department, especially Memo V.7 and Circular 16/79.  These circulars and other directives from successive Ministers have made quite clear the criteria to be used.  There are independent principles there at the moment.  One is the basic principle that a person who is not suitably qualified cannot be appointed. Another is that the full vocational education committee must approve the appointment of a teacher and in turn ministerial approval is necessary.  The selection board make a recommendation to the vocational education committee which they approve if they are satisfied and later the Minister formally approves. The decisions are made on the basis of independent principles outlined in circulars from the Department.</P>
    <P>There are further safeguards in the composition of the boards themselves. The central appointments board consists of three members of the vocational education committee, who do not have to be of the same political persuasion and in many cases are not, an IVEA official and a Department official overseeing the whole procedure.  The general appointments board consists of four vocational education committee members and a Department official.  Almost always CEOs and principals of schools will sit on the interview boards in an advisory capacity.  It is clear that there are safeguards and that the vocational education committees are operating under an independent set of principles.  The Department monitor very closely every appointment made by a vocational education committee.  In addition to the monitoring of the Department and of the full vocational education committee, the whole system is also monitored by the general public, precisely because it is democratic and open and the people making the decisions are answerable to the local community.  Not only is the system fair but it is seen to be fair and there is very little criticism of it.</P>
    <P>In the debate so far and in the debate last year there was some talk about controversial cases involving appointments by vocational education committees in <Col N="1510" /> the past two or three years.  I am aware of only three controversial cases.  The fact that we are aware of these cases shows the effectiveness of the system under which we operate.  When was the last time anybody in this House heard a criticism of the appointment of a secondary teacher anywhere?  There is no public scrutiny there.  If a vocational education committee do something which is incorrect, if a person is appointed who should not be appointed, it comes out in public.  It will be raised in public at a vocational education committee meeting and in the local and national press.  All these things can come to light because of the open system under which vocational education committees operate.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputies Bruton and Deenihan and anybody else supporting the Bill that we have a very effective system.  The most effective safeguard is the last one I mentioned, but the most important one is that the politicians on the vocational education committee have to face the electorate on a regular basis and the electorate are not slow in punishing mistakes and punishing people whom they feel have not acted in their best interests.  Irish people are very conscious of the need for education and all concerned about the future of their children. Any member of a vocational education committee who messes about with the future of children will be given an effective answer.  I have dwelt with this matter at some length because of the innuendo that there is a taint on appointments made by vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I have shown that the proposed Bill is unnecessary.  The only two reasons given do not stand up to any kind of examination. There is no taint on vocational education committee appointments. Deputy Bruton, using his own figures, said that 99.99 per cent of them are excellent and he said there may be a taint on one in every ten thousand.  The safeguards are in place and are more than adequate.  This leads me to wonder why the Bill has been introduced.  It is simply another attack on local democracy and the whole notion of subsidiarity in <Col N="1511" /> relation to Government, that is, decisions being made at the level nearest the people.  During the debate last year, in which I spoke, Deputies opposite shed crocodile tears because of the postponement of local elections and said everybody wanted local democracy and local elections and Fianna Fáil were running away from the people.</P>
    <P>This Bill exposes the hypocrisy of Fine Gael on this matter, demonstrating the real attitude of that party to real democracy at local level.  I have always contended that what is needed is not this type of Bill &mdash; when one divorces local democracy and input from procedures &mdash; but rather a lot more rather than less. Why should Deputies opposite call for more power for local communities when they do not want any of these local bodies to have any power at all?</P>
    <P>The proposed Bill is part of a general trend which is now fairly popular, that is to call for independent bodies for this, that and the other.  It is very fashionable to call for such bodies to take over the functions of a national or local body. Such calls may have been made because politicians generally are going down in public esteem.  It is my view that that is the fault of politicians themselves.  The trend towards bodies that are not answerable to the public, not open to public scrutiny, should be resisted.  Any such body should be amenable to local scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Politicians should be in a position to ensure that their wishes &mdash; as outlined in legislation enacted here on behalf of the electorate &mdash; are complied with and fully implemented.  There are too many decisions being taken nowadays by faceless bureaucrats not answerable to anybody and, when decisions are taken that do not suit the people generally, it is the politicians who get it in the neck. Therefore we should cop on to ourselves in this regard.</P>
    <P>I oppose this Bill also because of its impracticality.  I do not believe the Local Appointments Commission have any competence in the area of teacher recruitment. Neither do I think they have the <Col N="1512" /> requisite manpower.  We are all aware of the delays occasioned in filling appointments under the Local Appointments Commission.  Since the appointment of teachers must be made within a short period, I contend that this would not be practical.  Speaking as a teacher I contend that education and teaching are very different from the other spheres of responsibility of the Local Appointments Commission.  For example, it is relatively easy to specify objective guidelines and measurements in respect of local authority officers.</P>
    <P>Apart from their qualifications, at present catered for in relation to teachers, other aspects would have to be taken into account in deciding who may be the best teacher to fill a given post.  For example, one would have to take into account the local needs of any scheme, the specific needs of a school and perhaps extra curricular skills.  I do not believe the Local Appointments Commission would be in a position to judge those local needs.  Therefore, all they could go on would be any candidate's qualifications. It has been my experience as a teacher that, very often, those people who appear most highly qualified, most intelligent, do not always make the best teachers.  I contend there are other matters that must be taken into account than mere qualifications. I do not believe the Local Appointments Commission would be capable of taking all these extraneous matters into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to a TUI survey.  He spoke at some length about the dissatisfaction on the part of teachers with the vocational education committee system.  Of course dissatisfaction will be registered by way of any such survey; anybody who was unsuccessful in obtaining a job before an interview board will always register dissatisfaction.  I venture to suggest &mdash; from my experience at second level &mdash; that if a similar survey were conducted in that sector, the dissatisfaction registered there would be even greater.  There are no real interviews held at second level and, more importantly, responsible posts are allocated on the basis of seniority, not on <Col N="1513" /> ability, prospective input or anything else.</P>
    <P>There was also an allegation made here that the morale of teachers within the vocational education committee system is very low; it is not.  I reject that totally. At present their morale is very high and, it is fair to say, is rising.  The vocational education committees, led by the IVEA following on a period of perhaps having been on the defensive, are coming out fighting, seeking to fulfil their 1930 mandate. I might avail of this opportunity to compliment the Minister on her initiatives which have led to this resurgence of morale within the vocational education committee system.  In particular, I might refer to the expansion of the VPTPs, the arrival of all-Irish second level schools, one of which is located in my constituency in Rathcarn.  There are special programmes for travellers and the disadvantaged. There have been increases in the literacy allocation.  Indeed, many vocational education committees are now running more adult education courses catering for a variety of people who were not afforded such opportunities heretofore.</P>
    <P>In summary, I am opposing the Bill on the grounds that it is unnecessary, is totally impractical and constitutes an attack on local democracy, and indeed on the integrity of vocational education committee teaching staff.</P>

      <P>We lost this Bill in the spring of 1989 when there was a minority Fianna Fáil Government when, I suppose, the Opposition parties were able to get through somewhat more than they can now.  At that time the Second Stage of the Bill was agreed, all parties approving it.  At the time the Government, Fianna Fáil Party, did not disapprove and allowed it to proceed to the next Stage.  Unfortunately a general election took place and the Bill was not proceeded with.  I spoke on the Bill at that time but I might repeat some of the things I said then.  It is very important that it be understood that I stand fully <Col N="1514" /> behind the vocational education committees, the vocational education committee system, its independence and democratic nature.  I made that point clearly on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The 1930 Act is the only Education Act we have.  It laid down a democratic and secular system of education.  Indeed, it has been provided to date that it is bang up-to-date, that it is such a flexible system it can deal at all times with the most dramatic changes taking place in society and has done so particularly in the past ten or 15 years, proving that the necessary, progressive changes in curricular and teaching methods in vocational education committee schools can be effected way ahead of everything else. The system is unique in its democratic nature and close association with pupils, teachers, the overall system and needs of education, in projecting future needs and endeavouring to provide for such in the best possible manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stand by the vocational education committee system particularly because of its non-selective nature which is not and has not been recognised by successive Governments.  The vocational education committees do not have any selection process obtaining in their schools.  They take all applicants so long as they have room for them &mdash; the good and the bad, the excellent and the difficult, those with problems and those with none.  This means that their schools experience specific difficulties and problems not experienced by other second level schools.  Such difficulties have not been recognised by the respective Departments nor by Deputies on the Government side.  These people now defend the vocational education committee system but they had no defence to offer of it when it was subjected to so many cuts, to the enormous difficulty presented by an increase in pupil/teacher ratio to 20:1 at a time when they had so many needs not only in what are known as their technical schools in practical subjects and the need to have a much lower pupil/teacher ratio but also in terms of the difficult pupils they have in many areas.  These may be pupils who have extraordinary <Col N="1515" /> problems at home and who need special treatment and much more remedial teaching etc.  None of this was taken into account by the Deputies opposite.  They did not fight against the cuts imposed over the past number of years on the vocational education committee system.</P>
    <P>However, I defend the system.  I find it excellent and its democratic nature is very important.  Of course, democracy is not perfect, and there are imperfections in every system.  I have been on the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee since 1979 and I know of no selection made by that body that was wrong. Of course, I do not know if they were all right either but I could not name any case that I could say that was totally out of order, a purely political selection.  In 11 years on the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, nobody has come to me from any interview to say that it was dreadful, that the best people were not elected and that this or that happened. It is not just Fianna Fáil defending their control of the VECs currently because for 20 years before that when they were not in control, the same system existed, and the teachers had the same objections 20 or 30 years ago.  I am not putting anything at the door of any political group or political party.  I am saying simply that teachers are not satisfied. You do not have to say it is stupid that they are not satisfied, they should be satisfied.  They are not satisfied that all selections are made on merit.  That is probably an increasing problem now because of the enormous difficulties teachers have, first in getting jobs and, later, in being promoted so they are watching every system.</P>
    <P>The teachers always make the point that they are a professional body but nobody seems to recognise them as such. Medicine is a profession as is architecture. In local authorities all appointments are made by the Local Appointments Commission.  That is at the root of the argument, not that there is corruption or that wrong appointments are made.  Teachers are the only professional body who, on a local level, are <Col N="1516" /> not selected by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>The feeling has been expressed to me that when people are interviewed by boards in different vocational education committees they are aware of the political connotations of the board.  They are people they know and they wonder how much the board know about them, whether they will have seen them at this or that meeting, or whether a letter to a newspaper, perhaps, will have annoyed them.  In other words, interviewees will feel they are being assessed by people of a particular political persuasion.  That makes them question whether that board could possibly make an honest decision. I am convinced that all boards I have been on made honest and straightforward decisions but that feeling of dissatisfaction is there among teachers. They are not sure whether merit alone was the deciding factor.  In many cases they also feel that the interview boards are not competent or professional.  Irrespective of whether an appointment made was correct, comments have been made to me that the interviewers on the board did not seem to know their job.  They did not seem to know what they were looking for or what type of questions to ask, etc. There is that lack of confidence in the boards.</P>
    <P>I do not know what all interview boards are like but on the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee the principal of a school to which an appointment is being made is always there.  He &mdash; or she &mdash; is not a member of the board but is there and can ask questions and so on.  The Department's inspector is present and there is a certain professionalism, but the remainder of the board, the majority of the deciders on the board, are not professional interviewers. They are ordinary people.  They can assess a person's character and so on rather than his or her ability to teach or the other qualifications the applicant may require for the job of teaching.  For these reasons there has been among teachers for quite a long time a feeling that they should have independent professional interviewers on boards appointing them <Col N="1517" /> to jobs in the first place and promotions thereafter at second and third level.</P>
    <P>I made it clear last year when speaking on this matter that the vocational education committees are not the only ones with interview boards who may be prejudiced or discriminatory or anything of that sort.  If any discrimination is alleged against vocational education committee interview boards it is on the basis of political affiliation.  I repeat I have not found that on the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  In the other teaching areas, in the appointment of teachers to primary schools, for instance, the selection board for teachers would consist of the chairman of the board of management, most likely the parish priest, the principal of the school and an independent assessor appointed by the patron in consultation with the chairman of the board, in other words, appointed by the bishop in consultation with the parish priest.  That is for an ordinary teaching appointment.</P>
    <P>For a principalship there are three on the selection board, being the chairperson of the board of management and two assessors appointed by the patron in consultation with the chairman of the board of management.  Two assessors appointed by the bishop in consultation with the parish priest appoint a principal. I do not think that system is independent or competent.  It is not professional in any way.  It is outrageous.  This procedure is open to discriminatory appointments on the basis of perceived morality, ethics, possible attitudes to religion and, minority views on various issues.  Consequently, all sorts of biases and prejudices could be brought into play when a selection is being made for teaching appointments. In March last year I pointed out that I had occasion to question the previous Minister for Education, Gemma Hussey, a few years ago on the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association guidelines for the selection of teachers in which they said that only practising Roman Catholics would be considered for new appointments as teachers.  The Minister defended that.  Even though the teachers were paid by the State it was a <Col N="1518" /> matter for the Catholic primary school managers to decide on the selection of the teachers.  I thought that was totally wrong at the time.  I still think it is totally wrong.  For that reason I said last year that while I would be supporting the Bill on Second Stage, I hoped the Government would accept an amendment on Committee Stage allowing local appointments commissions to handle all teaching appointments, that I did not see why there was a greater need in the vocational education committee area than in other areas to have local appointments commissions. That is still my position.  I will be proposing an amendment when the Bill reaches Committee Stage that all teaching appointments be made under a local appointments commission to ensure that there will be no prejudice or bias, political, religious or otherwise &mdash; and I believe such prejudice is widespread.</P>
    <P>On 1 March 1989 at column 2091 of the Official Report the junior Minister, Deputy Fahey, in pointing out that the Government would be formulating legislation for the vocational education committee and the regional technical colleges and that the ideas in Deputy Bruton's Bill and some ideas put forward by people who spoke on it would be incorporated in it, said:</P>
    <P>Very significant also in the Minister's drafting of the new legislation will be the viewpoint put forward by the Teachers' Union of Ireland in their support for and acceptance of the measures in general in this Bill.  Once again let me say that the view of the TUI is very important in the considerations of the Minister.  The Minister is careful at all times to consult with and listen to the advice of the TUI, as she does with the other unions.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome this Bill and the provisions contained in it.  The specifics and the details have to be considered further perhaps and I am glad to say that the Minister will be giving full consideration and will welcome an opportunity to have further discussions with the various spokespeople on the drafting of the legislation for the <Col N="1519" /> development and rationalisation of the Vocational Education sector.</P>
    <P>That was just a year and six months ago. The same Bill is before us now and roughly the same things have been said in defence of the Bill, but a dramatic change has occurred in the Minister's attitude. I hope Deputy Fahey's attitude has not changed and that he will repeat what he said last year.  The Minister, so far, seems to have changed her attitude completely on this Bill and now she finds the Bill totally unacceptable.  I do not know what changed in the meantime except, of course, the type of Government.  Now Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have a majority.  At that time they were shaky, let us say.  Therefore, were they simply saying what they said last year from a political viewpoint without any sincerity or thought for the educational point that was being made and the importance to the education system of what they said last year?  Does that still stand?  Is the Teachers' Union of Ireland as important this year as it was in 1989? Are we saying now in 1990 that the Teachers' Union of Ireland does not count, that we do not listen to their views anymore but make up our own minds and make our own decisions?</P>
    <P>The junior Minister should now make clear what has changed since 1989 because it is as important to clarify this issue now as it was last year.  I asked last year if the whole rationalisation programme that they had begun was scrapped. That apparently is now the position although they did not admit it in the spring of last year.  What type of legislation have they coming up in the vocational education committee system when they talk about drafting legislation for the development and rationalisation of the vocational education sector?  Is there anything in mind at the moment apart from the Colleges Bill for third level?  Are there any new developments whatever coming up?  Has the Minister any thoughts on the vocational sector?  Is it intended, now that there is a bit of money in hand to, for instance, reduce <Col N="1520" /> the pupil/teacher ratio again to some practical level, to provide the administrative and caretaker staffs that are required in the vocational education committee system, to provide the funding that is necessary for that, because many schools are being run down and feel they are being put out of business?</P>
    <P>I am simply saying, as I said last year, that I am supporting this Bill.  It is absolutely essential and there is no point in Deputies opposite saying the morale of the teachers is very high when their union says the morale of teachers is low.  It is nonsense to keep saying that morale is high and getting higher.  How could morale be getting higher when there are so many teachers without jobs, when they are breaking their necks, so to speak, in huge classes that they cannot handle, when they have not got a school psychological service, remedial services etc? How can morale be high when they have not got an appointments system they can have faith in?  All they want is to be able to have faith in the appointments system to know that if they lose the job the decision was made by an independent body which decided on merit.  That might have happened under the present system but the candidate knew what their politics were and if turned down may have felt that the board had been politically biased when that may not have been the case at all.  Nevertheless the opportunity for that thought is there under the system.</P>
    <P>I will, therefore, be putting down an amendment for Committee Stage that a Local Appointments Commission be involved in the appointment of all teachers. There is no point in saying such a commission could not handle that task. Appointments to a commission can be made in such a way as to ensure they would be competent in that respect.  We could have said that at the beginning. When the Local Appointments Commission was first thought of the argument that the Deputy opposite is making now was made then.  The Local Appointments Commission was, however, put through because it was seen to be fair, to be independent and to be above board and above politics.  That is all that is required <Col N="1521" /> now.  We are not saying anybody is doing anything wrong.  We are simply saying we should have a clear professional body which is independent, the same as other professionals in local authorities have. That is what the TUI are saying and I think they are correct in that.</P>

      <P>I have listened with very great interest to what Deputy Mac Giolla had to say.  I thought his contribution was quite a good one but I am slightly bemused at his attitude.  In the first place he stated that he has a tremendous regard for the system that has been in place up to now and that he, in his long years of experience on a Vocational Education Committee and on selection boards, has never found any problem with the selections made.  He said none has come to his notice, and I am sure if there were problems they would have come to his notice or indeed to the notice of his party. That also has been my experience as someone who has been a member of a Vocational Education Committee as long as Deputy Mac Giolla.  Indeed, I sat on selection boards and never experienced difficulties or heard criticisms in relation to selections.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla accused the Minister, Deputy Fahey, of adopting a peculiar stance in 1989.  He said the system was working well and was a good system but, on the other hand, he said he was supporting a Bill to change the system. There is no point in bringing in legislation to change a system that people say is working well.  I cannot understand the Deputy's stance on that.  It is also a nonsense for him to criticise Fianna Fáil's commitment to the vocational education committee system.  Our support for that system is one of the hallmarks of our party in Government through the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil Governments have invested sizeable amounts of Exchequer funds in the Vocational Education Committee system and that is <Col N="1522" /> incontrovertible.  The Minister mentioned a number of matters in her speech which are relevant to my area and I would like very briefly to deal with them.  I will then come back to the issue that is before us in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The first matter I would like to refer to is the Youthreach programme which is up and running in Dundalk.  There are two very good community training centres in Dundalk, Ógra Dún Dealgan and the Tower workshop which is for travelling people.  The Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was in Dundalk recently and saw at first hand the great work that is going on in conjunction with the Department of Education and his own Department, organised by the local Vocational Education Committee.  In the Ógra workshop, which is mainly for young unemployed people who have no education, the placement is excellent &mdash; in the region of 75 per cent &mdash; and I would like to compliment the organisers of that workshop.  Under the aegis of the Department of Education a youth officer has been appointed to one of the disadvantaged areas in Dundalk and is working well.  I compliment the Department, and particularly the Minister, Deputy Fahey, who has some involvement in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other programme is the vocational training opportunity scheme, two of which were set up recently in Dundalk and Drogheda.  I understand they are just up and running.  Each one has a complement of 20 and they are working fairly well.  The whole idea, obviously, is to allow people who are over 21 years and on the dole for a long time retrain.  It is essential that society, and the State's structures, respond quickly to changing needs in the workplace, and that is one of the reasons this scheme will be very successful in the coming years.  Hopefully, as the Minister has said, it will be expanded in the future.  The VPT has been up and running in the Dundalk area for a number of years under the County Louth Vocational Education Committee and there are approximately 200 people involved this year.  The upturn in the economy and the creation of about <Col N="1523" /> 30,000 jobs, will mean that the VPT will have much more relevance in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned adult literacy. Most of us know this is international literacy year.  In the County Louth Vocational Education Committee area tremendous work is being done by local volunteers, and Vocational Education Committee members, in regard to adult education.  I compliment the NALA, the National Adult Literacy Association on the tremendous work they do in this area.  They liaise with adult education committees around the country.  Deputy Dempsey mentioned that there has been a sizeable increase in the budget for adult literacy in the last year and that is to be very much welcomed. The local Vocational Education Committee work in conjunction with the various community bodies as well as the resource centre for the unemployed in the whole area of adult education and this should be complimented.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's Bill which is before the House is an indication of the malaise that has been in Fine Gael over the past number of years.  Deputy Bruton was given some advice by the Taoiseach this morning and if I was to give him some more advice in relation to the Bill it is that he should not endeavour to attack local democracy, because that is really what his Bill is all about.  It is indicative of the snide implications made in regard to local representatives.  I wonder if the suggestion in the Bill has the complete support of the Fine Gael organisation.  I doubt very much if that is the case.  I doubt if those Fine Gael members who are on Vocational Education Committees agree with what is suggested in the Bill.  I would like to hear comments from some Fine Gael people on that matter.  I have spoken to a number of them in my area and they do not support the Bill.</P>
    <P>The people who sit on Vocational Education Committees have wide experience. Many of them are politicians and others are teachers.  Indeed, many of the politicians are teachers, as is the case in <Col N="1524" /> the Vocational Education Committee in my area, and they have great faith in the system that is in place.</P>

      <P>That is one of the major flaws in what is being proposed.  In my own area &mdash; I am not sure if this is laid down in legislation &mdash; membership of the selection boards is reviewed every year. That ensures, and obviously has ensured down the years, that there is no problem in relation to selections.  To give the responsibility to the Local Appointments Commission would increase bureaucracy and lead to selections not being made on time and consequent instability in the schools.  A school would not be able to respond to the need for an extra teacher at short notice and that is one of the flaws I see in the proposed system.  The Local Appointments Commission, while they do good work in other areas, may not work as quickly or as well as the local selection boards under the Vocational Education Committees.</P>

    <P>The Fine Gael Party have an ideological problem with decentralisation.  In 1980 <Col N="1525" /> we tried to decentralise offices to the regions but the programme was stopped in 1982 when the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party came to power.  For instance, an office was to be decentralised to Dundalk and it would have been in place years ago if the Government had allowed the decentralisation programme to go forward.  We returned to power in 1987 and we reactivated the decentralisation programme.  We are in the process of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He said that 0.001 per cent of the selections are not correct but that has been said about the Local Appointments Commission in relation to the appointment of gardaí.  This is just playing to the gallery, trying to put one over on the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke; it is Deputy Bruton just trying to make a name for himself. He may do that over the next week or so although I am not sure.  This is an attack on local democracy and it should go out loud and clear from this Chamber that Fine Gael are trying to attack local democracy.

      <P>The Bill before us is called the Local Authorities (Officers and <Col N="1527" /> Employees) (Amendment) Bill.  Basically, there are two methods by which local authority personnel are appointed. One is by the appointments committee and the other is by the Local Appointments Commission.  The appointments committee is a sub-committee of the county councils and the Local Appointments Commission is an independently set up body.  They have both done quite good work over the years and there is no point in criticising them.  Some years ago more people were appointed under the appointments committee than is the case at present.</P>

      <P>It did not at that time although, if I had thought of it, I could have given it as an excuse.  It was not the most gratifying three days' work I ever did and it became even less gratifying when, on one occasion, I was leaving a councillor's house and I saw the familiar form of a colleague of mine waiting at the gate to see the man I had just left, presumably on the same errand.  I do not know which of us spun the better yarn that evening, perhaps my friend was of a similar persuasion politically as the councillor I had visited but I was still doing the rounds when the next job came up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Vocational Education Committee at present teachers are appointed by the appointments committee, yet the Chief Executive Officers are appointed by the Local Appointments Commission. One would think that what is sauce for <Col N="1528" /> the goose is sauce for the gander. Traditionally, many teachers have a liking for politics and it would not be the most pleasant sight for a young teacher going in for an interview to be confronted by three politicians of the opposite persuasion. Of course, it might be just as unnerving to see three people of his own political persuasion there because, either way, the finger of suspicion could be pointed at the teacher &mdash; if he got the job &mdash; and at the politicians on the board if he did not get it.  I am not saying that those interviewers would be unfair but the suspicion would be there and it would not be good for anyone.  The Minister for Education spent some years in the profession and no doubt it equipped her to handle her onerous job.</P>
    <P>It is natural that there are misfits in many jobs but, although a person may be a misfit in one job, it does not necessarily mean that would be the case in another field.  It is the duty of an interview board to size up the applicant and if it is realised that the person is unsuited for the position for which he or she has applied it would be doing a tremendous disservice to appoint him or her.  Can the interview board be criticised for not realising that if they do not have any expertise in interviewing? That is the situation with the appointments committee.  On the other hand, the Local Appointments Commission have the necessary skills for interviewing. They have developed techniques and an ability to analyse the capabilities of an applicant.  If we relied more on the Local Appointments Commission we would have fewer misfits in many walks of life.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is just as well that the Local Appointments Commission have nothing to do with the appointment of politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an ESRI report recently published, one of the main reasons for community colleges not being accepted was the method by which teachers in the Vocational Education Committees were <Col N="1529" /> appointed and the method by which promotions were made.  If people in a job, in this case teachers, do not trust the methods of appointment and promotions it is not good or their morale.  They will lack confidence in themselves and in the system leading to a lack of interest in the job.  That will be reflected in poorer teaching standards and the people who will suffer will be the up and coming generation.</P>
    <P>The only criteria for any appointment should be suitability for the job.  The appointments committee which is a sub-committee of the county council are not in a position to judge fairly the capabilities of an interviewee.  Since the Local Appointments Commission is ideally equipped with trained personnel that is the body which should have responsibility appointing teachers.  Accordingly, I will support the motion this evening.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton in introducing this Bill indicated to the House that he was quite satisfied in the vast majority of cases, almost to the point where only a negligible number of wrong decisions have been made.  Far be it from me to indicate to Members opposite the qualities which should be sought in a future Leader of Fine Gael, but we are allowed a little mischief when we get the chance.  It has been suggested that Deputy Bruton is an original thinker.</P>

      <P>If Fine Gael want to look at how original he is let them look at this Bill.  There has been an admission that there is nothing wrong in the vast majority of cases and that the system is good but Deputy Bruton suggests we should change the system.  That is very original.  On that basis alone the Deputy should unanimously be adopted as Leader of Fine Gael &mdash; if that is the test of originality being looked for in a prospective alternative Taoiseach.

    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> Deputy Mac Giolla whose contributions are usually logical outlined how farseeing the 1930 Vocational Education Act is and said it allows for democratic control.  The great thing about Vocational Education Committee schools is that they are not selective in the pupils they take.  I was a student in a Vocational Education Committee school.  To suggest, that we should change the system because someone might have a grievance if he did not get a job, is quite incredible.  Deputy Mac Giolla, a very watchful, diligent, local representative in the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee over the last 11 years cannot point to one instance he knows of where there was any malfeasance in relation to any applicant for any job.  On the basis that we are all members of the human race and subject to even a tinge of fallibility, to which perhaps the new Leader of Fine Gael might not admit, that is a very good system.</P>

      <P>How does it work in Offaly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In Offaly it works impeccably and that came from the Fine Gael Member of the appointments commission, a person the Deputy would know well, Mrs. Hanafy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Vocational Education Committee meeting which discussed the public pronouncements made by Deputy Bruton &mdash; the forerunner to this legislation &mdash; some of the foremost critics of any suggestion which would taint local representatives came from the members of the Fine Gael Party on the County Offaly Vocational Education Committee. As a Member of Offaly Vocational Education Committee I had no hand, act or part in any appointment. I have not canvassed on behalf of anyone for any appointment.  I have total confidence in those who are there to make those appointments.  I am satisfied as to the competence and integrity of everyone of those public representatives in County Offaly to make the proper decision because they are all committed to the <Col N="1531" /> Vocational Education Committee system.</P>
    <P>On the basis that Deputy Bruton, Deputy Mac Giolla nor any other Member has evidence of malfeasance, I would ask them to stop undermining the system which they claim to be seeking to redress of taint, when there is no evidence except in 0.001 per cent of cases.  Let us get our act together.  If we believe in democratic control, if we believe we are competent as local representatives to make decisions in conjunction with a Department of Education official, in the attendance of the chief executive officer of the local Vocational Education Committee, and if we are suggesting that that system is as open and democratic a system as one could get and in line with the philosophy of the 1930 Act and vocational education in terms of local autonomy and accountability, I fail to see how any number of faceless and well intentioned bureaucrats under the local Appointments Commission can make a better decision.  In inferring they would make a better decision one would have to question the integrity, competence and ability of the local vocational education committee to do the same job.  In the absence of any such evidence, the logical conclusion is that the Vocational Education Committees can do this job just as well, if not better, than any other group one wishes to put up against them.  Those are the facts.</P>
    <P>It is not good that politicians at national level should try to deprive local politicians of an opportunity to display their competence and ability.  We should remember that they represent the local people.  There has been much talk about the Constitution in recent weeks in relation to other matters.  Under the Constitution parents are the primary educators of our children.  Why then do we think that the local representatives of the people are incapable of appointing people to educate their children under the non-selective system operated by the vocational education sector?  We should not bring forward legislation in this House &mdash; this was the line of thinking <Col N="1532" /> of Deputy Mac Giolla &mdash; to satisfy the figment of someone's imagination or, in the case of Deputy Bruton, who perhaps was making a trial run at pandering to minority interests, the 0.001 per cent.  He is going to have to pander to a few more minority interests within the Fine Gael Party next week.  In the absence of any evidence he proceeded to ask this House to change a system not on the basis that he had any evidence that it was not working efficiently but on the basis that he is an original thinker.</P>
    <P>Having regard to how far we have come in vocational education we should not accept the idea that politicians are incapable of making decisions to the benefit of the people we are supposed to be serving.  It seems that at the first sign of trouble we appoint a commission or get a bureaucrat or civil servant to sort it out. The attitude seems to be that even though he may never have heard of where one comes from he will know anyway as he has been trained in an ivory tower to look after such problems.  I stand over everything I say but as politicians we are asking the Irish people to accept that there is a problem, even though there is no evidence which suggests this, and to let the Local Appointments Commission to look after it.  I think that is an outrageous suggestion.  From the other side of their mouths these people will talk about giving more responsibility to the people and allowing more decision making at local level &mdash; the enterprise society.  We cannot have it every way and if that whiter than white attitude is brought to its logical conclusion some very eminent careers will be dispelled for very spurious reasons.</P>
    <P>It is about time politicians at all levels stood up to say that they represent the people and that the people will get rid of them if they do not want them on the committee or on a local body.  If there is evidence of wrong doing in any city or county VEC this can be rectified.  A motion could be put down to remove members from the committee.  It is as simple as that.  There is no evidence that any problem exists, it only seems to exist in someone's imagination.  If a wrong <Col N="1533" /> decision is made it is up to the committee to sort it out.  If there is a case of blatant wrongdoing I have no doubt that the officials of the Department of Education will let the Minister know fairly quickly. I would expect them to do this but this has not happened as the evidence shows that the proper procedures are being adopted.</P>
    <P>Having said that it is important to bear in mind, having regard to the demographic changes taking place by the end of the year 2002, that there will be 30 per cent reduction in pupils in the post-primary sector.  We have to examine the structures to ensure that that sector will continue to be responsive to the needs of the day.  The Irish Vocational Education Association have brought forward a discussion document in which they state that that sector is prepared to change and evolve in partnership with the other sectors in education, primary, post-primary and third level, within the regions. However, the other sectors will have to move before the vocational education committees can be asked to give up their autonomy and the powers they operate both lawfully and correctly.</P>
    <P>Recently I spoke to a retired teacher who was one of the pioneers of vocational education in the counties of Offaly and Westmeath.  He told me that they had to canvass and go looking for students for the vocational education system.  They targeted, in particular, farmers' sons and daughters and others who, through economic necessity, had to leave primary school at an early age and who did not have the choice of continuing in any form of education.  The vocational education system has come a long way since those days.  The idea then was that the local representatives and vocational education committees would decide on the way they would proceed.  People were answerable to the vocational education committees, local representatives, local officials of the vocational education committees and the other interests represented on the vocational education committee.  That is as it should be.  It is wrong to try to make any changes in the areas of selection, policy making or building priorities as <Col N="1534" /> this flies in the face of the achievements of the vocational education system under the present mode of operation.  It is particularly galling to seek change when no evidence has been put forward to show that such change is necessary and argue that the power to make decisions should be given to a centralised, faceless and unaccountable set up.</P>
    <P>The Irish Vocational Educational Association in their discussion document &mdash; this should be for discussion only at this stage &mdash; submit that local education authorities should be set up on a county basis to deal not only with primary, post-primary and tertiary education but also informal education such as adult education, outdoor pursuits, itinerant training workshops, community workshops, Youthreach, the various opportunity schemes, the vocational training and preparation programme and night classes.  All these are provided by the vocational education system which has evolved in such a way as to ensure that education is provided to a section of our community to whom it otherwise would not be available.  Members of this House are attempting to have the power to make decisions taken from that set up and given to those who are unaccountable.  The attitude seems to be that yes, they can run their VECs, seek to have schools built and offer night classes but that they do not have the competence to decide who teaches in their schools.  Where is the logic and the democracy in that?  We should remember that the numbers are increasing in many vocational education committees, including my own, and that people are sending their children to those schools because of the high quality teachers who have been appointed under the present structures.  That represents a vote of confidence in the County Offaly Vocational Education Committee as it does in other vocational education committees and it should not be interfered with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he is not prepared to accept the amendment.  We tried to accommodate all aspects of Deputy Gilmore's amendment in our amendment No. 6. We suggested that the institute be responsible for the fishing industry and merchant marine.  It would appear now <Col N="1536" /> that the Minister, despite all our protestations, is not prepared to consider the dangers of the dumping of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea.  That is a sad reflection on the Bill.  That was one of the most important amendments to the Bill.  I have outlined the dangers and the institute is the right vehicle to monitor and act on them.  Will the Minister indicate if he is prepared to take it on board for Report Stage?  However, he is adamant that he is not prepared to accept it and I am sure Deputy Gilmore will have something else to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy Gilmore indicate if he is anxious that I put the question on his amendment or is there some further contribution he would like to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank the Chair for his generosity in not putting the amendment in my absence.  I did not realise we had reached that stage of finality on it.  There are two things about the Minister's contribution I would like to take up.  The first is that he stated that the intention in the amendment was already dealt with in the Bill.  That line of argument has come up a few times today on amendments those of us on this side of the House are trying to advance. The Minister seems to give the impression that they are in some way accommodated in the Bill but clearly that is not the case.  I am seeking to give the Marine Institute a specific function. Quite honestly it is as valid to give the Marine Institute a specific function to examine the implications of Sellafield, and other nuclear installations adjacent to the Irish Sea, as it is to give the institute responsibility to organise seminars and lectures which merits a paragraph in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second line of argument which disturbs me somewhat is that it is not really the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine but of the Minister for Energy.  Clearly, Sellafield has an impact on the Irish Sea.  It is not simply a question of nuclear energy being an issue of concern to the Irish Government.  Surely, <Col N="1537" /> the Department of the Marine, and the Minister, have responsibility for the Irish Sea and the implications of nuclear waste discharges into the Irish Sea.  Is the Minister for the Marine telling us that he does not feel he has a responsibility in this area?  There was reference also to the Nuclear Energy Board being the appropriate body to carry out the research but my understanding is that the Nuclear Energy Board will be wound up under the terms of the Radiological Protection Bill.  Therefore, there is not much point in asking a body about to be wound up under the terms of another Bill, to do the research I am seeking.</P>
    <P>The kind of research on and attention to Sellafield I am seeking is specifically related to marine matters.  There has been evidence over the years of radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea.  We want to know &mdash; and we do not know &mdash; the full extent of radioactive pollution of the Irish Sea.  It has been described by no less a body than the House of Commons environment committee as the most radioactive sea in the world.  That committee can tell us it is the most radioactive sea in the world because they, and the British authorities, have carried out some research on it but the Irish authorities have carried out little or no research on it.</P>
    <P>I attended a conference last July on the implications of Sellafield.  We were shown maps which indicated the levels of radioactivity on the west coast of Britain and on the coastline of Northern Ireland but there was little or no evidence of radioactivity on the eastern coastline of the Republic of Ireland.  That was not because for some reason, like St. Patrick and the saints, radioactivity would not dare touch our coast but simply because we have not established the extent of it. The unfortunate reality is that nobody has established the extent of radioactivity on the Irish coastline.  Concerns have been expressed about the implications of radioactivity for fish in the Irish Sea not only in the interests of fish consumers but also in the interests of the fishing community.  It is incumbent on the Department of the Marine to see to it <Col N="1538" /> that proper research is carried out in that area.</P>
    <P>There is a new threat that some of the nuclear waste from Sellafield may be buried in containers in the Irish Sea.  We are told they have stopped discharging nuclear waste into the Irish Sea but the big debate in Britain at present is what will they do with the waste after the reprocessing takes place.  That issue has not been resolved.  There are grave fears that that waste will be disposed of in one form or another in the Irish Sea.  We need to have a body with specific responsibility. It is not enough to say that it is the responsibility of the Nuclear Energy Board or the Minister for Energy.  The Irish Sea is the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine.  I am asking that the Marine Institute, which is essentially a research and development body, be given specific responsibility by the Oireachtas to examine the extent of radioactive pollution, the extent of the threat and to assemble the kind of information which the Irish Attorney General would need if he was going to take a case to Europe. The people on the Government side are as quick as anybody else to call on the British authorities to close down Sellafield but unlike the Walls of Jericho, Sellafield is not going to come tumbling down just because Government Ministers blow their trumpets at it.  Indeed the whole issue has probably moved on from that and the question now is what will happen with the reprocessing plant which is due to come into operation in 1992.</P>
    <P>This is far too serious an issue for the Minister to say that it is accounted for in the general terms of reference which are being given to the institute under the Bill or that it is being done by the Nuclear Energy Board, who are about to be abolished, the Minister for Energy or somebody else.  Does the Minister for the Marine have responsibility for what happens in the Irish Sea or does he not? I believe he has.  He should take that responsibility seriously in regard to the threat that Sellafield and other nuclear installations pose for the Irish Sea and <Col N="1539" /> give this specific responsibility to the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not have given much consideration to this issue before this debate.  I would much prefer him to further reflect on the seriousness of it rather than put this amendment to a vote here this evening.  If he is prepared to commit himself to such further reflection obviously I will not put my amendment to a vote.  I would be much happier if the Minister would give an undertaking to come back here on Report Stage with at least some concession on this important issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Ministers response to this very important amendment.  The facts are that Sellafield and the reprocessing plant which will be in operation by 1992 across the water from us will be the single most serious threat to our environment.  These plants will be located in another jurisdiction over which we have no direct control. However the Irish Sea straddles the area between the two countries and I believe the Minister for the Marine has responsibility not only for inland waters but for all the waters around this island.  For the Minister to suggest here this evening that it would be inappropriate for him to give the power to the Marine Institute to get involved in any research in this area is just passing the buck and is very unacceptable in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the threats that can arise from Sellafield, and which have arisen, and we are not too sure about what will happen in the future.  We know that we do not have the scientific analysis and information available to us to enable the Irish Government to put a strong case to the British Government on this issue.  It is not enough for a Minister to lodge a protest about the activities in Sellafield to his counterpart in England or to lodge an objection in Europe if he cannot strongly substantiate that case by scientific evidence.  The type of evidence available to us at present is extremely limited. <Col N="1540" /> It is unacceptable for the Minister to suggest that this is a matter for the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Energy Board.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Energy, is in the process of disbanding the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes the setting up of a marine institute which would be an ideal and suitable body to do the type of work necessary in this area.  It is fundamental and very important to us and to people generally that we know what is going on, that information is made available to us so that we can put forward arguments in regard to activities which should not occur.  It is vitally important that we are aware of the type of transport used to dispose of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea, that we have accurate details about the amount of waste disposed of, who transports the waste, where it is transported from, the type of vessels in which it is transported and where it is finally disposed of.</P>
    <P>We are extremely concerned about the disposal of radioactive waste in the Irish Sea at present but we are not in a position to monitor this activity or get any indication as to what is happening to this waste.  This waste will have lethal consequences for Irish people not just in the immediate future but for centuries to come.  The seriousness of this problem must be recognised by the Minister and his Department.  He cannot shift the responsibility to the Minister for Energy. The Irish Sea is the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine and he must take responsibility for anything that happens in those waters.  He must take action and put in place the necessary machinery so that he can establish what the exact position is.</P>
    <P>It is both amazing and unacceptable for the Minister to come in here and suggest that the Minister for Energy should take responsibility for this matter. What is the Minister's attitude to waste which may be lying on the floor of the Irish Sea at present?  We do not know what waste has been dumped into the Irish Sea, what the extent of any such waste is, or what way the currents are carrying it.  The dumping of this waste <Col N="1541" /> is totally unacceptable and is extremely serious not just from the point of view of the marine environment but also from the point of view of the physical health of Irish people in the long term.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the Minister for the Marine takes this matter on board. This is an ideal opportunity for him to give clout to the Marine Institute so that they can carry out the necessary research, monitor various activities and be in a position to present the necessary data and information on nuclear activity, nuclear waste, reprocessing and the dumping of these substances in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister here tonight to reconsider his attitude to this amendment. This is a very serious matter which needs additional consideration.  Like Deputy Gilmore, I ask the Minister to reconsider this issue between now and Report Stage to see what action he can take within his Department in terms of including it within the terms of reference of the Marine Institute.  I do not think we can wash our hands of this issue in this House tonight.  Neither can the Minister wash his hands of it and say it is a matter for another Minister; it is a matter for the Minister for the Marine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I am afraid I will have to repeat what I have already said as the Deputies opposite have chosen to ignore my previous statement.  Radioactivity in the Irish Sea is monitored with the assistance of my Department.  The Deputy seems to want me to spell out in detail what the functions of the institute will be.  This is never done in any legislation and I do not propose to do so in the case of this legislation either because it would run into pages.  If I were to spell out their functions in detail what would happen if it was decided to include a different function in the years ahead?  Therefore, the details cannot be spelled out or itemised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points raised in Deputy Gilmore's amendment are already included in the legislation.  Section 1, the definition section, states that &ldquo;marine&rdquo; means of, in, <Col N="1542" /> near, concerned with or belonging to the sea and tidal waters, inhabiting, found or got from the sea or from non-tidal waters. It also states that &ldquo;research and development&rdquo; includes research into all pure and applied sciences, including economics and social sciences, investigations, tests, experiments, analyses and other studies and the application of science and technology to innovation and development. It will be seen that anything outlined in the amendment is included in the Bill and if I were to accept the amendment it would not add to or enhance the Bill in any way.  If I were not satisfied on this point, I would already have accepted the amendment.  There is nothing to preclude the institute from carrying out research in any of the areas outlined in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The institute can monitor the discharge of radioactive waste from any source into the Irish Sea.  They have full powers in that matter.  There is no point in spelling out in detail the functions of the institute. All we can do is give broad headlines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is really exaggerating.  We are not asking that every individual activity of the institute should be spelled out in the legislation. However, it is in order for the Legislature to identify the areas in which the Marine Institute ought to be engaged.  During the Second Stage debate there were many speeches about the priorities and the areas which need to be researched by the Marine Institute.  There is nothing unreasonable in the Oireachtas identifying a priority of a group of priorities for the Marine Institute.  We have a terrible habit in this country of being high on rhetoric on many issues but do nothing about them.  Everything from the restoration of the Irish language to closing Sellafield is game for high-minded speech but when it comes to doing something about it there is a reluctance on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time of this House is often been taken up with questions, debates and speeches about Sellafield.  Every couple of months we discover that there have <Col N="1543" /> been new cases of leaks.  The whole history of Sellafield has been one of British Nuclear Fuels denying that leaks or discharges have taken place and then, in the face of irrefutable evidence, having to concede it.  Every time news of this breaks, another Minister calls on the British Government to close Sellafield. Government backbenchers excel themselves telling us how strongly they feel about Sellafield.  I know many of them genuinely hold these views.</P>
    <P>Will the Irish Government take Britain to the European Court over Sellafield, as was suggested by the Minister for Energy and his colleagues when they were in Opposition?  I have raised this question at Question Time and the answer I have received is that after the Attorney General has considered the matter they have not enough evidence to do so.  Why is there not enough evidence?  If bodies like Greenpeace can assemble evidence, if CORE, the group based in Cumbria opposed to Sellafield, can assemble evidence, if consultants like John Large and his colleagues can assemble evidence, why is it that the Irish Government do not seem to want to assemble the evidence?</P>
    <P>I do not want to be openly critical of the Nuclear Energy Board but it is an open secret that due to lack of resources and other problems they simply have not been able to do the degree of monitoring and examination on the required scale, Can one imagine any other state in the world faced with the kind of threat that Sellafield poses to this country that would not, as a matter of Government policy, set about finding out the extent of the problem?  Here we have the Minister for the Marine, the Government Minister responsible for the Irish Sea, effectively saying it is somebody else's responsibility but that, of course his Department test for radioactivity in the Irish Sea.  It is time the Government took this issue a lot more seriously than heretofore.</P>
    <P>I am seeking a specific responsibility for the Marine Institute.  There are pages of general functions which the institute <Col N="1544" /> can perform, provided it gets the authority from the Minister, but we are very unsure about the specifics.  We know it will have some kind of controlling role over existing agencies, a co-ordinating role and so on.  The general public and certainly the members of this House, would agree that this is an issue that needs to be addressed a lot more seriously, yet the Minister for the Marine effectively walks away from it.  That is not good enough.  It is time the Government did something about this worsening problem.</P>
    <P>We know that contracts have been entered into by Sellafield to deal with nuclear waste from other countries.  Some of those contracts have been entered into with countries who were not prepared to reprocess nuclear waste themselves. Attempts were made to have some nuclear waste from Germany reprocessed in France and it was refused. All this nuclear waste will now go to Sellafield, travelling through the Irish Sea.  There are a number of problems in which the Department of the Marine have a valid interest.  Radioactivity in the sea is one problem; then there is the problem for fish and the problem along the coastline on beaches.  There is the problem related to fishing and the possible consequences of an accident occurring. These are areas that must be addressed, areas in which hard evidence needs to be assembled by the Marine Institute.  It was for those reasons I tabled this amendment so that that information could be assembled, so that the Government would be in the best possible position to advance a case whether in Europe or directly with the British Government and indeed let the Irish public know the full extent of the Sellafield problem as it affects them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset may I thank <Col N="1545" /> you, Sir, for affording me this opportunity to raise an issue that will be of great importance not alone to my constituents but to many others around the country, particularly those employed at ferry ports or Border posts in the future.</P>
      <P>It is expected that on 1 January 1993 customs import and export documentation in intra-Community trade will no longer be required.  It is also expected that, on the same date, the collection of VAT and customs and excise duties at internal EC frontier points will cease. The implications of the relevant regulations will be very severe and will have an impact all around this country.  I want this evening in particular to highlight these implications on Rosslare harbour ferry port in my constituency.</P>
      <P>The effect will be that out of some 50 Customs and Excise staff currently employed at Rosslare harbour 43 may well be made redundant.  Taking into account the age and circumstances of the 50 people affected &mdash; options that might spring to mind of, for example, early retirement or transfer, are not desired, reasonable or acceptable.</P>
      <P>I raise the matter this evening well in advance of the actual implementation of this tax harmonisation proposal so that we may have a clear indication from the Minister how he will tackle the problem. In a small community such as that located at Rosslare harbour these 50 well paid jobs form a crucial part of the local scene and environment.  They are a mainstay of the local community.  Indeed they, their families or the local community cannot afford to be at the loss of their wages and input into local economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister to allay the apprehension and uncertainty clearly felt already among those workers by indicating to the House this evening what proposals, if any, he has in regard to them.  Let me put it to the Minister that the option preferred by those employees is that they be absorbed into the Revenue Commissioners' activities in the local area so that they and their families can remain at their base, contributing to the local economy and that this absorption should begin very soon so that there <Col N="1546" /> would not be a sudden impact felt in January 1993.</P>
    <P>I want to raise one other germane point related to a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister which was answered yesterday.  There will be job losses also among the Customs and Excise officials in Rosslare harbour resulting from computerisation which will take place as early as next year, 1991. I was very dissatisfied at the answer I received from the Minister yesterday.  It would be my hope that in highlighting &mdash; by way of parliamentary question and this Adjournment Debate &mdash; these very important issues the Minister will indicate to us that they are under active consideration and that he has a strategy to enable these important personnel to remain within the communities of which they form such an important part at present.</P>

      <P>The completion of the Internal Market in accordance with the provisions of the Single European Act and, in particular the abolition of internal frontier controls, will mean considerable staffing, operational and other changes for the Customs and Excise service.  Certain decisions have yet to be taken at EC level before the precise effects become clear, but there is little doubt that the Internal Market measures will bring fundamental changes in terms of staffing, staff deployment and the nature of the tasks performed by the Customs and Excise service.</P>
      <P>It is natural that staff in the Customs and Excise service are concerned about their jobs and their futures following the completion of the Internal Market.  The Revenue Commissioners are well aware of the human dimension involved in this reorganisation.  It is their intention to approach the challenges of 1992 in a planned, sympathetic and constructive manner.  It is also the Revenue Commissioners' policy to keep staff informed of any developments that may, in the run up to 1992, affect their interests.  It is also the policy to continue consultations with staff unions on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> It is not possible, at this stage, to accurately assess the staffing implications for the Customs and Excise service, including Rosslare, in advance of definite proposals emerging in relation to the completion of the Internal Market.  A memorandum prepared by the Revenue Commissioners outlining the changes in the role of the Customs and Excise service &mdash; which the abolition of border controls from 1992 would bring &mdash; was circulated to the unions concerned some time ago.  More recently the Revenue Commissioners have established a study team to examine and report on the impact of the post-1992 Single Market environment on the staffing and related aspects of the Customs and Excise outfield service.  Their work commenced on 3 September 1990.</P>
    <P>The task of the team is to examine and assess the staffing and related implications for the Customs and Excise service of Community discussions and agreements aimed at completion of the Single Market and, in particular the abolition of fiscal frontiers; produce a draft organisation plan showing the post-1992 staffing structure to cater for Single Market functions and requirements and based on best available policy assumptions; and submit an action plan to cater for migration from the existing to the post-1992 situation, to be implemented on a pilot basis commencing on 1 January 1991.  In carrying out the study the team are open to consultation with staff members of all grades and to the unions and staff associations concerned.  The initial report of the study team will be available within the next few weeks.  The team will undertake further studies and consultation from time to time as required.</P>
    <P>A subcommittee of the Civil Service General Council has also been established under the conciliation and arbitration scheme to examine the implications of the Internal Market and, in particular, the consequences for staffing.  This subcommittee arranged for the carrying out of pilot survey by the IPA of Customs and Excise staff in <Col N="1548" /> Border areas earlier this year for the purposes of establishing the attitudes and views of the staff to possible redeployment and voluntary redundancy in the context of changes that may arise on the completion of the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>The subcommittee have now commissioned the IPA to extend this survey to include all Customs and Excise personnel on a countrywide basis.  The extended survey has commenced and will take about three months to complete. The team conducting the survey are holding a series of briefing meetings with Customs and Excise staff during this month. The team held such a meeting with the staff in Rosslare on Monday last, 12 November.</P>
    <P>Also as a result of the negotiations at the subcommittee of the general council, agreement has been reached to provide sponsorship in respect of certain retraining and educational courses for staff in the Customs and Excise service.  These special arrangements have been made in order to better equip staff for changed employment circumstances as a result of the possible reduction in the size of the Customs and Excise service.  Details of the agreed special arrangements were communicated by the Revenue Commissioners to the staff concerned by way of circular in August last.  Career breaks are now available to Customs and Excise staff in respect of certain domestic circumstances and for educational purposes.</P>
    <P>In order to keep all Customs and Excise staff aware of issues which affect their interests the Revenue Commissioners intend to issue regular Internal Market bulletins the first of which was issued last September.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to reiterate that while it is not possible at this stage to accurately indicate the staffing implications which the completion of the Internal Market will have on the Customs and Excise service, I would like to assure the Deputy that I am satisfied that the staff and their representatives are being, and will continue to be, kept fully informed on all developments.  No decision has as yet been taken on the numbers that will <Col N="1549" /> be required, and redeployment to other Revenue offices such as the income tax office in Wexford, or Waterford for that matter, will, of course, be considered.</P>
    <P>In relation to the computerisation question raised by the Deputy, unions have been assured that the relocation of any surplus staff resulting from computerisation will be dealt with in the context of the 1992 reorganisation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter as to the preparedness of Ireland's economy to deal with the price disruption with potential supply difficulties in the oil market.  Deputy Bruton has five minutes to present his case and the Minister for Energy has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for affording me this opportunity.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Energy are guilty of serious neglect in the manner in which they have exposed Ireland to damage due to the present crisis in the oil market.  They failed on several counts. They failed to maintain an adequate supply of security stocks.  They failed to deal with the excessive costs in the oil sector in Ireland.  They failed to make any move towards tax harmonisation in line with our partners in Europe, and they failed to introduce even the rudiments of a conservation policy.  The result of this complacency on the part of the Ministers and the Government of which they are members is that we will inflict on the Irish economy damage that would otherwise have been avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the storage point, during 1989 the Minister for Energy allowed our security oil stocks decline from 80 days' cover to 65 days' cover by the final quarter.  That meant we were 1.5 million barrels below what was the minimum requirement by the international energy area for security stocks.  The result was that when the Iraqi crisis broke the Minister had to engage <Col N="1550" /> in panic buying of stocks when prices on the world markets were at their highest. The effect of that was to impose very considerable sums of excess cost on the taxpayer which I estimate could run to £40 million if the Minister reached the 120 days' target he is talking of.  Not only that, he was helping to contribute to the driving up of prices on those markets.</P>
    <P>In the area of domestic costs, for the last three years the Government have prevaricated about Whitegate.  At times there were exclusive negotiation rights for individual people involved.  At other times a task force was to report urgently within three months.  They did not report for 12 months or more.  The result, on the Minister's own admission, is that we are continuing with outdated technology in that plant that is adding £25 million annually to our oil bills.</P>
    <P>In the distribution sector the Minister for Industry and Commerce has faced a situation where, according to the most recent figures, Ireland's distribution costs for oil are double those of our EC partners and he has done nothing to deal with this.  He set up a Fair Trade Commission inquiry last year but no action has been taken on foot of that inquiry and it is well over a year now since it was set up and held hearings.  Indeed, I believe it is Government policy more than anything else that has contributed to killing competition in the petrol market.</P>
    <P>Tax harmonisation is another serious area of neglect.  We are now paying £750 million in oil taxes to the Government. Ireland's competitiveness in this area is vital if we are to succeed in Europe, and failure to harmonise taxes is putting a huge burden on Irish manufacturing industry.  For example, for the key export fuel, auto-diesel, our taxes are 50 per cent higher here than those of our European partners.  What, other than that, is handicapping us?</P>
    <P>Finally, Fine Gael and other Members of this House have been crying out for years for a sensible conservation policy and the Minister only now, too late, is appointing a committee to look into this issue.  The economy is going to suffer seriously as a result of neglecting all these <Col N="1551" /> areas.  The impact on the economy of this oil crisis, the potential damage, which is serious because £400 million will be taken out of the economy that could pay 40,000 people in employment, is being greatly enhanced by failure on this Government's part to prepare properly an energy policy that would deal with this sort of eventuality.</P>

      <P>Let me remind Deputy Bruton that the situation I inherited was largely left there from the period of his Government, his party having been in office for four years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should perhaps stress that there have, to date, been no supply difficulties experienced by Ireland as the world oil market remains well supplied with crude oil. Data published by the International Energy Agency shows that of the 4.2 million barrels per day of crude oil production lost from the Gulf as a result of the crisis beginning in August, 3.5 million barrels per day has been made up by OPEC by the end of September and net losses in crude arrivals have primarily been made up through stockdraw, mainly from outside the OECD area.  In its communique issued following the governing board meeting of 31 October, the IEA said there was sufficient supply and that stocks were comfortable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that Ireland's dependence on imported oil for energy purposes has declined significantly since the last major oil crisis. Ten years ago, oil accounted for 69 per cent of total primary energy demand while coal and gas accounted for 9 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.  In 1989 oil dependence had dropped to 44 per cent while the inputs from coal and gas had increased to 24 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.  It is against this background we must consider our competence to bear the brunt of possible future oil <Col N="1552" /> shocks.  The area of greatest concern would be automotive fuels.</P>
    <P>Although, as I stated initially, there is no shortage of oil supplies at the moment, the price of oil has fluctuated wildly during the past few months as a direct result of the tensions in the Gulf region. We have seen prices rise from $19.29 per barrel for Brent blend on 31 July to a peak of $41.37 on 28 September.  They have subsequently fallen so that they stand today at $33.95.  Product prices have more or less followed crude prices but gasoil and kerosene have been quite volatile and it is likely that this trend will continue through the winter season.  Spot gasoline prices have risen from $260.50 per tonne on 31 July to a peak of $355.50 on 10 October but have fallen back so that it is today trading at $312 per tonne.</P>
    <P>The price rises in recent months have, for the most part, been a response to the political uncertainty and fear of war in the Gulf rather than the physical supply situation.  Perceptions of possible future shortages arising from the tightness of international refinery capacity particularly for heavier crudes and seasonal surges in demand have also led to the recent price fluctuations.  While the Gulf crisis remains unresolved, it is likely that prices will remain high in relative terms and Irish consumers, in common with other consumers worldwide, will have to bear the impact of prices passed through to the market.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of war in the Gulf region, apart from causing an immediate and drastic increase in spot prices, could lead to major supply difficulties and the consequence of this scenario for Ireland has been considered in recent months by my Department.  No changes in the existing system of price control for automotive fuels, regulated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, have been made in order that the international spot price trends can be reflected in the Irish market and thereby act as a demand reduction measure.  I have encouraged the public to use energy wisely and efficiently so that the economy can adjust to supply difficulties as they arise.  Furthermore, as a security of supply measure, I have <Col N="1553" /> recently ensured that the following measures be put in place to deal with potential future supply difficulties:&mdash; The State-owned Whitegate refinery was moved to 100 per cent technical throughput in order to increase stocks levels at the refinery.  Crude stocks in Whitegate at the end of October were 115,000 tonnes while product stocks were 116,000 tonnes.  Whiddy oil terminal was re-activated to hold additional supplies of strategic crude oil.  There are now approximately 200,000 tonnes <i>in situ</i> adding 20 days supply.  These would be used to keep the Whitegate refinery in operation in the event of an international shortage in crude supplies arising from outbreak of war.  Additional stocks of gasoil amounting to 20,000 and gasoline amounting to 21,000 tonnes have been built up in a number of locations around the country and these, too, will be available in the event of severe supply disruptions.</P>
    <P>As a result of these measures, Ireland's strategic stocks are now high and have increased from 96 days forward consumption at 1 July, 1990 to 116 days at 1 October, 1990 and are now at around 120 days.</P>
    <P>In the event of a shortfall in supplies arising, I expect that increases in product prices and conservation publicity measures would continue to play an important role in affecting demand.  In addition some drawdown of stocks held by oil companies and large consumers would take place.</P>
    <P>If the current situation in the Gulf deteriorated signficantly, in addition to the measures just mentioned, orders giving me control over the supply, distribution and export of fuels would be introduced.  The impact of this legislation would be tailored to meet Irish supply difficulties so that the economy could continue to function despite international tensions.</P>
    <P>In a crisis, Ireland would not act in isolation but, as a member of the International Energy Agency and of the EC, it would participate in whatever measures the agency deemed necessary to allocate supplies on an equitable basis among its <Col N="1554" /> members.  The agency would operate through various bodies in an emergency, namely the Standing Group on Emergency Questions, the Industry Supply Advisory Group and the IEA Secretariat, to ascertain the level of available supplies throughout the IEA and to agree on the fair-sharing of those supplies among member countries.  In this context, I would consider, but I see no possible need for this, the introduction of a rationing system for private motor vehicles should a real shortage occur.  It is envisaged that any rationing scheme would only be introduced as a measure of last resort; the necessary planning has been done.</P>
    <P>In view of the measures which I have outlined above, the House can rest assured that every measure has been taken to ensure that our economy is prepared for an emergency and, while administrative and operational aspects of measures taken to cope with supply shortfalls would no doubt be difficult, we are now well equipped to deal with whatever situation may arise.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherlock gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the question of the closure of Garda stations in Cork East and its consequences on policing in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this very serious matter as there is now serious concern among the people of Cork East about plans to downgrade rural policing in the area which would lead to the partial closure of smaller Garda Stations.  Cork East, like many other areas, has a worrying level of crime.  The report of the Garda Commissioner showed that the East Cork Garda Division had a crime rate of 24.9 crimes for every one thousand of the population and this is higher than any area outside of Dublin.  The East Cork Garda Division also includes urban areas of Cork city which would account for a <Col N="1555" /> substantial portion of this figure but crime is clearly a problem in rural areas.  The general trend shown in the report was for a decline in crime in urban areas and an increase in rural parts and in the light of this it is fair to assume that most of the increase of 6.8 per cent of reported crime in Cork East took place in rural areas.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the Garda authorities are planning to downgrade, or partially close, a number of Garda stations in the area and centralise policing through the district headquarters of Youghal and Midleton.  The northern part of the division, villages such as Killdorrery, Glanworth and so on, are being serviced under that kind of system from Fermoy and that is totally unsatisfactory. As it is, cutbacks, and restricted recruitment over a long period, have meant that gardaí are stretched to keep existing stations functioning and patrol cars on the road, never mind getting out and investigating crime.</P>
      <P>Much crime takes place during the hours of darkness especially after 10 p.m. and a network of local stations open 24 hours a day is necessary to deal with this.  Local stations can provide a sense of security for communities, especially those which have a serious crime problem. Not everyone has a telephone and public telephones are very often inaccessible or out of order.  It is not too long ago since we had a series of very vicious crimes against elderly people living in isolated rural areas.  The new garda arrangement in East Cork will clearly leave elderly people vulnerable to these deplorable attacks once again.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be making a great mistake if he underestimated the strength of local feeling on this issue.  Public meetings have been held in a number of areas to protest at these plans.  In Ballycotton, just to give one example, more than 100 people attended a protest meeting and a petition opposing plans to downgrade Ballycotton Garda station was signed by some 900 residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, I know, always demands for additional gardaí for Dublin and other areas to deal with what everybody <Col N="1556" /> acknowledges to be a serious problem of urban crime, but gardaí should not be withdrawn from rural areas leaving the people there without adequate protection. One suggestion that should be examined is the greater use of civilian personnel in back-up roles so that gardaí can do what the public want them to do, and what they are trained for, prevent crime and investigate it when it occurs. The community watch programme is very worthwhile and should be encouraged. Many fully trained gardaí are occupied on administrative work or acting as drivers or mechanics, work that could be done by civilians.  I appeal to the Minister, therefore, to reconsider the plans to downgrade Garda stations in East Cork, or any other area, and, rather than reducing police levels to consider ways of increasing Garda numbers in the area and, consequently, give the rural areas the attention they are entitled to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher) (for the Minister for Justice)</NameTxt>
      <P>The raising of this matter by Deputy Sherlock has given me an opportunity to put to rest the rumours and speculation which have been circulating in recent weeks about the closure and downgrading of rural Garda stations. A lot of unnecessary concern and anxiety has been caused to people residing in rural communities by unfounded rumours and speculation about plans to reduce the Garda service to rural areas in County Cork and elsewhere.  There have been suggestions of widespread closures of rural Garda stations, downgrading of stations and withdrawal of garda manpower from rural areas.  The Minister of Justice has been inundated with letters and telephone calls from Members of this House, community representatives and from the public generally expressing great concern about changes in rural policing as reported in the media.  The Minister has been very disturbed by the irresponsible behaviour of the scaremongers who put about these stories without any regard for the frightening effects they might have on the elderly people living alone in isolated <Col N="1557" /> areas and people who have, in the past, been victims of crimes in rural districts.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has already issued a public statement which very clearly assures rural communities that no decision has been taken by him, and that no decision will be taken by him, to close or downgrade rural Garda stations and that no proposal or plan exists to this end. Only the Minister for Justice has the legal authority to make such a decision and he has already assured the public that he is not going down that road.  I want, on his behalf, to repeat that assurance in the House tonight to ensure that there is absolutely no room for any further misunderstanding in this matter.</P>
      <P>As well as confirming the Minister's commitment to keeping rural Garda stations open, may I also express his determination that there should be no reduction in the Garda presence in rural Ireland and that nothing should be done to interfere with the close relationship which has traditionally existed between rural communities and the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>What has been happening in recent months is that Garda management, in consultation with officials from the Department of Justice and the Garda representative associations, have been engaged in a review of their current policing systems to see whether they fully meet the demands of the public or whether by reorganisation or other means they can be made more efficient, more modern and more responsive to community needs.  These proposals which are still the subject of continuing detailed consultations between the Garda authorities and the representative associations would involve the allocation of additional resources by way of civilian clerical staff and extra Garda transport to the Garda districts involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also envisaged is a substantial reduction in the form-filling procedures in the Force which, as is acknowledged by all concerned, consumes an excessive amount of Garda time, time that should be spent by members of the Force meeting the public, investigating and, indeed, preventing crime.  These proposals are, <Col N="1558" /> of course, still very much in the melting pot.  I cannot, therefore, set out a precise final outline for the House at this stage. However, I can assure the Deputy and all other Members of the house that when the final proposals are worked out the Minister will approve only those changes put before him which he is satisfied will result in an improved Garda service for every village and townland in east Cork and, indeed, in all other areas. I want to conclude by repeating the Minister's commitment to keeping rural Garda stations open and to maintaining an effective Garda presence in the areas served by those stations.</P>

They cannot plan their programmes properly, they are finding it increasingly difficult to get credit from the banks and vital services for emigrants wil have to be curtailed and in some cases abandoned if funding is not made available immediately.  A sum of £500,000 was made available in January's budget for emigrant services. We have now reached mid-November and not one penny of this money has been made available for emigrant groups.  This is disgraceful and very unfair for the agencies providing the services and also <Col N="1559" /> those unfortunate emigrants who benefit from the services.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme was introduced by the Labour-Fine Gael Government as a way of keeping alive the will to work for thousands of people who found themselves on the dole queue.  It has worked well and it has kept alive their sense of pride and dignity. Local authorities, local communities and local services, such as schools and so on, have benefited enormously.</P>
      <P>I want to congratulate the present Minister for introducing an amendment to the scheme to give child dependant allowance as well as married allowance, which was an excellent idea.  Unfortunately, a person having worked in a social employment scheme for 12 months must opt out immediately and cannot re-enter the scheme, except in extreme circumstances, for another 12 months. There is a lot of work to be done and many people willing to do it.  There are so many people on the dole and so much dole money paid out that I would like to see a refinement of the scheme where people would be able to get back in benefit on the scheme within a much shorter period.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that there are in Dublin over 100,000 dwellings in 350 non-gas housing estates, including St. Anne's, KCR, Terenure, with 132 houses not linked into the Dublin Gas grid.  These residents want the option to change over to gas, particularly since the Minister, Deputy Harney, has banned the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal. These residents represent a huge potential market for Dublin Gas.  The reason I am raising this issue tonight is to ask the Minister when these potential customers will be brought into the gas grid.  I would caution the Minister and Dublin Gas that, while recognising the capital cost to Dublin Gas in laying and extending the pipeline, they should not overcharge for the gas installation, which is the case at present &mdash; it is estimated to cost £1,000 <Col N="1560" /> per house in a non-gas estate.  In an estate in Drimnagh which already has natural gas, an elderly widow was charged £570 for the gas connection plus £360 for a gas coal-effect fire, giving a total of £930. We now have a golden opportunity to properly market and sell this, our finest non-imported energy supply which is so clean and environmentally friendly.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 300,000 residences in the Dublin area.  Of these, about 200,000 are within areas covered by the gas grid, although not all are connected to the grid.  Bord Gáis Éireann have recently compiled a register of non-gas estates in the Dublin area which will be considered for connection to the gas grid in due course.  The register comprises some 350 estates involving approximately 100,000 houses.</P>
      <P>A programme will be set up by BGE early in 1991 for the connection of these non-gas estates.  When this is available, the board will be in a position to indicate the time scale involved in connecting up particular estates.  A project of that scale and cost will require detailed planning and co-ordination and the installation of the mains will take place over a four to five year period.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann are, of course, obliged to earn a commercial return on their capital investment.  They will, therefore, be surveying every estate to ascertain the level of take-up for gas in each case, and to explain to residents the costs involved for them in changing over.  Only those estates which would provide a satisfactory return on the board's investment will be connected up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of those dwellings in areas served by the gas grid, I understand from the board that only about 30 per cent currently use gas central heating.  This leaves a significant market for expansion within the area of the existing grid.  The board will continue to give priority to targeting this <Col N="1561" /> market, which would require comparatively little capital expenditure to connect up and which would provide a more immediate return on investment.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the two Deputies who raised the questions.  In reply to Deputy Jimmy Deenihan grants from my Department's Vote to non-statutory bodies providing welfare services for Irish emigrants in Britain are normally paid in December each year following recommendations from DÍON.  Last year, because of the increased Government allocation from £250,000 to £500,000 grants were distributed in two instalments: the first in July and the final one in December.  This was an exceptional measure.  For this year the committee reverted to their previous practice.</P>
      <P>With the increase in their allocation DÍON have been able to fund a wider range of organisations.  This has led to an increased number of applications, many of which would not have applied to DÍON before, thereby necessitating more work for the committee in processing and vetting the new applications.  DÍON have also moved from the funding of organisations towards grant aiding innovative and research projects aimed at quantifying and assessing the emergency needs of Irish emigrants.  This calls for greater appraisal by DÍON of individual applications.  In view of the fact that the members of DÍON act in a voluntary capacity and in their own time, I am fully satisfied that they are doing their best to process applications as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Despite the increased volume of work I understand that DÍON will be forwarding to me shortly their full list of recommendations for the 1990 grants.  On that basis I expect to announce payment of the grants before the end of the month. I do not disagree with the Deputy's point and I will consider the matter for next year.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Jim Higgins, the social employment scheme is the principal manpower intervention to assist the long term unemployed.  In order to participate on the scheme a person must be over 25 years of age and either in receipt of unemployment assistance or registered as unemployed for over 12 months and in receipt of unemployment benefit.  Participants are given work related opportunities, albeit on a part-time basis, on a wide variety of projects organised by local authorities or by voluntary sponsors.  Participation on the scheme lasts for a maximum of 52 weeks at any one time.</P>
      <P>With limited financial resources available for the scheme, any reduction in the qualifying period for re-entry to the scheme would have the effect of reducing the number of opportunities available for persons who had never participated in the scheme.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is better to give opportunities to as many long term unemployed people as possible rather than reduce the numbers benefiting from the scheme.  Over 11,000 people are currently participating in SES projects throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to have been in a position earlier this year to increase the rates payable to participants.  I acknowledge the Deputy's comments in relation to participants.</P>
      <P>The availability of the child dependant allowance has proved very attractive to older unemployed people and they are now participating in the scheme in increasing numbers.  At present around 50 per cent of participants have adult and child dependants.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that participation in the scheme is very worthwhile for participants and helps them to improve their prospects of obtaining employment when opportunities become available.  There is the added bonus that the projects on which participants work are of significant benefit to local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I repeat that it is preferable to provide opportunities for as many long term unemployed people as possible and I do not intend to advise FÁS to reduce the qualifying <Col N="1563" /> period of one year before a participant can become involved in an SES project for the second time.</P>
    <P>During the course of the discussions on the new programme of economic and social development this issue is being raised again, particularly in regard to local authority employment.  The argument is whether local authority employment, <Col N="1564" /> in some form or another, might be better in the long run than the social employment scheme but it has not been costed yet.  There will be some further movement in this regard over the next few months.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 November 1990.</P>

      <P>As I have already pointed out on several occasions I am concerned to ensure that the benefits of the Community intervention system are passed on to beef producers in the prices they are paid for their cattle by meat processors. In this connection I recently met <Col N="1439" /> representatives of the meat trade and impressed on them the need to ensure that producer prices adequately and fairly reflect the value of Community supports. To enable this to be more effectively done I agreed to have my Department implement a number of improvements in the operation of the intervention system including a 1p per lb increase in the deboning allowance.  I am pleased to note that since then prices paid by export factories to producers have increased by some 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The question of the price to be paid for cattle is, of course, one for negotiation between farmers and processors.  Nobody wishes to change that.

      <P>Work on this project will be carried out mainly by way of two contracts.  Contract One covers work from approximately 3 km. west of Kilcock to the Maynooth/Celbridge Road.  Contract Two is for the remaining section of the road, from the Maynooth/Celbridge Road to the Lucan by-pass.</P>
      <P>Draft contract documents for Contract One have been received in my Department and a decision in this matter will be issued shortly.  It is expected that work on this contract will commence during 1991 following completion of the tendering procedure.  I understand that the local authority expect to be in a position to forward contract documents relating to contract Two to the Department for approval around the middle of 1991.  It is intended that both contracts should be completed three years from the commencement of work on Contract One.</P>

      <P>As Shaw Bridge is located on a regional road, primary responsibility for the proposed project rests with the local authority, Kildare County Council.  The cost of such works normally falls to be financed from local resources supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my Department for such roads.  In the case of Kildare County Council, these grants total £2,061,000 in 1990, including a supplementary grant of £700,000 for improvement works because of the special needs of the county.  The <Col N="1449" /> 1990 allocation compares with an expenditure of £954,000 in 1989.  The determination of priorities in the expenditure of these grants is a matter for the local authority.</P>
      <P>The local authority's consultants have prepared a preliminary design and a cost estimate of £480,000 for a scheme involving improvements to Shaw Bridge and the immediate approach roads.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to complaints of long delays in Temple Street Children's Hospital (details supplied) in Dublin 1; if he is concerned that medical staff are being put under severe pressure; and if he has any plans to improve both staffing and facilities at the hospital.</Quest>

      <P>Details supplied by the Deputy referred to an individual case and the hospital authorities have informed me that on the night in question the casualty department experienced a higher number of attendances than usual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The casualty department at Temple Street Hospital provides a 24-hour, seven <Col N="1450" /> day service.  It is a very busy casualty department with approximately 55,000 attendances per annum.  No child is turned away from its accident and emergency service even though, in certain cases, children could be seen in the first instance by a general practitioner.</P>
    <P>The waiting time for any patient attending a casualty unit will be determined by the medical condition of the patient and the pressures on the casualty unit at a particular time.  It is totally unrealistic to expect all cases to be seen immediately as would seem to be implied in the Deputy's question.  Temple Street Hospital assesses each child on arrival in order to determine the priority of the case.  All emergency cases are dealt with immediately; other cases have obviously to wait a longer period for attention.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is arguing from the specific to the general and I have no reason to believe that patients attending at Temple Street hospital receive anything other than the highest possible level of care. As far as improvements at the hospital are concerned, I allocated additional moneys last year which had the effect of reopening beds, treating additional patients and reducing waiting lists.  In addition two extra casualty officers were assigned to the casualty department in recent months.</P>

      <P>Section 67 of the Health Act, 1970, requires the health boards to make ophthalmic treatment and optical appliances available without charge to persons who have full eligibility, that is, to medical card holders and their dependants.  This would include the children of medical card holders.</P>
