      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 5, 6, 11, 12 and 4.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.; that business tomorrow shall be confined to the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1990, and the undisposed part of today's announced business and any divisions demanded tomorrow shall be postponed until 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business for today, I repeat that I am opposed to the ordering of No. 12 &mdash; the Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Bill &mdash; which I do not believe should be taken until the Companies Bill has come out of Committee. In the matter of promised &mdash; or, perhaps, more accurately, threatened &mdash; legislation is it the Taoiseach's intention that the broadcasting legislation which we discussed over the last two evenings will be enacted during this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Bill will be circulated tomorrow and taken next <Col N="988" /> week.  I am quite certain that the Deputy, among others, will be very happy to have this legislation enacted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's intention to stand his ground on this Bill or does he now find that the ground is going from under him?  Will the provisions of this Bill last as long as the trees which Minister Burke had planted in Blakestown, Clonsilla&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I might remind the Minister of some of The Workers' Party reservations with what we perceive to be the inadequacies of this Bill.  For example, with regard to trustees, the provisions of section 34 enable the trustees of an occupational pensions scheme to transfer payments without the consent of a member.  This provision confuses me somewhat.  Would the Minister explain what circumstances he envisages could give rise to such action or why a member's consent would not be sought in the first place?   For example, the National Pensions Board did not recommend that trustees should have power to effect transfers rather than preserve benefits without the members concerned being approached.</P>
      <P>Many employees and some employers have abused pensions schemes and negotiated their terms for short-term financial gain.  Employers have often deployed the provisons of a pensions scheme as a means of enticing workers to leave their employment, usually by boosting redundancy payments as an incentive to workers to leave their employment by way of deals negotiated in respect of redundancy.  We must recognise that that is not the main purpose of a pensions scheme &mdash; they are not intended to be savings schemes for employees or lump sums that can be negotiated when some employees are made redundant.  In addition, some employees have used their pensions scheme membership to negotiate a short-term savings scheme, yielding a lump sum, rather than its being used as a long-term provision designed to yield pensions and other benefits on death or retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> The provisions of this Bill improve that position somewhat.  I should like the Minister to address the matter as it pertains to a country like ours, suffering so much from emigration and long-term unemployment. What facility would exist for emigrants making a claim under this Bill? While it is accepted that the object of pension schemes is primarily to accrue a pension, in many cases the viability of schemes is often dependent on a properly constructed long-term investment plan of a member's contributions.  Can the Minister envisage any case for workers seeking refunds of their contributions, for example, where they are relatively new, short-term members of the scheme who wish to emigrate or where the worker is relatively young and, through ill health or other factors, may never be employed again?</P>
    <P>As this debate continues, it will be brought to our attention that a number of established procedures will be shaken &mdash; for example, the rights of individuals on leaving their employment to cash in their savings through the pension scheme.  Obviously many workers would be anxious to retain this right if they should lose their jobs, if they leave to seek employment elsewhere or if they wish to emigrate.  These people might wish to capitalise on the savings already accruing on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I accept that pensions schemes are not savings schemes but I would like the Minister to address on Committee Stage the opportunities for access by workers to the money in the pension schemes to which they have made an input.  I have in mind particularly relatively young people who would not be very long in the pension scheme and where the sum of money would not be great.  It is hard to tell a young worker who has served five or six years in an industry and who wishes to emigrate that his pension will be there for him at the age of 60 or 65 if he should return from the United States, Canada or South Africa.  In many cases people regard their pension as a lump sum to be used when they wish to emigrate or if they become unemployed and have mortgages. Many of these people consider this <Col N="1000" /> sum as being relatively large but in the context of the overall pension scheme it is relatively insignificant.  There are great pressures on these individuals to get the lump sum, which has been the tradition to date.  It will be very difficult for people to recognise that this practice is on the way out.  I would ask the Minister to consider providing facilities for people to cash in their savings in the pensions scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the qualifying service section, the Minister has provided that a person must have five years service before he can qualify for preservation and that two of these years must fall after the commencement date of this legislation. However, the National Pensions Board recommended that five years service be required of members under 25 years at the time of leaving and that this be reduced by one year for each year over that age, subject to a minimum of two years qualifying service.  This would make a significant difference for anyone over the age of 25 years.  Perhaps the Minister would address this question on Committee Stage.  As I said the last day, I am working mainly from the recommendations of the National Pensions Board which, in many cases, are preferable to the watered down provisions incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the preservation and revaluation provisions will not apply from a current date to entitlements arising from service prior to this legislation becoming effective.  The National Pensions Board suggested a short lead-in period for the change, with no attempt at retrospection.  The Bill lays down a much longer lead-in period which is inappropriate and unacceptable.  The original formula of the National Pensions Board should be used.  The majority of pensions schemes are financially healthy and it would cause no problems if we were to allow for a shorter lead-in period.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with equal treatment is a major disappointment because it provides for only the minimum requirements of the European Community Directive on equal treatment in occupational schemes.  The main weaknesses <Col N="1001" /> are in the areas of exemptions and enforcement.  The Bill fails to achieve progress in its approach to the removal of discrimination between men and women. Comprehensive recommendations made in the latest report of the National Pensions Board have been ignored.  The Minister, for his own reasons, has decided to make changes that barely comply with the EC Directive on equal treatment. One of the major debates on this Bill will centre around the whole question of equal treatment for men and women.</P>
    <P>This Bill shows all the hallmarks of being substantially watered down by lobbying and pressure, not just from the pensions industry but from employer interests.  Pensions schemes can continue to impose different pension ages for men and women, widowers will not have to be provided for on the same basis as widows and different benefits can be provided for men and women.  This may be justified on actuarial grounds, for example, that women live longer than men or that one sex suffers more illnesses than the other.</P>
    <P>I will comment on specific sections of the Bill.  In regard to the actuarial factor, section 67 (1) (a) allows different contribution levels for male and female members of pensions schemes, to the extent that the difference is justified on actuarial grounds &mdash; this must be repealed by 30 July 1999 but it was the view of the National Pensions Board and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that such an exemption should not be availed of.  In practice, few if any pension schemes in Ireland require members to pay different contributions because of their sex.</P>
    <P>Section 67 (1) (c) allows for different retirement ages for men and women.  This exemption was seen as unnecessary in view of the widespread harmonisation of pension ages in this country and the fact that social welfare pensions are paid already to both men and women at the same age.  Section 67 (1) (e) allows different treatment for a deceased member's surviving spouse or other dependants. <Col N="1002" /> This is unacceptable in view of the fact that such differences are already seen as being unwarranted and are being removed in certain areas.  The Minister has produced a Bill that not only flies in the face of the recommendations of the Government-appointed National Pensions Board, but proposes to allow differences in contribution levels between men and women to remain up until 1999, provided they are based on actuarial data.  I would argue that each of these exclusions is in conflict with the broad principle of non-discrimination laid down in Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome and runs the risk of being challenged under this Article.</P>
    <P>We wish to see further debate in these areas as the Bill progresses.  In the light of our reservations, the Minister will be aware that we will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen the Bill.  However, I would have to agree that the Pensions Bill, 1990 is welcome and is long overdue.  The Bill implements many important recommendations of the National Pensions Board and indeed satisfies several longstanding trade union demands in the area of pension reform.  However, it was disappointing in certain respects, particularly with regard to member trusteeships and equal treatment for men and women.  During my previous contribution I went into detail on the member trusteeship so I will not repeat myself.</P>
    <P>I will summarise now what The Workers' Party see as the main weaknesses of the Bill.  First, there is a very low trade union representation on the proposed new pensions board.  Seven out of the eight members will represent employers, the pension professionals and the ministerial nominees.  Second, very low fines will be imposed for pensions offences and we believe these will not act as a serious deterrent for serious offenders.  Third, the question of preserving pensions will apply only to benefit built up after the time the legislation becomes effective and after the person has five years qualifying service in the scheme.  We think this weakness should <Col N="1003" /> be corrected and it does not conform with the recommendations of the National Pensions Board.  We are concerned also that contributions refunds, where still payable, will not attract interest.  We also note the registration of pension schemes will not be linked to the actuarial certificates submitted to the new pensions board and will, therefore, not necessarily facilitate approved supervision of schemes.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned that self-investment and the concentration of investment are not restricted even for the purpose of certifying minimum funding standards.  We have reservations about the precise disclosure arrangements which will be governed by regulation. The Minister has the power to restrict the categories of persons who receive information, the amount of information provided and whether it is supplied automatically or on request.  Some schemes may also be exempted from disclosure requirements on the grounds of size.</P>
    <P>The member trusteeship as recommended by a substantial majority of the National Pensions Board has not been introduced.  The equal treatment directive has been implemented in a minimalist manner with all possible exemptions and exclusions being availed of, in particular, different retirement ages.  Different benefits for survivors and even different member's contributions levels are permitted which are contrary to the recommendations of the National Pensions Board.  All pension disputes concerning equal treatment for men and women are to be dealt with by the pensions board in future rather than by the existing equality enforcement machinery, such as equality officers and the Labour Court as heretofore.  This will be further removed from the normal industrial relations arena and I argue that quite possibly it will have adverse consequences. There is no provision for compensation, except in dismissal cases, where employers are found guilty of, and employees have suffered from sex discrimination in regard to pensions.</P>
    <P>They are the litany of points that we would like the Minister to address before <Col N="1004" /> the Bill comes back on Committee Stage. I look forward to the continuing debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This most welcome Bill brings together the first and fourth reports of the National Pensions Board, which was established in 1986 to review the operation and regulation of occupational pension schemes.  The first report provides the body of recommendations reflected in this Bill.  The fourth report deals with the equal treatment of men and women in occupational pension schemes, the subject of EC Directive 86/378.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains very significant provisions aimed at regulating occupational pension schemes and protecting the interest of scheme members through the implementation of standards and procedures by all such schemes.  On reading the explanatory memorandum to the Bill I found that its purposes and main provisions are quite clear and understandable, although the Bill necessarily contains much technical detail relating to the operation of such schemes, the logic of which is found in the deliberations and report of the National Pensions Board.  I recognise, therefore, it is the product of a board which included representatives from Government, trade unions, employers and the self-employed, and the professionals within the pensions industry.  I understand also that a total of 19 further submissions were sent to the Minister following the publication of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far from being a watered down exercise, as Deputy Byrne has suggested, this Bill is a model of the democratic procedure with which this House can feel very comfortable and satisfied.  I congratulate the Minister and all those who contributed to bringing this Bill before the House.  However, if we can be critical of anything, it must be the length of time that passes before such important areas of law affecting so many people are reviewed or streamlined.  In this case we have the Trustee Act, 1893, comprising the main body of statute law in regard to pension schemes but which was not drafted with pension schemes in mind. <Col N="1005" /> That is a deficiency of our statute review system and therefore I am very pleased to see that this Bill provides for the establishment of a permanent pensions board which will, <i>inter alia</i>, monitor the general area of pension schemes and advise the Minister on the matter.  Within such a framework we can ensure that there are ongoing and efficient reviews of all pertinent legislative and procedural issues. It is particularly important, and indeed a comfort to this House, that in such an important Bill as this, which contains many technical provisions, there is a facility to ensure compliance and review and a body through which the views and representations of individuals, associations and other bodies can be properly channelled and efficiently received.</P>
    <P>Section 10 details the precise functions of the board.  While I believe they are quite comprehensive I wonder whether the Minister would consider establishing an advisory or public information office also.  I know there are provisions for the dissemination of information by trustees, but as we all know, bureaucratic or other reasons can often hinder or embarrass people when establishing their rights or entitlements.  A third party or public information bureau could provide a very useful service in this field and would at the same time give the board some indication of the types and extent of problems which might arise for the ordinary member.  It is possible that the Minister intends to provide this type of service and at this stage I would ask him to comment on it.</P>
    <P>In section 16, which also deals with the staff of the board, there are no provisions relating to the transfer of staff from Government Departments or other agencies, therefore, I presume all the staff will be recruited by the board.  I would be glad if the Minister could give me some indication of the likely employment arising from the establishment of the board and where it is intended the offices will be located.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with the disclosure by members of the board of any interest in proposed contracts.  It is correct that <Col N="1006" /> provision should be made to ensure that such disclosures take place.  As this will not be a private company, the provisions of company law will not apply where such disclosures do not take place.  In that case, the Minister does not provide a remedy for any failure on the part of board members to disclose such interest. I understand that because of the essentially representational nature of the eight ordinary members of the board, as provided for in the First Schedule, the Minister may have some sensitivities in this area.  However, it would be in the Minister's interest to provide some form of remedy for himself should difficulties arise in regard to this delicate area.</P>
    <P>Regarding Part II, I would like to offer a general warm welcome to the proposal to create the pensions board which I believe will be seen as a most positive and beneficial proposal by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill concerns the preservation of benefits.  Like most Deputies I was amazed at the Minister's recent statement to the effect that 90 per cent of workers who change jobs cash in their pension contributions.  I was astonished to hear that.  While some may re-invest the money in insurance policies or other long term securities I am sure that is not the case for most of these people.  It is only when this type of revelation is made known that one can focus on this problem and realise the possible longer term difficulties that could be caused for many people.  It is equally true that many workers feel tied down to particular jobs or companies because of difficulties involved in leaving a pension fund.  Naturally pension scheme trustees were not overly concerned with those leaving the scheme which created problems for those concerned to secure their own and their families long term security should they decide to take up alternative employment. It is these two areas that Part III of the Bill, along with the technical details and qualifications described in the Second Schedule, seeks to address.  I welcome the provisions in the sections.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a general comment on this Part of the Bill and the Second Schedule.  I would see great <Col N="1007" /> advantage in the production of a layman's guide to the technical detail of the sections in this Part and the Schedule giving some examples of what precisely would happen to pensions in the event of a person leaving employment and how the various calculations would be made.  If it would be impracticable to do so while the Bill is in transit through the Oireachtas it would be a very useful early exercise for the board.  I may again be pre-empting something the Minister already has in mind but I would be glad if he would consider this possibility so that what can otherwise be technical language, and necessarily so in the context of the Bill, could be reproduced later in more easily understood terms.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 33 and the entitlement to transfer payment, I was concerned on reading subsection (3) (b) that a direction to the trustees to apply the transfer payment in the purchase of one or more authorised annuities does not appear to be specific on whether the employee or the trustees select the annuities concerned.  I would appreciate if the Minister would re-examine this subsection to ensure that his intentions are clearly met.  If the subsection read that the members selected specific or named annuities from particular insurance companies &mdash; presuming that to be the intention &mdash; then it might read better.</P>
    <P>In the same vein, I would be glad if the Minister would elaborate on the circumstances as described in section 34 under which such an annuity may be purchased on behalf of a member without his consent instead of providing preserved benefit.  In those circumstances is it the Minister's intention that the member will have no choice in regard to the annuity purchased or the insurance company involved?  I would appreciate clarification on this section at a later stage.  In regard to these transfers generally, perhaps the Minister would indicate the position regarding those who take up employment elsewhere in the EC or who return to this country following a period of working in another EC country.  The reality of the Single European Market is the inevitable greater exchange and movement of <Col N="1008" /> workers across national borders.  While preservation of the benefits is an obvious option, I would be glad to know if there is any development at EC level to provide a similar transfer payment facility as provided for in this Bill.  I know there would be wider financial issues involved and can the Minister say if section 33 (3) (a) can be used for such purposes?  I have no doubt there will be many further developments in this area in the near future and arising from greater harmony in EC matters it only serves to underline the importance of establishing the pensions board at this time.</P>
    <P>Part IV will be of greatest interest to and cause the greatest activity for the new board.  In these provisions lie the very necessary security for all pension fund members.  It is essential that all schemes should be subjected to the types of scrutiny and procedural checks which are provided for in this Part and in the Third Schedule.  There have been some notable disasters in the past arising from under-funding of pension schemes which can only be tackled through close monitoring of funding arrangements.  I am aware that the accountancy bodies have been developing a new statement of standard accounting practice which relates to accounting for pension funds in the financial statements of companies.  All of these developments will provide a better and more open policing of the rights and entitlements of workers and members of such schemes.  In this context, I would ask the Minister to clarify the position of members when firms go into liquidation and where schemes are found to be under-funded.  In particular I would be glad to know where they stand in the pecking order as creditors.  This Bill will go a long way towards avoiding such catastrophies but equally they can happen.  Where do these people stand in terms of ranking as against preferential creditors?</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I would like to see an advisory or public information office established by the new board.  Notwithstanding that, I wish to welcome heartily the provisions in Part V dealing with the disclosure of information to <Col N="1009" /> members and their families, trade unions and others by the trustees of pension schemes.  Section 53, while providing for such disclosure, does not specify a time frame within which this information is to be provided.  This type of information equates with that provided for in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, in which a specified period is given &mdash; I think four weeks &mdash; in which to reply to a request for information on pensions and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>As section 53 (5) makes non-compliance an offence carrying a possible £1,000 fine, it is important to specify the time within which the request must be complied.  Perhaps I am being unfair to the Minister here, maybe I have missed such a provision in some other section.  If so, I apologise to the Minister, but I think this is worth pointing out.</P>
    <P>I can but welcome the detailed provisions in Part VI in regard to the general duties of trustees and their appointment and removal, which appear to be quite comprehensive.  Part VII dealing with equal treatment for men and women in occupational benefit schemes is yet another milestone on the road which has seen great achievements in this area over the past 20 years.  Notwithstanding the thrust of existing equality legislation, the provisions are very necessary and it is appropriate that the monitoring and implementation of these provisions falls within the framework of the Employment Equality Agency.  I am also glad that these provisions are based on an EC Directive which ensures that in this respect we are applying rights equal to those in other EC countries.  In this matter also we can be certain that the tremendous expertise and experience of the agency and the Labour Court will be put to good effect investigating complaints.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 78, which deals with dismissal arising from an employee's proper use of the facilities afforded by this Bill, I would have thought the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, would in any event have made such a dismissal unfair.  That <Col N="1010" /> being the case if I am right, I am concerned that there be consistent procedure for dealing with and investigating dismissals. The 1977 Act provides for investigation by the Employment Appeals Tribunal who can order reinstatement, re-engagement or compensation.  This Bill provides that the Labour Court should investigate and determine the fairness or otherwise of the dismissal, and I believe that complicates existing dismissal law procedures unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>In the normal course of events a dismissal appears before the Employment Appeals Tribunal who could just as likely find a particular dismissal in breach of this Bill and unfair, and I am anxious to know what would be the result of such determination.  Would it follow that the case had to be referred to the Labour Court?  Many practitioners in this field feel that these very important matters should be dealt with consistently, and I cannot help but feel that the Labour Court is an inappropriate body to refer dismissal cases to.  I would like the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    <P>These matters apart, the Minister has put together a very important Bill which I welcome, and I congratulate him on bringing it before this House.  I am sure it will receive the great attention and discussion it thoroughly deserves.  I look forward to the Minister addressing the few points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for facilitating me, because of a time factor to make a brief comment on the Second Stage of this very important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has traditionally been acknowledged that the basis of a pensions structure in addition to an income structure is a vital aspect of any individual's rights; indeed up to this moment a very substantial number of our community to which this legislation is directed have not had that aspect of security at the termination of their employment.  This Bill is confined to the private employment and occupational employment sectors, but those of us who have been associated with trade <Col N="1011" /> union and worker participation discussions down the years find it has taken quite a long time to have it extended to the latter category.  In the State, local authority and health boards sectors traditionally one category of worker had the benefits of a pensions scheme and another category termed the servant category were denied it.  Within these same bodies because one group were classified as officers they had an entitlement to a pension structure while the other sector, classified as servants, were not so entitled.  Finally, in 1974, after much agitation, to the satisfaction of all such people in county councils, health boards, forestry and the State itself, the then Minister legislated to include all grades and categories within the ambit and structures of the pensions schemes applicable to the officer grades in these organisations.  I am making that point to demonstrate that, while the officer grade pensions structures came into being with the formation of the State, it took many years to achieve justice and fair play for other categories of workers in the same concerns.</P>
    <P>We are now dealing with pensions schemes for occupational workers.  The guidelines set out are praiseworthy.  They provide that members can change jobs without forfeiting their pension rights. The schemes must be properly funded, employers must deliver on the promises made to their employees, and members must have full access to all information about the running of their schemes and the security of their pensions.  Those are all very worthy objectives, but the new pensions board face a horrendous task. They have a terrible job to correlate all the different industries, all the different interests and all the financial aspects of the different concepts they will be dealing with and make them acceptable to for the membership and the workforce.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into all the sections of this Bill today.  However, I welcome this as a first step.  This Bill is being introduced now not only to comply with an EC directive but because it is urgently needed to provide safeguards and provisions for people in occupational <Col N="1012" /> employment.  One can visualise that in a short time, the new Social Charter and new directives originating within the Community will play a substantial part in keeping all such schemes to a satisfactory level, but this board will have a tremendous task on their hands from the outset. We are all conversant with aspects of mutual pensions agreements between substantial occupational employment groups and their employers.  We have seen firms going into receivership, with the horrendous consequence for many people that the pension and security that they had looked forward to simply disappeared. I hope this board will be in a position to ensure that such disasters for occupational workers will not occur in the future.</P>
    <P>We have looked forward to this Bill for years.  Our aspiration is for a comprehensive national scheme which would have a tripartite basis involving the worker, the employer and the scheme. Having regard to the cost of such schemes and the resources available, we are conscious that it may not be possible now to bring this to reality.  We hope, however, that this is the first major step in ensuring that occupational employees and their dependants will have some support at retirement age.</P>
    <P>Not only must the employee be provided for by way of a reasonable and adequate pension but due regard must be had to the employee's dependants in the case of death.  Some existing private schemes cover this area to some extent. It is a very important factor and such provision will have to be of general application.  In the event of the death or serious injury of an employee, his dependants must be provided for.</P>
    <P>The importance of the trustees and representation on the board will be discussed specifically on Committee Stage. We believe that the success of a scheme will depend on information being made available by the trustees to the workforce. The membership of the board is not a suitable topic for discussion now but it will be the subject of amendments on Committee and Report Stages.  We must set up a competent board which will <Col N="1013" /> look after the interests of occupational employees and enjoy their confidence.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party welcome this Bill but we have substantial reservations on certain sections.  We will endeavour to ensure during subsequent Stages that these weaknesses are eliminated so that the Bill when it comes into law will be a model of efficiency and of immense benefit to a sector of our workforce who have been left unprovided for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will achieve its laudable objectives. It attempts to set out minimum standards and requirements to ensure the protection of contributors to pension schemes so that when an employee wishes to obtain his rights under a scheme he will find the fund intact.  I will comment later on that aspect.</P>
      <P>The Bill is quite complex and detailed and I am not sure that it will identify and deal with all the problems which have occurred in recent years.  It does not follow all the recommendations of the National Pensions Board but goes part of the distance.  I hope the provisions of the Bill will be sufficient to guarantee the rights of those involved.  The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill is to provide for the compulsory preservation of pension entitlements of members of occupational pensions schemes who change employments and for the subsequent revaluation of such entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some pensions schemes already operational which are quite good and have worked very effectively.  The Construction Industry Federation have a very effective and thorough pensions scheme on which I compliment them.  I have never found them wanting and they are very careful to ensure that an individual's entitlements are carefully guarded, regardless of when the contributions were made, or when the person ceased to be employed, changed employment or emigrated. The records of the scheme seem to be as near perfect as one can get.  We can all criticise the failings of various schemes but the opportunity should not <Col N="1014" /> be missed to congratulate those which have operated very well.</P>
    <P>A number of instances have occurred in the past few years involving individual employees who have contributed assiduously over many years to pensions schemes.  Their employment may have been interrupted and they may have returned to employment again.  For one reason or another somebody within the company interrupted the normal procedures and the unfortunate contributors discovered at the end of the day that their normal pension entitlements were not stashed away.  This Bill proposes to eliminate the interruption of normal procedures, the raiding of funds and their utilisation for other purposes.  That has happened on a couple of well known occasions but I am not sure that this Bill will be a panacea which will eliminate that kind of practice.  There will always be some people who will attempt to circumvent legislation in a fashion which in the short-term may be beneficial to themselves.  The Bill may not be capable of preventing that but at least it goes some way towards identifying the major weaknesses in the various systems.</P>
    <P>There was no overall governing body such as the one we are now to have.  I am sure every Member of the House shares my hope in this regard &mdash; if individuals contribute to a particular scheme for a number of years then at the end of the day they should be entitled to benefit from whatever contributions they have made.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Member of this House has had countless dealings over the years with insurance companies who have operated and cared for various schemes.  I hope this Bill will bring about some changes in this area.  Some employers have initiated pension schemes with very little cost to the employee but the benefit of such schemes to the employee can be minimal at the end of the day.  Perhaps the Minister should put a little more thought into what actually constitutes a worthwhile pension scheme, particularly those schemes operated by insurance companies.  There should be no difficulty nowadays in working out the details of a <Col N="1015" /> scheme which will not be all that punitive by way of contributions from an employee during the course of his employment, while at the same time being fairly beneficial to that employee at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some difficulties which have arisen over the years in relation to pension schemes.  I hope the National Pensions Board will not be a bureaucratic and impersonal body so that when a query is raised, as undoubtedly it will, they will be able to respond in a compassionate fashion, particularly when dealing with widows, who are in a vulnerable position, in attempting to obtain the benefits of a scheme to which they or their husbands have contributed. In the case of countless pension schemes which are being operated at present the spouse of a husband or wife who was 45 or 50 years when he or she died and who had contributed to such a scheme over a long number of years can very well find that their entitlement to benefit died with their spouse.  This is a very serious issue and has happened on a number of occasions.  It is very unfair and there is absolutely no necessity for it.  I am not sure the Bill will be capable of dealing with this problem.  I am sure other Deputies have come across this problem on occasion.  In many cases conditions were laid down at the inception of the pension scheme which predetermined what was going to happen at a later stage.  This is no excuse for what happens in such cases and people should be able to restructure schemes when the necessity arises.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency by some companies operating schemes to rely too much on the small print of the scheme when the pay-out time comes.  I am not sufficiently <i>au fait</i> with all these schemes to go into them in detail but a number of ones I have come across contained a death benefit.  I have had great fun with some companies in attempting to extract information from them before a necessity arises.  I am sure other Members of this House have experienced the same consternation in trying to determine precisely the best thing to do in certain circumstances.  In some cases the wives <Col N="1016" /> of constituents of mine have come to me after, perhaps, having had a discussion with their family doctors about their health or that of their spouses.  In such cases I should like to be able to gain access to information so as to be in a position to advise the individual concerned what she should do in her best interests.  I believe this Bill will cater for such cases in terms of the availability of information.  Of course, I know this will mean the availability of information on an ongoing basis so that we can obtain information for the contributor to a scheme regarding his or her entitlements and information on the security of the entire pension fund so that we can be sure the funds are not being drained off by some mysterious means in a different direction, being used for other purposes or shoring-up a firm which might be creaking.  The Bill deals with all these important issues.</P>
    <P>I do not want to digress from the Bill but I have to say that I have been disappointed at the manner in which the small or fine print has been interpreted in the past by some of the custodians of pension funds or insurance schemes.  I know we are talking here about contributory schemes but in some cases funds are paid into solely by, for instance, employers and it appears on the surface to employees that they are entitled to certain benefits.  However, when they go after those entitlements they find there are restrictions or regulations laid down in such a fashion as to create an obstacle course for the person concerned.  I do not think this should be allowed to happen.  It is a sort of sidestepping of the regulations and it is totally unfair to the unfortunate employees who are faced with that problem. Invariably the people who suddenly come face to face with this type of problem are the ones who are hard pressed financially and cannot afford the expertise to take on the large companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to clarify the duties and responsibilities of scheme trustees. This is an important provision having regard to previous incidents we all know about.  Obviously the responsibilities of the trustees are to ensure that the benefits <Col N="1017" /> are essentially retained and made available when the time comes and the scheme is not interfered with in any way.  The Bill also proposes implementing the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational benefit schemes.  We must all welcome this provision for the simple reason that it was easy in the past to say that because of certain contributions, payments or wage levels, women had a lesser rate of entitlement at the end of the day.  It was very handy to be able to do that and it is only proper that this is being amended in the Bill.  I may also add that it is only to meet an EC requirement that this provision has been incorporated in the Bill.  I make that point in case anyone thinks it was included as a result of divine inspiration here or elsewhere; like many other things, this provision has been included in the Bill because of an EC requirement.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of transferring benefits of an employee when he or she moves to new employment or leaves the country, there is probably room for even finer tuning of the system in the context of EC law, just as individuals can at present have social welfare benefits credited on the basis of their contribution in another country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill takes full account of the free and open economy that we will have coming into 1992, and the speed with which the financial transactions will be able to take place.  I hope somebody does not wake up some morning to find that what we have been trying to do in this Bill has been eroded with some computer throwing up a lot of blanks on the screen indicating that where there was a healthy fund it has now disappeared to some financial institution in Hong Kong. Modern technology has been worthwhile and advantageous but there are also risks attached to it.  I hope that the new freedom of movement of money will not become a means for circumnavigating any aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The pensions board is also being set up, which is a good idea.  I hope it will have sufficient teeth to ensure that matters are carried out in an above board <Col N="1018" /> fashion.  The Companies Bill is going through at the moment and for my sins, I had to sit on that Committee a couple of times.  It is, however, a necessary Bill and will, I hope, deal with some of the problems that might possibly arise in regard to pension schemes.  I hope however that we will not see, as a result of this Pensions Bill, a repetition of some of the debacles we have seen in the past, with people deciding to investigate their entitlements under a pension scheme and finding that they have none.  This sort of thing has happened in the past and is still happening.  For example, people have sold houses and lodged the money with an investment company and found, three or four days later, that there is no money and no house and no investment company and that their hard earned savings are all gone.  I am not so sure we will eliminate this problem.  I am specifically avoiding naming particular institutions, but we all know of them.  I suppose the pensions board will be able to police the operation of these schemes.  I have looked through the Bill and it looks as if they will, but other Bills have failed to eliminate the kind of abuses I am referring to.  I mention that because we have all come across constituents who have had bitter experience of dealing with some of these fast moving financial institutions.  That is all I want to say about that.  Generally, I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will eliminate the abuses we have seen in the past, protect the rights of contributors to pension funds and that it will discourage possible abuses by eliminating avenues for such before they arise, so to speak.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that a little more could be done for the self-employed.  Many would say that the self-employed should be made to look after themselves but, whether self-employed or employed by somebody else, individuals who contribute to a pension scheme are entitled to equal treatment and there should be no distinction.  If one is prepared to put money into a scheme one should get good value in return.  For the self-employed there is the question of income tax concessions and that is a sensitive area in this country because there are different views <Col N="1019" /> on it, depending on what side of the ideological fence one stands.  It would be no harm if the Minister would look again at the range of schemes for the self-employed and the manner in which they can be operated to take into account the tax code and the tax concessions that are available to see whether some improvement could be made there which may not be costly to the State and may in fact be beneficial to the State.  There is a State pension scheme already in operation.  I hope the one we are talking about now does not have as many sharp turns on the road.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I hope this Bill will achieve its objectives.  If it does that it will have eliminated some of the difficulties experienced by people in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This Pensions Bill is very important and will provide much needed protection to members of schemes who, in the past, were not sure of their position.  In the changing labour market and with greater life expectancy of employees this Bill comes at an appropriate time.  It is important that the Bill looks at equal treatment for men and women, although it does not go all the way down the road, which is a disappointment to me.  I will elaborate on that shortly.  It does, however, set important minimum standards of contributions for schemes and this is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a complex Bill in that it must cover many schemes and members of those schemes.  A study of the 12 European countries which was produced recently did not show Ireland in a great light as far as provision for pensions is concerned.  It showed that our pensioners were worse off than pensioners in any of the EC member stakes in terms of what their pensions can buy.  In addition, it was felt that the drop in their income on retirement was the worst in the EC, with the exception of the UK.  For example, in the Netherlands on retirement an employee can expect his or her pension to represent 93 per cent of previous earnings. That is very different from the position of most pensioners here.  In <Col N="1020" /> terms of purchasing power, Dutch pensioners are more than twice as well off as their Irish counterparts.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Bill deals with the problems experienced in many schemes.  We must look at age structure and life expectancy levels when talking about pensions.  The indications are that people can expect to live 15 years after retirement and, therefore, it is important that people prepare for retirement by proper financial plan.  Many people receive a pension from their employers but time and again we come across self-employed businessmen and farmers who have not made provision for their retirement. I have met many people who were in poor circumstances because of bad planning in their early years.  I hope that as a result of the debate young, self-employed people, including farmers, will realise the importance of planning for the future.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate on the Bill dealing with nursing homes I learned that the cost of private nursing home care for elderly people varies between £120 and £150 per week.  Another reason why people should make adequate provision for their retirement is that they may have to enter nursing homes in their later years and may have difficulty meeting the cost. People should realise the need to join pension schemes and prepare for their retirement.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has decided to establish a pensions board which will monitor and supervise schemes.  I am also pleased to note that a wide range of interests will be catered for on the board, in particular that the membership will include a trade union representative who will represent employees.  That person will highlight the problems of employees and, through the board, will bring them to the attention of the Minister.  The remit of the board is wide and, aside from ensuring that the provisions of the Bill are implemented, they will have comprehensive powers to carry out inspections of the various occupational pension schemes.  I note that failure to comply with the requirements of the Bill will be an offence and I hope <Col N="1021" /> that the penalties, which are significant, will act as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>The implementation of Directive 86/378 is important but it does not go far enough.  However, I am pleased in that it represents a significant step forward. The Bill covers occupational benefit schemes, access to schemes, benefit rights and contribution levels.  I am pleased to observe that under the directive women will receive special treatment in connection with pregnancy and childbirth but I am disappointed that the Bill does not include a provision on equal treatment for spouses and children of women employees.  We are all aware that many families depend on the income support of the working woman.  When I was employed in the public service in the early eighties I was a member of a pension scheme and the widows' and orphans' pension scheme.  However, the widows and orphans element has been changed to spouses and children.  The change means that women in the public service can provide for their dependants.  It is a pity that we must have a pause before there will be full equality in all pension schemes, private and public.</P>
    <P>My anxiety in regard to this was relieved by the Minister's commitment to eliminate all discrimination between men and women in occupational social security schemes.  I am pleased that the equality will be implemented in the next two years.  The provisions of the Bill will operate from 1 January next and I understand that the equality provisions must be implemented by January 1993.  Working women should have the option to contribute 1.5 per cent or 2 per cent of their income to provide for their dependants. If there is an option it will represent a cost to the employee.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the preservation of benefits for members of pension schemes who leave after the commencement date but before attaining normal retiring age.  That change is vital. In today's labour market the average employee will change jobs quite frequently. It is important that the pension schemes to which they have contributed <Col N="1022" /> should be preserved and passed to the next employer.  As a result of the change, rather than receiving a number of cheques for a small amount when they retire people will receive one cheque from their last employer.  Sections 26 and 28 are designed to protect the benefits of those early leavers and to create greater movement.  I welcome those provisions.</P>
    <P>The transfer of payments between employers is important.  It is good that the transfer payment equivalent to the value of the benefit will be made to the scheme of the new employer or to an improved annuity bond underwritten by a life office.  In addition, there will be an obligation to accept the transfer payment from the scheme of the previous employer while being free to determine the amount and form of the benefits accrued by such payments.  Any preserved benefits provided under a benefit scheme will be revalued after five years from the date of leaving and the rate of valuation will be equal to the annual rate of increase in the consumer price index, or 4 per cent, whichever is the lesser. That covers the differences in the five year period between the two employers.</P>
    <P>Part IV is of great importance in that it sets minimum standards.  We were all concerned about that and planned that it will be possible to have close monitoring of schemes.  There is a requirement that certification will be needed to show that specified minimum standards are being applied.  It is hoped that sufficient resources will be put at the disposal of the board to ensure that the regulations ware put into practice.  The pensions board will act as a watchdog.  There will be a similar approach in regard to the disclosure of information.  It is important that information should be made available to the pensioner, the pensioner's spouse and the trade union representative.</P>
    <P>Powers are given to the trustees and actuaries to obtain information, not only to ensure a free flow of information, but also so that parties tempted to engage in sharp practice of various forms may be <Col N="1023" /> deterred.  The freedom to see all documents pertaining to the scheme is provided for and the fact that annual audited accounts and actuarial valuations are compulsory should diminish fears regarding the operation of the schemes.</P>
    <P>The sections requiring disclosure of information are vital to ensure that there will not be a repetition of past cases where pensioners lost their life time contributions and pension entitlements. While the Bill covers a large area about which we were all concerned, I should like to see further progress on the issue of equality.  However, from the Minister's approach, it is obvious that there will be progress in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill has produced much needed minimum standards, regulations and safeguards while, at the same time, providing greater access to preserved benefits and the transfer from one employment to another.  This will provide greater efficiency and flexibility as workers prepare for their later years while also protecting their interests if they need to change employment to make progress or to be promoted.</P>
    <P>The Minister faced a most difficult task in presenting this Bill because there are 25,000 different occupational pension schemes in operation at present.  It is important to ensure the security of members' pension rights as they stand but we could not afford to put the continued development of pension schemes at risk by over-regulation.  The Bill provides for major, progressive improvement and I compliment the Minister for introducing it.  We look forward to its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael welcome the Bill as we had been pressing the Minister to introduce it.  Indeed when introducing it, he said it was the most important legislation concerning occupational pensions to come before the House since the foundation of the State. I might not fully agree with that remark but it is certainly very important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said that he wished to ensure that members can change jobs <Col N="1024" /> without forfeiting their pension rights, that schemes are properly funded, that employers deliver on the promises made to their employees and that members have full access to all information about the running of their schemes and the security of their pensions.  We welcome all these measures and we compliment the Minister for introducing them because Fine Gael had been pressing for them for some time.  Indeed, last March we specifically called on the Minister to introduce the legislation without further delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged the work of previous administrations and said it was against this background that the National Pensions Board was established in 1986, to report to the then Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; the former Deputy Barry Desmond &mdash; on the priorities for the regulation of occupational pension schemes and the general development of pensions for the future.  Thus began a process which has culminated in the publication of this Bill.  We are very glad that the Minister generously acknowledged that aspect in his introduction to the Bill. It is in the spirit of that approach by the Minister that Fine Gael welcome the Bill. A number of amendments may be necessary on Committee Stage.  Some may be introduced by the Minister or, where necessary, by the Opposition spokes-persons. Fine Gael believe that the Minister made an error in failing to adopt the full proposals of the National Pensions Board regarding equal treatment and member trustees.</P>
    <P>We welcome the provision in the Bill regarding minimum funding, disclosure of information and the establishment of a pensions board.  We particularly welcome the provision for the preservation and transfer of pension rights.  We will propose amendments to ensure that member trustees are appointed to large schemes within a fixed period after the Bill has been enacted.  We also want to provide for full, equal treatment as recommended by the National Pensions Board and which is in line with current practice in many cases.  It is vital to clarify legal <Col N="1025" /> uncertainties enshrined in the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>The aim of Fine Gael is to ensure that the Bill is as simple and cost-effective as possible.  It is vital to ensure that there is a mechanism to encourage the provision of pensions and to discourage employers from worsening pension schemes.  Fine Gael are concerned at the level of exemptions proposed in the major sections and we will be anxious to hear the Minister clarifying his intentions in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a welcome development in pension law as it replaces the Trustees Act, 1893, and the Perpetual Funds (Registration) Act, 1933.  The success of the Bill is due in no small way to the National Pensions Board who thrashed out many of the issues involved.  It is a model for other complex, specialist legislation.</P>
    <P>This is significant legislation which will benefit many employees not currently in pension schemes.  It will also benefit the State because at present many low paid employees are pushed out of service industries without a pension, often after working all their lives in the same firm. These people are often in their fifties and sixties; sometimes they have been in a live-in job with the result that they also lose their home.  I am glad that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is sitting in for the Minister for Social Welfare because I know he is familiar with the problem of people who have been pushed out of their jobs and accommodation, which means that they have to join the local authority housing list.  If proper pension facilities were provided for everyone there would be less of a strain on local authorities having to provide housing.  From our involvement with local authoriites we know that there is a strong demand for local authority houses from people who are unemployed in their fifties and sixties and who do not have a pension.  Indeed, local authorities now provide specialised housing for such people.  If they can be helped in this Bill it would also benefit the State because it would not have to provide further facilities for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> I hope that this Bill will mean that people who are pushed out of employment will at least still have their pension entitlements.  There are many more people in this position than is generally recognised.  I spent 25 years in the same occupation before I became a TD.  I left my job without receiving any redundancy payment, lump sum, or pension rights, in fact without leave of absence.  My employers said: well done on your election to the Dáil; we are sure you will not need leave of absence.  I hope their confidence in me will prove to have been justified.  There are countless numbers of people like me, people employed in other service industries.  For example, I was part-time, then full-time, then part-time, then self-employed and again a part-time employee; that was my type of employment. I worked in livestock marts all my life.  I merely give that as an example of the circumstances in which a number of people find themselves having worked perhaps half their lifetime in the one job or perhaps different jobs.  It would be my hope that the provisions of this Bill would cater for such people rendering it easier for them to be included in pensions schemes.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the establishment of a pensions board which will monitor and regulate the pensions industry, ensuring that these provisions are complied with. In addition to the establishment of a pensions board there will be included also the preservation of benefits, minimum funding standards, disclosure of information in relation to schemes, trustees of schemes and equal treatment of men and women in occupational pensions schemes.  While the provisions of the Bill provide a framework within which occupational pensions schemes can be operated, it would appear that the self-employed and those in non-pensionable employment once again have been omitted. That is why I mentioned my employment circumstances and those of a number of others finding themselves in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this Bill as it stands in relation to occupational pensions schemes, nonetheless thought should be <Col N="1027" /> devoted to the provision of pensions for the self-employed and those in non-pensionable employment.  I know there is a contributory pension entitlement for the self-employed.  However, that leaves a category of persons dependent on the State whereas, were they given sufficient fiscal encouragement, they could make such provision for themselves.</P>
    <P>Our spokesperson, Deputy Flaherty, will be tabling some amendments, and we will be anticipating some on the part of the Minister, on Committee Stage.  In the course of his remarks the Minister indicated on a number of occasions that he will give favourable consideration to such amendments, where necessary.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are indeed necessary.  There has been much worry caused by the collapse of high profile pensions schemes in recent years.  For example, there were the cases of H. Williams and the Castlcomer collapses which caused many people worry, they being in similar circumstances.  Certainly the provisions of this Bill will tighten the position somewhat in that regard.  There is no doubt that those and other events have worried employers and employees alike.  It would be my hope that the introduction of this Bill would help to allay such fears.</P>
    <P>In replying I should like the Minister to clarify a number of matters for me.  For example, in the course of his introductory remarks he had this to say:</P>
    <P>Members also have a right to information on their schemes under trust law, but legal proceedings may also be required ultimetely to obtain redress in this area.  The likelihood of long delays and the uncertainty as to the outcome, given the vagueness of trust law, will generally act as a major deterrent to members taking legal proceedings to enforce their rights, particularly given the substantial legal costs that could be involved. </P>
    <P>While accepting that, I wonder how does the Minister reconcile that apparent contradiction? It is all very well that, under existing law, somebody can take their case to the courts to ensure that their <Col N="1028" /> right to information is enforced, but if there is a prohibitive factor included, how can they do so?  Later in his introductory remarks the Minister made this comment:</P>
    <P>The new board will be broadly representative of the main interests in pensions schemes, namely, the trade unions, employers, the pensions industry and the Government. </P>
    <P>That poses the question: what percentage of the pensions board membership will be representative of the trade unions? We must remember that not alone will the trade unions be safeguarding the interests of their members but they will be representing the views of all employees.</P>
    <P>Later in his remarks the Minister had this to say:</P>
    <P>The success of this legislation in safeguarding the rights of pension scheme members is crucially dependent on the board operating with the maximum efficiency.  I believe that this can be best achieved by having the administrative expenses financed by the occupational pensions schemes. </P>
    <P>It is indeed strange that it is proposed that the administrative costs should be borne by pension schemes.  I wonder whether that is justified, or whether such administrative costs should not be funded separately rather than be a drain on pension schemes.  Under the heading &mdash; Exclusion of Certain Categories &mdash; the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is my intention to exclude public sector schemes who operate the public service transfer network from these requirements.  Such schemes cater for those employed in the Civil Service and the broader public service, including the vast majority of semi-State companies. </P>
    <P>Later he said:</P>
    <P>There is also in existence an extensive transfer network whereby full credit for past service is provided to <Col N="1029" /> employees moving within public sector organisations. </P>
    <P>Would the Minister say whether the provisions of section 36 cater for the present employees of FÁS, who I understand intend taking legal action on 11 June in pursuit of their pension scheme rights. Under the provisions of the Labour Services Act, 1987, AnCO personnel, now employees of FÁS, find that the Minister for Labour is not honouring the provisions of their pension scheme that obtained when they were employees of AnCO.  They propose taking strike action in support of their claim.  I hope the Minister will be able to assure the House that the enactment of this Bill will solve that problem, thus, hopefully, eliminating the necessity for their proposed industrial action.  If the Minister can give such assurance it will indeed be helpful to FÁS employees, perhaps eliminating the necessity for their proposed industrial action and its knock-on effects which will affect them severely.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael welcome the introduction of this Bill for a number of reasons apart from certain reservations and the amendments we shall be tabling on Committee Stage to strengthen its provisions.  Its provisions will ensure a fully transferable pension scheme, much to be desired at present because we must remember that people change employment frequently, sometimes four or five times in their lifetime; it is not like the position that obtained years ago when people remained in the same employment for life.  The portable aspect of the new scheme is very desirable and we welcome it.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate when he is replying the relationship between the new pensions board and the Revenue Commissioners?  I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have a section, albeit under a staff section which monitors pension schemes and this new scheme does not fit in with that section. Will the Minister outline what he proposes to do in this regard?  As I have said, I will be seeking clarification on this and the other points I have raised.  However, <Col N="1030" /> in general I compliment the Minister on having acknowledged the necessity for introducing this legislation we have been pressing for.  We await with interest the Committee Stage when we will be pursuing the necessary amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  It is only right and proper that Deputies should come into the House and congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I recall questioning the Minister's predecessors, the former Deputies Hussey, Eileen Desmond and Barry Desmond on many occasions in this House. I always felt that the aspect of social welfare that needed a push was a national pensions scheme.  I compliment the Minister on his initiative in this regard.</P>
      <P>I know a great deal of work and research had to be done to introduce a national pension scheme and I congratulate the National Pensions Board and the Minister on ensuring that such a scheme will now be on the Statute Book. In his speech the Minister dealt mainly with procedures and the safeguards for the pension funds, matters which, of course are of vital importance.  For many people the investment in a pension plan is the most important investment they are likely to make both in terms of cash and financial security.  It is therefore important that these life long investments are not only well managed but are seen to be properly managed and that the members are provided with the information they require to satisfy themselves in this regard.  Too many workers after long years of making contributions to pension funds were shocked to learn that the funds into which they had been paying went out of existence.  One can well imagine the shock and despair of a worker on finding himself in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to compulsory preservation of benefits.  I welcome the compulsory preservation of pension rights of workers who leave their jobs.  Too often workers were blackmailed into staying in unsatisfactory employment because to leave would mean losing their pension rights.  Very often this artificial barrier <Col N="1031" /> dictated the conditions of employment and salary which was often under a national wages agreement.  I welcome the removal of this obstacle.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the Bill which gives effect to the requirements of the EC Directive which provides for the implementation of the principle of equal treatment in occupational benefits.  A very important provision in the Bill is the one relating to penalties for offences.  The Bill provides that a prosecution for an offence may be instituted by the new Pensions Board to be established under Part II of the Bill.  Very few members would risk instituting proceedings in the High Court.  Under the provisions of this Bill, an aggrieved member can request the Pensions Board to take an action on his or her behalf against a defaulting trustee.  I believe this is one of the significant safeguards enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the annual report by trustees giving basic information on the scheme, I would like to know if members are made aware in advance of any amendments to the scheme over the years?  I do not know how one should approach this, but if amendments are to be made, members should know in advance the proposed amendments and their observations should be requested.  I have always believed that if one is to change something, notice should be given to members so they can make their contribution. We are trying to bring perfection to the Bill and I would like the Minister to enlighten me further in this area.  I do not think it is in the Bill but the Minister referred to it in the course of his speech.  Amendments can be made which can cause disruption to members if they are not to their satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say he was determined to ensure that member participation in the appointment of trustees will be dealt with in a way that will give members an effective and meaningful role in the administration of what is after all a scheme designed for them.  I had certain reservations about this part of the Bill but I am prepared to accept it having listened to the Minister's explanation. However, I hope there will be no <Col N="1032" /> delay in appointing a member to the board of trustees.  I have no doubt that employers would also like to see a member working on the board of trustees and this would be in their own interests. Co-operation between workers and employers will be of tremendous benefit to everybody.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of experience of problems in the building and construction industry.  I know people who had given years of their working life to builders and on retirement found that the pension fund no longer existed.  We had too many cowboy builders in recent years getting rich over night at the expense of their workers.  The safeguards of pension funds which the Minister is now introducing would have been very important to these people.  It is very sad that a worker, after giving years of service, finds that the pension no longer exists for him.  How many employers invested members' contributions in their business and then conveniently went into voluntary liquidation and bang went the pension fund which was part of the financial structure of the industry?  I have dealt with many workers in the building construction industry who were deprived of their rights and the moneys they had contributed to the fund, and for that reason alone, I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill every success and hope its scope will be broadened over the years to include the self-employed and those in non-pensionable employment.  It is new and deserves the support of everyone.  I am glad the trade unions also support the Bill although they have one reservation regarding the trustees.  From reading the Minister's brief and from the explanation he has given, I have no doubt trade unions will understand that this is something that is in its infancy and needs a trial period to reach perfection.  I can see great things in this Bill.  I hope the trustees will monitor the whole performance of the Bill so that we can break into different fields &mdash; as I have mentioned, the self-employed and those in non-pensionable employment.  Trustees should concentrate on how best these people could be included.  Many people <Col N="1033" /> do not want to depend on the State.  This Bill places a tremendous emphasis on the future of pension schemes.  Young people starting employment should ensure that they are involved in a pension scheme.  I see great hopes in introducing a long-awaited and long-demanded measure by members of the various political parties.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the transfer of pensions.  Many of our young workers have emigrated and are in employment, perhaps pensionable employment, in other countries.  I wonder if there is a possibility that they could be included in this pension scheme.  If they are in pensionable employment abroad I do not think there would be any complication for insurance companies in transferring their pensions.  Many of these people, especially as far as the construction industry is concerned, want to come back home.  I understand builders are asking former employees to return home as there is now an up-lift in the building industry.  These people have had a sad experience of pensions in this country. Perhaps the Minister would comment on this matter and consider widening the scope of the Bill over the years to include emigrants in the pension scheme.  There may be certain complications but I would like a comment from the Minister on this. It is very important that emigrants return on retirement.  They do not want to be a burden on the State and are prepared to contribute to their independence.  It would maintain the link between the people at home and the emigrants if they were involved in a pension scheme.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I want to be brief because I know many Members want to make contributions.  I have no doubt the Minister will be prepared to consider amendments which would improve the Bill.  This measure is new and deserves a trial run and concentration as to its working.  As I have said I hope it will be broadened to include the self employed and those in non-pensionable employment. On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I welcome the Bill.  We have been advocating this idea since our inception. Since I entered the Dáil about 25 years <Col N="1034" /> ago, and from earlier in my career in political life, I have been continually advocating the establishment of a national pension scheme to safeguard our workers at the end of their working lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year when I gave up the previous position I held to stand for election to Dáil Éireann, besides all the other risks I was taking I was throwing away pension rights that I had built up for a period in excess of 11 years.  It was an area in which I felt legislation was needed, as a sum of money was being put aside on my behalf on an annual basis until such time as I reached retiring age. I am very pleased that the Minister for Social Welfare has now brought this legislation before the Dáil and I know it will be welcomed by the approximate 550,000 employees and their families.  It affords them a degree of security that was not there previously.</P>
      <P>The setting up of the pensions board to monitor and supervise on a regular basis the activities of the pension scheme is a very important development.  We have seen in the past the scandal whereby firms were reportedly making their PAYE and PRSI returns on a monthly basis on behalf of their employees but when something went wrong and these employees went along to claim the benefits they were entitled to, it transpired that these funds had not been paid over to the Revenue Commissioners.  Indeed we have also seen the situation in the past whereby some pension schemes were under-funded, and significantly so in some areas.  In all these instances to a large extent the employee was at the mercy of his employer but thankfully the provisions of this Bill change that situation. The duties of the trustees of these schemes are clearly outlined and I welcome particularly the section relating to the disclosure of information in relation to schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For too long members of occupational pension schemes knew that an amount of money was accruing on their behalf each week or each month but beyond that they knew nothing else.  They did not know how this scheme was being administered, <Col N="1035" /> they did not know how it was performing and, most particularly, they did not know what payments they were going to receive on a regular basis when they retired.  Furthermore was this payment index linked or was it a flat rate which would very quickly lose its value?  Under this new Bill the trustees must provide members with certain financial and other information about the scheme.  Also the individual rights and obligations which arise under the scheme must be disclosed. If this Bill is enacted and a member is unhappy with the way his or her scheme is operating, they would then have recourse to the pensions board to have the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>At present most pension schemes are established under trust law.  Trust law has evolved primarily in relation to family and charitable settlements and it is not always easy to apply to the different circumstances of pension schemes in that much that is embodied in the Trustees Act, 1888 to 1958, with its precise limits are hard to define.  The main body of the statute laws are contained in the Trustees Act, 1883, which was not passed with pension schemes in mind.</P>
    <P>The common law view of trust is that the settlers or persons setting up trusts should have complete freedom to make whatever provisions they think fit.  Most statutory provisions only take effect in the absence of some expressed provision in the trust instrument.  Trust law is not normally restrictive and where the legislator has thought restrictions to be necessary there has been specific legislation in relation to certain charitable trusts.</P>
    <P>There is therefore an absence of any specific statutory provision covering the duties of pension scheme trustees.  Trust duties may be set out in the trust deed but there is no general law regulating what should be included but duties of trustees may in fact be very limited if the trust deed so provides.  The only general obligation of trustees is to administer the fund in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed.  It can, therefore, be difficult to assess if trustees, or deeds, are performing properly and in accordance with trust law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> At present if members of a particular scheme have reason to believe that the scheme is not being administered in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed, or is being mismanaged, the redress currently is through the courts (a) by suing for breach of trust, or (b) for an order removing the trustees.  I am not aware of any such case that has come before the court here which specifically related to pensions schemes and in any event the cost, delays etc. involved in such proceedings would be quite substantial and perhaps make the action prohibitive.</P>
    <P>While members of pension schemes do have certain rights at the present time to information concerning their own pension scheme, this is not generally realised by the beneficiaries.  Moreover, those who are aware of their legal right to information are generally unclear as to what this right involves and how it can be asserted or enforced.  In any event for those who do realise that ultimate legal proceedings may be required in order to obtain redress, the likelihood of long delay and substantial costs would act as a major deterrent.</P>
    <P>Because of the provisions of this Bill members of occupational pension schemes may now be assured that in order to comply with the new legislation their scheme will have to be structured in such a manner as to be in a position to provide promised benefits, not only on completion of service to pension age but also to be adequately funded to provide a realistic proportion of such benefits which would be inflation proofed should they leave service or should the scheme be discontinued prior to pension age.  It is a welcome development that an employee who is a member of the pension scheme with five years' service completed will be automatically entitled as if he or she remained in service and in addition this benefit will now have to keep pace with inflation up to 4 per cent per annum over the period up to pension age.  Facilities to transfer benefit to another scheme or into a personal annuity bond underwritten by a life office are also a major step forward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> Because pension schemes are entered into voluntarily and are not imposed by statute it may be argued that it is inappropriate to legislate for compulsory preservation of pension benefits.  In our society generally and in the employment area in particular there are numerous examples of legislation governing activities entered into by choice and there is no reason why this should not be so in the pensions field.</P>
    <P>Under this proposed legislation all schemes must provide preserved benefits for those leaving service.  For many who will leave a company after a short period of service the preserved benefit is likely to be trivial.  It can be argued, therefore, that in such cases there should be no compulsory preservation.  However, with increasing mobility of labour one must guard against the possibility of a number of successful employments of short duration with no pension rights eventually becoming a high proportion of an employees total working right.  Therefore, I feel that the preservation requirement should apply to those leaving with a short minimum period of service and I feel that this has been adequately captured in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The funded pension schemes are an effective safeguard for members' pension rights only if enough money is set aside to meet the schemes liabilities.  In setting the funding policy for a defined benefit scheme the main emphasis is generally on the ongoing position i.e. are rates of contributions sufficient to fund adequately each member's expected pension prior to his or her retirement. Particularly recently the extent to which a pension fund could meet its obligations and wind up were probably not considered as part of the normal actuarial valuation process.</P>
    <P>We must remember that in framing proposals for a minimum funding standard Ireland has a high percentage of small companies many of which make pension provision for their employees through the medium of pension schemes operated by an insurance company.  The funding year is usually on a premium <Col N="1038" /> which is paid annually.  Almost invariably the annual input to a scheme funded on an annual premium basis is less than one funded using a more conventional group funding approach.  Consequently the overall amount available to provide benefits in the event of a wind-up would be lower.</P>
    <P>The world population is growing at an enormous rate and it is becoming increasingly difficult to provide jobs and an adequate standard of living for the increasing population.  Partly because of this there has been a tendency over the last number of years to reduce the working week, to provide job sharing schemes and other incentives and efforts to try to get as many people as possible into the workforce.  There is also more of a tendency nowadays to try to retire people earlier basically to try to get them out of the workforce earlier in life. While this creates other job opportunities for younger people, it causes problems for the person who is retiring and throws up new challenges to them.  There is accordingly far more leisure time available to people nowadays and this time has to be filled somehow, lest stagnation and disinterest in life is to set in.  To fill these periods, certain activities are often undertaken which in many cases cost money.  Because of this proper provision has to be made while one is in employment so that an acceptable standard of living can be maintained in retirement.</P>
    <P>Despite the question of costs it must be recognised that the main objective of an occupational scheme is to provide members with an income in retirement which, when taken in conjunction with whatever social welfare benefits are payable, is sufficient to maintain a reasonable standard of living.  This objective will not be achieved however unless there are arrangements in operation to increase pensions in payment in order to protect the real income of the retired member. Accordingly priority must be given to developing arrangements which would lead to a greater level of protection for pensions in the course of payment than had been achieved previously.  Because of the likely costs involved it should not <Col N="1039" /> be assumed that employers alone should be asked to pay the total cost of such arrangements.  For example, members might be willing to pay part or all the additional cost involved.</P>
    <P>While it is important for the people who are retiring to be in a position to maintain the standards that they are used to, certain funding standards must also be maintained.  All the pensions schemes in the world or all the regulations in the world, will matter little if the amounts being transferred to the pension fund are insufficient to meet the future demands. That is why I welcome the minimum funding standards which are set out in the Bill for defined benefit schemes which are funded.  I note that these will be subject to actuarial supervision and that the Pensions Board will have to be satisfied that sufficient assets are maintained within the fund to provide the specified minimum benefits.  I am glad that schemes which are seen not to be in accordance with these provisions will be required to submit a proposal to outline the measures that it will be intended to take to ensure that any deficiencies in the fund are quickly made up.  As I have said earlier, this is an area where many people on retirement have found out to their detriment that sufficient moneys have not been provided for them but thankfully this problem will now be eliminated.</P>
    <P>A by-product of this Bill which I believe is going to be of benefit is that it will give more flexibility in the labour market.  Up to now the fear of losing pension rights by transferring from one occupation to another, has discouraged many employees from seeking new horizons and new challenges.  The old adage that familiarity breeds contempt could certainly be used here as the longer a person stays at a particular job, the more likely that that person is going to become uninterested and accordingly less productive, thereby reducing standards.  The provisions of this Bill provide a much needed flexibility and can be of tremendous benefit to those amongst us who are bored and fed up with life and need a change not only to improve their work performance but which as a consequence <Col N="1040" /> would also improve the quality of their life.  This is a very real social benefit of this Bill and one which I think should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>We cannot always expect the State sector, through the social welfare services, to provide money in these circumstances to meet expectations.  The social welfare services are there to provide an adequate income for people to live on but we as a country cannot expect to ever go substantially beyond that.  This is why privately operated pension schemes are becoming more and more important as we move into the 21st century. Indeed this has been recognised by some of the more far-sighted companies over the last number of years, which have been making provision through various pension schemes for their employees. Unfortunately most of those schemes did not go far enough and as I outlined earlier, they were a disincentive to mobility in the workplace.  This Bill tackles those shortcomings which have become more and more evident of late.</P>
    <P>While it would be churlish not to recognise that there is still a certain amount of poverty in this country, nevertheless where the vast majority of the population are concerned, they have seen a rise in their living standards over the last ten to 15 years.  This increase in living standards breeds its own problems as in general people will live according to their means and their means dictate that they can afford certain items and have a certain quality of life which possibly they did not have heretofore.  It is very difficult subsequently for anybody to endure a cutback in their standard of living and we have all seen many examples of this where a person loses his or her job and the consequent effects that this can have on that person and his or her family.  In many cases they cannot cope with this change in their living standard and unfortunately sometimes resort to drastic measures.  The same can be said of the person who is going into retirement.  He or she cannot just turn themselves off over the course of a couple of weeks and readily accept that because they have now reached a certain age, they must <Col N="1041" /> do without some of the things that they enjoyed previously.  This is why it is so important to have proper provision made for one's retirement years, so that their own level of standards can be maintained. Indeed, besides everything else, there are external social pressures which quite often dictate the standard that must be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to note that the concept of equal treatment for men and women in occupational benefit schemes is an important core of this Bill.  This principle of equal treatment is outlined in section 65 which states that &ldquo;there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex in respect of any matter relating to an occupational benefit scheme&rdquo;.  Any scheme which includes a rule purporting to discriminate against a particular sex will have that rule declared null and void by the provisions of section 69.  This discrimination in pension schemes does happen and has happened in the past and it is praiseworthy that such a determined effort is being made to stamp out this practice.</P>
    <P>One of the most important parts of this Bill is the provisions as outlined in sections 63-79 relating to equal treatment. At present in private sector schemes employees are not usually permitted to join an occupational pension scheme until they have reached a certain minimum age, completed a minimum period of service, or reached a certain job status, for example full time.  In some schemes a maximum entry age is also stipulated.</P>
    <P>Where there are differences in treatment between men and women the likelihood is that eligibility conditions for females involve a longer service qualification and/or a higher eligibility age for admission to the pension scheme.  The primary reason for such differences is to keep down administration costs because historically the incidence of employees leaving employment before age 30 is particularly significant among women.  I think it is obvious that both on the merits of the case itself and the fact that it is explicitly required by the terms of the EC <Col N="1042" /> Directive, eligibility conditions governing membership of occupational pension schemes should be the same for men and women.  This should be specifically provided for in legislation and I welcome the fact that this has been done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Occupational pensions schemes are free to pick their own pension ages for men and women.  The fact that their time and pension under the State's social assistance system is payable from age 65 has had a major influence on the design of occupational pensions schemes where equal retirement age has been very much the norm.  Where differences occur they generally mean that the normal retirement age for women is earlier than that for men.  In view of the fact that the State social insurance system has a common pension age for men and women, I can see no reason for deferring the implementation of equal treatment in this area. Where changes have taken place to equalise retirement age for men and women the trend has been to equalise the later retirement age.  I think this is reasonable and a practical means of achieving equality of treatment.</P>
    <P>Where existing arrangements do not comply with the principle of equal treatment there will be cost implications in achieving equality.  However, there may well be ways of mitigating or neutralising such costs in individual schemes, for example, by negotiating overall terms and conditions in a manner which complies with equality provisions but does not involve overall additional cost.  In any event, there is no way that this should be put forward as an excuse to delay the implementation of the equal treatment concept.</P>
    <P>Another advantage of proper pension provisions is that it encourages some people to perhaps retire a little bit earlier than they might have otherwise envisaged, but many of these people will possess skills which quite often are subsequently used for the benefit of the less well off and disadvantaged in their community.  There is quite a number of people in this category who will always want some sort of work type challenge to occupy their minds and very many of <Col N="1043" /> these become involved in charitable organisations, local residents' associations and, indeed, a wide range of activities, which brings great benefit to the community at large.</P>
    <P>This Government, or any Government, will probably never be in a position to provide a full and complete range of services that we might like and that is why it falls to voluntary organisations to fill a gap, and these organisations will be augmented by skilled, intelligent, retired people either through participation in existing organisations or through the initiation of new ones.  I have seen that happen in my home city of Waterford.</P>
    <P>One organisation that immediately springs to mind is the &ldquo;Make Waterford Beautiful&rdquo; Committee who have such people involved with them and they are doing a tremendous job to clean up and beautify Waterford, thereby making it a more attractive place for visitors.  This obviously has a commercial benefit to tourism, etc.  Then people are generating income, helping the economy, increasing our gross national product but costing the State nothing.  They have also created employment in the jobs they have left which takes more people off the unemployment register.  In this situation the retired person wins, the State wins, commercial enterprise wins and the unemployed win.  I know this may sound like a simplification of the whole process and is perhaps a bit Utopian, but it is happening, perhaps slowly at present but it is bound to accelerate in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill can bring tremendous benefits and my own summary is that it will create a more mobile workforce, it will help employees maintain in retirement the standard of living they were accustomed to, it will create employment by encouraging earlier retirement through proper pension funding and it will benefit charitable and other organisations by the provision of retired people with no financial worries who have time to devote to such organisations.</P>
    <P>This Bill tackles and I think succeeds in putting some order into a rapidly expanding area and the principal thrust <Col N="1044" /> behind the whole Bill is to ensure that scheme members are fully informed at all times of what is happening to their particular scheme and can have full confidence that their later years are being well provided for because of the minimum funding standards which are laid down.  The concept of preserving pension rights for early leavers is an excellent one, while particularly the principle of equal treatment for men and women is most important, as I have already outlined. All in all, I feel that the approximately 550,000 people who will be affected by this Bill and their families, will be most appreciative of what the Minister has succeeded in achieving on their behalf through the presentation of the Pensions Bill 1990.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not speak for very long on the Bill but I want to make a few points.  I look forward to watching the Bill going through the House because really I do not fully understand how the pensions scheme works at this time.  I have not had an opportunity to read the legislation that has been put together down the years, and I am looking forward to understanding fully the gripes people have, and that I hear about regularly as I talk to my constituents.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out to try to provide a national pension system for everybody, and that is very laudable.  I am sure any defects in the Bill will become obvious as we go through the various Stages.  The Minister and his officials have to be commended for the amount of work they have done in drawing this document together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a few words about my experiences with the business of pensions and social welfare since I became a Deputy in this House last year.  It is an absolute minefield.  There are problems I have seen as a rural Deputy which I would like eliminated.  One of the things I noticed initially was that many people are convinced that pensions and social welfare assistance and benefits are available on patronage, and if they go to their local TD they will get assistance or benefits they are not really entitled to.  It is a <Col N="1045" /> shame that a great many people are gulled into believing that.  All reasonable people have to agree that is not the case and only where people are willing to tell lies and misrepresent the facts can they avail of benefits and assistance that otherwise they might not be entitled to.</P>
    <P>I doubt very much if Members of this House are helping people to evade their responsibilities in that area.  Certainly I would have nothing to do with anything like that, but the feeling abroad is that patronage is widespread.  People come into my clinics and discuss with me proudly the possibility of getting a pension, a non-contributory pension which obviously they are not entitled to, and they expect me to use my influence to provide them with a little income each week.  Possibly the reason for that is that the people who deliver the service in that area have always been very far removed from the population at large.</P>
    <P>The ordinary person in rural Ireland has been afraid to some degree of the person who carries out the means test and as a result there has never been any great clamour for services to be made more available.  People would prefer not to have to deal with social welfare officers at all.  In seven or eight years' time everybody will be getting a contributory pension but in the interim the Ministers in charge should try to update the availability of information and services to the general public and get rid of some of these silly myths.  If a person in my constituency wants to talk to somebody about social welfare, he or she finds it very difficult to get in touch with somebody who knows the facts.</P>
    <P>The offices where information is available are generally quite far away. Officials who understand the regulations and conditions governing social welfare should be easily accessible.  The personnel attached to the office in Carrickmacross spend much of their time on the road carrying out assessments and means tests.  A person who is visited by one of these officials may want to have a further discussion but only one or two hours are available each week for such <Col N="1046" /> meetings.  It is a case of never the twain shall meet after the initial visit.  These constituents call to my clinic and there is interminable letter-writing in an effort to get information about something which could easily be sorted out if the people came face to face.  We waste our time and energy seeking information which should be provided automatically in the first place.</P>
    <P>The same applies in respect of information on unemployment assistance. People cannot get the information they require in their local office.  A form can be filled in and sent to a distant office, but it is not easy to contact the person dealing with the matter.  When people seek the assistance of politicians the notion that there is widespread patronage is further built up.</P>
    <P>Very recently I came in contact with a widow whose reading ability was quite poor and whose understanding of the intricacies of pensions was very limited. Her husband died about 12 months ago and she informed me that in 1985 he had been given the option of joining the widows' and orphans' pension scheme.  A letter arrived from his employer, a public service body, which he had difficulty in understanding since he also was not very literate.  The letter stated that he would have to decide to opt in or out of the scheme before a certain date in 1985.  He was not able to decipher what the letter was about and when he died his widow was informed by the employer that since he had not replied he had opted out.  The result is that she has not got the pension she would be entitled to if the employer had decided that a lack of response meant consent.  That is what should have happened in that case.  I wonder how many other people have received letters of great significance which they could not understand.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that such things can happen in the operation of pension schemes.  There is a large number of people whose lack of literacy prevents them from gaining certain benefits to which they would normally be entitled. People who are delivering the service must be conscious of this.  In the case to <Col N="1047" /> which I am referring, I am surprised that somebody who was dealing with this individual in the course of his work did not understand that he would not be able to handle it and offer him some verbal advice and assistance.  It is an example of a tragedy to which there is no solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister is attempting to tidy up an area which has changed dramatically since the previous legislation was enacted.  Nowadays people move from one job to another and pension entitlements need to be clarified.  This problem is being addressed in the Bill.  I welcome the Minister's intentions and I hope that we will be able to examine the Bill in great detail and amend it where necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with delight that I am here today to welcome this Bill.  This legislation will go a long way towards providing necessary regulation in the very important area of occupational pensions schemes.  The Bill provides modern, complete pension legislation which ensures that those in employment can look forward to financially secure retirement.  It is essential that such security of pension rights be enshrined in legislation on the Statute Book.  The only law on our Statute Book at present dealing with trust schemes is the Trustees Act, 1893, which, understandably, contains no provision at all in relation to 20th century schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent company collapses, not uniquely confined to any one sector of Irish industry, showed how the pension schemes of redundant employees were either inadequately funded or the pension fund had been diverted and was not available to meet the pension rights of those employees.  The three major companies which collapsed in recent years were the H. Williams Group, the Castle brand group in Nenagh and Roscrea Meats.  Members of my family and some very close friends were affected by these collapses, in particular, by the collapse of the H. Williams Group.  I saw at first hand the effect the collapse of the H. Williams Group had on employees who worked for that company for many years. The employees who worked for such a <Col N="1048" /> group did so in good faith, paid into the pension scheme and carried out their duties in the best manner possible but due to the sudden collapse of the group they were left with nothing other than whatever State pensions they could claim.  I have seen the effect this type of collapse can have on families.  If someone in receipt of a pension of £100, £150 or £200 a week suddenly loses that money it can have a devastating effect on him. The quality and standard of life of that person may have been based on the pension he received from the company he had worked for over a number of years.</P>
    <P>It is our responsibility, as legislators, to ensure that the workforce are adequately protected by appropriate legislation.  The Bill before us is essential in this respect as it will establish standards for occupational pension schemes, provide the framework for the supervision of pension schemes and implement the principle of equal treatment for men and women, which will meet the requirements of EC Directive 86/378.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a number of sections of the Bill which I particularly welcome.  Sections 26 to 38 in Part III provide for the preservation of pension entitlements.  I know people who have paid into pension schemes for up to ten years but who, on leaving their employment, were not advised of what they should do with their pension.  Prior to becoming a Member of this House, I paid into a pension scheme run by my employer but I was never advised about what my contributions were realising, what the company's contributions were realising and what my pension was worth to me at any given time.  When I left that employment I received a cheque which I do not believe even met the payments I made into that scheme.  I was given no other option but to accept that cheque. This is one reason I particularly welcome the provisions in sections 26 to 38 in Part III.</P>
    <P>Sections 39 to 52 in Part IV provide for the introduction of minimum funding standards.  I welcome this provision, which is a must for any pensions Bill.  I also welcome the provisions in sections <Col N="1049" /> 53 to 57 in Part V which provide for the disclosure of information to scheme members.  I should like some type of leaflet to be issued to scheme members, for example, a P60-type annual information leaflet which would show employees the total contributions they have made, the number of weeks and such other necessary information employees would like to have about their particular pension schemes.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the clarification of the duties and responsibilities of scheme trustees.  Previous speakers expressed concern about the scheme trustees and in particular, member trustees.  I understand the Minister has already indicated that he will table amendments in this area on Committee Stage.  I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage when those amendments can be teased out fully.  The provision in relation to the establishment of the pension board, in sections 8 to 25, as a new statutory body is very necessary.</P>
    <P>The measures I have referred to must be welcomed by all Members of the House, especially because of the magnitude of pensions schemes.  Approximately £10,000 million is held in assets by investment companies for pension schemes and benefit payments are in excess of £250 million per annum, covering approximately 550,000 people.  Of course, thousands more people are members of mixed insurance schemes. I question why these people were not provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed from time to time by the employees of State and semi-State companies, the Port and Docks Board, etc., about superannuation pension payments and questions have been asked about the funds which are available to those employees from the schemes they have paid into. This is an area which could be easily cleared up and addressed and I wonder why it was not provided for in the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>When people reach retirement age and apply for an old age contributory pension they are told certain anomalies exist in <Col N="1050" /> regard to their employment for previous years and their social welfare contributions by way of PRSI stamps.  It is recognised &mdash; this has been thrashed out before in this House &mdash; that a number of anomalies exist in this area.  I believe most people are unaware of how their class of contribution to social welfare during their working life may affect their contributory old age pension in later life. Many people believe that when they reach 55 and 56 years they are entitled to claim an old age contributory pension and because they have worked all their lifes they will get it at a recognised level. It is only when they apply, which normally is too late in life, that they are told their social insurance class changed during a particular period of their working life and they have insufficient stamps.</P>
    <P>The other area is the anomaly that exists in relation to people who are caught in the 1953 situation in regard to stamps as well.  This is as an important an area as occupational pension schemes and should be looked at.  If it cannot be accommodated in the Bill that is before the House I would welcome regulations to deal with these anomalies.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt about the amount of painstaking work and effort put in by the Minister, by the various committees that reported to him, by the authorities, the professionals in the pension investment area and, of course, the officers of the Department of Social Welfare in regard to this legislation.  The result of all that work is this, the first Bill to regulate occupational pension schemes since the foundation of the State.  I would like to congratulate them on the work they have done to date in that area.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister, if at all possible, when this Bill is passed through the House, to consider issuing a fact sheet to the 550,000 employees covered by the occupational pensions schemes so that they will know exactly what legislation has been introduced in this House and are fully briefed as to the type of protection proposed in this legislation.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the reason I particularly welcome this legislation is that in future there will be proper legislation on this area on our Statute Books, legislation which will give the workforce the confidence of knowing that appropriate and adequate provisions is being made for their retirement.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start by noting the general welcome which this House has given to this important Bill.  I want, on behalf of the Minister, to thank Deputies for their very constructive approach to the debate.  It is clear that the spokesmen of all parties have carried out extensive research on the provisions of the Bill and this was reflected in the contributions made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, there has been a general welcome for the Bill.  There are differences of view on certain of the provisions and these can be further discussed in detail on Committee Stage.  It is clear, however, that all sides of the House are agreed that this legislation is of major importance.  The implementation of the provisions will bring about a major improvement in the protection of <Col N="1052" /> workers who are covered by occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The importance of the Bill has been underlined many times in the debate with reference, in particular, to the numbers covered by occupational pension schemes, some 550,000 workers, and the scale of the assets of pension funds which recent estimates put at £10 billion.  The important contribution made by the State to the development of occupational schemes has also been mentioned, both in relation to providing occupational pension cover to its own employees, as part of their terms of employment, and through the generous system of tax reliefs made available to such schemes in the private and commercial semi-State sectors.</P>
    <P>In view of this it is essential that a comprehensive and effective regulatory system is in place to ensure that the pension rights of so many workers which have been earned and paid for over a working lifetime are adequately safeguarded. The overall objective of this Bill is to put such a regulatory system in place.</P>
    <P>I am glad also that the general approach adopted in this Bill and its main provisions have been broadly welcomed by Deputies.  Inevitably, of course, the main focus has been on what has not been provided for in the Bill.  The three main issues identified in this regard were member trustees, equal treatment and the composition, operation and financing of the proposed new statutory board. Before going on to deal with these issues, I would like to refer briefly to the basis for occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that occupational schemes are voluntary and that employers in the private sector are not required by law to provide for such arrangements nor are workers required by law to be members of such schemes. There are no requirements either concerning the type of benefits to be provided or the level of benefits.  In practice, employers and employees come to an agreement that arrangements for pension cover will be provided as part of the employee's overall remuneration package. The tax reliefs available in this <Col N="1053" /> regard provide a major incentive to both employers and employees to make such arrangements.</P>
    <P>The main objective of this legislation is to safeguard the pension rights of the members of pension schemes.  However, the main danger that has to be avoided in this area is over regulation or endeavouring to regulate everything at once without allowing schemes to progressively adapt to the new requirements and, above all, meet the costs involved in a planned way.  Such over regulation could result in employers or workers deciding against setting up or having occupational pension arrangements or opting for arrangements that provide greatly reduced pension cover.  It is against that background that I will now deal with the three issues I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>I would like to begin with the issue of member trustees.  Reference has been made to the fact that a majority of the National Pensions Board were in favour of statutory requirements in this area.  In the last analysis, however, the groups whose views are paramount in this regard are the employers and the employees.  It is they who agree to the establishment of a pension scheme, who negotiate the terms of that scheme and who pay for the benefits to be provided.  It is essential, therefore, that in relation to such a crucial issue as member participation in the appointment of trustees a way of providing for this is found which will be broadly acceptable to both these groups.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into the details of the concerns of both trade unions and employers on the issue at this stage. However, I do believe that there is a need for a considerable amount of work still to be done in this area before a set of procedures can be devised to give members effective and meaningful participation in the administration of what, I must stress, in the last anaylsis are their schemes.  This complex issue was dealt with in the report of the National Pensions Board in less than two pages.  It was, however, recognised in the report that progress towards the fulfilment of <Col N="1054" /> the objective of member participation in the appointment of trustees should be gradual rather than immediate.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach is to work for a consensus on this issue over the next three years, the period referred to in the report.  He will be asking the new statutory pensions board to encourage employers on a voluntary basis to provide for member participation in the appointment of trustees, through negotiations with their employees.  The Minister has also, however, already indicated his intention to bring forward an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage to provide a statutory basis for member participation in the appointment of member trustees.  This will be done by giving power to the Minister for Social Welfare at a future date to prescribe in regulations the arrangements under which this would be achieved.</P>
    <P>In relation to equal treatment the Bill provides for full compliance with the terms of the EC Directive on this issue. The directive permits member states to defer compulsory application of the principle of equal treatment in relation to retirement ages and survivor's benefit at the latest until a further directive requires equality of treatment in this area.  Proposals for such directive are under consideration by the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at length in his opening speech with the issue of retirement ages.  He stated in this context that he was studying the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the Barber case which, <i>prima facie</i>, appears to require equality in this area with effect from 17 May, the date of the judgment. In the light of his consideraton of this judgment the Minister will introduce an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage to reflect this new reality.</P>
    <P>Equal tratment in relation to survivors' pensions creates problems for a number of reasons.  The purpose of such benefits is to provide for survivors who had been dependent on the earnings of the insured person before his or her death.  Traditionally, husbands have been the main breadwinners for the family, with the wife caring for the house and children. <Col N="1055" /> Survivors' benefits reflected this social reality and, accordingly, cover was provided for the survivors of males only.  In applying the principle of equal treatment in this area it is important that we do not disimprove the provisions which are already in existence.  Equal treatment, as pointed out, in particular by Deputy Ferris, can result in benefits being equalised downwards as well as upwards.  As occupational pension schemes are voluntary it is not possible to require them to equalise upwards.  The compulsory application of the principle of equal treatment could, therefore, result in existing cover for survivor's pension being reduced significantly if it had to be extended to both male and female employees.</P>
    <P>The board pointed out in the fourth report that the cost of providing widowers' pensions relative to the cost of providing widows' pensions is not particularly significant because the mortality rate of women at all ages is lower than that of men and this effect is compounded by the fact that wives tend on average to be younger than their husbands.  That would be the case in most schemes where the majority of employees are male and the female employees are in the younger age groups.  However, there are 25,000 schemes here and in a proportion of those the situation may be very different with the majority of members being female and a high proportion in the older age groups.  The board estimated that in such schemes the provision of widowers' pensions could give rise to a significant increase in overall costs.  In such schemes compulsory application of equal treatment could lead to a reduction of overall pension cover on grounds of cost which would adversely affect the male breadwinners and their spouses.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not propose to give legislative effect to equal treatment in this area for the present for the following reasons.  First, as mentioned in his opening speech, it is difficult to justify imposing extra costs on schemes, which are not required by an EC directive, at the same time as they have to meet the additional start-up costs of complying <Col N="1056" /> with the other requirements in the Bill. Secondly, the Minister wishes to await the adoption of the next EC directive in this matter to ensure that the provisions in Irish legislation are fully in line with whatever terms are included in the directive. Making provision in national legislation to deal with this matter at a time when proposals for an EC directive dealing with the same matter have been submitted to the EC Council of Ministers would lead to greater uncertainty for schemes, as there would be no guarantee that the provisions in Irish legislation would ultimately be in line with those of the directive.  If within two years there is no immediate prospect of the EC directive dealing with this matter being adopted, the Minister is committed to introducing appropriate measures requiring equal treatment in relation to survivors' pensions.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the third main issue raised, which concerns the operation, composition and financing of the pensions board.  The National Pensions Board did propose that certain functions should be reserved in legislation to the chief executive officer.  The main objective would be to allow effective action to be taken as soon as possible in relation to problem schemes.  This, however, would require that provision be made for the chief executive officer to be directly responsible to the Minister for Social Welfare in respect of these functions while at the same time being responsible to the pensions board in respect of other matters concerned with the implementation of the Pensions Act and having to report generally to the board on the implementation of the Act.  Such a procedure could give rise to difficulties and possible duplication between the Department of Social Welfare and the pensions board and result in the chief executive officer having to report on a regular basis to two authorities.</P>
    <P>To avoid the board having to get involved in detailed administration it will be possible for the board to delegate day-to-day administration to the chief executive officer subject to the board's overall control in this regard.  This is allowed for <Col N="1057" /> under paragraph 245 of the First Schedule. Given the enhanced role of the board in this regard it is also essential to avoid membership of the board being too high as this could lead to delays in decision-making and in the general effectiveness of the board.  For that reason the Minister opted for a board in which each of the interests involved in pensions would be represented and the total membership would be a chairman plus eight members. In the light of the views expressed in this debate, and representations made since the publication of the Bill, the Minister is reviewing the membership of the board with a view to a small increase in membership.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty also referred to exemptions provided under the Bill for certain schemes.  Some of these were outlined in the Minister's speech.  Section 36 (1) enables the Minister for Social Welfare, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to exclude schemes by regulation from the requirements in Part III if he considers that the benefits of those schemes are, in overall terms, no less favourable than those provided under that Part.  The intention is to use this enabling provision to exclude those public sector schemes which (a) provide preserved pension benefits on standard public sector lines, and, (b) are members of the public sector transfer network.</P>
    <P>The standard public sector arrangements for preservation of benefits provide that: a member with at least five years pensionable service is entitled to preserved pension of 1/80th of pensionable remuneration per year of service subject to a maximum of 40/80ths, or one half of such remuneration.  He or she is also entitled to a preserved lump sum of 3/80ths of pensionable remuneration per year of service subject to a maximum of one and a half times pensionable remuneration.  A preserved death gratuity equal to the lump sum payment is provided in the event of his or her death in addition to a preserved spouse's pension of one-half his preserved pension <Col N="1058" /> entitlement which could have been provided in the event of ill-health or retirement. The pensionable remuneration for this purpose is the actual remuneration of the member at the date of leaving service up-rated in line with all salary increases awarded to the grade from which he or she retired.</P>
    <P>There is also in existence a comprehensive transfer network under which service is fully transferable for pension purposes within participating organisations. Almost all schemes in the public sector operate preservation rules on these lines.  In most cases a knock-for-knock arrangement exists whereby full credit for previous service is granted but no money changes hands.  When these arrangements are compared with the minimum requirements under the Bill one will find that, overall, they are more favourable.  The qualifying service requirements are of the same length, five years.  The method of revaluation under the public sector arrangements is linked to salary increases which is a reasonable method of ensuring that early leavers are treated fairly in comparison to members who stay in the scheme until retirement age.  The adequacy of these arrangements was fully recognised by the National Pensions Board in formulating their proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Bill, revaluation of preserved benefits is only required for defined benefit schemes up to a maximum of 4 per cent per annum. The public service arrangements are linked to salary increases.  In this context it should be noted that very few schemes in the private sector revalue preserved benefit entitlements of members.  Admittedly transferability of service is confined to schemes operating within the public sector area but full credit is granted for previous service.  Under the Bill a member of a funded scheme is entitled to have his preserved benefit entitlement transferred to a new scheme of a new employer or to an annuity bond.  Such transfer values need only reflect the actual equivalent of the member's preserved benefit revalued only up to 4 per cent maximum.  All in all, it is considered <Col N="1059" /> the public sector arrangements whereby preserved benefits of early leavers are fully indexed in line with salary increases and full transfer of service available within the public sector, are overall more favourable than the minimum requirements laid down in the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new minimum funding requirements, section 51 enables the Minister for Social Welfare, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, to exclude by regulation certain schemes or categories of schemes from the funding requirements of Part IV.  The grounds on which such exclusions may be made are stated in the section as being schemes, essentially, whose benefits are, or may be, paid from the Exchequer.  This section will provide the enabling basis for excluding unfunded public sector schemes and certain funded schemes principally in non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>With regard to unfunded schemes generally the National Pensions Board stated that it would be illogical, following the introduction of a minimum funding standard, to allow unfunded schemes to continue in their present form and that they should, therefore, be required to fund at the minimum level for future service. However, it recommended that an exception of this rule should be made for public sector unfunded arrangements whose financing is based on the State's permanent and continuing ability to discharge its obligations as they arise. Having examined these proposals it has been brought to the Minister's attention that certain funded schemes of non-commercial bodies were in a similar position.  Although the pension schemes had funds, the security of the pension benefits is ultimately dependent on the Exchequer.  For similar reasons therefore, these schemes are also being excluded.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed disclosure requirements, the Minister already outlined in detail the exemptions recommended by the National Pensions Board. For example, it is not appropriate to obtain an actuarial valuation for a defined contribution scheme under which the <Col N="1060" /> member's ultimate benefits are determined by reference to the amount of defined contributions and the investment return earned on them.  Death benefits in respect of members are normally insured on a year by year basis.  It would be inappropriate to have annual reports and audited accounts in respect of such schemes.  Members will have the right to an individual statement of the amount of any such benefits payable in the event of death.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty also referred to the proposed levy on pension schemes provided for in section 25.  The sole purpose of the proposal fee as stated by the Minister, is to meet the administrative costs of the new board.  The scale of fees and the basis for their determination will be set down in regulations made under this section.  These matters will be decided in consultation with the new board.  As the Minister pointed out in his speech it is his intention that the full cost of the board will be met by the proposed levy on schemes themselves.  This is what was recommended by the National Pensions Board.  I do not envisage asking the general taxpayer to fund this new regulatory regime.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the new board would be a relatively small organisation. Their main function will be to deal with problem cases which do not comply with the new standards.  These would represent only a minority of the 25,000 or so scheme members themselves and their representatives to ensure that their schemes complied with the legislation. The costs of running such a board, therefore, should not be significant.  I certainly do not believe it will represent an undue burden on pension schemes whose annual income is now put at over £1 billion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne inquired how the new board would operate.  As I already mentioned, it would deal with problem cases. It is envisaged that a member's remedy for non-compliance with the new requirements would initially take the form of an approach to the trustees either directly or through his trade union or staff representative.  If this approach or informal contact does not produce the desired <Col N="1061" /> result the member, or his-her trade union, could make a complaint to the board which would then investigate the allegation on the member's behalf.  It is hoped that the involvement of the pensions board would normally be sufficient to achieve the required action.  If this course of action fails to provide satisfaction, the board would then use their power to take legal proceedings on behalf of the member against the defaulting trustees or any other culpable person.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will override anything contrary contained in the scheme's own rules.  If a dispute arises concerning the application of a specific provision a person may apply to the new board for a ruling on the matter whose decision shall be final and may only be appealed to the courts as a point of law.</P>
    <P>With regard to qualifying service conditions for preservation of benefits, section 27 provides that a member who has five years qualifying service of which at least two such years occur after the commencement date shall qualify for preserved benefit.  The pensions board recommended an age related formula, five years for those under 25 years reducing by one year for each year in excess of that age, subject to a minimum of two years for those aged 28 or over.  The current practice in both public and private sector schemes is for the vesting of rights to preserved benefit after a period of five years.  The Minister considered that on grounds of simplicity a non-age related formula would be more administratively convenient for schemes.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill will allow existing members with three years service to qualify after 1 January 1993 for preserved benefit irrespective of their age. Under the board's recommendation members aged 27 on that date would have to wait longer to build up such an entitlement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne also referred to section 34 which enables the trustees in certain circumstances to be prescribed to effect a transfer payment without the consent of the member.  This provision is designed to reduce the administrative workload of <Col N="1062" /> schemes administering an ever increasing number of small preserved benefit entitlements.  Otherwise, unless those leaving requested a transfer payment, records would have to be kept in respect of all leavers.  In employments with high turnover of staff a situation could arise where records in respect of leavers could exceed those in respect of persons who stay in the job.  It is proposed that, in the case of small preserved benefit entitlements, that is those in respect of short periods of service, say, four or five years, the trustees of the scheme should have the power to transfer their liability to an approved annuity bond.  This would in no way cause any diminution in the member's preserved benefit entitlement.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues were raised by Deputies during the course of the debate which will be fully considered by the Minister before Committee Stage. On Committee Stage there will be an opportunity to examine the provisions in detail and to consider any amendments to improve the Bill.  The Minister has already indicated his intention to bring forward a number of amendments in response to representations made to him in the House and from other sources.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank all the Members who contributed so constructively to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for the dissolution of <Col N="1063" /> Fóir Teoranta, the repeal of existing Fóir Teoranta legislation, the transfer of its assets and liabilities to the Industrial Credit Corporation plc and related matters. It gives effect to the Government's decision, announced in February 1989, to wind-up the activities of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta were established in March 1972 under the Companies Act, 1963, as provided for in section 2 of the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972.  They were designed to fill a gap which was perceived in the range of State services available to manufacturing industry at the time.  Their purpose was to provide an orderly procedure for restructuring ailing, but potentially viable, industrial concerns which encountered financial difficulties and which were unable to obtain their financial requirements from commercial sources.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta were established in a period of structural change in Irish industry prior to EC membership in 1973, and the removal of many trade barriers.  The progression to the open economy which we now have was taking place rapidly. The Government at the time took the view that transitional measures aimed at helping Irish industry to adapt to the new more competitive conditions would be reasonable.  Fóir Teoranta's busiest period of activity was during the recessionary period of the early eighties, when they provided very substantial assistance to Irish industry, mainly in the traditional sectors such as textiles and clothing, footwear and leather, furniture, etc.  Unfortunately, despite Fóir Teoranta's efforts, many of their client firms in these sectors did not survive.  It would be difficult to assert that Fóir Teoranta had anything but a marginal effect on the overall performance of these sectors one way or the other over the period since its establishment.  On the positive side it must be said that some firms, in various sectors, which were assisted by Fóir Teoranta prospered and are trading successfully today.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined the European Community in 1973, shortly after Fóir Teoranta were established.  Since then, there have been wide fluctuations in the <Col N="1064" /> performance of the economy.  In part, fast growth periods were stimulated by increased Government expenditure and borrowing.  These borrowings eventually became unsustainable.  The previous Government embarked upon the implementation of a <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which had as one of its central aims the improvement of the environment for industry so that industry would be in a position to stand on its own feet and compete in the world marketplace. The aim was to reduce excessive Government expenditure, thereby reducing Government borrowing and lessening the upward pressures on interest rates and inflation.  As Deputies know, very considerable progress has been achieved in the past three years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of activity in Fóir Teoranta had tapered off considerably in recent years, reflecting the improved outlook for industry, from a peak of about £23 million in disbursements in 1983 to about £7 million in 1988.  The number of applications received, cases approved and the average size of cases approved has also substantially reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the fall off in demand for their services and the virtual disappearance of large cases, together with buoyant own resources, Fóir Teoranta's requirement for Exchequer funding also declined in recent years.  The last occasion on which the company needed to call on the Exchequer was in 1987. Since then, they have financed their operations from on-going income from their investments by way of interest and capital repayments including a considerable element of pre-payments, and share realisations.  In fact, during the winding down phase, Fóir Teoranta have repaid a total of £8.2 million of Exchequer advances &mdash; £4 million in 1989 and £4.2 million so far this year.  The company <Col N="1065" /> have been closed for new business since 23 February 1989.</P>
    <P>Since Fóir Teoranta were a lender of last resort, it is not all that surprising that a high degree of failure took place among their client firms.  However, the failure rate experienced by Fóir Teoranta involved very considerable cost to the Exchequer.  The failure rate may be measured by the fact that some £75 million of the Exchequer advances of £87.5 million currently outstanding, in effect, has already been written-off by the company as irrecoverable.</P>
    <P>The level of write-off in Fóir Teoranta reflects the fact that many firms assisted failed, despite the assistance given by Fóir Teoranta.  Many of those firms left it far too late to go to Fóir Teoranta for assistance in the first instance.  Nevertheless, where assistance was given in such cases, the damage had already been done and the firms eventually went to the wall anyway.  While there may be economic benefit in keeping jobs in existence longer rather than being lost at the outset, the prospect for long-term sustainable employment may be better if firms are transferred to new owners quickly in the receivership/liquidation process than if they are kept in existence, with Fóir Teoranta assistance, but with existing high levels of indebtedness and generally poor management, as well as other weaknesses.</P>
    <P>The recent takeover of the Irish companies in the Sunbeam group is an example of the fact that companies can survive and jobs can be saved, without the need for a State rescue agency such as Fóir Teoranta.  I would like to pay tribute to the role played by the industrial development agencies &mdash; the IDA and SFADCo &mdash; in bringing this takeover about.  I also look to the examiner provisions of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 to play a very important and positive role in the area of company reconstructions in the future.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which the Government considered the future of Fóir Teoranta.  Their decision that Fóir <Col N="1066" /> Teoranta should be wound up, as indicated in the announcement I made on 22 February 1989, was based on the following: the low level of demand for Fóir Teoranta's services over the recent past; the very much changed industrial environment, as a result of the firm action taken by this Government and the previous one, as compared with when Fóir Teoranta were established; the provision in the current Companies Bill allowing for the appointment by the Courts of an Examiner in order to prevent a potentially viable company from going into immediate liquidation and the need to prepare Irish industry to be ready to meet the challenges of the more competitive regime which will apply when the Internal Market is in place after 1992.</P>
    <P>The decline in demand for Fóir Teoranta's services was due to a number of factors &mdash; the new climate of confidence in the economy and the favourable environment for industry were obviously major influencing factors.  Another important consideration was the fact that finance for industry is now available on a much wider scale than ever before from private sector individual and institutional sources.  Individual investors have the powerful advantage of State-backed tax schemes such as the business expansion scheme.  The BES now has funds of over £100 million invested.  Clearly it has been a substantial source of equity funding for Irish business which in the past has been too heavily dependent on debt finance.</P>
    <P>Venture capital funds also exist on a significant scale, with an important role in this regard being played by public sector agencies such as NADCorp and the investment arm of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  Given these developments, it was inevitable that &mdash; leaving aside the improvements in the economy generally &mdash; demand for Fóir Teoranta services would be considerably lessened and the need for such an organisation diminished.</P>
    <P>The provision in the current Companies Bill allowing for the appointment by the courts of an examiner to companies in financial difficulty is modelled on the similar Chapter II process in the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> United States.  The aim is to prevent a potentially viable company from going into immediate liquidation.  This approach is one which was advocated by Fóir Teoranta for some time.  It allows for a stay on the rights of creditors while the examiner attempts a reconstruction of the company's finances.</P>
    <P>One of my objectives in preparing the Bill was to provide a new procedure which would help to obviate the need for a separate State company to deal with industrial rescue.  There will be ample scope under the new procedures for genuinely viable firms to stave off closure if they are threatened by merely short term financial difficulties.  The Bill is at present before a Special Committee of the House and, while progress in its enactment has been slow due to its complexity and importance, I would hope that it will be enacted before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The industrial environment now is very much changed from that which existed when Fóir Teoranta were established 18 years ago and during their main periods of business.  Business confidence has never been greater.  I believe that State intervention such as that provided by Fóir Teoranta has no place in this environment. Despite recent increases, interest rates and inflation are at lower rates than those that exist in many of our competitor economies.  The Confederation of Irish Industry is on record as stating that industry in Ireland would &ldquo;prefer to have a competitive cost environment than seek to compensate for deficiencies in the environment through cash grants&rdquo; etc., from the State.  Clearly, we are living in an environment much more conducive to getting industry back on its feet and achieving increased long-term industrial employment.  The best action which the Government can take in relation to the survival of firms is to contribute as much as possible to lowering the input costs of industry, rather than giving them hand outs when it is probably too late anyway to save them.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Government took their decision in relation to Fóir Teoranta in the light of prevailing circumstances.  The Government's view is that with the other <Col N="1068" /> sources of finance available for investment in industry and with the economy in good condition, there should be little if any adverse impact on employment as a result of the closure of Fóir Teoranta. As regards the view that a need may arise in the future for the State to be actively involved in industrial rescue should economic conditions deteriorate, it has to be made clear that the days of feather-bedding Irish industry are over.  Irish industry must be able to compete in the marketplace and, in an intensive effort to ensure that this will be the case in the post-1992 situation, the Government are already devoting greater resources to industry in the context of the EC Structural Funds over the next few years. Expenditure supported by the Structural Funds will be over £1 billion over the five-year period to 1993.  There is, therefore, no lessening in the level of resources being devoted to industry.  It is the purpose for which those resources are used which is important and we will be ensuring that the funds involved are put to best effect in order to secure good solid progress in attaining the employment targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>There will be an orderly winding down over time of Fóir Teoranta's portfolio of loans and investments which, under the terms of the legislation now before the House, will be assigned to the Industrial Credit Corporation to administer.  The Exchequer's investment in the client firms concerned will be looked after by the ICC in accordance with the contractual arrangements entered into by those firms with Fóir Teoranta.  It is not possible to say how long the winding down process will take.  However, I would expect it will probably take of the order of five to seven years, but it could be longer in particular instances.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ICC, my recent public statement that I am proposing to employ consultants to advise me on the options available in relation to the future development and capital requirements of the company has no direct effect on the arrangements being established under this Bill.  Whatever the outcome of the <Col N="1069" /> consultants' report in due course, and the Government's decisions in relation to it, I envisage that the ICC will continue to administer the Fóir Teoranta portfolio on the basis now being established.  Deputies will be aware that a Bill has been circulated to allow an increase in the State guaranteed borrowing limit of the ICC. That Bill is a normal ongoing adjustment in its borrowing limit and has nothing to do with this Bill.  The increased borrowing limit is necessary to enable the ICC's on-going activities to proceed without interruption.</P>
    <P>As regards the staff of Fóir Teoranta, I am pleased to report that most of the staff have now either been redeployed to other parts of the public service, or have taken early retirement on terms similar to those available under the general public service early retirement scheme.  Efforts are continuing to redeploy the small number of staff who are left who have opted for redeployment.  Some temporary staff have been taken on so as to ensure that the winding down process proceeds smoothly and the the Exchequer investment is protected.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the specific provisions of the Bill, I would like once again to express publicly my appreciation &mdash; and that of the Government &mdash; of the work done by Fóir Teoranta since their establishment.  I wish to pay tribute to the hard work, commitment and dedication of the staff, management and directors of the company over the years.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the individual sections of the Bill.  First of all, I should point out that the provisions of the Bill will come into effect on a day to be appointed by ministerial order.  Section 1 is a definitional section.  Section 2 dissolves Fóir Teoranta.  Section 3 transfers all of the assets and liabilities of Fóir Teoranta to the Industrial Credit Corporation save for a sum of £75 million of Exchequer advances which is being written off.  This amount has already been written off in the books of Fóir Teoranta as being irrecoverable.  It is important to emphasise that, apart from about £10 <Col N="1070" /> million written off in 1983, this £75 million represents losses incurred by Fóir Teoranta over the full 18 years of their existence.  The balance of the outstanding Exchequer advances, which is about £12.5 million, will be transferred to the ICC.</P>
    <P>Money received by the ICC in respect of the assets of Fóir Teoranta, mainly their portfolio of loans and equity investments will, under subsection (4) of this section, be paid to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) allows the Minister to pay to the ICC a fee in respect of their management of the assets and liabilities transferred to them.  Section 4 provides for the preservation of existing contracts of Fóir Teoranta and their transfer to the ICC.  Section 5 provides that the ICC will be substituted for Fóir Teoranta where the latter are a party to legal proceedings immediately before the commencement of the Act.  Section 6 exempts the transfers involved under these provisions from the imposition of stamp duty.  Section 7 deals with the final accounts of Fóir Teoranta which will be prepared by the ICC and submitted to the Minister who will present them to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The section also requires the corporation to keep all proper and usual accounts in relation to the assets and liabilities transferred to them and to present them to the Minister who will submit them to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 8 provides that the ICC shall present a report of their activities in relation to the assets and liabilities transferred to them to the Minister who will present it to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 9, subsection (1) provides that the Minister may make advances not exceeding £2 million to the corporation in respect of liabilities of Fóir Teoranta, arising from the exercise of their statutory functions, which had not been discharged by Fóir Teoranta on the transfer date.  These liabilities arise from some outstanding commitments to client firms and to receivers of client firms where in certain circumstances moneys paid to Fóir Teoranta by receivers may have to be returned to the receivers <Col N="1071" /> together with interest thereon.  The remaining subsections contain standard provisions in relation to Exchequer advances.  Section 10 provides for the repeal of existing Fóir Teoranta legislation. Section 11 provides that the expenses incurred in the administration of the Act be paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 12 deals with the short title and the commencement. date.  As I mentioned already, the Act will come into operation on such day as the Minister may appoint by order.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On 25 April 1989 the Minister for Finance made a statement in the Dáil which stated that the Government considered that Fóir Teoranta were no longer necessary and that he would introduce legislation to abolish them.  This legislation arises from that commitment.  In the course of his statement, the Minister gave reasons why, in his opinion, a State rescue bank for Irish industry was no longer necessary; first, interest rates were at their lowest level for over a decade; second, inflation was at its lowest since the sixties; third, large amounts of money were available to industry through the BES scheme; fourth, the Companies Bill had a provision modelled on the Chapter 11 process in the United States which would prevent a potentially viable company from going into immediate liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to examine these reasons for Fóir Teoranta's abolition one year later.  Interest rates have risen four times, and by over 4 per cent since the Minister made his statement.  Consequently, the low interest rate argument is clearly no longer valid.  The claim arising from low inflation is also suspect because the inflation rate has doubled since the Minister made his statement in April of last year.  Inflation is rising in the United Kingdom and there is a deep fear of German-led inflation in the EC.  The 1990 budget has made some reductions in VAT and excise duties which have enabled the Minister to predict quite low inflation rates for 1990.  However, only a portion of inflation is generated domestically and <Col N="1072" /> the biggest input to domestically generated inflation will be the level of the pay increases in the next pay agreement. It is clear that the Minister's claim that Fóir Teoranta are redundant because of low inflation, which will continue into the mid-term, is no longer valid either.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed there were significant amounts of money available through the BES schemes for industry. The Minister himself, however, put paid to this.  The typical BES investor wants to avail of the tax break provided and at the same time be guaranteed the repayment of as much of his original investment as possible at the end of five years. The 1989 Finance Bill made an attempt to remove guarantees of repayment from business expansion schemes.  The Government decided also to extend the BES scheme to the tourism industry.  It is quite clear that asset-backed BES schemes, such as investments in new hotels or hotel extensions, is a much lower risk for an investor, than providing investment capital for manufacturing industry.  In fact, BES funds for the manufacturing industry have dried up and consequently the third argument advanced by the Minister for the abolition of Fóir Teoranta, when he first announced it in April 1989, is no longer valid.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised in April 1989 that procedures along the lines of Chapter 11, which applies in the United States of America, which would prevent viable companies from going into liquidation, would be introduced in the Companies Bill.  Such provisions have been included, but the advice of our representatives on the select committee is that the provisions are so complex, so court-oriented and so removed from business experience they are impracticable and unworkable.</P>
    <P>We requested, through our Whip, that this Bill to abolish Fóir Teoranta would not be taken until the Companies Bill had passed all Stages.  We fear that the claim that the role of Fóir Teoranta will be adequately replaced by the Chapter 11 type provisions in the Companies Bill is doubtful in the extreme.  All the arguments made by the Minister when he <Col N="1073" /> promised legislation in this House no longer apply.  Consequently he should now withdraw the Bill because it is ill-conceived and untimely.</P>
    <P>I would like to look at the terms of reference under which Fóir Teoranta conduct their business and at their record over the last decade.  Fóir Teoranta are a lender of last resort, mandated to help good companies in bad times and in good. They have always acted prudently and have been instrumental in saving 40,000 jobs or more in manufacturing industry in the last eight years or so.  During my period as Minister for Industry and Commerce it was quite clear to me that Fóir Teoranta were anything but a soft touch and that their board and employees performed their duties with diligence and competence under their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>When Deputy John Bruton spoke in this House on the subject of Fóir Teoranta on 25 April 1989 he put the terms of reference and the procedures of Fóir Teoranta on the record.  He stated:</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are not, and never were, an easy touch for a loan.  Under their terms of reference, established by the late Deputy George Colley when he introduced the necessary legislation, in order to qualify for aid from Fóir Teoranta a company must: (1) be engaged in industrial activity; (2) have significant employment involved which is either nationally or locally significant; (3) there must be a sufficient contribution of money from the owner of the company going in at the time of the rescue; (4) there must be reasonable prospects of profitability on a permanent basis; (5) its continuance is in doubt because of inability to obtain its financial requirements from commercial sources and, finally, failure to receive assistance would have serious repercussions either nationally or locally.</P>
    <P>All of those criteria must be complied with if a company is to get aid from Fóir Teoranta.  There is no question of Fóir Teoranta ever being used <Col N="1074" /> simply to bale out the banks because, under the law, if a company can get assistance from the banks, they cannot get it from Fóir Teoranta.  It is only companies that cannot get assistance from the banks that are qualified to receive assistance from Fóir Teoranta. </P>
    <P>I believe Fóir Teoranta, under the guidance of their chairman and board, carried out their mandate effectively and I am not at all convinced that their services are no longer needed.  In fact, all the evidence points in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>There are three categories of companies which require Fóir Teoranta assistance.  Firstly, there are young companies with new products, especially in the high-tech sector.  The primary asset of these companies is the brain power of the founding partners.  These companies frequently get into difficulties in their early years and the attitude of the Minister that perhaps allowing them to go under and be taken over is the best way to save the companies is not valid.  The viability of these companies depends on the intellectual skills of a small group, usually the founding partners.  Neither liquidation nor Chapter 11 type procedures will rescue the company or save jobs and yet many such companies prove viable when assisted by Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from the report of the Chairman, Owen Kealy, in 1987:</P>
    <P>While in the past our activity has been concentrated on the traditional sectors of the economy, there are signs of an increased level of applications for assistance for &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; firms, especially in the electronics and software sectors.  This indicates the growth of an indigenous &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; sector is not without its problems, particularly for firms trying to move beyond the initial development stage.  Fóir Teoranta has a role to play in helping such firms overcome barriers to growth which threatens their survival at critical stages in their development.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the financial problems of firms which we are called upon to help resolve are often the results of management weaknesses or <Col N="1075" /> difficulties.  Accordingly we continue to make increasing use of our management services division which provides a pool of experienced personnel who can be used to supplement the management resources of the client firms.  We are also prepared to assist companies in locating new management and can, in certain circumstances, contribute to the cost involved. </P>
    <P>I think the points made by the chairman regarding the activity in new high-tech firms are still valid today.  The need he identified is well established.</P>
    <P>The second category of company which require the services of Fóir Teoranta are the large indigenous companies which need time to adjust to changing market circumstances and fluctuating competitive forces.  Many companies such as these have been helped and thousands of jobs have been saved.  The overall figures are interesting.  The number of companies assisted over the years is as follows: in 1982, 84 companies; 1983, 94 companies; 1984, 93 companies; 1985, 86 companies; 1986, 58 companies; 1987, 51 companies and 1988, 46 companies.  Well over £100 million has been provided in funds from 1982 to 1988 and 40,000 jobs have been saved.  This is a significant contribution to industrial employment, and probably represents more net jobs in manufacturing industry than will be created in the lifetime of this Government, even if they last for the full four-years term.</P>
    <P>Companies such as Irish Country Bacon, Manford Clothing and C &amp; D Pet Foods have all been helped by Fóir Teoranta and jobs have been saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Companies have been helped other than the categories mentioned above.  In bad times when interest rates and inflation are high and when competitive factors are adverse, the whole industrial base can come under threat and certain companies <Col N="1076" /> need a safety net to bring them through. Certainly there have been improvements in the economy.  However, high interest rates together with reduced demand on the home market and a recession in the United Kingdom could put many firms in difficulty.  It is most imprudent of the Minister for Finance to be implementing a hasty, ill-conceived decision in circumstances which are very different from those that prevailed when he made his statement in the House over 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister should withdraw the Bill. If he has sufficient confidence in the economy he could suspend the activities of Fóir Teoranta until adverse economic circumstances require their reactivation.  I believe, however, he should leave things as they are.  If his colleague in the Department of Industry and Commerce agrees to radically amend the Chapter 11 type provision in the Companies Bill.  Fóir Teoranta may not have to intervene as frequently as in the past.  At present I believe Fóir Teoranta are required and therefore Fine Gael will oppose this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty in responding to this Bill.  On the one hand, I acknowledge that there will continue to be a role for some type of emergency rescue agency for industry in trouble but on the other hand I have fairly serious criticism of the role Fóir Teoranta have played and the manner in which they have operated.  It is rather unusual that we are contending with a Bill introduced to abolish a State agency which, in effect, have already ceased operating.  It is a bit late to be coming back after Fóir Teoranta have been already scattered to the four winds and asking this House in retrospect to approve this dissolution. That is no way to handle Government business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, there is likely to be a continuing demand for some type of rescue agency for potentially viable enterprises &mdash; I emphasise potentially viable enterprises.  Some of the choices made in the past amounted to no more than throwing good money after bad.  The reference made by Deputy Noonan to <Col N="1077" /> the comments from the chairman in 1987 concerning management weaknesses and other reasons which caused Fóir Teoranta to intervene are very true.  In some of those cases it was throwing good money after bad but for potentially viable companies and enterprises that are acknowledged to have short-term difficulties, we run some risk in abolishing this facility in its entirety.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan drew attention to the Minister's statement of April 1989 when he listed the reasons he felt it necessary to take this step.  Deputy Noonan took us through those four reasons one by one. It is striking that in such a short time none of the four reasons is valid any longer.</P>
    <P>A particular claim was made at that time concerning low interest rates in the economy, the position regarding low inflation and the position regarding the money that was available through the Business Expansion Scheme.  All these circumstances have changed drastically in the interim.  Interest rates have changed dramatically since 1989.  Since the present Coalition Government came to office, there have been four increases in interest rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have placed copies of the detailed terms of reference for Phase I of the Dublin Transportation Study in the Oireachtas Library.  Broadly Phase I will examine and report on the existing transportation situation in Dublin taking account of developments since the 1971 Dublin Transportation Study, evaluate the recommendations of previous studies and assess the extent to which they have been implemented, assess the travel forecasting processes used in the previous transportation studies, and identify any new travel data required to complete the study.  As part of Phase I of the study, a separate sub-group will also carry out an evaluation and assessment of the feasibility of rail and busway options for public passenger transport in relation to the former Harcourt Street railway line and the Tallaght area.</P>
      <P>Phase II of the study will develop a detailed strategy to meet the existing and future transportation requirements of the greater Dublin area.  Part of the mandate of Phase I of the study will be to recommend detailed terms of reference for the second phase.</P>
      <P>In my statement announcing the study, I said that I was most anxious that the study would be conducted in such a way as to gain a wide measure of acceptance from the various agencies involved in developing transport services and facilities and from the general public as transport users.  While the detailed arrangements for public consultation have not yet been decided, I can confirm that submissions will be invited from interested statutory and voluntary organisations and from the general public.</P>
      <P>I envisage that a report will be published when the study has been completed.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister now acknowledge that his abolition of the <Col N="1079" /> Dublin Transport Authority was a fundamental mistake and that if he had not done so the work that is now being undertaken could have been undertaken over three years ago?  Can the Minister explain to the House why this work was not undertaken and completed prior to the submission to Brussels of the application for Structural Funds for the Dublin region as the work now apparently being undertaken would and should have had a direct impact on applications for funding for roads, rail and all transport facilities and systems within Dublin?</P>

Of course, the Deputy will also be aware that the Minister for Tourism and Transport announced earlier that he has a special working group looking at rail and busway options for passenger transport in relation to the former Harcourt Street railway line and the Tallaght area.  That review will be incorporated into Phase One of the study.  I am pleased <Col N="1080" /> that the Deputy sees the usefulness of this study at this time.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a recent report (details supplied) of the excessive use of section 4 type planning decisions in Dublin County Council; if he is concerned about the possible conflicts of interest in the making of these decisions; if he will introduce legislation to eliminate the perceived abuses of section 4 planning decisions; if, having regard to the need for orderly and balanced development in the Dublin area, he intends to meet the city and county manager and county councillors to discuss these matters; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to a recent article in a Sunday newspaper, which is the report referred to by the Deputy.  In so far as the question of new legislation is concerned, Deputies will be aware that the Government propose to bring forward proposals for the reorganisation and reform of local government and the matter is currently under active consideration.  One of the matters which is being considered in this regard is the operation of aspects of the Planning Acts, including &ldquo;section 4&rdquo;.  The question of any legislative changes found necessary will be addressed in the context of the general reform of local government law which arises as part of the general reform of our local representative bodies.</P>
      <P>In so far as conflict of interest occurs, Deputies will know that the planning code already requires the registration of interests by members of a planning authority, the failure of which is a punishable offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development plan is the planning authority's policy document which guides planning decisions.  I regret that the completion of the review of Dublin County Council's current plan is already two years overdue.  My Department, by letter <Col N="1081" /> of 1 May 1990, conveyed my concern to the county council at the slow pace of the review.  I am, however, confident that it will be completed within the permitted extended period up to 31 March 1991. While I have no proposals to meet the council, I will be monitoring the position and if considered necessary I will arrange a meeting with the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is now grave public disquiet to the effect that many people suspect that some Fianna Fáil councillors are being corruptly interfered with in the manner in which they are pushing forward section 4 type resolutions and that one particular councillor &mdash; Councillor Pat Dunne &mdash; has admitted that one beneficiary, the largest single beneficiary of such companies &mdash; Bovale Limited who obtained three separate permissions totalling 700 houses &mdash; had, in fact, contributed funds to the Fianna Fáil Party? In these published and undisputed circumstances in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 27 May 1990, would the Minister not agree that he has an obligation to meet, without delay, the members of his party who have brought the role of the public representative so much into disrepute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reject the essence of what the Deputy has said.  I would remind him that the newspaper report which he relies on in this regard lists the extent of section 4 and material contravention procedures that have been proposed by various councillors and by various parties. The report makes it quite clear that it is not suggesting any wrongdoing in the fact that some councillors are more involved in the process than others.  I should also point out that the editorial in the same newspaper, on the same day, also emphasised that there is no evidence whatsoever that any financial inducements have been received by any of the councillors concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government sub-committee and the other committee of experts who are at this time involved in the review of the <Col N="1082" /> whole question of local government.  It will be open to any one individual or group to make submissions on the section 4 question.  It will then be for the ministerial committee to decide what actions might be taken on the use of section 4 in relation to planning matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not concede that while there is no evidence to link party contributions with the beneficiaries or the councillors or the party in this regard, there is no legal requirement for such donations to be published anywhere and the objective evidence of planning permission for over 2,600 houses being granted in areas where the county council did not want them to so occur at land prices which were far less than market values, would suggest they should be, all lead the ordinary person in the street into a very unsavoury conclusion from this circumstantial evidence? Will he not agree, therefore, that he should meet the councillors or have the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment who is still, I understand, a member of the council, meet with those councillors to convey the sense of disquiet this House no doubt shares?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 76 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been consistent in their policy on Sellafield and have called many times for its closure, both at meetings with the relevant UK authorities and more generally.  Nuclear safety matters are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Energy at national level and, at Community level, come under the Energy Council and the <Col N="1084" /> Euratom Treaty rather than the Environment Council.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Energy, has raised the Sellafield question several times during his Presidency of the Energy Council, most recently at the Council meeting on 21 May.  I refer the Deputies to the replies to Questions Nos. 8, 15, 22, 41, 42, 51, 64 and 70 of 24 May in which the Minister for Energy gave a comprehensive account of his efforts in this matter.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have raised the issue of Sellafield nuclear safety and emissions generally at international level at every suitable opportunity, including two international conferences which I attended so far during my Presidency.  At the Third North Sea Conference in the Hague on 7-8 March, I expressed my strong concern and that of the Government about radioactive waste disposal in the marine environment and called for the closure of the Sellafield plant.  In Bergen on 14 May, at the conference on sustainable development, I pointed out the problems of nuclear waste disposal, of the decommissioning of old plant and the appalling consequences of accidents, and stressed that nuclear energy cannot legitimately be advanced as a solution to climate change at least until the problems I outlined have been resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the shipment or transport of nuclear waste is a matter that falls within the Minister's Environment brief?  What direct discussions has he had with the West German authorities to ask them not to proceed to implement their agreement to transport nuclear waste that cannot be reprocessed in West Germany to Sellafield so that it can be reprocessed in Sellafield? What discussions has the Minister had directly with the Japanese Government about the shipment of nuclear waste through the Irish Sea to the Sellafield plant for reprocessing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we are all concerned about this matter.  Even though it is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Energy, <Col N="1085" /> and it is the Energy Council who deal with all these matters, I have to point out that the Minister for Energy protested about this last year to both the UK and German Governments, especially to the German authorities as they had abandoned the completion of a reprocessing plant in Germany because of environmental concern.  The transportation of spent fuels through the Irish Sea is a major cause for concern and the Deputy can rest assured I share his view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Other than sharing people's views and engaging in the rhetoric of concern, throughout the course of the so-called Green Presidency the Minister has had not one direct contact by way of direct discussions on a Government to Government level with the West German Government to ask them not to transport nuclear waste to Sellafield, and there have been no direct discussions of any nature with the Japanese authorities to request that they bring to an end the transshipment of nuclear waste through the Irish Sea.</P>

I do not know whether he was in the Dáil on 24 May when my colleague dealt with this matter at some length, but the matters referred to so far as nuclear questions are concerned are for the Energy Council and the Minister for Energy has made our position known there.

      <Quest>if the Government were represented at the recent conference of European Environment Ministers in Bergen, Norway; and if this country has committed itself to an agreement to stabilise emissions of carbon dioxide by the year 2000.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The EC Presidency and Ireland were represented at the Bergen Conference. During the working sessions in the first week, two senior officials from my Department and one from the Department of Energy represented both the Presidency and Ireland.  During the ministerial session in the second week, I attended in my dual capacities as President of the EC Environment Council and Irish Minister for the Environment. In fact, I had the honour of being elected as one of the four vice-presidents of the conference and chaired some of the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards CO 2 targets, I said at the Bergen Conference that Ireland is fully committed to the international efforts to stabilise CO 2 emissions but that such <Col N="1088" /> efforts must be based on equity.  There must be recognition of the fact that some countries have relatively low levels of CO 2 emissions and are only now beginning to develop.  The key issue is how to share out the burden of achieving global stabilisation of CO 2 emissions, or any overall reduction targets that may be agreed.</P>
    <P>I have not yet set a target for CO 2 emissions in Ireland.  This will need to be further considered in the light of international developments including the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Second World Climate Conference which will take place from 29 October to 7 November of this year.  The results of the programme of expert studies which is being undertaken at national level will also need to be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Minister's response that Irish targets for carbon dioxide emissions are not yet appropriate because they must be based on equity, would he not agree that Irish emissions of carbon dioxide are higher per head of population and per pound of national income than the European average?  How can he expect the Third World to play a part in the reduction of CO 2 if a developed country like ours is not willing to agree to a target now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not just now.  We will be willing to agree at the appropriate time. The actual figure has not been finally established but it is accepted internationally that Ireland is a relatively small emitter of CO 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not per head of population or per pound of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Targets for the country will be set.  Action at international level is the only effective way to tackle the problem. We are trying to establish the extent of Ireland's CO 2 emissions and an inventory of Ireland's CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions is being established.  We hope it will be completed about the end <Col N="1089" /> of August this year, well before the world conference at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it is somewhat hypocritical for the Irish Government to attend international conferences stating that they are in favour of everybody stabilising CO 2 emissions throughout the world by the year 2000 while at the same time not having any target or any programme to achieve a target?  Can the Minister give any information on the other matters included in the final document in relation to a joint energy efficiency programme, specifically in relation to the improvement of public transport and the encouragement of goods traffic by railway and canals?  Has this country any targets in those areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepts and recognises the need to stabilise CO 2 emissions while ensuring at the same time stable development of the world economy. That matter was the subject of considerable discussion at a recent meeting I attended in Washington and also in Bergen.  There will be a major world conference following the IPCC report, which we expect to be published in late August or early September.  It will contain the base scientific data required to enable world countries to take the necessary decisions.  The Deputy is right in that I favour stabilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that in June 1989 when the Commission brought before the Council proposals, seven of the European Governments wanted the resolution following that meeting to include the immediate setting of a target for CO 2 stabilisation by the year 2000 and that our Government, represented by this Minister, resisted such a motion? Could the Minister clarify the form of derogation he is looking for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not looking for a derogation. We are waiting for the report of the IPCC and we will participate fully in the stabilisation process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister justify the June 1989 decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time there was no unanimity about what we should or should not do.  The only way we can establish what should be done is by using the scientific data which will be provided to us before the end of September.  The big emitters of CO 2 will then be pressed hard to comply.  We have a very good position on the matter in Ireland and as a Community.  It has not been quite as easy to get some of the other world players on deck, but following Bergen it can be fairly said that we are moving to a position where action will take place, even if there is a scarcity of scientific data in support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on the number of adult homeless persons living rough in Dublin is not available in my Department.  The assessment of housing needs at 30 September 1989, carried out by local authorities under the provisions of section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988 estimated that, at that date, there were a total of 588 homeless persons in Dublin city, county and Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the framework put in place following the enactment of the Housing Act, 1988, and the funding made available to local authorities and voluntary bodies towards the accommodation needs of homeless persons are an adequate and reasonable response to the problems of homelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated, I will be reviewing, in the course of the year, the measures introduced under the Housing Act, 1988, in relation to the accommodation of homeless persons and I will <Col N="1091" /> have regard to the views of housing authorities and voluntary organisations in that review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister react to the findings of Focus Point estimating the numbers at 1,500, almost three times the number he is suggesting?  Does he not agree that by virtue of the fact that houses will not be built in the city this year and that housing lists will get longer, inevitably the problem of homelessness will worsen?  What specific funds does he intend to allocate to stop that?</P>

      <P>Unit of accommodation. The Stanhope project which is due for completion later in the year will accommodate 100 adults.  Projects are already completed at the Simon Community Hostel in Usher's Quay with accommodation for 40 persons.  The Iveagh Trust is upgrading its hostel accommodation to provide 155 modern units for homeless persons.  This project is due for completion at the end of the year.  It is expected that approximately £2 million will be expended in 1990 under the scheme for the accommodation of homeless persons.  We have made strides in this regard.  I admit that a lot remains to be done but as finances become available we will do it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is a housing emergency in Dublin which particularly impacts on those who are homeless?  There are 5,000 people on the housing lists of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, while it is projected that at best those two local authorities will complete 60 new houses in 1990 for the entire city and county.  How does the Minister see that as being compatible with dealing with the problems of homelessness?</P>

      <Quest>if, in light of the strong and valid local reservations on the proposed inner relief road system for Castlebar, County Mayo, he will instruct Mayo County Council to defer work on the project pending a re-examination of the merits of alternative proposals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 3 April 1990, I confirmed, subject to minor modifications, a compulsory purchase order made by the local authority for this scheme.  In determining the order I took into consideration the objections made against the order, the evidence presented at the public local inquiry and the report of the person who <Col N="1093" /> held the inquiry.  My decision was based on these matters only.  The administration of a duly confirmed compulsory purchase order is a matter for the local authority concerned, in this case Mayo County Council.  I do not propose to instruct the council to re-examine the merits of alternative proposals or to delay the project by a further review of proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this proposal will not only split the town of Castlebar physically but has caused considerable agitation among members of the local community?  The Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, and others have visited Castlebar to view the situation there.  The Minister, as a local representative, has already acted in a judicial role by confirming the compulsory purchase order arising from the public sworn inquiry.  May I ask the Minister if he is absolutely satisfied, both as a local representative and as a Minister acting judicially, that he has acted objectively by taking into account the statements, facts and evidence given at the public sworn inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied that the Minister has acted correctly in this matter.  I made and based my decision on the evidence given at the public oral inquiry where everybody and every organisation got an opportunity to state their case.  The scheme proposed by the National Roads Authority which was discussed during the oral inquiry is the best scheme and is the one which will now proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

Is the Minister satisfied that the proposed route, which will cause environmental damage and pass close to a campus where there are 2,000 students, will not interfere unduly in the quality of life of people, will not cause noise pollution and will not be a constant traffic <Col N="1094" /> hazard?

      <P>Despite the advice he has received from his departmental officials and the county council engineering staff of Mayo County Council, does the Minister not accept that there must be something seriously wrong when the combined population of Castlebar are opposed to this road being built?  Last Monday the nuns, priests and brothers in Castlebar collectively decided that they wanted to voice their objections to this road in no uncertain manner.  Does the Minister, who is normally cast in the role of Henry VIII, the <i>Fidei Defensor,</i> not find it strange to be striking down all <Col N="1098" /> these objections on a very cursory and flimsy set of legalistic and official arguments?</P>

I have read every page of this transcript and I am satisfied that the inspector's recommendation was proper. It would be improper for me to do anything other than I did.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 11 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the questions arise from the content of a recent radio programme in which the Chairman of Cork/Kerry Tourism outlined certain views which had been expressed to him by continental bus drivers about the condition of Irish roads.</P>
      <P>I understand that, when approached by Cork County Council, the chairman did not have information about specific problems which would have enabled the local authority to consider taking remedial action.  If the Deputies have such information they should bring it to the notice of the relevant local authorities for attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For my part, I have provided some £27.5 million in grants to Cork and Kerry County Councils this year for the improvement and maintenance of public roads for which they are responsible.  The grants include discretionary grants totalling £11.55 million to supplement expenditure from the local authorities' own resources on regional and county roads. The grant allocations for work on national routes take due account of the <Col N="1102" /> needs of such routes in tourist areas and, no doubt, local authorities take account of the needs of regional and county roads in tourist areas when determining their priorities for the expenditure of discretionary road grants and their own resources.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am aware that the councillor is a member of Fianna Fáil and also of Clonakilty UDC.  While I did not hear his contribution on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme he was subsequently contacted by the county concil. Specific roads or locations were not mentioned, he was unable to provide that information.  The important thing is that the discretionary grants allocated to Cork and Kerry County Councils have risen quite substantially.  I note a figure here which might be of interest to the Deputy. In 1986 it was roughly £4 million for Cork and for Kerry £1.8 million.  In 1990 the figure for Cork is £8.3 million and for Kerry £3.1 million.  That is a lot of extra money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that he is not aware of the actual conditions of the road network in Cork and Kerry?  Is he aware that Cork and Kerry contain probably up to 25 per cent of the road network of this State and that the tourist roads &mdash; not the primary roads &mdash; by the sea are in a desperate condition? Is the Minister trying to say he is not aware of that?  If he is not aware of it, has he any excuse?  If he is aware of it what is he going to do to ensure that these roads are maintained and improved to a proper condition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not seek to put words into the Minister's mouth. Out of the total allocation of moneys available to me I have allocated £27,504,000 to Cork and Kerry for roadworks this year, a very substantial increase on what they were receiving <Col N="1103" /> until a few years ago.  I have also increased dramatically the amount of discretionary money.  I am not saying that every single turn has been straightened or that every single road is to the standard I would like.  What I am saying is, as part of my overall programme for the funding of these roads, they have got a very decent allocation and will, I hope, be getting further substantial funds when these become available to the Minister.</P>

There is a very considerable mileage of county and regional roads in this country, about 74,000 kilometres.  It takes a very large sum of money to maintain and keep those in good condition.  I am not saying that every road in Ireland is up to the standard I would like.  I have stated that it is a deficiency in our infrastructure that I am seeking to correct.

      <P>The local authority housing construction programme in 1990 is being funded from the internal capital receipts of local authorities supplemented by Exchequer resources.  The allocations for the individual housing authorities were determined on the basis of their relative housing needs.  As the resultant allocations were not matched by the level of internal receipts in every case it was necessary to redistribute some capital from those authorities with surplus capital receipts including Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, to those that were short.  This transfer was effected by requiring those authorities with internal receipts surplus to their housing allocation to fund some of their road works programme from this surplus and by directing an equivalent amount of Exchequer funds for roads to housing authorities with shortfalls in their internal housing capital receipts.  This arrangement does not affect actual expenditure on either the local authority housing programme or the roads programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's complicated reply that what has been described as a complicated piece of book-keeping has meant that money that was intended to be spent on housing was spent on housing and that money intended for roads was spent on roads?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the most desirable way to deal with this but on this occasion, because of the receipts, this did not work out the way one would have hoped.  However, I must point out that nothing was lost under the roads or housing programmes.  It was simply that the available receipts were somewhat better in some administrative areas than others. The surplus of those receipts was transferred indirectly to other housing authorities with a shortfall of internal receipts to enable them in turn to provide more housing.  This may sound convoluted but we are talking about a book-keeping exercise as far as the total allocation was concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

Will the Minister explain how there was a surplus of money in Dublin when there are people waiting for houses with no realistic prospect of being housed by a local authority?

Does the Minister consider his decision appropriate in the context of the loss of local authority housing stock sales?  Will he agree that that money should be redirected to the provision of new houses for those on waiting lists? Some people at present on the waiting list in Dublin will still be on it in 20 years' time on the basis of new houses being <Col N="1110" /> built in Dublin city and county at the moment.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give a definition of &ldquo;in due course&rdquo;?  What does it mean?  When the Building Control Act was debated, Members on this side expressed concern about the delay in the preparation of building regulations and it now appears that our fears are confirmed. At that stage, the Minister gave the House an assurance that there would not be a delay.  Will he now give an indication when the regulations will be made so that there is no confusion in regard <Col N="1111" /> to building control arrangements and the implementation of the new Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The fears which the Deputy expressed in the House on a previous occasion are still groundless.  The proposed building regulations were published by the Department and local authorities and the building industry had been asked to observe the requirements in the drafts pending implementation of the statutory basis.  There was criticism that they were too complex and a new format is being developed to cater for this matter.  I hope that the final drafts of the regulations will be available in about two months and that the regulations can be made at that stage.</P>

In regard to the seven local authorities which currently operate building by-laws, will the Minister make an order under the 1990 Act stating quite clearly that the legal regulations being administered by those authorities are the building regulations which are currently published?  This would remove the ambiguity, cost and duplication currently experienced by people who have to apply for planning permission and by-law approval.</P>

      <P>No.  I said that they had already been published and that we were asking builders and local authorities to implement them on a voluntary basis. There was criticism that they were too complex and difficult to understand and, therefore, consideration is being given to making regulations containing simple, functional requirements which will be supported by separate technical guidelines. This is in response to the industry and it will make life easier for everyone. However, it is taking a little extra time to get the format right although I expect it will be completed in about two months.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that certain failures by his Department contribute to the enormous cost of road accidents?  I will give two examples.  One is that there is not enough money available to local authorities for the maintenance and upkeep of roads, and the second is the inordinate waiting list of people applying to do their driving test. This may well result in people who are not qualified to drive doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that we are spending approximately £215 million on road improvements this year, which is a big increase on previous allocations in this area.  The sum of £500 million has been assessed under new methodology which came into effect because of OECD observations.  The new method has also been adopted by the UK. Before this it was done on an estimation of lost output, medical and legal costs and a notional sum to take account of suffering involved.  If that criteria had been applied the sum would have been halved but I agree that it is too much.</P>
      <P>I am distressed about the waiting list for driving tests and I am trying to do something about it.  I have made a proposal in that regard and I am trying to finally settle the matter with the interested parties.  It is not easy but it is my intention to do so and we can then clear the backlog within 12 months.  I want to get to the stage where people who apply for a driving test will get it within a month.  That is my aim and objective and, if I get co-operation from all sides, it can be achieved pretty quickly.</P>

In the context of such a plan, will the Minister agree that the time has come to provide automatic testing for vehicles which have been on the road for five years or more and to introduce legislation to provide for the compulsory wearing of seat belts for passengers on the back seats of cars, not just in the front?  Will the Minister confirm that he is aware that research abroad indicated that the compulsory wearing of seat belts in the back seats of cars substantially reduces injuries suffered in traffic accidents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot confirm the percentage to which the Deputy referred but I am quite sure it is very high.  I would like to go down the road Deputy Gilmore <Col N="1115" /> recommended, that is that we should clear this backlog of driving test applications as speedily as possible.  If we could get that backlog out of the way once and for all, so that people could undergo a driving test within a matter of a couple of weeks from the date of application, we could then consider very many options for improving the position dramatically. There are sufficient staff in the driving testing division &mdash; along with the new recruits in the recent past &mdash; to deal with all applications received on a day-to-day basis.  I must stress that it is the backlog obtaining which is crippling the system and which amounts to some 50,000 applicants at this time.  There is no way we can get rid of that backlog without receiving outside assistance.  I have proposed how that could be done correctly, efficiently and in accordance with the highest standards. It is a matter of getting all interested parties &mdash; the unions and others involved &mdash; to sit down and agree the process.  I am hoping that can be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that spending another £215 million on roads &mdash; if I heard him correctly &mdash; is not the answer, rather that the answer is a larger investment in public transport, particularly in urban areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Were I to go down that road I would be attacked by all and sundry for not providing sufficient money to bring our roads up to a proper standard. Deputy Garland will have heard Deputy O'Keeffe speak earlier about the standard he would like to see apply to road construction in provincial areas. Then there are the demands in this city for better road networks and better circulation of traffic.  One can do only what is feasible within the allocations obtaining. We are spending a lot of money endeavouring to get the road network around Dublin right; we are endeavouring to get our major national arteries correct so that we can gain from the advantage of competitiveness in the open market that will be upon us in a couple of years.  Therefore, we have to commit <Col N="1116" /> large sums to that purpose.  I accept that 92 per cent of the road network is comprised of roads, other than national primaries, and encompasses enormous mileage.  Although there are fewer than one million taxpayers in this country, everybody calls for us to have roads equivalent to those in other European countries and elsewhere, where there is an enormous surplus of tax revenue.  One immediately realises that such objectives are not possible overnight here, but we have an objective we would like to reach and are doing the best we can.  I would have to say that the Government have been reasonably generous with me, in tight economic circumstances, in giving a great deal more money to the improvement of our roads network &mdash; granted to accommodate the Structural Funds requirement as well, but, at the same time, the additionality has been there and must be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that local authorities attempting to introduce road safety measures &mdash; whether that be ramping of roads, painting double yellow lines or whatever &mdash; encounter two difficulties at present: first, that the procedures to be followed to achieve road safety measures are lengthy and cumbersome and, second, there is a shortage of the necessary resources to put them into effect?  Would the Minister give the House an undertaking to examine those two areas in view of the very high cost to the country of road accidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be favourably disposed to examining matters in any way that would improve overall road safety. Certainly I will bring the matters raised to the attention of the relevant section of my Department.  I would ask the National Road Safety Association to be as generous as possible in their campaign later this year.  I know they intend having a major campaign, and I will ask them to include the seat belt aspect to which Deputy Shatter referred as a major element of that campaign.</P>

      <P>I made regulations on 21 May under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, which implement the commitment in the Government's Environment Action Programme to prohibit the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal in the built-up area of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The effect of the regulations, which come into operation on 1 September next, is to ban the main types of coal which have been used in Dublin's open fires in recent years &mdash; i.e. Polish, Texan and English coals &mdash; and to set certain standards for the solid fuels which may be sold in the restricted area.  Manufactured fuels containing the prohibited coals will be permitted only if they meet specified criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A standard is also being set for the sulphur content of solid fuels.  This is to prevent air pollution arising from sulphur dioxide emissions (SO 2) and to help Ireland meet its international obligations under the Helsinki Protocol to the <Col N="1118" /> Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.  The standard set is intended to ensure that the use of substitute fuels in place of low-sulphur prohibited coal does not increase total (SO 2) emissions to unacceptable levels and cause further air pollution.</P>
    <P>Fuel merchants will be allowed to store and transport prohibited fuels within the Dublin area only where such fuels are intended for sale outside of the restricted area.  Merchants will be able to take orders for such sales.  They will be required to keep records for control purposes.</P>
    <P>Persons who fail to observe the regulations will be liable to the imposition of severe penalties.  The Air Pollution Act provides for a fine of up to £1,000 and-or up to six months imprisonment on summary conviction, and for a fine of up to £10,000 and-or up to two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. Arrangements are being made to have the regulations strictly enforced by the three local authorities concerned &mdash; Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.</P>
    <P>An extensive area of Dublin is included within the restricted area so as to ensure the effectiveness of the measures being taken in preventing air pollution throughout the capital and its environs.  On that basis, the restricted area includes the whole of Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire, the built-up areas of the county, and adjacent areas.  Detailed maps of the restricted area will be available for inspection at local authority offices.</P>
    <P>With the implementation of the regulations, a wide range of solid fuels should be available for use within the restricted area.  Solid fuels which are currently available on the Dublin market and which are not affected by the prohibition include Bord na Móna briquettes, union briketts, coalite, extracite and anthracites. In addition, I expect that various new fuels which meet the requisite standards will be brought on the market for next winter.  It is intended to launch an information campaign later in the summer to advise the public generally in <Col N="1119" /> Dublin of the options which are available and of the characteristics and optimum use of alternative fuels.</P>
    <P>The regulations now made do not affect in any way the provision of heating systems which are fuelled by means of electricity, oil and gas.  In this regard, I hope and expect that the very successful home conversion programmes of Bord Gáis Éireann and the ESB, in particular, will continue to make significant inroads in the home heating market in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has already announced details of the arrangements which have been made to help low-income groups in the restricted area to meet additional costs arising from the need to buy smokeless or low-smoke fuels next winter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State indicate to the House what resources her Department will make available to the three Dublin local authorities to enforce this legislation, and how many personnel she estimates each local authority will require to ensure its proper enforcement?  Furthermore, could she indicate what discussions have taken place between her Department and the Department of Energy with a view to ensuring that Dublin Gas make arrangements to extend the gas grid within Dublin so that natural gas is made available to many parts of County Dublin for heating purposes where it is not currently available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's first question I should say that officials of my Department are at present having discussions with the three local authorities in relation to the policing of this ban.  Obviously advice will be available but the Dublin local authorities will be expected to assign those officials working on special control area orders to this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to discussions with Bord Gáis Éireann, I should say that is a matter for the Department of Energy.  But the committee established by the Government in December last will be reporting shortly on gas and other options for the <Col N="1120" /> city.  I expect that those options will be considered by the Government shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister outline for the benefit of the House the discussions she has had with the major solid fuel distributor, CDL, who will now have to change the types of fuels they were selling?  Can the Minister assure the House, having had discussions with CDL, that they will not profiteer from the new regulations?  Will the Minister further indicate that the arrangements the Minister for Social Welfare has made for the recipients of fuel vouchers will mean that the fuel purchased with the increased fuel voucher will have the same calorific value as coal purchased under the previous fuel vouchers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to discussions which I have had with CDL and other solid fuel merchants, I do not know whether the companies in question will make more money out of the new options, that is a matter for them and it depends on the extent to which they can exploit the vacuum that now exists in the Dublin market.  That is not a matter for me.  The decision made by the Government was made regardless of the interests of any of the solid fuel merchants and was made in the interests of public health in the city and county.</P>
      <P>On the second question, the value of the fuel voucher, £3 will be given to low income families in the city and county and this is an additional £3 for those already in receipt of the national fuel scheme vouchers, making a total of £8. This is a reasonable amount and will allow them &mdash; with the information that my Department will be making available &mdash; to make a wise choice and should more than adequately cover the additional cost of low smoke fuels.  I might also add that fuels will be coming on the market this winter that will be marginally more expensive than coal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the case.  It will not be illegal for any householder to burn bituminous coal this winter.  The Government decided to concentrate on the distribution, marketing and sale of coal and we believe the effort should be concentrated on those who are selling the coal.  However, if these regulations do not prove effective, the Government will consider taking additional action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

What personnel will the local authorities allocate to policing this?  What additional funding is the Minister's Department prepared, to provide to ensure that enforcement is a reality and not just a pious aspiration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the first part of the Deputy's question, I do not believe that the simple repeal of that clause in the Air Pollution Act would have been sufficient; it would not have allowed for the areas of the city and county suffering from smoke pollution to have been brought under control in a <Col N="1123" /> short period of time and it would have taken a substantial time to go through the special area control order procedure. On the question of the order being challenged in the court, the Government sought the advice of the Attorney General on making this order and I am satisfied, on the Attorney General's advice, that if this order is challenged, the challenge will not be successful.</P>

I attempted by way of Private Notice Question to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to assure us that no Irish citizen has been affected by the earthquake in Romania.  As the Chair may know, many Irish citizens are attempting to adopt babies out there.  The Ceann Comhairle disallowed the question on the grounds of lack of urgency but I do not think there is anything more urgent than an earthquake.  I do not know what disaster would be considered an emergency. Because he has disallowed the Private Notice Question I seek to raise this issue on the Adjournment.</P>

  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Bill, 1990:" RHead="Second Stage (Resumed)">
    <Title>Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on Second Stage was adjourned I was saying that I had some difficulty with this Bill because I was not entirely enamoured of the operation of Fóir Teoranta at all stages of their history.  Therefore, I had some sympathy with the fact that it is proposed that this body be wound up, but I query whether the economy is now in such a robust condition that there is perceived to be no need for any alternative rescue agency.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the economic circumstances at the time Fóir Teoranta were established when we were heading towards EC membership, with all the implications of trade barriers coming down, a freer market and a more competitive environment generally.  As a result this posed additional stresses and strains for Irish companies not accustomed to performing in the new free market conditions.  It was acknowledged in that climate that there was a role for a body such as Fóir Teoranta to tackle genuine ailing companies that, with restructuring, advice and short-term finance, had the capacity to be revived and to continue to provide employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was in April, when the Minister first addressed this subject, that he remarked that there was no necessity for State props in the new competitive environment, about which he was in ebullient mood.  He detailed in that address, as Deputy Noonan said, the fact that interest rates were the lowest for years, there was unprecedentedly low inflation and investment was available through the BES, all factors that, in the very brief period since this Coalition Government came to power, have dramatically <Col N="1158" /> changed.  The position regarding low interest rates no longer applies.  There have been four increases in interest rates since the Government came to power and there is a very significant difference, of 4 percentage points, between the interest rates obtaining in this country and in the leading economy in the EMS exchange mechanism.  Inflation has not been contained and the investment available through the BES has been very seriously curtailed in the Finance Act, 1989, and in the Finance Bill which we passed in the House last week.</P>
    <P>In case there is any doubt about this matter, I want to say that I support entirely the limitations imposed on the operation of the BES.  In fact, I do not think they went far enough.  Some of the abuses of that scheme were scandalous, and that raises very serious questions about the original <i>raison d'etre</i> of that scheme.  It seems, when it comes to raising investment capital for industry, that that is too risky a matter for many Irish businessmen, whereas a guaranteed return on projects like some of the so-called tourism-related projects is considered a much safer bet.  If one looks at the BES since its establishment, one finds that until such time as the banks came up with ruses which could make investments risk-free the BES was scarcely availed of.  It was only when investors could be guaranteed a safe return that they began to put up the money for the kind of projects I have referred to.  That raises doubts about the investment culture and entrepreneurial instinct in this economy.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, the situation that the Minister adduced as his reasoning for introducing the Bill has completely changed.  I wonder whether the initial reasons for Fóir Teoranta coming into existence are not, to some extent, about to be revisited on us in as much as there is some analogy to be drawn between the circumstances facing Irish enterprise at the time of our entry to the common market and the situation we will be faced with after 1992.  Projections have been made and commentators have written about there being an expectation that <Col N="1159" /> we will, unfortunately, risk further closures and further company failures in the aftermath of 1992.  Other commentators say we are now so slimmed down, fit and lean that we can face the free market competition with impunity.  I would like to think that is the case but quite frankly I am dubious whether, at least in the initial years following the completion of the free market, some companies that, perhaps in the medium or longer term, would have potential for survival and continued employment, will come under pressure, and that the absence of an alternative mechanism will be regrettable.  I hasten to add that it is not my job to come in here and argue for further bankrolling of industrialists, although that is too expansive a term to use for all the people who have availed of the Fóir Teoranta largesse, but I am concerned about the employment that is provided.</P>
    <P>I have some quibble with Deputy Noonan's reference to the fact that Fóir Teoranta have been instrumental in saving 40,000 jobs.  That is probably an exaggeration but nonetheless from the point of view of protection of employment, they have played some role.  I would like the Minister to say if there are estimates for the number of jobs that remain in existence as a result of Fóir Teoranta assistance.</P>
    <P>I part company with Fine Gael when it comes to indiscriminate praise of Fóir Teoranta.  Deputy Noonan was too undiscriminating in his comments about the performance of Fóir Teoranta and about them not being an easy touch for Irish businessmen.  I do not believe that at all stages of their history and in all cases that can be established.  To some extent they were seen as an easy touch and as a mechanism for the banks to avoid their social responsibility.  Customers who were too much of a risk were pawned off on Fóir Teoranta and the banks did not feel they would come under any pressure as a result.  In some cases Fóir Teoranta were used as a milk cow for inefficient businessmen.  That is an important point, because successive persons associated with the management and board of Fóir Teoranta have commented that they <Col N="1160" /> were often asked to bail out companies whose difficulties were also due to inherent managerial weakness.  In my view often it is not a financial problem alone but a question of managerial competence. Perhaps we should look very carefully at whether a system of task forces of experts should be available to provide the necessary managerial competence in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Talking about Fóir Teoranta having been used on occasion as a milk cow by inefficient Irish businessmen, my attention has been drawn to an article as recently as 3 May 1990 in <i>Business &amp; Finance</i> on a company called Manford Clothing.  This article illustrates the general point I am trying to make and probably supports the introduction of the Bill for the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta by the Government.  The article states:</P>
    <P>Manford Clothing &amp; Fashions, the Longford clothing company that went into receivership two weeks ago, received over £1 million in State aid since it began trading in 1980.  Of this, £440,000 came from State rescue agency Fóir Teoranta.  The Fóir Teoranta investment was approved in the summer of 1985 and was made in September 1985.  At this time Noel Hanlon, the owner of Manford Clothing and Fashions was also the chairman of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>A spokesman for Fóir Teoranta says that Hanlon would not have been involved in the discussions on the Manford investment.  A close friend and former election agent of Albert Reynolds, who is the local TD for Longford, Hanlon was once one of the biggest employers in the county. </P>
    <P>There has been a number of examples of that kind of involvement by the agency.  I do not question the statement there which is the reason I put it on the record that Mr. Hanlon would not have been involved in the decision while he was chairman of Fóir Teoranta.  It is tempting in a situation such as that where one's own business is involved and one is in such a position because there could be a potential conflict of interest.  Generally <Col N="1161" /> speaking, Governments of successive colours have been subjected to inordinate pressure from backers of their own political parties to be rescued in circumstances such as I have described in the case of Manford Clothing.</P>
    <P>Mention of Mr. Hanlon's stewardship as chairman reminds me of another point, and it is an important one.  There was a time when one could get easy access to information about major loans advanced by Fóir Teoranta &mdash; perhaps not the minor ones &mdash; because they were published annually.  Some of the figures I have show that on the capital side the Exchequer advanced £1 million in 1979, £7.9 million in 1980, £3 million in 1981, £14.5 million in 1982, £22 million in 1983, £19 million in 1984 and so on.  The point about which I am uneasy is that when Mr. Hanlon took over as chairman in 1982&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sorry, Deputy I know you are a relatively new Member but there is a custom in the House that when making reference to individuals, reference that might be misconstrued, or where the individual in question might wish, in other circumstances, to defend himself and is not given that opportunity here, Deputies, as far as possible, avoid indulging in such references.

      <P>It is unfortunate that the chairperson who took over about 1982 put an end to the practice of publishing the major list of beneficiaries annually. It is disquieting that it was from that year on that the amounts advanced jumped dramatically.  I instanced £1 million from the Exchequer on the capital side being <Col N="1162" /> advanced in 1979, £7.9 million in the following year and £3 million in the following year; then it suddenly jumped to £14.5 million in 1982 and went as high as £22 million in 1983 and remained at a high figure until recently.</P>
      <P>It is important that there is public accountability and that the information is easily accessible to the public.  I am convinced that part of the motivation behind the Government introducing this Bill is that they are aware, and their officials are aware, that there has been misuse of the Fóir Teoranta facility and that in some cases it was throwing good money after bad.  It was, on occasion, used as a milk cow for inefficient business. From that point of view it is difficult to defend its continuation but it does lead one to question whether the economy is now in a sufficiently robust condition to dispense with it entirely.</P>
      <P>I support the view that one could not continue indefinitely dishing out enormous sums of money.  I presume the £75 million referred to in the Minister's address is roughly the same as my own figure for the end of December 1988 &mdash; the deficit at that time on the profit and loss account was £74.9 million.  That is a substantial amount of money and I accept that it warrants action by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether it was correct for the Government to proceed with this decision in this manner at a time when it is known that a major review of industrial policy generally is being concluded.  The publication of the triennial report on industrial performance is expected within a matter of weeks.  Obviously, one cannot discuss the role of Fóir Teoranta or any alternative outside any discussions on a review of industrial strategy.  It is remarkable that this would seem to be the second time the Minister for Finance has preempted that review by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; he made the decision in the Finance Bill to extend the advantageous tax regime for the manufacturing sector to the year 2010, and now he has made the decision to abolish Fóir Teoranta.  One hopes this does not reflect any lack of co-ordination <Col N="1163" /> within the Cabinet.  One presumes there is close and detailed discussion on it but I would have liked an opportunity to reflect on it to see what shape the new proposals will be concerning future industrial policy.</P>
    <P>I think it is evident and accepted by all sides of this House that this is the major debate of the nineties, that the industrial strategy we have followed up to now has been a costly failure and that if we are going to create jobs to tackle our emigration, poverty and unemployment problems we will have to rethink whether we are getting value for the vast amounts of public finance we spend on industrial policy.  My party have made what I consider to be a very significant contribution to this debate in a document published earlier this week called <i>Making it Work &mdash; A Framework for Industrial Development</i> and have attempted to focus on some of these questions.  About £400 million per annum has been spent throughout the eighties on a range of grants and subsidies and an array of State agencies including Fóir Teoranta, that exist for this purpose.  That is not to comment on whatever the figure is.  There is some dispute about it in terms of tax foregone in the various schemes we have been talking about on the Finance Bill and so on, but in direct contributions it is about £44 million per annum.  That is a great deal of money.  Are we getting jobs for it?  We have over 40,000 people fewer employed in the economy now in the manufacturing sector than we had ten years ago.  That seems a very disturbing figure.  My view is that the IDA are doing a very good job, but the time has come to have a look at whether they are doing the job they should be doing.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister has gone ahead and made this decision and we have now to try to respond to that.  He has argued that there is an alternative mechanism available since the decision to abolish Fóir Teoranta and he has pointed to the provision in the present Companies Bill which is the US Chapter 11 type facility. I welcome that.  It is a very positive decision by the Government.  I am a member of the Special Committee on the <Col N="1164" /> Companies Bill and I support this aspect of it.  The US Chapter 11 system as it operates in the US has ramifications beyond this point that I would not be so enamoured of, but in so far as there is a facility there to stop cash outflows to creditors where a particular enterprise is genuinely under short-term pressure this is very welcome indeed.</P>
    <P>The banks have behaved disgracefully in this respect in the past.  They have made some outrageous decisions to pull the plug on enterprises that had considerable medium-term and long-term potential when it seemed that their investment might be at risk.  The banks have always moved to look after themselves in matters like this, and if hundreds of people lost their jobs as a result of the bank's decision that never seemed to trouble the banks.</P>
    <P>I welcome the examiner mechanism contained in the Companies Bill in terms of preventing for a short period the kind of cash outflows that normally would make a company in the circumstances I have described so vulnerable.  However, I have not formed a definite view at this stage as to whether that will be sufficient to cope with the circumstances in the climate post-1992.  The Workers' Party in their document, <i>Making it Work &mdash; A Framework for Industrial Development,</i> argue very strongly that perhaps instead of doling out grants and subsidies and providing expertise in an array of State agencies, we should consider taking investments or key shareholdings in companies, not just companies in trouble but other companies who are seeking to raise finance so that we could exert some influence on key investment decisions. One of the big problems about the maturing stock of multinationals in this country is that, although they have provided very badly needed jobs, the outflow of capital back to the country of origin is of frightening dimensions, something like £2.4 billion profits in the last year being repatriated.  I would like to think the State could take a more interventionist role and be in a position to exert influence over the reinvestment of some of that surplus in the Irish economy.  It seems <Col N="1165" /> that is one of the areas that should be looked at in the kind of debate we are having now about Fóir Teoranta, or Fóir Teoranta mark 2.  I would rather think it would be in a revamp of the total institutional arrangements that are there at the moment that in return for investment to bale out the company who seemed as if they were capable of restructuring themselves, the State would take a stake-holding in that company in the manner I have described.  Alternatively &mdash; or as well &mdash; it would appoint a director or appoint managerial expertise where it is found that the real difficulty is that the managerial competence is not there to run that company productively or efficiently.  It seems we would have more control over our future as an economy if we were to take that direction.  I hope the House will have an opportunity to discuss this in the not too distant future.  I will leave it at that for the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, in a sense there is a degree of artificiality about the debate because we are discussing a State organisation who literally have run their course and have been terminated.  It is only valid to point out that the circumstances now and the circumstances surrounding the foundation of Fóir Teoranta are very considerably different.  Fóir Teoranta were established to deal with a specific set of complex circumstances which faced Irish industry as we went into the EC.  The Government of the day correctly anticipated that there would be a major change associated with Ireland's membership of the EC.  The nature of Irish business was fundamentally different in the early seventies from the nature of Irish business today.  Irish business at that time was predominantly made up of small to medium sized basically family firms, many of them engaged in a very traditional way in manufacture behind very high protective barriers.  Those barriers had begun to come down in the previous decade, but the protectionism really collapsed from the early seventies onwards. The Government of the day took the view <Col N="1166" /> that the shake-out could not be sustained by many traditional Irish industries and that some form of specific agency was necessary to deal with the problems.  Fóir Teoranta came out of that thinking.</P>
      <P>This country moved from an era of protectionism to an open economy. There was a specific need for this type of institution since there was a gap in the institutional arrangements at that time. Deputy Rabbitte has pointed out that the section 11-type provisions which are being introduced in the Companies Bill, so painfully being pushed by me, Deputy Rabbitte and a number of other Deputies through a committee of this House, put into place a different institutional and legal framework wherein the type of problem which was previously dealt with by Fóir Teoranta can be dealt with.  The Government in the early seventies took the view that there would be pressure on Irish industry in the new environment. It was felt in particular that small and medium traditional Irish firms needed some form of support.</P>
      <P>I would agree with one point made by Deputy Rabbitte, although I would not make the same inference.  It is a great pity historically that throughout the period of Fóir Teoranta there is not a consistency in the presentation of their accounts.  I do not accept that there is a sinister implication to be drawn from this and I am sure Deputy Rabbitte did not mean this. Consistency in these accounts would provide us with a very good yardstick for measuring the type of problem being dealt with by Fóir Teoranta throughout their existence and it would provide an extremely good way of judging in objective terms the relative success of the company in dealing with the problems they faced.  The reports covering the five years from 1973 to 1977 show that disbursements totalling in excess of £19 million were made to 261 companies.  That represented a very substantial amount of investment.  The companies assisted read like a <i>Who's Who</i> of Irish industry of the early seventies.  They include companies such as AET, Avoca Mines and Arklow</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> Pottery.  I notice that my own constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Wicklow companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an historical fact that a very high proportion of Wicklow industry was assisted but unfortunately it did not survive.  The list is contained in the 1976 and later reports and makes very intriguing reading.  A couple of County Clare companies are included.  Other companies are Athlone Apparel, Ballybay Tanners, Cappancur Joinery and Carrigaline Pottery.  The tragedy is that these concerns did not survive even with State assistance.</P>
      <P>During the first five years of their operation Fóir Teoranta dealt with a very substantial crisis of transition.  While not being unkind to them or their personnel, it must be said that there was not conspicuous success in that period.  I would be inclined to the view expressed by Deputy Rabbitte.  It is obvious that throughout the period the banks whipped many small firms into Fóir Teoranta. Clearly many of the firms did not have a great chance of success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems of having a State company like Fóir Teoranta operating in those circumstances and at that time was that the company could be held hostage to requirements in constituencies and to the wishes of Members of this House.  I do not say that to chastise people because if a firm in my constituency had been threatened at that time I, too, would have been clamouring at the door of the relevant Minister.  When a company like this, a lender of last resort, is set up under the State umbrella, there is a very great political temptation to beat that Minister about the head if he or she does not assist each and every lame duck in one's constituency.  That is something that obviously happened.  If we look at the extraordinary long list of companies assisted and go back over the record of this House, it is clear that on every occasion a company found itself in difficulty it was whipped into Fóir Teoranta either by the banks, who were all too anxious then as now to rid themselves <Col N="1168" /> of risk, or by people such as ourselves defending constituency interests, without an attempt being made objectively to judge the benefits of Fóir Teoranta's intervention.</P>
    <P>The middle years of the company's operation saw a fall off in demand for services.  Between 1976 and 1981, for example, 249 firms were assisted and the total funds provided amounted to £27 million.  Although the number of firms assisted was in decline throughout the period, there was an increase in the average assistance provided to individual firms.  Because of the change in the presentational system it is not possible to comment in as detailed a way on the companies assisted at that time.  Working from memory alone, it is obvious that many of the companies went to Fóir Teoranta <i>in extremis</i> and objectively they did not have a long-term chance of survival.</P>
    <P>I listened with some interest this morning to Deputy Michael Noonan.  I would have to take issue with him on his claim that 40,000 jobs were saved by Fóir Teoranta. If he checks the figures I think he will come to the conclusion that this was the total number of people who were employed by the companies assisted by Fóir Teoranta.  I do not think Deputy Noonan would claim that all those companies and all those jobs were saved. Clearly that is not the case.  That figure is far in excess of the reality.</P>
    <P>The recession of the eighties saw a major upturn in Fóir Teoranta's operations. The accounts for 1982 to 1986 make very interesting reading.  It is a pity that we do not have the detail of every company assisted during that period.  A good number of Wicklow firms again featured and sadly all too many of them went to the wall.  There is an intriguing indication of a litmus of the failure of Government policy during the period. The failure of the then Coalition Government to grapple with the changing circumstances of the Irish economy and in particular to deal with the needs of industry in the light of the harsh economic realities of the day is graphically illustrated in the accounts.  In 1983 and 1984 in excess of 90 companies were assisted <Col N="1169" /> in each year.  That was the highest at any time.  In the period 1982-86, 415 firms were assisted by Fóir Teoranta, the highest number in 1983 and it declined in 1985-86.  Perhaps this was because there was some improvement in the economy, but if one were cynical one could say it was because the shake-out had occurred wherever it could.  Disbursements during that period &mdash; this point was made by Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; were very high: £14 million in 1982, £23 million in 1983, £90 million in 1984, £21 million in 1985 and the amount was less in 1986.  The total disbursements over that period were £90 million, an historically high figure.</P>
    <P>One of the very disturbing factors during this period was the accelerated rate of debt write-off by Fóir Teoranta. I do not have the actual figures for the period but my calculations suggest it was well in excess of £50 million.  The accounts for 1985 show that in excess of £29 million was written off by Fóir Teoranta.  This is a very big measure of failure by any standard and is a clear indication that a large number of companies on the books of Fóir Teoranta were clearly not in a position to be helped.  I am not saying that we should not have tried to help those companies, or that if I had been a Member of this House representing a constituency where one of those companies was located, that I would not have tried to help them.  As I said, one of the great dangers in having a company like Fóir Teoranta involved in this type of operation is that, in a sense, it is an automatic hostage to fortune; in effect, it is set up to deal with every political crisis which occurs when any company, irrespective of the circumstances, finds itself in difficulties.</P>
    <P>Events have changed very considerably since 1986.  I should like to take issue with Deputy Rabbitte's interpretation of the present economic circumstances. He suggested that inflation, interest rates and the availability or otherwise of the BES and venture funding was such that one might need to consider a continuation of the life of Fóir <Col N="1170" /> Teoranta.  I admit to being a little confused as to precisely what the Deputy was saying because he criticised the companies who were assisted by Fóir Teoranta and seemed to favour the termination of Fóir Teoranta, but not quite yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I did not understand the Deputy's argument, and I was here for his entire speech.  However, I thank the Deputy very sincerely for his clarification.  I note he did not say what kind of institution he would put in place of Fóir Teoranta.  However, as I have said I do not want to be argumentative.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Rabbitte that when we are talking about, for example, interest rates &mdash; it is true that there have been increases in Irish interest rates; anyone who pays a mortgage is abundantly aware of that, and I pay several &mdash; we never compare them with those in the Federal Republic of Germany where, incidentally, they have increased more rapidly than ours.  It is not valid, as Deputy Rabbitte has attempted to suggest, to compare our interest rates with those in the Federal Republic of Germany because traditionally our interest rates have been compared to those of the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a very dramatic change in this area since 1986 and it would be less than generous of Deputy Rabbitte not to recognise this.  Interest rates were at an historic high in 1986 and were four percentage points above the level pertaining in the United Kingdom.  This had a material effect on Irish industry.  Not alone did it affect the rate of investment, given that there is a common capital market between the two countries, but it <Col N="1171" /> also affected the opportunities available to industrialists to make investments. This position has been completely reversed and it would be disingenuous of any Deputy to suggest that this is not the case.  The position in relation to interest rates has been completely reversed and our rates are significantly below the UK rates at present.</P>
    <P>I note from today's papers that there is a great deal of bullish speculation in the financial markets in Dublin and that the Central Bank will make an announcement regarding a down turn in interest rates in the near future.  If this is the case, it will happen a little earlier than I and other academic commentators had anticipated. I anticipated that the rates would be reduced later this year but I would certainly welcome an earlier rather than a later cut.  However, the main point is that interest rates are stabilising and we can expect a cut.  Regardless of whether they increase or decrease the point is that our interest rates are considerably lower than they were in 1986.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte also suggested that our rate of inflation also had a bearing in this case.  The present rate of inflation in Ireland is lower than in the United Kingdom and significantly below the 1986 level.  The Deputy was critical of BES funding but the reality is that this funding is still available.  The Minister, through his intervention in the recent budget, has made BES funding far more realistic than it ever was.</P>
    <P>All the factors which existed when Fóir Teoranta were established are gone &mdash; we are now members of the EC; the shake-out has occurred; the demand for Fóir Teoranta's services has collapsed; the industrial environment has changed &mdash; it is far more confident now than at any stage during this decade; companies which historically showed weaknesses have either gone to the wall or have weathered the storm; management has improved &mdash; I agree with the suggestion that our management has a long way to go yet; and the economy in general has <Col N="1172" /> been stabilised because of the steps taken by the Minister.  In spite of all that has been said here, Irish industry is far more buoyant now than it ever was.</P>
    <P>The reality is that Fóir Teoranta has lived its life and served its purpose and it is now time to move on to a different set of arrangements.  That is what the Government are proposing in this Bill.  It is right and proper for the Minister to have taken steps to protect the interests of the staff in Fóir Teoranta.  I am surprised other Members did not refer to this point.  This is a very important element because these people have served the State through a long and difficult period.  As I have said, the Bill is a bit of a <i>non-sequitur</i> but nonetheless it deserves support.</P>

While Deputy Roche gave an historical view of his perspective of the Irish economy and the performance of Fóir Teoranta, he gave a limited commentary on what exactly took place during the eighties.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Rabbitte's contribution.  He said it was difficult to ascertain what kind of loans were given during that period and to which companies they were given.  He said it was with regret that he had to make that point.  I concur with what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a similar situation in the health area and many hospitals were in financial crisis.  It occurred to me at that time that the health boards were run by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle ably corrected him earlier, Deputy Rabbitte was saying that Fóir Teoranta was also being run by a Fianna Fáil board of directors.  I am not saying that Fianna Fáil boards of directors between 1980 and 1982 did not do the thing properly or were not capable of examining fully what was going on.  I would say that I recall being over in the <Col N="1173" /> seat where Deputy Roche is and the present Minister for Finance being down here when certain companies in his own constituency were in difficulty.  He was exorting the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to get Fóir Teoranta to rescue them and he was all on for it and there was plenty of money spent on rescuing companies.</P>

      <P>Mine as well.  Occasionally a company will go to the wall and will need assistance so from that point of view the introduction of this Bill is timely but I would appeal to the Minister not to proceed with it until the Report Stage of the exhaustive Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 is through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall the trauma and distress caused during the eighties by companies closing. There were large sums spent by Fóir Teoranta in trying to rescue the companies and they failed, but at least the State made an effort and all the parties in this House would show a little compassion <Col N="1175" /> when the State was needed to give at least a little aid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche is very critical of the early stages of Fóir Teoranta.  Some of the guidelines that were set for Fóir Teoranta at that time in relation to giving out money were very restrictive.  They would not release one penny if they could possibly avoid it, the guidelines were so severe.  They were so restrictive it was unbelievable.  Then the matter was opened up in 1982.  The present Minister for Finance was the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time.  The guidelines for Fóir Teoranta were expanded considerably then.  If Deputy Roche is decrying the fact that substantial funds were spent during the eighties I can tell him that one of the people who took part in that was Minister Reynolds as Minister for Industry and Commerce because he was most anxious to see these companies rescued.  So were we all.  We all wanted to see employment maintained.  We had different problems in different constituencies. There was the other aspect to what Fóir Teoranta did while it was in existence.  I was very disappointed at the way an able Deputy like Deputy Roche could skid over this thing as if there was not good reason for the decisions that were taken in order to assist companies.</P>
    <P>I am really disappointed that the Minister has proceeded with this Bill.  I have to conclude as well, because the Minister pushed this Bill so often &mdash; four or five times recently &mdash; that there does not seem to be any consultation between the Minister and the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, from that other party.  If there really was co-ordination between him and the Minister here certainly this Fóir Teoranta Bill would not be at the advanced stage it is at now.  It is time the Minister went back and asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is serious about passing the Companies Bill or if he is to continue instructing his officials to put more and more amendments in to <Col N="1176" /> prevent one rescue agency following another.</P>

      <P>This Minister has patience and long-term patience, too.  He is a man with ambition, a good man.  He has prospects. He is an optimist.  He believes in the future.  In this instance he would have a great out if he pursued the Department of Industry and Commerce in the way in which they are dealing particularly with Opposition commentary on Committee Stage of the Companies Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the need to prepare Irish Industry to meet the challenges of the more competitive regime which will apply when the internal market is in place after 1992.  Is that not going to mean tax harmonisation?  Is it not going to mean VAT harmonisation?  Is it not going to mean quite a change in a range of conditions of industrial companies? Is it not going to be the case that we will have problems?  Is the Minister going to leave Irish industry with their hands behind their backs?  Is he saying that there is not to be anywhere companies that need assistance can go?  They will come to the Minister's door to ask what he can do for them and he will tell them to go down the road to the Department of Industry and Commerce and that Minister O'Malley will look after them, that he has a fellow called the examiner but they will find that he is not in place.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Installation of Fire Warning Systems in Houses.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the <Col N="1177" /> Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. My question of 16 May, and my request to the Chair for an Adjournment Debate, arise directly from the tragedy which occurred in my constituency on 7 May last when, at 49 Clifton Drive, Bally-fermot, two young brothers, aged eight and five years, lost their lives in a domestic fire and another brother was rescued from a similar fate.  That appalling tragedy was the most recent in a large number of tragedies arising out of fires in houses, flats, mobile homes and caravans. Indeed, the two deaths in Bally-fermot brought the number of children killed in fires in the last year to 16.</P>
      <P>It is time we did something about this. In the United States, where legislation has resulted in smoke detectors being fitted in four out of five homes, domestic fire deaths have been almost halved.  In Britain a recent report of the National Housing and Town Planning Authority estimates that more than 300 lives would be saved each year by the installation of smoke detectors.  On 16 May I tabled the following question to the Minister for the Environment, &ldquo;... asked the Minister for the Environment whether he will introduce legislation to make it compulsory for local authorities to fit smoke detectors in all public authority houses in order to reduce the intolerably high incidence of deaths resulting from house fires; and if he will make a statement on the matter.&rdquo;  In his reply the Minister referred me to the provisions in the Building Control Act which would enable regulations to be made requiring fire alarms to be provided in new buildings; he should speedily introduce those regulations. He also referred to his advocacy for the installation of smoke detectors and publicity campaigns to highlight their advantage.  I am sure he will say the same thing today in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In advance of the Minister's reply I should like to say that his response on the last occasion was not good enough.  Not <Col N="1178" /> enough people have heeded him; something much more is required if more tragedies are to be avoided.  Those most at risk are not installing alarms and are not being properly targeted by the publicity campaigns.  In Britain it has been estimated that home owners are three times more likely to have a smoke alarm than local authority tenants.  Pensioners and poor families are only half as likely to have a smoke detector installed as the national average.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to think that the position is any better here than it is in Britain.  In all probability the position is worse.  The number of smoke alarms in privately rented accommodation, such as student flats, must be very small indeed. I shudder to think what the position is in mobile homes and caravans, particularly when they are occupied by disadvantaged groups such as travellers.  I hate to think what it is like in the majority of flats where students are accommodated.  My attention has been drawn to a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 May last from Una Hoey.  She stated:</P>
    <P>Sir, &mdash; I am writing to express my concern &mdash; and worry &mdash; about rented accommodation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Two of my sons are sharing a top floor flat in a four-storey building. There is no fire escape, no smoke alarms and no materials for fire prevention on any of the landings.  I wonder how many young people are at risk in similar accommodation.</P>
    <P>I hope that all TDs, the fire service, ministers of religion and any others in positions of authority who read this letter will do something about this dangerous situation. </P>
    <P>I do not find those comments surprising. It is many years since I was a student living in student accommodation and I do not think things have improved all that much since.  When I look back I shudder when I think of the risks that so many of us students took.  Like other Members I have a daughter living in <Col N="1179" /> student accommodation.  The accommodation some of them are living in is so hazardous that we should not sleep at night worrying about them.  Of course, my proposal would extend to student accommodation.</P>
    <P>Legislation requiring smoke detectors in every home is the only effective way to save lives.  What I am proposing in relation to public authority housing, and new housing, is only an initial step which can be introduced quickly.  We should then proceed to ensure that smoke alarms are compulsory for all types of accommodation. If they are not made compulsory experience teaches us they will not be installed.  We already have the highest percentage of domestic fire outbreaks in the developed world, according to Tom McDonald, Chairman of the Chief Fire Officers Association at their recent annual conference.  He went on to say that because of the use of polyurethane foam-based furniture fires develop much more rapidly and produce more heat and toxic gases than they used. In addition to the installation of smoke detectors that problem must also be effectively tackled.  I suspect that that problem is increasing pretty rapidly and that as a result the danger of more tragedies is increasing daily.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give a lead in this matter, particularly in the interest of the young, the old and the less fortunate members of the community who are most at risk and to whom the message of the necessity for smoke detectors is not getting through.  Those people would be afraid of the cost of smoke detectors despite the fact that some of them can be installed for as little as £4.  If the Minister had seen, like I did when I attended the funeral of my two young constituents in Ballyfermot, the agony and suffering on the faces of the parents he would not hesitate for one moment to do anything which would help prevent such tragedies. I appeal to him to take this action, which would be relatively easy to do.  It is not a costly operation which would strain the <Col N="1180" /> finances of the Government.  I urge the Minister to give a lead in this matter to the local authorities, house builders and the community at large.  That lead would be much more effective than any publicity campaign he would organise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to Deputy Currie's contribution and I should like to assure him, and all Members, that the question of encouraging the use of smoke detectors in the home has been receiving constant attention in my Department in recent times.  The Department's examination of the value of smoke detectors has led to the conclusion that they provide an early warning of fire and are an aid to saving lives.</P>
      <P>I should like to see a smoke detector installed in every house and we have stated this publicly in the past.  However, we are convinced that the approach should be voluntary.  People who instal a smoke alarm of their own free will are likely to be far more conscious of the need for safety than those who instal it only because they are forced to do so.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, instead of following the path of legislation, we propose to continue the policy of advocating the use of smoke detectors in homes.  Considerable publicity has been given in recent times to the value of smoke detectors.  We publicly advocated their use in launching national fire safety weeks and the National Safety Council are engaged in ongoing media advertising stressing the value of smoke alarms.  This campaign will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management and upkeep of dwellings are matters for the housing authorities. Last December the Department issued a circular letter reminding them of the need for adequate fire safety precautions. The importance of smoke detector alarms was emphasised and local authorities were requested to take steps to encourage tenants to instal such devices and to keep them in good working <Col N="1181" /> order.  It is necessary for tenants and householders to ensure that smoke alarms are kept in good working order and if batteries run down they should be replaced.  In addition, local authorities were requested to advise all their tenants in regard to fire precaution measures applicable to the type of dwelling occupied. A separate circular letter was issued to local authorities containing guidelines relating to demountable dwellings and advising that suitable smoke detectors should be provided.</P>
    <P>The Building Control Act, 1990, contains provisions which enable regulations to be made on a wide range of issues, including the provision of fire alarms in new buildings.  The approach to be taken in regard to the installation of fire alarms in new buildings will receive consideration and I assure the House that I am fully committed to reducing &mdash; and if possible eliminating &mdash; deaths from domestic fires.  Progress in this regard will be made by continuing the practice of affording publicity as often as possible to the value of smoke detectors and encouraging local authorities to emphasise the value of smoke detectors to their tenants.</P>
    <P>I am extremely anxious to be as helpful as I can in this respect.  I will do everything I can but goodwill all round is needed.  Under the 1990 building regulations perhaps we will be able to do something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tallaght, Dublin, New Hospital.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important issue.  I have been trying for weeks to raise this matter for a number of reasons. The new hospital planned for the Tallaght region is a major decision for that area. It is desperately badly needed and any controversy which would cause delay or cause it to be born in conditions of rancour or dissent would indeed be most regrettable.</P>
      <P>In Limerick, a city with a population of less than the Tallaght region, a Government almost fell on the issue of the retention of three hospitals.  The new hospital is designed to serve a region much wider than Tallaght and, therefore, it is important that the controversy which has gathered momentum in recent days and weeks is not allowed to develop. There is a responsibility on the Minister for Health to intervene and to ensure that that controversy is nipped in the bud.</P>
      <P>The issue of the preservation of what has been described as the unique ethos of the Adelaide Hospital is not just a question of the rights of religious minorities, although these are clearly involved, it is about the respect for all minorities and the extent to which society is prepared to accept the rights of different traditions and the need to develop a pluralist society.  It is important to state that nobody is coming into the House to support the imposition of the ethics of any particular church on any hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Protestant ethos is quite different and distinct from the question of ethics. The Protestant ethic is not imposed on <Col N="1183" /> the people who avail of the high quality of service in the Adelaide Hospital.  That hospital has always respected the pluralist tradition in our society and it is not merely a question that the Protestant community would want some alternative in hospital care to that provided by the Roman Catholic ethos.  However, a great number of people &mdash; Catholics as well as Protestants and dissenters &mdash; would wish to avail of an alternative to the Roman Catholic ethos and to avoid a situation where a faceless ethics committee are interposed between the doctor/patient relationship.  These people do not want an ethical committee which will make decisions overriding that of the doctor and the views of the patient.</P>
    <P>The tradition of the Adelaide Hospital is liberal and pluralist, meaning that the Church of Ireland were very reluctant to interfere in the private relationship between a medical practitioner and an individual.  They felt, for example, that delicate private issues relating to sex should be dealt with, in all conscience, privately between the practitioner and the person concerned.  The Protestant ethos &mdash; unlike the Roman Catholic one &mdash; is to interfere as little as possible with the individual and medical advisers.</P>
    <P>The key point I want to make is &mdash; and I repeat &mdash; that this is not just a Protestant concern.  Very many Roman Catholics would be deeply concerned that if they got in some ethical committee, the members of which they had mostly never heard of, such a committee could override a doctor's opinion on their treatment no matter how legal it was because of some religious doctrine or other.</P>
    <P>Some of the procedures most popularly referred to and which are provided in the case of the Adelaide Hospital relate to male and female sterilisation.  The fact is that this is a perfectly legal procedure but it is not available to patients in many other hospitals because of the overriding requirements of the rules of those hospitals where it is laid down &mdash; very explicitly in the case of some of them &mdash;<Col N="1184" /> that no procedure may be carried out that is contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church.  I might refer to the statement by the Chairman of the Adelaide Hospital Board, Dr. McConnell, that all medical practice which is lawful will be available in the new hospital in Tallaght.  He went on to say that, in the Adelaide Hospital, no doctor or nurse is obliged to participate in something to which he or she has moral objections but staff cannot stop any lawful medical practice, as has happened in other hospitals.</P>
    <P>I suggest this is an issue that goes to the heart of what kind of society we want. These are circumstances in which generosity is required on the part of the Government &mdash; to acknowledge that this issue goes beyond the mere question of providing a hospital to questions concerning religious minorities, other minorities, and indeed is being carefully watched in Northern Ireland for reasons I need not go into.  It would be regrettable if we allowed this controversy to develop. We saw the unfortunate intervention by the Bishop of Limerick, Dr. Newman, which served only to distort and inflame the issue.  I would not like to see this continuing, nor I am sure, would the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Church of Ireland Bishops are on record as acknowledging the generous response of the Taoiseach when he received them on more than one occasion.  Yet a question is raised by the fact that the board appear to be experiencing great difficulty in having translated into action on the part of the Department of Health the views expressed in private to them by the Taoiseach. I would like to ask the Minister for Health: why is that the case? In addition, I should like to ask the Minister for Health: why did he appear to put financial pressure on the hospital in 1989 when he refused to allocate a budget until the middle of the year while, at the same time, giving verbal assurances that their traditions would be respected in the new hospital?</P>
    <P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will rest my case at that and ask the Minister to intervene in this debate.  I would ask him: is it not appropriate &mdash; having regard to all of the political circumstances prevailing on this island &mdash; that he invite the board of the Adelaide Hospital to play a leading role in the development of the long awaited new hospital at Tallaght?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>This has been an ongoing issue for the last ten years, not one which has just occurred, but it is crystallising at this point.  It is an issue of serious concern to many of my constituents.  Successive Ministers have given, and the present Minister continued, the guarantee with regard to nursing and the nursing tradition of the Adelaide Hospital.  I welcome that.  But the fear that now exists within the Protestant community is that their traditions, ethos and medical practices must be defended.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the Adelaide Hospital has a very special place in the lives and minds of the Protestant community. My Protestant constituents are most concerned that its unique ethos be preserved.</P>
      <P>I do realise that the Minister has to accommodate the three hospitals within the new Tallaght hospital - the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospitals.  I have already privately welcomed the Minister's guarantee on the nursing tradition and would greatly welcome from him a strong, firm and positive statement regarding the continuation of the Protestant ethos within the new hospital to be created in Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish I had more time but I feel I am summarising a point of view very <Col N="1186" /> sincerely held by many Members on this side, as on all other sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the question of the future role of the Adelaide Hospital in the management of the new hospital in Tallaght because there has been a lot of misinformation, misunderstanding and misrepresentation on the issue.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Roche has said, what is happening is ongoing and had begun long before I became Minister.  For example, as far back as 1968 the Fitzgerald report outlined the future of the hospitals for Dublin.  In their report they recommended six hospitals, three on the north side, three on the south side, one of the latter to be the Tallaght Hospital.  Of course, the rationalisation process has been taking place under successive Governments because they felt it was in the interests of the people of the city that that should be the case.</P>
      <P>An integral part of the original plan was that the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospitals would form the nucleus of the new hospital at Tallaght.  These hospitals &mdash; known as the MANCH group &mdash; have been closely associated since the move to Tallaght was first mooted.  For example, all the consultants hold contracts with the one authority, the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals.  That was done to facilitate the transfer of consultant staff to Tallaght.</P>
      <P>The Tallaght Hospital Board was established in 1980.  The board are responsible for the planning and building of the new hospital and are representative of the three hospitals which will be moving to Tallaght.  The Adelaide Hospital, through their representatives on the board and on the various project groups, has made a major contribution to the planning of the new hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to avail of this opportunity not only to place on the record of the House my appreciation and that of the Government of the very distinctive and <Col N="1187" /> valuable contribution of the Adelaide Hospital to Irish medicine but also to reiterate my commitment to ensuring that, whatever arrangements are put in place will protect the traditions of the Adelaide Hospital.  The Adelaide, as an independent voluntary hospital, has a long and distinguished tradition of service to the people of Dublin.  The hospital has played a major role in the lives of Dublin people for 150 years, indeed not just the people of Dublin but those all around the country.  The Government respect and value the tradition of the Adelaide Hospital and are committed to ensuring its continuance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already assured Protestant Church leaders, whom he met in September last, that he is very anxious to have arrangements agreed for the management of the new hospital at Tallaght which will enable the Adelaide and its ethos to continue to be an integral part of the public hospital system.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, on many occasions, I have stated publicly my respect for the independence and traditions of all the voluntary hospitals. Contrary to what Deputies may have read in newspapers, I should say I am acutely aware and particularly sensitive to the concerns of the Adelaide in relation to the preservation of their tradition in Irish medicine.  I fully understand their concern and wish to respond to it in a very positive way.  Successive Ministers for Health have acknowledged these concerns.  For example, in 1984 one of my predecessors guaranteed that 40 places would be retained for trainee nurses of the Adelaide tradition.  I have stated publicly on many occasions that that commitment will be honoured.</P>
    <P>Of course, the other hospitals moving to Tallaght &mdash; the Meath and National Children's Hospital &mdash; also have a great tradition in Irish medicine.  The challenge facing us is to make arrangements for the management of the new Tallaght Hospital, ensuring that the rich, valuable tradition of the three hospitals is not lost but <Col N="1188" /> rather nurtured and cherished under a unified management.</P>
    <P>At this stage the Taoiseach's preference and mine is for the establishment of a health corporate body under the provisions of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961 to manage the new hospital which would allow for appropriate representation of each of the three hospitals as well as of the Eastern Health Board.  I might add that that arrangement works very well in St. James's and Beaumont Hospitals.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Seanad earlier this afternoon, I am happy to discuss the future with the three hospitals and endeavour to reach agreement with them on future management.  I might add that any proposal emanating from the three hospitals will receive my sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>The other important point I want to stress is that concern has been expressed that certain medical procedures now practised at the Adelaide Hospital would not be available in the new hospital in Tallaght.  That is not so.  I want to give the House my categoric assurance on this point.  In the ongoing discussions I will consider with the hospital the most appropriate way to allay any fears held in this regard.  I am prepared to discuss with them how that can be demonstrated in whatever manner is deemed necessary. If legislation is necessary, so be it; we will introduce it.</P>
    <P>My priority is to ensure a first-class acute hospital service in Tallaght for the people of Dublin.  I want to see the Adelaide tradition maintained at Tallaght and also to accommodate the tradition of the other two hospitals moving to Tallaght.</P>

I am having ongoing discussions with the <Col N="1189" /> hospital on a variety of issues, including their funding; indeed their funding in comparison with that of the other voluntary hospitals in this city and State, has been much higher over the past three years, if the Deputy cares to look at it.  I referred at some length to that matter in the Seanad.  Unfortunately time constrains me here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat that nobody is being <Col N="1190" /> coerced.  The three hospitals have been working together for the past ten years preparing for their expected move to Tallaght. I am anxious to continue my discussions on the management of the new hospital with them and hope to meet each of the three of them again in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Section 12 of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977 requires the Minister to present to the Oireachtas proposals for the revision of the European constituencies within the period of 12 years from the enactment of that statute and at least once in every 12 years thereafter.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that representatives to the Parliament were elected for the existing constituencies for a period of five years from June 1989 and that, in the normal course, a census of population is due to be taken in 1991, it has been decided to propose an amendment to section 12 which will require a revision of European constituencies to be carried out after the next census and before the next European elections.  The proposal will be contained in an Electoral Bill which I hope to introduce shortly.</P>

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 31 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>During a visit to Galway last week, I noted the condition of a number of regional and county roads in the Connemara area.  In addition, my Department is aware of the condition of these roads generally from the results of assessments and surveys carried out by local authorities and from the ongoing work of the roads inspectorate of the Department.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for undertaking any works on the network of non-national roads, including the provision of the necessary finance, is primarily a matter for local authorities.  County councils may use the discretionary grants for non-national roads paid by my Department to supplement expenditure from their own resources on regional and county roads. The discretionary block grants, apart from those for Dublin County Council, have been allocated strictly in proportion to the mileage of regional and county roads in each county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1990 State road grants to Galway County Council amount to £9,481,000, an increase of 23 per cent on 1989.  The provision comprises £4,056,000 for national roads and £5,425,000 for regional and county roads.  It includes discretionary block grants amounting to £4,097,000, a supplementary discretionary grant of £500,000 for improvements to regional and county roads in recognition of the special needs of the county, and discretionary grants totalling £464,000 in respect of flood/storm damage.  Altogether, the 1990 discretionary grants represent an increase of 53 per cent on the level of equivalent grants to the authority for 1989.  I am satisfied that Galway County Council has <Col N="1133" /> received its fair share of the funds available to me for road grants in 1990.  The selection of works to be done in particular areas is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    <P>The 1990 Exchequer provisions for road grants have been fully allocated and there are no funds at my disposal from which additional allocations could be made at this time.  I will, of course, bear the needs of County Galway in mind when determining the road grant allocations for future years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the very high number of fish kills in the summer of 1987, an ongoing programme has been in place to eliminate such incidents.  Although a total of 111 kills occurred last year, a major cause was deoxygenation and low water levels in rivers due to the fine weather and high temperatures.  The proportion caused by agriculture was at its lowest ever, at approximately one-fifth of all kills.</P>
      <P>Last year's experience serves only to reinforce the importance of pursuing the implementation of a comprehensive programme of measures to tackle all sources of pollution.</P>
      <P>The emphasis already placed on education about pollution risks and appropriate safeguards, and the part played by official agencies and farming organisations in promoting awareness, have resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of fish kills due to agricultural sources.  The grants now available for the provision of pollution control facilities on farms should contribute to a further reduction in the number of pollution incidents from such sources.  The continuing emphasis in the sanitary services programme, including the small schemes programme, on schemes designed to eliminate pollution blackspots will also have significant beneficial effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have issued a further circular to all local authorities, reminding them of the high number of fish kills last year and asking them to review and intensify their efforts during 1990 to eliminate all potential pollution sources.  The circular specifically requested each local authority to identify the fish kills which occurred in its area in 1989 and to take account of them when deciding on farm surveys, reviewing effluent discharge licences, or assessing the adequacy of the authority's own sewage and water treatment facilities.  The circular requested local authorities to continue farm surveys especially in high risk areas, and reminded them of the need for follow up action on farms found to be of high or <Col N="1139" /> medium pollution risk in earlier surveys. In addition, it drew attention to the need to review effluent discharge licences regularly and, generally, to ensure that the Water Pollution Act, 1977, is vigorously implemented.</P>
    <P>The main element of the programme to control pollution which remains to be put in place is the enactment of legislation amending the 1977 Act so as to strengthen the powers available to local authorities to prevent and deal with water pollution.  The amending legislation will also provide for substantially increased penalties for water pollution offences, civil liability for pollution damage, and remedial measures at the polluters expense.</P>
    <P>The Bill has already passed all Stages in the Seanad and is now at Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>The level of child road deaths in this country has to be viewed against the proportion of children in the total population. For example, while child deaths in this country in 1987 represented 9.7 per cent of all road deaths as against 8.2 per cent in the UK, children under 14 years comprise 28 per cent of the Irish population as against a comparable figure of some 20 per cent for the UK.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the standard of Irish road signposting is adequate for the needs of road users generally.</P>
      <P>A programme for the provision of adequate directional signposting on national roads funded by my Department has been under way since 1977 and is now essentially complete.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were asked to undertake a similar programme in 1987 in respect of non-national roads.  The funding of this programme would be a matter for the local authorities themselves although they may, at their discretion, meet such costs from discretionary grants for non-national roads provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>A further programme is now being implemented in co-operation with Bord Fáilte and local authorities to upgrade signposting on non-national roads in areas of high tourist amenity.  Special grants totalling £75,000 have been allocated to three local authorities, to support this programme, by my Department in 1990.  This programme has been running since 1987.</P>

      <P>The general position is that payments made by employers to employees in respect of travelling expenses, or any other expenses, incurred in performing the duties of their employment are chargeable to tax.  The employee may claim a deduction for tax purposes for expenses actually incurred. In practice, an employer may by arrangement with the inspector of taxes be allowed to pay certain amounts in respect of such expenses without deduction of tax.  For example, under an agreement made between the Revenue Commissioners and the Construction Industry Federation, payments to workers sent to work away from home base are payable free of tax if they conform to the agreement. This is in line with the practice adopted in the case of expenses payments to public servants and other employees.</P>
      <P>I am informed that there are certain payments made to construction workers specifically in respect of travel between home and their place of work.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that such payments are taxable.  They are also taxable in the hands of other workers, including the small minority of public servants in receipt of them.</P>

      <P>Following various representations, my Department applied under the European Regional Development Fund for assistance towards the cost of constructing a dam to restore Glenbower Lake and associated amenities at Glenbower Wood, Killeagh, County Cork. However, despite my Department's continuous efforts in 1989, this particular project was not given a sufficiently high priority by the European Commission to guarantee its acceptance for funding. Other possibilities for obtaining funds for the project are being explored in consultation with Coillte Teoranta who own the property.</P>

      <P>The normal source of road grant funding for footpaths on national primary routes is the annual road grant allocation for ordinary maintenance works on these routes.  The 1990 allocation under this heading to Kildare County Council is £390,000.  The development of the programme of works on foot of this allocation is a matter for the local authority. It would be open to the authority to include the works referred to in this year's programme or in future years' programmes for national primary road maintenance.</P>

    <P>In July 1989 my Department received an application for grant aid from the chairperson of the board of management of Scoil Bhríde, Ranelagh, towards the cost of works he wishes to have carried out at the school.  My Department's architect has inspected the school and his report has been considered.  The whole question of what works should be grant-aided is being considered in the context of the available capital and the fact that a number of classrooms in the school are not now in use.  My Department propose to meet the school authorities at an early <Col N="1157" /> date to discuss the matter.  I will communicate with the Deputies when there have been developments in this regard.</P>
