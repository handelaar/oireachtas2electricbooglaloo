      <P>Information of the type requested by the Deputy comes from the labour force survey.  The labour force survey is a large sample household survey taken on an annual basis in April-May each year by the Central Statistics Office.  It covers about 45,000 private households with 150,000 persons.</P>
      <P>Respondents are asked to indicate their employment situation in the week preceding the interview.  Those who say that they worked for at least one hour for payment or profit, including work on the family farm or business, are asked to indicate whether the job was full-time or part-time and to specify the number of hours usually worked per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> It is estimated that there were 82,200 persons with such part-time jobs in April-May 1989, the latest period for which figures are available.  An estimated 30,500 of these usually worked less than 18 hours per week; 34,600 worked 18 but less than 30 hours per week and 7,400 worked at least 30 hours per week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Minister, in the light of the jobs already enumerated in the census, of the need to ensure the protection of part-time workers and an improvement of their conditions.  Will the Minister agree the hidden number of part-time jobs would contribute greatly to the revenue?  Is there legislation to protect those workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The promised legislation dealing with part-time workers will be in the House very shortly.  Indeed, it is expected to be published before the Christmas recess.  The figures I have given to the House are based on the labour force survey of 1989.  The labour force survey figures of April-May 1990 will be available during next year.  The figures published in October last were taken from that survey but details relating to the number of part-time workers were not available at that stage.  The information will be available next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>During the eighties it became apparent that improvements in Irish management could make a contribution to economic and employment growth.  Against this background, I appointed in July 1987, an Advisory Committee on Management Training. The major finding of the committee, which reported in January 1989, was that the level of commitment to management development by Irish firms was low, given the economic challenges that face the country.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that there are indications that the level of management development carried out by Irish firms has increased in recent times.  I would also like to say that the European Commission have agreed in principle to making a sizeable financial contribution to a programme aimed at showing the importance of management development to managers of small and medium sized enterprises.  The programme will be overseen by the IMI and will be called &ldquo;The Year of the Manager&rdquo;.  In addition to funding from the Commission, the programme will be funded by contributions from the IMI, my Department and the participant's fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the advisory committee also noted that the primary responsibility for management development lies with the chief executives of public and private organisations.  The committee recommended that State intervention in the form of funding should be switched from providers to users and should be targeted <Col N="1744" /> at small businesses.  This is being done. State development agencies are also encouraging management development in their respective sectors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 11, 16, 20 and 29 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on a programme for economic and social development <Col N="1745" /> between the Government and the social partners are at present under way.  The aim of these negotiations is to produce an agreement which will ensure a continuation of the consensus based approach to the formulation of social and economic strategies which was so successful under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  A new agreement would enable us to build on the achievements of the programme and ensure the attainment of further social and economic progress.</P>
    <P>Meetings have been held with employers, trade unions, farmers and youth organisations and further meetings are planned.  Discussions are broad ranging covering such issues as taxation, job creation, health, education, social welfare and pay and conditions of employment. Under pay and conditions, wage increases and public holidays are among a number of items listed for consideration.</P>
    <P>In the context of ongoing discussions, it would not be appropriate for me to speculate at this stage as to what the outcome of the discussions might be or the form of any eventual agreement.</P>
    <P>It is clear that any agreement will have provisions setting down macro-economic targets as well as covering employment, taxation and social services.  The issues are well documented and discussed in detail in a recently published NESC Report.  There will also be an agreement or agreements on pay and conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the current <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have been very substantial indeed, particularly in terms of macro-economic targets, taxation, employment, pay and social welfare benefits.  I am on record as supporting a continuation of that approach and I believe this is now all the more critical in view of a worsening external environment in terms of the recession in the UK, the US economy, GATT, the competition for investment from Eastern Europe, the onset of the harmonisation of indirect taxation in the European Community and full economic and monetary union, not to speak of the crisis in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that as in the case of <Col N="1746" /> the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> an agreement will result from the present talks which will contain elements which satisfy all the parties involved, while at the same time contributing to the national interest and continuing economic and social progress.  It is clear that the future lies in rejecting conflict in favour of co-operation and consensus.  It would be unfortunate to find that after several decades of attempts to achieve real economic and social progress we had not learned that lesson.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister really serious in saying that the present programme has been successful in regard to job creation?  It is now generally recognised it was a dismal failure in this area. Any achievements were made on the backs of those who could be categorised as the weaker sections in the community. Indeed, people are still waiting for hospital beds.  In the coming programme, will measures be taken to take these things into account, particularly job creation and health, which were completely ignored in the current programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  I accept that, in the early part of the last programme, job creation was not very successful and this also happened in other countries, particularly over the last 18 months.  There has been substantial growth in the economy but that does not take away from the fact that there are over 200,000 people unemployed.  The basis for discussions on the present programme is being broken down into four areas &mdash; tax reform, social services, job creation and pay and conditions. Job creation will have to be a substantial part of a new programme and &mdash; as was attempted in the last programme &mdash; it will be done on the basis of trying to identify the sectors and the means by which jobs can be created. Looking back over the three year programme it is clear that there will not be a growth in jobs to the same level as productivity growth but they are complementary, which has been pointed out by <Col N="1747" /> surveys done in the EC and the OECD.  I hope this will continue and form a major part of any new agreement.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister inform the House if he intends to take into account the proposals of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors? They submitted a document to every Member of the House pointing out that a basic income is the first item on the agenda as far as they are concerned.  They also asked for major tax reform, a concerted job creation programme, an integrated approach to tackling rural poverty and a coherent approach to tackling emigration.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>the reason Conway House Hostel in Kilburn, London, never received grant aid from the DION Committee, despite the fact that it provides a vital service to many young Irish emigrants.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Government assistance to voluntary organisations in Britain catering for the welfare needs of Irish emigrants is distributed on the advice of DÍON &mdash; the Advisory Committee on Emigrant Welfare Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>DION's current priorities are: front line information and advice services for emigrants; outreach services for unemployed youths, women and children in <Col N="1749" /> temporary accommodation, and travellers; special projects to assist the unemployed to find secure employment; and day care centres for the elderly.</P>
    <P>DÍON's approach to the funding of hostels, such as Conway House, is that the cost of supporting either the capital or current costs of hostels would be prohibitive. DÍON take the view that direct access provision for the single homeless is primarily the responsibility of the UK local statutory housing authorities.</P>
    <P>Irish Centre Hostels Limited, the parent body of Conway House, submitted an application for funding the overhead charge for the appointment of additional staff and support services to provide a job-finding facility for residents in the hostel.  The application was considered by DÍON but was not successful because DÍON grants are directed at establishing a co-ordinated network of employment referral contacts among Irish agencies and the UK Employment Services rather than supporting the setting up of individual facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Conway House is the largest youth hostel for Irish immigrants in London and also caters for 16 Irish adults, will the Minister have their application considered seriously in view of the fact that they provide advice and information for many of the residents who come to them?  This weekend four people from Mullingar arrived at the house with only £30 and no job.  They provide advice services, they give direction on employment and it is fair to say that they have been discriminated against by the DÍON Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister make a special case on their behalf in this regard or at least request the DÍON Committee to consider their proposal more sympathetically this year than in previous years in view of the work they are doing for so many young Irish immigrants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am familiar with the <Col N="1750" /> work of Conway House and I agree with Deputy Deenihan that they do a good job.  From what DÍON told me &mdash; not in relation to this question but generally &mdash; I understand that a number of organisations are endeavouring to provide this type of job resource centre for the people in their areas.  There is an organisation called &ldquo;Safe Start&rdquo; which is a foundation to establish links with the various groups and organisations in existence.  They have received funding from DÍON for a number of years.  Rather than having individual centres duplicating jobs, DÍON want to co-ordinate the work. However, I will put forward the Deputy's views to the people in Conway House with whom I am familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the DÍON Committee co-ordinating services, is the Minister satisfied that the committee have focused enough on the needs of young women emigrants, particularly pregnant women?  It has been put to me that we need far more resources and emphasis on this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a point. In recent weeks there have been discussions between the DÍON Committee and primarily one of the Catholic welfare organisations that has been involved with young pregnant Irish women.  A question for later on today names one organisation which has applied to DÍON.  DÍON are trying to deal with this problem across all the Irish centres, rather than dealing with one organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding to DÍON has grown, although it is not enough to meet all the demands on them.  The people involved in the committee have been there for five or six years now and they have a lot of expertise.  They work closely with the federation of Irish societies and the chaplaincy services.  A great number of organisations are now appearing, knowing that there is statutory funding from this country, and that is creating difficulties. It is nice that the DÍON Committee can give out some money, but they are trying to get the best value for that money.  They are experienced and are trying to work <Col N="1751" /> across all the agencies and do not want to be seen to be catering for an individual organisation.  They are looking at the problem mentioned by Deputy Barnes.</P>

      <P>The question refers to Conway House Hostel and to the young people there.  The Minister in his reply seemed to accept that enough was being done for the youth and did not refer to the fact that one-third of the people who call to Conway House are under 17 years of age and have no statutory entitlement at all under British law.  Will the Minister now put more emphasis on this fact?  Last year's report showed that 151 out of 459 people interviewed were under 16 or 17 years of age.  Surely the Minister should be alarmed at these statistics.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is wrong in his implication that I do not see any problems.  In relation to the emigration of 16 and 17 year olds, during Question Time we on this side of the House, and through the educational system through FÁS, have tried to discourage young <Col N="1752" /> people from emigrating.  There has been a substantial decrease in the numbers of young people emigrating, including Conway House.  For those already there, DÍON are trying to give welfare, counselling and Outreach services to assist them and link them into the statutory employment groups there so as to help them to get work.</P>

      <P>In view of the great work undertaken by the Conway House Hostel which is especially beneficial to Irish emigrants, could not the Minister or the Government recommend that this hostel be included for a grant from the DÍON Committee, especially as the hostel meets the criterion mentioned by the Minister in relation to catering for temporary accommodation for emigrants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy asked that.  The one thing that neither my predecessor nor I have done is to unduly influence the DÍON Committee.  If I were to respond in this way to all the personal representations from organisations throughout the UK and elsewhere I would have spent all the money that DÍON have.  Since the foundation of DÍON they have assessed applications themselves.  That is the more appropriate way to proceed.  If I were to decide for them it would create difficulties.  They consult with the various Irish organisations and the federations.  They are only disposing of £500,000 and it is more appropriate that they proceed by making their own assessments than on foot of influence from me.</P>

      <P>I certainly would. Deputy Quinn did a lot of the work on this committee earlier on, and I acknowledge that.  The DÍON Committee are a voluntary committee.  They spend several nights a week meeting organisations and four or five times a year at weekends they come to different parts of Ireland to meet organisations.  I would defend the organisation in that they do tremendous work. There is only one home-based member on the committee and that individual, a trade union leader, spends a great deal of time during the weekends in London and in Manchester.  I can arrange such briefings, but it might not be very easy and the briefings would have to be during weekends.  They do such work and I have left them a place for that reason for a number of years.  They are inundated with requests for the money they have.</P>

      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply that he accepts that the equality legislation is now outdated, defective and inadequate to meet the needs, and that very little has been achieved over the lifetime of the legislation since 1974?  Does the Minister accept that since it is a fact that low pay tends to be concentrated in all female employments, the provision in existing legislation requiring a male comparator makes nonsense of that legislation and is that one specific provision he will deal with in the new legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is unfair having regard to all the work that has been done under this legislation.  The Deputy's adjectives are over-strong as a lot of good work has been done since 1974 and still is being done.  At the same time I acknowledge, as I did some months back, that the Act can be improved.  It will be updated on the basis of experience in the courts and elsewhere, of employment equality officers, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others, since its enactment.  Let me say for the information of the House that it was felt, following discussions with the social partners, the Labour Court and equality officers that it would make more sense to bring the two Acts, the 1974 Act and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, together.  I hope the proposals we are <Col N="1755" /> now working on will lead to the bringing forward of one single updated Act.  Finally, I agree with the last point made by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The annual totals of proposed redundancies notified to my Department under the Redundancy Payments Acts for the years 1985 to 1990 were: 1985, 22,531; 1986, 22,790; 1987, 24,090; 1988, 23,037; 1989, 13,395; and for the first ten months of 1990, 11,488. The breakdown requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.  The figures available relate to all cases of redundancies covered by the Redundancy Payments Acts but do not differentiate between cases in which the employees concerned have voluntarily accepted redundancy payments agreements and other cases in whcih such agreements have not been reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain why it is not possible to give a breakdown of the figures?  At present a number of profitable firms are making <Col N="1758" /> people redundant.  It is now being used as a device to shed staff rather than as a device to make a company more competitive. Even though profits are increasing the number of jobs is reducing all the time.  Therefore there is a need to differentiate between the two.  Will the Minister give the House an assurance that this could be done?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so because the Acts do not differentiate between voluntary and compulsory redundancies.  We presume that people are made redundant for a reason and they are entitled to their benefits.  The benefits under the Acts are not set at any specific levels to induce people to take redundancy despite what may happen under different agreements.  The redundancy Acts do not contain any special provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not concede or agree that we have a very inadequate statistical base to enable us understand what is happening in the labour market particularly in relation to redundancies?  Furthermore, having regard to the high levels of unemployment, notwithstanding other positive factors in the economy, does he propose to introduce in his Department any mechanisms which would enable him to get the statistical qualitative data that Deputy O'Sullivan sought in his first question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to compulsory and voluntary redundancies, people claim their entitlements from the social insurance fund when made redundant. I presume that the rates in relation <Col N="1759" /> to voluntary or statutory redundancy are not too attractive and I would not presuppose for one second that people are acting in cahoots with each other &mdash; if this is the implication &mdash; and wish to be made redundant compulsorily.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for debate.  While I do not think debates are allowed at Question Time, I do not agree with the Deputy.  I presume the people who fill in their forms for redundancy entitlements have been made redundant against their wishes or that the redundancy may be linked to the introduction of technology or rationalisation.  I do not think that is the breakdown required.  I would consider the question if it was easy to break down the figures but I do not think that is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason Ireland has not ratified ILO Convention 13 of 1921 is that the existing legislative provisions in force provide more comprehensive protection than is provided in the Convention, which is narrowly based and is now out-dated.  The Convention relates only to the protection of workers from exposure to two compounds of lead, while the provisions contained in current <Col N="1760" /> legislation, notably the general requirements of the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the detailed regulations giving effect to the EC Directive on lead, and a range of separate regulations under the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980, protect workers against all compounds of lead.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Health and Safety Authority that the existing legislative provisions, both EC and national, provide adequate protection for all workers exposed to lead at work, and that ratification of the 1921 Convention would have no positive benefit in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because it enables me to dispel any confusion that exists.  I have had a continuing interest in the matter and the House will be aware of the initiative which I undertook during the Irish Presidency to bring out more clearly in all countries of the European Community the responsibilities of all the parties in this degrading form of victimisation.  My policy on this issue is abundantly clear and I believe so is the law.</P>
      <P>Under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, if a Labour Court order making an award to a victim of sexual harassment is not complied with within two months, the employer is guilty of an offence.  I am advised that where an employer fails to comply with a Labour Court order the person in whose favour the order is made can complain to the gardaí who can have a prosecution initiated through the Director of Public Prosecution's office.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, if the complainant makes a complaint to the Minister for Labour the case can be referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office for the initiation of the necessary proceedings. This last is the option which I favour and is the option which is most easily available to an aggrieved party.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that procedures need to be changed to ensure payment of awards but I believe that it is important &mdash; and I have communicated this to the Chairman of the Labour Court &mdash;that it should be generally known that the Minister for Labour will initiate proceedings on behalf of a person to whom an award in a sexual harassment case has not been paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that women workers are the main victims of this kind of degrading victimisation.  It does take a courageous resolve on behalf of women workers in that situation to take an action in the first place because the details can be quite harrowing.  While I accept that an employer may be guilty of an offence, to require a woman who may well and usually has lost her job to initiate a prosecution is unrealistic.  There ought to be <Col N="1762" /> a more easily accessible mechanism to cause a reward in such a case to be implemented.  Is the Minister saying that the Chief State Solicitor's office will, in all cases, prosecute employers on behalf of victims who have had awards made to them by the Labour Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the first part of the Deputy's statement, that the individual would have to initiate the case either to get a Labour Court determination or an order.  In the case of the termination of working they can then proceed to get an order.  If they were to go through the Director of Public Prosecution's office that could be difficult and involve more legal aspects.  This has received some airing recently.  The practice I have been following for some time is that if a complainant makes a complaint to the Minister for Labour the case can be referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office for the initiation of the necessary proceedings.  That is an easier and more effective way for the individual to proceed. My experience has been that I did not have to trouble the Chief State Solicitor's office for too long because the case has been normally resolved.  In the event of the case not being resolved the procedure we would follow would be through the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister for Labour on his work and initiatives in this area.  They have been integrated into European guidelines.  I welcome, as I am sure does Deputy Rabbitte, the fact that the Minister for Labour can initiate the proceedings on behalf of the victim.  May I ask the Minister if that is widely known and whether any costs involved will be carried by the Minister or his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the costs are carried by the Department because it would be an action I would be initiating as Minister on behalf of the individual on the basis that an order of the court, or a determination of the court, has been ignored by the person on whom it was <Col N="1763" /> served.  I thank Deputy De Rossa for raising the question and Deputies Barnes and Rabbitte for their interest in this issue.  The position is not as well known as it should be and I am using this occasion to reiterate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to re-assure the House that I fully share the Deputy's concern that part-time workers should be protected under labour law.  This is a view which I have held for some time but as there were conflicting opinions between the social partners as to how this matter should be addressed I engaged in a lengthy process of consultation so as to bring the divergent views of the Federation of Irish Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions closer on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this during the earlier part of this year it became clear that developments at Community level will have an impact on the status of part-time workers under labour and social welfare law.  These developments are taking the form of a series of proposed directives published during the summer and autumn in fulfilment of a work programme which I agreed with the European Commission during the Irish Presidency.  However, as these proposed directives are still at a relatively early stage and are the subject <Col N="1764" /> of ongoing discussions within the social questions group of the Council, I have decided that it is necessary to proceed independently with our own proposals while continuing to be mindful of the emerging position at Community level.</P>
    <P>In the context of this overall position, I got approval some months ago to prepare a Bill to protect regular part-time workers.  The Bill, which is currently being drafted as a matter of priority, will extend the scope of current labour legislation regarding minimum notice, holidays, maternity leave, redress for unfair dismissal, workers' participation and redundancy and insolvency protection to most of the regular part-time employees who are not covered at present.</P>
    <P>As I am hopeful that I will be in a position to introduce the Bill to this House before the end of the present session I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot elaborate further on its contents at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to introduce the Bill in this session.  It is something my party have been concerned with for some time. Having regard to the strictures which the Minister places on me in terms of supplementaries may I ask him, having regard to the Bill which The Workers' Party introduced in the House, will we be grossly dissatisfied with the Minister's labours when the Bill is introduced?</P>

      <P>In his reply to Deputy Rabbitte the Minister mentioned on two occasions regular part-time workers.  Do I take it from his response that he does not intend to incorporate temporary part-time workers, the people who are most exploited under the present system?  Will he afford any comfort to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer both questions by saying that I hope the Bill will be seen by people as progressive legislation and will go much further than what is happening in the Community as of now. That is something that could change. <Col N="1765" /> There have to be thresholds and guidelines or otherwise the legislation would become unrealistic.  The regular part-time workers and relative part-time workers will be protected by the Bill.  I do not think we can protect all kinds of part-time workers because that would include students who do a few hours work on a Saturday or in the evenings.  They will not be included in the terms of the proposed Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it will be possible to give <i>pro rata</i> conditions, based on the number of hours worked, to people who are employed in a temporary part-time capacity?  If some measure is not taken will he not agree that it will lead to further abuse and be a disincentive to employers inclined to employ people on a full-time basis thereby reducing the number of people on the unemployment register?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very cautious about this issue and I do not wish to do anything which would affect the growth of part-time workers in the labour market where it is regulated.  I seek to provide the appropriate protections in a range of labour legislation which should be provided for in labour legislation for people who work less than the normal number of hours per week.  They have not got that protection at present and I will provide for it in the new Bill.  I do not believe anyone will be left out once this Bill goes through.  I will deal with small groups of people and those who are not in permanent or regular part-time work.</P>

      <P>As I explained fully in my reply to the Deputy's question of 23 May 1990, the conclusion I reached was that it would not be feasible to extend and implement any definition of employer's insolvency beyond those categories set out in section 1(3) of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.  The decision was taken following detailed examination of the <Col N="1770" /> matter and on the basis of legal advice received by me.  That advice was that it would not be feasible to extend the scope of the 1984 Act by regulation and that primary legislation would be necessary for that purpose.  In fact, any legal amendments necessary would be appropriate to more general legislation governing the circumstances in which an employer is deemed to be insolvent rather than to the 1984 Act, which is not primarily designed to define insolvency situations.</P>
      <P>The provision in the 1984 Act to which the Deputy refers was an enabling one which, on further examination by my predecessor as Minister for Labour as well as by me, led to the same conclusion &mdash; that the provision concerned did not allow for the extension of the scope of the Act in the manner suggested by regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already raised this issue and as I understand it, it will have to be taken up in insolvency legislation, which I think is being considered. The point is that primary legislation would be required to introduce a scheme which covers informal insolvencies.  The then Government tried to do this in 1984. I was spokesman for my party on that occasion and I remember the debate on this issue.  The important point is that any scheme to deal with informal insolvencies could not be looked at in isolation from bankruptcy and winding-up law which, apart from the implications for the individual companies involved, would entail a whole range of complex issues and procedures.  I think this matter would have to be provided for in insolvency legislation because it is not possible to deal with an employer's insolvency under the 1984 Act on its own.  A new definition of insolvency for this purpose would have to be written into an insolvency Act.  I will <Col N="1771" /> communicate that point to the relevant Minister.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 40,000 employees are covered by joint labour committees.  This figure represents about 5 per cent of all employees.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990, contains a number of measures which are designed to facilitate the establishment of joint labour committees; to improve the functioning of existing joint labour committees and to bring about more effective enforcement of Employment Regulation Orders.  In addition, one of the functions of the new Labour Relations Commission will be to carry out periodic reviews to determine whether new joint labour committees should be established or existing joint labour committees extended.</P>
      <P>I believe that these changes will ensure that the joint labour committee system functions efficiently and effectively and adequately addresses the problem of low pay in certain sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the time has been reached to revamp the entire legislation governing <Col N="1772" /> minimum pay, that the joint labour committees are contributing to the problem of low pay endemic in the economy, that there is generally poor enforcement of employment regulation orders and that it would be much better to use the considerable abilities of the Minister and his office to facilitate a climate for minimum pay legislation in the economy generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That might yet prove to be the case.  I believe that joint labour committees, if worked for individual sectors, can bring about fairly substantial improvements for the low paid.  They do so all the time.  In the 1990 Act we were attempting to make the system more efficient and to obtain more powers for the implementation and enforcement of employment regulation orders.  We have increased the inspectorate in that area. This issue has been discussed as part of the Programme for Government.  I do not want to indicate what might or might not happen in those discussions.  In the meantime I am committed to trying to extend and expand the operation of joint labour committees to make them more effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that in any given area covered by a joint labour committee the levels of pay are substantially lower than elsewhere in the economy.  The Minister referred to the Programme for Government but I presume he is talking about the social and economic programme.  I take it this matter is the subject of discussion with the social interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for discussion. Joint labour committees were put into sectors which had particular problems in an attempt to protect people in those sectors.  They fulfilled a useful function.  The employers and trade unions concerned in a sector talk about the problems peculiar to it and try to get the best arrangement for employees. Joint labour committees are very important and are seen as such by the trade union movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to the concept of a minimum income through the provision of reasonable pay levels and some adjustment or expansion of the concept of the family income supplement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is a matter for social welfare.  This year the family income supplement has been expanded. The thresholds for PRSI and the income figures for taxation are ways to tackle the income question.  I have said several times that the answer to low pay is to do with training, education, social welfare and taxation.  All those aspects taken jointly can help those on low pay, not any single aspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the most effective way of dealing with this problem is to introduce minimum wage legislation?  Joint labour committees, like the Agricultural Wages Board in the past, indicate an acceptance that there are abuses in the marketplace. This will continue as long as there is not proper legislation to cover those at the bottom level of the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numerous ways of dealing with this problem.  Collective bargaining for people who may not be in the bottom 10 per cent is one way and the joint labour committees can be effective in the sector they cover.  We should be looking at the sectors where there is low pay.  We have a joint labour committee covering the contract cleaning sector but it applies only to the Dublin area.  Congress now want to replace that by a committee which would cover the whole country.  IDATU, together with the vintners, want the establishment of a joint labour committee to cover retail grocery and allied trades.  The trade union movement are using the joint labour committees for the intended purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A great number of these <Col N="1774" /> are not organised.  The biggest joint labour committee is for farm labourers, who work on about 20,000 different farms.  The joint labour committee has worked for them during the years.  It is a good mechanism but it is not the only one.  Taxation and social welfare are a fundamental part.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that most of the joint labour committees deal with work that remains women's work and is very low paid?  With the experience of the joint labour committees, some sections of FÁS could concentrate on the training and skills needed to move people out of the low income area.  That may be the most positive way of moving out of the low income trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with Deputy Barnes.  There was a joint labour committee which helped sections of the clothing and textile industry.  People are now trained for the most modern part of the textile industry, which provides very good employment, far from the sweat shops in back streets throughout the country.  There is actually a shortage of skilled people in the better textile areas. This is despite the fact that there is a joint labour committee classifying the employees as mainly women in the low paid area.  Employers are now coming to me seeking employees.  Some months ago we asked FÁS to conduct courses in that area.  It seems contradictory that there is a low paid area where they cannot get people to fill jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it from what the Minister has said that in the upcoming talks on a programme for social and economic development the Government are considering an integated approach to pay, social welfare and means testing so that we might remove from the system many of the anomalies and poverty traps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a lengthy answer on some of the aspects earlier.  All these aspects are being discussed in isolation <Col N="1775" /> from each other, but there is the view that we would make more progress by a combination of these measures, even if it takes a number of years to do it.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>if, in relation to his statements (details supplied), the Government intend to take any steps to ensure that the private sector will do more to invest their profits at home and thus create additional jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I made the comments referred to in the question the preliminary estimates of the labour force at mid-April 1990 have been announced. The estimates show an increase of 30,000 in the number at work and a fall of 19,000 in the number unemployed as compared with the 1989 estimates.  Employment in industry has increased by 16,000 and, in the private services sector by 15,000. There was a decline of 3,000 in the public sector.</P>
      <P>These employment increases are attributable largely to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> negotiated in October 1987 and the increased investment accompanying the programme.  Despite these favourable trends, there are certain features of the present situation which are a source of concern.  Unemployment at 218,000 is still at an unacceptably high level.  Future expectations are for an annual labour force increase of about 25,000.</P>
      <P>While emigration declined by 15,000 in the year ended mid-April 1990, the figure of 31,000 is unacceptably high.  Too many of our talented and highly qualified young people are opting for employment abroad.  Irish companies will have to improve their recruitment practices if they are to attract and retain graduates from third level education.  There also seems to be a reluctance among some employers to recruit people from the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the future, economic and <Col N="1776" /> employment growth will continue to be influenced by developments abroad.  The global economic outlook is now less promising than earlier in the year due to the impact of higher oil prices, the instability generated by the Gulf crisis, the decline in the UK and US economies and the uncertainties occasioned by German reunification.  As a result, there are some indications of a slowdown in domestic growth since mid-year.</P>
    <P>Against the background that I have outlined it is obvious that our job creation efforts will have to remain at a high level of intensity if we are to make further progress in reducing unemployment and emigration.  Action in this area requires the full co-operation of all interests but especially the social partners.</P>
    <P>We must develop a strong internationally competitive economy geared to maximising employment growth.  This involves a coherent strategy spanning industrial, agricultural, labour market and other relevant policy areas.  Particular emphasis has to be placed on indigenous industry, mainly comprising small and medium-sized businesses, together with the continued attraction of overseas investment to facilitate technology transfer as well as expanding employment.</P>
    <P>We have to bear in mind that there are almost 1,000 overseas firms operating here employing 90,000 workers representing 40 per cent of the industrial workforce. We need overseas investment in manufacturing and internationally traded services but we have to deepen the linkages of overseas firms in the domestic economy.</P>
    <P>The Government's concern is to continue to provide an environment conducive to the expansion of business and employment.  This is the approach that has influenced the Government's stance in the negotiations on a programme of economic and social development. Employment and job creation are featuring prominently in these discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have complimented the Minister before in the House for <Col N="1777" /> choosing, on one or two occasions, to speak out, to criticise the performance of some of the leading private sector companies in terms of job creation.  Would he not agree that it is unrealistic to talk about significant additional job creation from reinvestment of profits while circumstances obtain here in which almost £3 billion are being repatriated in profits by the 1,000 companies to which he referred?  I want the Minister to accept that I am not arguing that it is not possible to prevent the repatriation of profits. Does he agree that these represent the life-blood of our economy being allowed to drain away and, because of that the spectre he raises of this investment going to Eastern or Central Europe is all the more probable?  Will he indicate whether there is any attempt being made by the economic Ministries to tackle this question through the taxation system or whatever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is being tackled in a number of ways.  While acknowledging the Deputy's remarks I have spelled out several times that it is reinvestment of profits and resources that will create employment.  In the first two years of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> there were very few indications of such spin-off in terms of jobs.  I have given statistics on a number of occasions about the capacity utilisation within our economy which did not appear to rise as did our GNP, in that we did not appear to be gaining many job increases.  That trend appears to be changing, however slowly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my reply, there are at present over 200,000 people unemployed. However, I acknowledge that some industries will do almost anything rather than create employment.  For example, they will operate on the basis of using whatever capacity they have within their existing workforce&mdash;often to the benefit of that workforce&mdash;by way of double days, long sessions at weekends and overtime, thus not generating additional employment.  We must continue to work to resolve that problem.  I might add that the Departments of Finance, <Col N="1778" /> Industry and Commerce and a number of others are endeavouring to expand the level of employment in our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it is imperative that action be taken when £3 billion are being repatriated in profits, representing roughly the equivalent of the amount of money secured by way of Structural Funds in preparation for 1992?  In that context&mdash;whether by way of a revision of the system of grant aids to industry or an incentive within the tax system&mdash;would he agree that we should cause such companies to reinvest some portion of those profits here where they are generated?  Furthermore, would he agree that, otherwise, we will not see any significant boost on the part of these companies in terms of job creation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the drive that must be undertaken continuously, to endeavour to get those people who generate profits in the manufacturing services sector of our economy, to put some of those profits back into the generation of employment.  There are some indications that that trend is improving, which has been shown in the labour force survey undertaken this year.  Nonetheless, there are other companies which have not yet got the message.  Therefore, that drive by State industries and Government must be continued in an effort to get those people to generate investment in jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seriously concerned about the proposal to transfer the trial of persons for certain offences to the Central Criminal Court.  Essentially the Bill provides that in future all rape and aggravated sexual assault cases &mdash; most are rape cases now &mdash; will be tried in the Central Criminal Court.  I understand the Minister's thinking.  The idea, as I understand it, is that he wants to give a fair expression of the seriousness with <Col N="1833" /> which such crimes are viewed.  I understand that.  The trouble is that the cosmetic can sometimes be in opposition to the reality.</P>
      <P>Let me speak about the background. The Law Reform Commission made this proposal but they did so in the context of it being the beginning of a process of returning a wider criminal jurisdiction generally to the Central Criminal Court which is part of the High Court.  The Minister has accepted the broad proposal, but not the context.  The reason I am so concerned about the proposal, as far as rape and aggravated sexual assault are concerned, is that there could be enormous delays as a consequence of this proposal, so there are serious practical reasons why the Minister's proposal should not be adopted.  The Minister referred in an earlier debate to the fact that there were only six rape trials per annum at present held outside Dublin. We must remember, however, that under the extended definition and under the provisions of this Bill the proposal will embrace a much larger number of cases.</P>
      <P>My real concern is that the move proposed will result in considerable delays. That would be unfair to the complainant, the person who has been subjected to the horrendous crime of rape, who is surely suffering trauma enough without having that trauma dragged on over an extended period of time which would be the consequence of putting this proposal through.</P>
      <P>Second, such a proposal is unfair to the accused.  The accused faces a huge sentence in prison and in some instances may be in custody and, because of the clogged-up situation in the High Court the accused, who may ultimately be acquitted, could find himself spending considerable time in custody pending trial.</P>
      <P>A basic principle of law is that justice delayed is justice denied.  When we are talking about such serious charges we must all put our heads together to establish a system which will result in a speedy dispatch of such cases in the interests of the complainant and of the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> In general there have not been complaints about the conduct of such cases in the Circuit Criminal Court.  Let me be blunt about it, there are absolutely no delays there and that is a major factor. Prior to 1981 one of the reasons for the transfer of virtually all criminal responsibility to the Circuit Court was the tremendous delays in the Central Criminal Court in Dublin.  Trials were delayed for years and this led to defendants having the option of their criminal trials being transferred to the Central Criminal Court from the Circuit Court simply for the purpose of delay.  This scandal was cleared up by the Courts Act, 1981, transferring all criminal jurisdiction, except for murder and treason, to the Circuit Criminal Court which is now completely up to date in its criminal jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In general there have been no complaints about the conduct of cases in the Circuit Criminal Court but there have been a few specific decisions which have given rise to public outcry.  Whatever about the merits and demerits of those specific cases &mdash; I was horrified by a few decisions &mdash; the answer is not to throw the baby out with the bath water and dismantle a system that has worked well in the nine years since the Courts Act, 1981 but to accept the proposal Fine Gael have made, to adopt the Bill which I moved on behalf of Fine Gael in this House and to allow for a review of sentences. That is the answer and that inevitably will be drafted onto our criminal justice system whether by way of Fine Gael's continued opposition and pressing the issue or alternatively when Fine Gael come back to Government soon.  That is the way to deal with the few specific decisions on sentences which have been subject to such criticism.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the problem of delays.  I was a practising solicitor &mdash; I do not practise any more &mdash; and I know the problem with the backlog of cases in the High Court.  There is no proposal to increase the number of judges.  If the Minister made such a proposal that would possibly change the thinking in this regard.  I know that in Cork it takes up to three years to get a case to trial in the High Court <Col N="1835" /> and Circuit Court.  That is the kind of situation we are dealing with.  The backlog has been increasing, we are talking of a backlog of about 9,000 cases &mdash; I had some figures showing the increased numbers over the last couple of years.  In that event I would appeal to the Minister to turn away from what I term a cosmetic solution.  He should look at the reality and ensure that these cases are heard within a reasonable time in the interests of the complainant and the accused.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has given bland assurances that he does not envisage this provision leading to delays in the holding of these trials in the Central Criminal Court but I would point out that the former President of the Circuit Court, Mr. Justice T. F. Roe, expressed a strong view in this regard.  I would further point out that the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, has also strongly argued against this proposal. These are people of experience who have knowledge of the way the courts system works.  If the Minister is not responsive to the views expressed by the Opposition, he must take into account the views expressed by senior judicial figures.</P>
    <P>That basically is my concern.  I will present my case in as soft a way as possible to encourage the Minister to my way of thinking.  I fully understand that he wants to give clear expression in our laws to his concern and the concern of all of us about the seriousness with which rape cases must be viewed.  When you approach a Bill with an understanding and an acceptance of that seriousness and at the same time end up with a proposal that will make matters worse, reality must dawn.  I would strongly urge the Minister to change tack and not to proceed with this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Minister replying to the questions raised by Deputy O'Keeffe I wonder would he give consideration to a couple of points I will briefly make.  The essence of the matter is the delay.  The reason we are opposing the section is that we feel this section will <Col N="1836" /> give rise to undue delay by transferring all these cases from courts throughout the country to Dublin without giving the High Court the necessary mechanism, in the form of extra appointees, to deal with them.  If the Minister is to allay our fears by guaranteeing that he will embark on the appointment of new members of the Judiciary, I hope he will give consideration to the appointment of women who have a great role to play in the Judiciary.  With regard to this legislation in particular it would be welcome if there were more women members of the higher Judiciary to deal with the type of offence envisaged by this legislation.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with anything the Minister has said on the question of delays.  I would refer to the Law Reform Commission consultation paper dealing with the trial of rape and related offences. The Law Reform Commission, in their wisdom, formed the opinion that the Central Criminal Court should have exclusive jurisdiction because of an apparent delay at Circuit Court level.  I would say with the greatest of respect to the members of the Law Reform Commission that that opinion is not accurate. I would refer the Minister to Circuit Court statistics on serious crime, particularly rape.  On average over the past number of years the delay involved in bringing an offender or an aggressor to trial was of the order of six months, not by any manner of means an undue delay. When looked at in tandem with the delays in the High Court it is fair to say that the Minister is not counteracting the element of delays by transferring cases to a centralised location.  The amendment should not be withdrawn until guarantees on the question of delay are given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the question of delay there is also the matter of inconvenience.  It would be of considerable inconvenience for witnesses, victims, members of the victim's family, members of the Garda Síochána and everybody involved in the prosecution to have to travel to Dublin for perhaps a week as the case is processed. I wonder if the Minister regards it as being in the best interest of everybody <Col N="1837" /> involved that trials should be centralised and that people from Donegal, Cork and all over the country, would have to move bag and baggage to the Four Courts for the duration of the hearing.</P>
    <P>I make another point without even mentioning the crisis in our legal aid system of which every Member of the House and every member of society is fully aware.  The Minister must accept that the statistics bear out the fact that most people charged with offences of the type envisaged under this legislation are on legal aid.  The legal aid bill will be increased substantially by centralising the trials in the High Court.  The amount of money available for legal aid is very scarce and there are areas of far greater need where this money could be directed rather than as proposed in this section.</P>
    <P>There is another point I ask the Minister to take on board in considering the delay in the Central Criminal Court, the question of the trauma of the victim. There is no doubt that, between the commission of the crime and the bringing of the aggressor to trial, the victim lives and relives horrific trauma and the longer the delay the greater the trauma.  It is in everybody's interest that the offender is brought to trial at the earliest opportunity to aid the victim, to enable her to put the unfortunate horror out of her mind and set about the task of rebuilding her life as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to carefully consider my final point, which is a reasonable one, although not the most important.  Our criminal law system ordains trial by one's peers and trial by jury as envisaged under the legislation, with which we are all in agreement.  At present the sexual offence of rape is tried at the various Circuit Court venues throughout the country and the jury members are made up of people from within the offender's local community. the odium in which rape and sexual offences are held in society is clearly identifiable and defined within that locality.  I wonder, if we centralise it, will we reduce the odium in a local community towards a sexual offender?</P>
    <P>By bringing all these trial to Dublin, perhaps we will depersonalise the crime <Col N="1838" /> as far as the aggressor is concerned, which may not be in society's best interest.  On the other hand, I accept the point that by transferring the victim from a circuit area to Dublin one is aiding depersonalisation.  However, on balance, the overriding consideration must be the delay involved and, to the best of my recollection, the Minister has not seriously questioned the method of sentencing in the Circuit Criminal Court.  I do not think he has stated that one of the reasons for the transfer is inconsistency or any unhappiness that people might have about the Circuit Court sentencing. The record will show that two out of the three lengthiest sentences handed down to rape offenders have been in the Circuit Criminal Court.  Therefore, it is not doing justice to that point for anyone to say that the sentencing policy by Circuit Court judges is not in the best interests of society.  In the not too distant past, the Circuit Criminal Court imposed sentences of 14, 15 and 16 years for the crime of rape, which the High Court have not done to the same extent.</P>
    <P>My major concern is the question of the delay.  However, if the Minister states that there will not be a delay and if he is prepared to allay our fears by saying he will embark upon a programme of appointing High Court judges, I might be prepared to review it but there is a difficulty in the legislation as framed at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat perplexed by the opposition to this section in view of what was discussed earlier in the Seanad, to which I will refer shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended that, in future, all rape and aggravated sexual assault cases should be tried in the Central Criminal Court.  The Government agreed with this recommendation and decided that it should be given effect in the Bill.  I should like to make it clear that this decision was intended to be seen as an expression of the seriousness with which the Government view the crimes of rape and aggravated sexual assault.  It should not in any way be taken as a criticism of the Circuit <Col N="1839" /> Criminal Court or the judges in that court who have dealt with rape cases. However, I should point out that, as far back as 10 June, 1987, during the debate on the Cavan rape trial, speakers from both sides of the House advocated that the holding of rape trials should be in the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Law Reform Commission looked at this matter in some detail and, in their final report of May 1988, recommended that all rape trials be held in the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>Why am I perplexed about the attitude of the Opposition?  When the Bill was debated in the Seanad all parties there were in favour of section 9.  The then Senator Fennell &mdash; now Deputy Fennell &mdash; said in the Seanad debate of 15 December 1988, as reported in the Seanad Official Report, column 1486:</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in general and, specifically, many of the proposals such as the change of venue to the Central Criminal Court for hearings.</P>
    <P>I do not specifically mention the then Senator Fennell; she was supported in this by her party colleagues in the Seanad. She also welcomed the change in venue to the Central Criminal Court in her contribution on the Second Stage debate in the Dáil on 20 February 1990, as reported in the Dáil Official Report, column 2474. Therefore, Deputies will understand why I am perplexed by the opposition to this section.</P>
    <P>The question of delays has been raised. There are no appreciable delays in the hearing of cases in the central Criminal Court and I have no reason to believe that the transfer of rape trials to that court will change the position.  The President of the High Court will, of course, have to make a judge available for, more time in the Central Criminal Court to cope with these cases.  The effect on the overall position in the High Court will become clear only after the arrangements have been working for some time and I propose to keep the situation very carefully under review.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> I should point out that the delay sometimes associated with the hearings of civil cases in the High Court arise from a variety of factors which are not relevant to the hearing of criminal cases.</P>
    <P>As to the question of the inconvenience of having rape trials in Dublin, at present in any rape trials the prosecution or the defence can opt to have the trial transferred to Dublin.  My major concern is not the amount of inconvenience but the implications for the victims of rape.  The legislation goes to considerable lengths to reduce the trauma and to protect the identity of the complainant and the holding of trials in Dublin can only serve to preserve her anonymity far more effectively than could be done if the trial was in her own home town.</P>
    <P>In relation to the High Court, the transfer to the Central Criminal Court will add to the work-load, a point raised by Deputies O'Keeffe and Flanagan. However, the criminal work-load of the High Court has been decreasing since 1984 and the proposals would restore the criminal work of the High Court to close to their 1984 level.  It seems, therefore, that the change will not give rise to any additional appointment to the High Court.  However, I emphasise to Deputies &mdash; I understand their concerns about delays &mdash; that the matter will be kept under review by me in consultation with the President of the High Court and I will take whatever remedial action necessary in relation to the elimination of delays although I do not envisage them arising.</P>
    <P>The whole emphasis of this Bill &mdash; and the emphasis which I am placing on it in relation to the transfer of these cases from the Circuit Criminal Court to the Central Criminal Court &mdash; is to clearly express the seriousness with which the Government view the crime of rape and aggravated sexual assault.  I will, therefore, be opposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to briefly indicate the position of The Workers' Party to the proposed amendment.  In principle we support the proposal contained in section 9 that from now rape and serious sexual assault offences should <Col N="1841" /> be dealt with exclusively by the Central Criminal Court.  We will not support the Fine Gael Party in their proposed opposition to the section.  That was our position as laid down in a response document to the Bill which we published in January last year.  Our views have not changed. Since we made our views known, the former President of the Circuit Court, Judge Roe, issued a number of reasoned arguments as to why he believed this section somehow reflected on the integrity and performance of judges to date with regard to dealing with trials before the Circuit Criminal Court.  Judge Roe must be acknowledged as a profound and committed defender of his court and jurisdiction of the time, among his many other attributes, but the experience of many victims in dealing with the crowded jurisdiction and workload of the Circuit Criminal Courts did not hold with his view of the efficient way in which they conducted their business.</P>
      <P>The Circuit Criminal Courts outside Dublin by and large comprised one single court venue where on the first day of the sittings for that session all of the business would be gone through, and by tradition criminal business was taken first and civil business last.  Whenever a jury trial was called for, there were groans of exasperation throughout the building from all of those practitioners who had assembled in the hope of disposing of civil or other business.  Because of the complexity of issues in many cases, the criminal cases would tend to take up the lion's share of the time available to the sessions.  I am alluding to this because the central issue here is not the question of the facility of the court prosecutors, representatives, advocates or witnesses, or the question of the delay.  The central issue is to reflect, in the administration of justice, the gravity felt by the community and by the legislators for the heinous crime of rape and serious sexual assault.  That is what we have to address.  Whether or not the Law Reform Commission felt this was a central issue is neither here nor there.  Certainly the Oireachtas Joint Committee investigating this matter felt it was a central issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1842" /> We should transfer the exclusive hearing of those cases to the Central Criminal Court.  If anything won the argument for the Minister or any of us who are arguing this, it was the Kilkenny case which was dealt with during the last year.  We commented on it in this House before and I will not dwell on it but the notion in this day and age that a person would be given a suspended sentence and be able to walk free from court without having to spend time in a custodial institution for the crime of rape is almost, if not entirely, unanswerable.  For those who argued that the Circuit Criminal Court should retain jurisdiction, that was the last nail in the coffin of any sustainable argument.  We should try this formula and see if we can get over the practical difficulties that have been alluded to by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    <P>The issue of delay is a worrying issue, as is the idea that the workload of the Central Criminal Court will be unduly heavy.  That argument must be considered. One of the things the Minister might consider is whether there is an argument, for this reason and others, for establishing an exclusive high court of criminal jurisdiction in the High Court as opposed to the formula of the Central Criminal Court being a sort of sub-station of the High Court's more general jurisdiction. We should consider giving a full statutory and administrative structure to a separate court of criminal jurisdiction at High Court level.  That would involve the appointment for a limited period of a number of judges to the high court of criminal jurisdiction so that we would not have the situation that pertains at the moment, that the President waits until convenience will allow him to send off a judge to the Central Criminal Court to deal with criminal cases.  There are periods when the Central Criminal Court does not sit at all, for example, when the High Court is on circuit at the civil side, usually at the beginning of each law term, when neither the Central Criminal Court nor the Court of Criminal Appeal sit because of the non-availability of judges or the convenience of the administration, or the practitioners at the Bar, as opposed to other considerations.  Apart from the <Col N="1843" /> vacation gaps, there are other built-in gaps in the legal calendar when the criminal jurisdiction of the High Court is not exercised at all.  That should be looked at.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other related issues.  The issue of exclusive jury experience being deposited in Dublin is something that should be looked at.  Has the Minister considered the prospect of the Central Criminal Court sitting on circuit in the same way as its civil side of the High Court sits on circuit in different locations, as a means to deal with the trial in the provinces of rape and serious sexual assault?  A trial is not, strictly speaking, a trial by one's peers if all juries are drawn from the Dublin area.  Is there a prospect that the Minister might contemplate building into the legislation a process whereby the empanelling of the jury might take place in the circuit area in which the offence occurred and that the jury once selected would be sent to Dublin with the trial for the hearing of the issues?  One of the notions that we build into the idea of a trial by one's peers is local knowledge, knowledge of even the geography and mores of the locality. All these things have a profound and important effect on the minds of the jury deciding facts.  It is not right to ask Dublin juries to always determine issues of fact that relate to the provinces, be it Donegal, the west coast or anywhere outside the metropolitan areas where different cultural and social aspects apply.  The Minister might look at the issues in this area by on the one hand addressing the question of the Central Criminal Court as it currently stands being empowered to sit on circuit, in Kilkenny, Cork and elsewhere or by introducing a device whereby juries can be empanelled locally and brought up to Dublin for the case.</P>
    <P>Another point relates to the issue of bail.  With regard to all trials where the offence by definition and requirement must be dealt with in the Central Criminal Court, there is built into the legislation an equal requirement that bail can only be determined by the High Court. Has the Minister addressed this issue with <Col N="1844" /> regard to rape?  I see him nodding furiously to indicate that he has&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The issue of bail &mdash; which will be dealt with exclusively by the High Court &mdash; can be equally as important in the conduct of the pre-trial proceedings.  By and large, those are the issues about which I am concerned in this context, but having said that, we should give this provision a trial run and accept the Minister's assurances, and hold him to them, that he will keep the matter under close review.  We can overcome the tactical and other issues and problems which may arise, but it is only right that we should mark the gravity of the offence of rape and serious sexual assault today by giving the jurisdiction to process these trials exclusively to the Central Criminal Court.</P>

      <P>It is important on this section that the Minister would give an assurance &mdash; he has given such a commitment &mdash; that with the President of the High Court he will keep a very close eye on this issue.  I would like to give two reasons for our concern and anxiety about this matter.  In their submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre stated at point No. 14 under the heading &ldquo;Priority Listing for Rape Cases&rdquo; that in their experience most women have to wait at least one year from the time of the incident to the court hearing and during that time the impending hearing is never far from the victim's thoughts.  Indeed, it sometimes prevents her from recovering from this horrific experience.  Based on their experience the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre recommended that in cases where the assailant has been apprehended at an early date a maximum time limit of four months from the date of the incident be placed on the hearing of rape and serious sexual assault cases.  I would like to place on record, as my colleagues did last week, the fact that the Minister has met with members of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and paid great attention to what they recommended.  This is a sticking point in so far as we have to be reassured, given their experience, that such delays will not aggravate the problems facing the victim, which we are desperately trying to alleviate.  Everything in this Bill should reflect the experiences of the Rape Crisis Centres.  That is a very big point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between 18 to 26 rape cases are processed by the courts annually.  We are aware, and we have been told this by the rape crisis centres throughout the country, that the number of cases processed by the courts is only the tip of the iceberg and reflects the lack of confidence women have had in court procedures up <Col N="1846" /> to now.  I hope that following the introduction of this Act and with improvements in the procedures we can expect a higher number of court cases.  The projected figure must be taken into consideration. One of the advantages that could accrue from having cases heard in one court, apart from the standardisation of guidelines and sentencing, is the setting up of a trained team within the court which would allow victims to gain access to skilled counsellors and &mdash; this is one of the things the rape crisis centres would like us to ask the Minister and the courts to take into consideration &mdash; banghardaí or other female assistants who would always be available within the court to offer support and psychological help to the victim.  There is always the chance if such help is available within one court it will be made available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>What we want to highlight in the debate on this section is our anxiety and concern with regard to delays and the suffering the victim has to endure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief as I find myself in agreement with both the Minister and Deputy McCartan on this issue.  On Second Stage the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, who made the case on behalf of the Minister who was unavailable that day, outlined the reason for the transfer of rape and serious sexual assault cases to the Central Criminal Court.  He said that they were being transferred to underline the seriousness of that crime.  We all agree with that proposal.  Indeed, we have repeatedly said that rape is a serious crime and that we want that to be underlined in the Bill.  We welcome the Bill for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I said I was concerned that delays could occur in bringing cases to the Central Criminal Court given the backlog of cases in that court.  The Minister has reassured me that this will not be the case and that with the passage of time cases will be heard sooner and extra judges may be appointed to that court in order to speed up the work.  I got the impression that because of the extra <Col N="1847" /> workload this change may bring about a reorganisation in the Central Criminal Court.  Having been given that assurance we can only wait and see if this matter will be closely scrutinised as promised. We all hope that we will be Members of this House for a long time and that the Minister will retain his position for some time.  If there happens to be a change we can remind the Minister &mdash; or whoever is Minister at the time &mdash; of the assurances given to this House and the reasons given for removing these cases from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court.  It is true that people in rural areas who have to be brought to Dublin will experience much inconvenience and trauma but, at the end of the day, if what the Minister has done underlines the seriousness of this crime then it is worth while.  I hope the Minister will underline that assurance and also ensure that the trauma involved as a result of transferring these cases to Dublin will be reduced as far as possible. I hope he will ensure that these cases are dealt with speedily.  Having been given that assurance we should accept this section of the Bill and not seek to amend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased we are having such a debate about court procedure and what will happen when we come to bring these cases to court.  It is important that the public are aware of the kind of detail the Members of this House are giving to this legislation.  If they listened to RTÉ, following our last debate &mdash; which was very useful and important and contained a very fundamental change on the part of the Minister &mdash; I regret to say they would not have known anything had happened.  This is a pity because I think there are many people out there who think we are legislating for castration, I am sorry to say, because a comment by one of my colleagues &mdash; which he had every right to make &mdash; was taken up in a very capricious and frivolous way.  I have heard it on several programmes out of context and as a cause for joking.  That is regrettable. When the debates for today is reported I hope the serious nature and the care with <Col N="1848" /> which Members are approaching this legislation will be reflected in such reports.</P>
      <P>In legislation such as this I am always interested to listen to my colleagues with legal training and the legal profession.  I must say Deputy McCartan took us around the various highways and by-ways of the various courts in the land and how and when cases are heard.  That is something with which I will never become familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the apparent contradiction or difference in the approach that was taken in the Seanad from that taken in this House.  I would say to the Minister it is important that we are totally open-minded on this legislation and are open to look at all the various aspects of rape, its reporting, the treatment of rape victims, the hearing of cases and the after-effects.  I was very swayed by our discussions on this side of the House on the delay factor.  The stress, the strain and the nightmare for women who have gone through this dreadful experience cannot be overestimated. During my time in the course of reporting as a journalist I remember speaking to two women who suffered from the crime of rape.  I will never forget the sense of anguish I felt for one woman who was a young mother.  It is cruel to leave women waiting to bring their cases to court.  They should have priority.  Of course, we understand the preliminaries must have been gone through and a book of evidence prepared &mdash; all of which is necessary &mdash; but I still cannot accept that it can take nine or 12 months before a case comes to court.  It puts an unbearable strain on somebody who knows they have to go to court and relive in the court room the awfulness of what has happened to her.  I agree with Deputy Barnes that we see only the tip of the iceberg.  The number of rape convictions which ranges from 18 to 26 is very small and I am convinced does not represent the number of offences that take place.  Many women, particularly young women, would feel they were powerless and that they would not be able to carry through on reporting rape and they grin and bear <Col N="1849" /> it and go away and suffer for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the Minister's commitments and his assurances that the delays will be reduced as far as possible. We accept he cannot do the impossible. If it is necessary to appoint more judges I appeal to him to do so.  I appeal to the Minister, so far as he has influence on these things, to think about more women High Court judges and perhaps we will put in a caveat to provide special training. I am not saying that those who sit in the High Court are not men and a woman of wisdom and care, etc. but people in such an important job are being asked to do the impossible without special and ongoing training.  I know it is possible for them to do special training themselves. A special programme of training should be provided for judges.  I have been reassured by the Minister's assurances. We must get rid of the long delays for trials, which we have seen in the past, for rape cases.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I would like to make.  I spoke in the Seanad about the need &mdash; and I think it has been referred to in the debate here also &mdash; to enable the State to appeal where there is too lenient a sentence.  We have also heard about the suspended sentence for rape. Can the Minister tell me how that is possible? I know a convicted person has the right to appeal his sentence if it is perceived as too high.  There have been cases of this in the past where there has been public outrage.  Can the State apply for an appeal in that instance or is there any machinery by which that can be done?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last point, an amendment has been put down and we will deal with it later.  The question of delays, as I said earlier, is one which I will keep under consideration and, if necessary, I will have a consultation with the President of the High Court and if alterations have to be made they will be made.  Regarding the priority listing which was mentioned, my understanding is that the President of the High Court affords all criminal cases going <Col N="1850" /> before the court priority <i>vis-á-vis</i> civil cases.</P>
      <P>The central issue which the Government are determined to get across in this legislation is the seriousness with which we view the crime of rape and aggravated sexual assault.  To give an indication of that seriousness it is intended, as per this section, that in future trials will be heard before the Central Criminal Court.  We will deal with the question of bail later.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question raised by Deputy Barnes of support services, I can assure her I will have discussions with the Garda Commissioner in relation to the presence of a bangharda at all times in relation to these cases because I think it is vitally important.  In discussing this issue, what we were doing the last day and what we are attempting to do today also is to recognise that as well as the physical damage there is also the psychological damage and the trauma a rape victim experiences.  We need to recognise that in our legislation and within our support services.</P>
      <P>That is why I brought forward the major amendment to section 4 the last day.  I join with Deputy Fennell in expressing my regret that that aspect of what I thought was an excellent debate in this House the last day did not receive the type of attention which I believe it should have received.  We are dealing here with very serious legislation but unfortunately it was a side show &mdash; if I can describe that contribution as such &mdash; which seems to have received public attention rather than the serious contributions made by Deputies on all sides of the House to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said I want to formally withdraw our opposition to section 9.  Deputy Liam Kavanagh's contribution represented what could probably be described as an honest brokerage position but perhaps he read a little too much into what the Minister said.  I did not hear the Minister say that he was embarking on a recruitment drive in the High Court, but I am prepared to accept <Col N="1851" /> what the Minister has said rather than divide the House on this issue.  I accept that this is a very serious matter, it is a section of no small importance.  In view of what the Minister has said regarding the delays and that he is prepared to watch the matter closely &mdash; and I am sure he is keen to ensure that we on this side of the House will also closely monitor the matter &mdash; we will not be opposing section 9.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to section 10 which provides for the exclusion of the public from hearings. While I do not think this section goes far enough I do not have an appropriate amendment to deal with this and I hope the Minister will consider my remarks on the section.</P>
      <P>In addition to the holding of these cases <i>in camera,</i> there are other matters which I regard as being essential.  These matters need not necessarily be included in the legislation but perhaps the Director of Public Prosecutions or the entire prosecution team will take them on board. We have just agreed a section which will transfer all cases to the High Court in Dublin.  It is very important that the victim in such a case is given a form of familiarisation course on the lay-out of the court, the functions, the various roles and representations involved in the holding of a court case.  We have dealt at great length with the trauma a victim experiences and I believe some form of course must be given to a victim in terms of procedure, lay-out and meeting with police officers prior to the exclusion of the public from a hearing, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good relationship must be built up and maintained between the Garda and the victims in regard to such matters as <Col N="1852" /> access to a copy of statements, contact with counselling services and the progress report on a case prior to a hearing.  People have referred to the six or nine month delay in regard to such matters and it is very important that the victim is kept fully informed at all stages of what is happening, the various stages involved, the likely date on which a hearing may take place and the detection process.  A pre-trial consultation, a meeting with witnesses, an exchange of views and going over the evidence in so far as one can do that is extremely important.  The role of the prosecution must be more then merely laying the case before the court. The prosecution and the victim must work in tandem as far as possible.  There are also pre-court and post-crime procedures which could be adopted.  However, more often than not a victim is left entirely in the dark.</P>
    <P>While the holding of a case <i>in camera</i> is welcome and of fundamental importance, if we believe that the holding of a case <i>in camera</i> is as much as we can do to help the victim we are mistaken.  While giving a broad welcome to section 10, I believe we can do far more to aid and assist the victim rather than leaving it and the case being held <i>in camera.</i>  I hope the Minister will give some thought to my comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is not relevant to section 10, I welcome the opportunity to put it on the record that in future the Director of Public Prosecutions proposes that when it has been decided that a case is being prosecuted on indictment and a Book of Evidence is being prepared, all proposed witnesses, except gardaí and certain professional witnesses, would be sent a copy of their statement on which will be endorsed a request to study it carefully and notify any alterations or additions which the witness may wish to make to a named prosecuting lawyer, usually a State solicitor.  This will be in addition to the complainant receiving a copy of his or her statement at an earlier stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is further proposed by the Director of Public Prosecutions that a pre-trial <Col N="1853" /> consultation will be held with all witnesses at which they would collectively be asked if their evidence would correspond with their statements and, if not, to specify variations.  Of the proposed arrangements, only the supplying of the statements to the witnesses has so far been implemented to any extent.  However, it is hoped to implement the arrangements in full very shortly, and in particular with the passage of this Bill.  This will ensure that in sexual cases there will always be contact between a complainant and the prosecuting team.  In addition, what I could describe as a familiarisation course wil be made available to the complainant in sexual cases in which the lay-out and the procedure of the court will be explained to her and in which she will be advised in very general terms of the type of questions which she might be asked.</P>
    <P>I am sure that these arrangements will go some way towards reducing and relieving the trauma and anxiety of the victim which are inevitable in trials of this nature.  There is a need for the greatest attention to be given to the position of a victim who has gone through the horrendous experience of an assault and who then find themselves in completely strange surroundings facing the accused. That is what is intended here, and I gather it is what Deputy Flanagan had in mind. I can assure the House that that is what we are trying to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have opened up the debate under section 10, which deals with how trials of rape and serious sexual assault cases should be conducted.  Section 10 proposes the almost complete exclusion of the general public from the hearing, admission being only at the discretion of the trial judge.  I believe this is prompted by the desire to make the surroundings and conditions of the hearing conducive to the victim and any other witnesses being called in evidence, so that they would be at ease and in a position to give free and voluntary evidence to the trail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to amendment No. 15 in my name which deals with one of the related issues which has now <Col N="1854" /> been mentioned by the Minister and Deputy Flanagan, that is, how the victim might be dealt with at a trial.  I accept that the Ceann Comhairle has ruled my amendment out of order, and I do not seek in any way to challenge that.  Nevertheless the Minister might look at this important issue of legal representation on Report Stage.  The case has been very strongly made to him by the Rape Crisis Centre and the issue has been pursued with an unerring commitment by people active in the field.  It deserves attention here.  The Ceann Comhairle has come to the conclusion that my amendment should be ruled out of order in that it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer.  As a member of the Opposition I am not in a position to move such an amendment.  I had attempted to avoid this difficulty by suggesting that any legal advice would come from the free legal aid scheme, but of course if the workload is increased the cost to the Exchequer will be increased indirectly.  My hands are tied but I am asking the Minister to look at the issue.  In view of the concern he has expressed, he might come back with a formula on Report Stage.  It is an issue which will not easily go away.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has a desire to lay down rules and directives on work practices, the matter is entirely outside his control and he cannot lay down how prosecutors will conduct their business in advance of the trial or on the day of the trial.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in his office and cannot be told by the Minister or by any Member of this House to lay down guidelines for the employment of counsel in court.  In any event, counsel in court consider themselves to be independent of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. They are instructed through the Chief State Solicitor's office, accept the brief and then work independently of all.  They are answerable only to the rules of ethics and of the courts.</P>
    <P>While the Minister would like to see certain work practices such as pre-trial consultation with the victim about his or her statement, about the conduct of the trial and the witnesses to be called, there <Col N="1855" /> are two hurdles, namely the independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the less emphatic but very definite fact of life, the view of the Bar that they have their own rules of etiquette and that the Director will not tell them how to conduct their business. The view of the Bar is that contact between the prosecuting counsel and the victim must be kept to a minimum because they should never leave themselves open to the suggestion that they would in any way coach or prepare unduly the victim for presentation at the trial.  There are real difficulties here. While respecting the Minister's intentions, the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the rules of practice at the Bar, the importance of the concept I advocate in this amendment deserves consideration by the Minister.  I hope he will indicate that he will return to this matter on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the trauma that can be endured by a complainant during a rape trial.  In many ways she may feel that she is on trial and I can understand that she would wish her point of view to be put forward.  This is the intention behind the amendment which Deputy McCartan has been discussing.</P>
      <P>The question of separate legal representation for complainants was examined by the Law Reform Commission and very strongly rejected.  They raised the question of the constitutional propriety of the proposal and referred to the serious uncertainty as to the effect it would have on the trial of such cases and the possibility that it might so complicate the hearing and alienate the jury as to result in the unjustified acquittal of the accused. The Government, in the light of the Commission's recommendations, decided against the provision of separate legal representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission were of the view that this problem could be adequately redressed within the confines of the existing system.  That was the approach I advocated earlier in relation <Col N="1856" /> to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In the real world the Director of Public Prosecutions can talk to his prosecuting team.  The procedures I have outlined which it is intended to follow are being drawn up and will be put into operation. It would be ludicrous to suggest that the Director of Public Prosecutions would lay down guidelines for his own prosecuting team which they would refuse to obey. They might refuse in one case but he has the right to keep his prosecuting team and it is highly unlikely that they will go against him.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the consciousness of the trauma that is endured by a complainant during a rape trial, it is important that in advance of the trial there should be familiarisation courses available during which the layout and procedure of the court would be explained.  The victim should be advised in general terms of the type of questions she might be asked.  The intention is to remove the psychological pressure of going into a courtroom for the first time and being faced with the accused.  We want to ensure the maximum possible assistance, comfort and reassurance to the victim of the horrendous crime of rape or aggravated sexual assault.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendments regarding familiarisation with the procedures.  This is the most frightening and alienating experience of the rape victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This part of the Bill is very important. We applaud the exclusion of the public from hearings, except for named people. In the interests of reporting and making public the court procedures it is important that we allow bona fide representatives of the press to attend.  I do not know whether the Minister can do anything in this regard but studies here, even of the most cursory kind, and indepth studies carried out in Britain by the press show that rape cases are used as sheer titillation by the majority of the press. The most salacious and sometimes damaging aspects of the case are headlined, without the feelings of the victim or of the <Col N="1857" /> alleged rapist being taken into account during the court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Recent evidence of the monitoring of rape cases in Britain &mdash; shown in a television programme recently &mdash; demonstrated that the reporting of the salacious and sexual aspects in the tabloids there &mdash; if I may describe it as such &mdash; was covered fully.  Yet two newspapers only within the overall national press in Britain carried through a process of reporting, not merely the court proceedings but the actual evidence taken and final result.  This demonstrated the total lack of importance attached to the court proceedings, indeed to the victim and even the alleged assailant.  It clearly showed that the press overall were not interested in reporting the case as a legal process or even for the common good but did so merely to gain cheap headlines, very often at the expense of the victim.</P>
    <P>Some group would appear to be endeavouring to do something about that aspect <i>vis-á-vis</i> our press; perhaps this is not a fault of our national press. However, I have been sent many headlines, pages of provincial newspapers that have reported local rape cases and in my view, the only future for the victim would be to emigrate or to move from that area because of these damaging press reports; they even reported alleged conversations and so on.  We are here endeavouring to minimise the trauma on potential victims, yet in this press coverage that trauma has been maximised causing victims enormous suffering.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of what Deputy McCartan had to say in regard to his amendment which was disallowed.  I know the Minister is aware of the importance the rape crisis centres attach to separate legal representation for victims of rape in court proceedings.  Without delaying our Committee Stage discussion, I too would call on the Minister to give great thought to that aspect before Report Stage.  In support of that request I might give the Minister the benefit of a little information.</P>
    <P>In October 1987, as Chairwoman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights I had a meeting with the Director <Col N="1858" /> of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Eamonn Barnes.  Subsequently he made a public comment with regard to his ideas on the reform of the law in regard to rape.  The first thing he had to say was that he recognised he did not have any real authority in regard to reform of the law, saying that changing the law was a matter entirely for the Government, the Department of Justice, the Law Reform Commission and the Oireachtas.  He went on to say that, in regard to this area of legal representation &mdash; from his experience &mdash; in rape cases where the defence lawyers may be allowed, at the discretion of the judge, to question the woman about her previous sexual history, there could be a case made for permitting another lawyer, not the prosecuting counsel, to represent the woman at that stage.  He said he would not be in favour of a third legal team from start to finish but said that this limited form of representation might help to safeguard the position of the victim and argue her side of the case so that the woman would then be, and be seen to be, properly represented.  I pay great attention to that public comment of the Director of Public Prosecutions which he made available to a national newspaper.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge on the Minister how important it is that a victim be properly represented, and, even in such circumstances, we should take on the costs from start to finish and perhaps even conflict between the legal procedures of defending Counsel.  In saying this I believe I am reflecting the enormous concern not merely of the rape crisis centres but also of future victims of rape.  I refer to the fact that it has been accepted in natural justice that a judge may, at his or her discretion, decide that the sexual history of the victim would have to be gone into although the sexual history of the defendant cannot be investigated. Perhaps the Minister would give serious thought to special legal representation for the victim at that part of the trial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the last point I might say that the judge and prosecuting counsel are already under a duty to protect the witness from unfair or irrelevant <Col N="1859" /> cross-examination.  The existing legislation, being strengthened by this Bill, includes further restrictions on the right to corss-examine a complainant on her previous sexual experiences, a restriction which I believe to be very important. Coverage of rape cases by the local media takes us back to section 9, in that we would be in the Central Criminal Court, away from the type of local coverage that has existed heretofore.  In defence of our national media I should say they have been very responsible in their coverage of rape cases.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined what the Law Reform Commission have said and the strong view they took on this matter.  In the light of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission the Government decided against a provision on separate legal representation.  However, I might point out that the Law Reform Commission, in their consultation paper, said that it is already perfectly permissible for a woman who has been raped to consult a lawyer and to bring a lawyer with her, in the capacity of a friend, to the court during the hearing of a trial. Therefore, a woman has that right as of now.</P>
      <P>I am studying this area of the law as it pertains to the provisions of this Bill and all that is contained in them, particularly for Report Stage.  I am not sure what I may be able to do to meet some of the points Deputies have raised in the area of sentencing.  When one gets to the sentencing stage various people doctors, sometimes clergymen, friends of the accused, perhaps employers and others &mdash; are brought into court to give the defendant character references which might have an influence on sentencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect I feel has not received fair consideration &mdash; and I have discussed this with a number of people who have been involved in these cases &mdash; is the rights of the victim in regard to the trauma she may have suffered in relation to the sentencing. I am thinking of the right of a doctor to come forward and say that as well as the accused having been found guilty, this victim has suffered such <Col N="1860" /> psychological damage it will remain with her for X amount of time.  I had a discussion recently with the mother of a young girl who had gone through this experience.  The mother had been in court and, as she described the proceedings to me, she said she had wanted to scream to get the point across of the damage that had been done to her daughter while, on the other side, a case was being made about the character of the accused, the effect prison would have on the accused and so on, but nobody was defending the position of her daughter. That is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know what I will be able to do about that.  However, I can give the House my assurance that I will examine it and give my further comments on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>In his last comments the Minister has summed up exactly what those of us who have been seeking independent legal representation for victims would have said, and indeed what the rape crisis centres have reiterated.  They have highlighted the fact that the victim, the witness, sits rather helpless, tending to feel isolated and marginalised throughout the whole of the court proceedings. The Minister has explained the feeling in a rather graphic way, indeed what the mother of the girl to whom he spoke felt.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether what he read into the record will form part of the regulations to be made under the provisions of this Bill?  Perhaps he could explain that matter more fully.  I do not know if it is going to meet the perceived needs of the Rape Crisis Centre.  Perhaps we were best to agree to these proposals. I accept the Minister made them very well-meaningly and perhaps we should see how they work.  In my opinion this will be a long way removed from the existing situation.  If in the course of time it is deemed as not going far enough perhaps we can look at it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have gone on to an amendment that has been ruled out and we are really discussing section 10.  It is very welcome that this is going to be an absolute procedure, that the cases will be <Col N="1861" /> heard <i>in camera.</i>  I have a couple of questions on that.  Will it be possible for either team, prosecution or defence, to challenge some person who is in with one or other?  The provision is for &ldquo;a parent, relative or friend of the complainant&rdquo;. Will there be rules on this court procedure subsequently?  Will one be able to object and want all those attending the court to be accounted for?  I am wondering out of curiosity.  Family law cases have been heard in camera for some years now and there are no newspaper reports on them.  Why is this different?  We have to have media reporting of cases, but by what rationale can you say they are excluded from family law cases with the same requirement that anonymity is respected, and not excluded in this case? As my colleague said, you have to go down the country and buy a provincial paper to read the gory details of reported rape cases.  I am always amazed at the incredibly gory detail that is reported particularly in papers outside Dublin. The national papers have a very responsible role which they play well.</P>
    <P>I welcome this provision and I am happy about it.  I hope there will not be challenges to anyone who might reasonably want to be present with the victim.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that he is going to look further at this section on Report Stage. While he has indicated he will go in a certain direction, I share the views expressed by my colleague here that full legal representation would be by far the most desirable reform.  Let the Minister be in no doubt that as long as he goes in that direction we are happy.  Only this morning while I was at the hairdresser's I read in <i>Cosmopolitan</i> a little article by a woman who had been raped.  She said her problem started once she had got past the sympathetic female police officer who interviewed her initially.  Immediately she encountered the traditional police interviewing and was asked very searching questions about her motives and involvement.  Uniquely, compared with <Col N="1862" /> any other victim, the rape victim's problems start early on in the whole process of dealing with a case.  Therefore, the right of legal representation is one all those who have been directly involved see as extremely important.  I support the case being made in relation to this and I ask the Minister in his further deliberations before Report Stage to go as far as possible down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to mislead the House.  I emphasised that the question of separate legal representation was examined by the Law Reform Commission and was strongly rejected by them.  I had gone the road of discussions with the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to having improved familiarisation and care and attention given to the victim of rape.  I have my personal views on the situation of the victim at sentencing time, that is a specific point within the hearing.</P>
      <P>The question was asked as to why discretionary power was being given to persons other than officers of the court, those directly concerned and the press to attend proceedings.  In all proceedings other than where applications are made under sections 3 or 4 of the 1981 Act, officers of court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, the press and a friend/ parent of the complainant and of the accused, if under 18, will have the right to be present.  However, there may be circumstances where persons other than those just mentioned may wish to attend the proceedings and have a valid reason for doing so.  For example, there may be persons involved in research of a legal or scientific nature.  It may be desirable to have a medical person present if a person involved in the proceedings is unwell.  It would not be feasible to foresee and list every such circumstance, therefore the court is being given discretion to decide what other persons may attend in the light of the circumstances in each case. This follows the pattern as provided for in section 20 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated he will be looking before Report Stage at an aspect of representation in the area of sentencing.  I ask him to look again at what I suggested in my amendment. I do not go as far as the cause of the Rape Crisis Centre to the extent of saying that representation should involve a right of hearing or a right of argument at trial.  That is why subsection (2) of my amendment provides they would have the right of consultation.  The Minister pointed out correctly that a victim has the right to bring a friend by way of lawyer to court.  That person clearly would be someone allowed in by the judge throughout the hearing.</P>
      <P>However, there is the question of cost. Lawyers do not come without price and I suggest in the amendment that any such befriending or accompaniment might be provided through the legal aid scheme. In my view it would not represent a very onerous imposition on the existing scheme or on the Exchequer.  Therefore, the Minister might look at it, recognising the right to bring the friend along as a lawyer, or a lawyer as a friend, whatever way, it is.  He might look at the question of extending legal aid in that area.  It would require changing the regulations in a small way.</P>
      <P>Regarding the right to be consulted, even though the friend as lawyer or lawyer as friend would come along he or she might not and would not necessarily have the right to approach privately or discretly the prosecution or the Garda and ask where the case was going and what was happening.  The Minister might consider giving them that right in addition to the right of being present.  However, I am not arguing for that.  I do not go the full distance in regard to it because I acknowledge the constitutional and pragmatic problems of the conduct of trial that the Law Reform Commission rightly talk about.  I make the point that my amendment does not suggest anything of the sort.  There are one or two aspects the Minister could bear in mind in looking at the Bill for Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be pleased to look <Col N="1864" /> at that matter in relation to the legal representation and the cost of that in the number of cases involved.  I will glad Deputy McCartan has made the point that major constitutional questions were raised by the Law Reform Commission in relation to the right to participate in a trial.  I do not see that I will be able to include that but I am prepared to look at the question of examining the possibility of altering the regulations to facilitate the situation that prevails to allow a person who is a victim, who has been raped, to consult a lawyer and to bring the lawyer with her in the capacity of a friend to the court during the hearing of the trial.  I am prepared to look at the cost involved in that under the criminal legal aid scheme and I will report back to the House on Report Stage.  I am very anxious to see that when we bring this legislation through the House it will be as caring and victim orientated as we can possibly make it, and that is what we have being striving to do.  I believe also that the new rules and regulations and familiarisation programme being laid out by the DPP will go a long way towards meeting some of the concerns and the trauma of the victim.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fennell asked about the press. Normally the press are not allowed attend <i>in camera</i> hearings.  However, I feel it is important that in rape cases the public should be made aware that such crimes are prosecuted and what the outcome of those prosecutions are.  It is important that the public should know not just of the actual crime but that there is a follow up prosecution, that the person who is found guilty of it faces the full rigour of the law and that the press be there for that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1A) All such applications for leave of the judge under subsection (1) shall be made at the commencement of the trial, in the absence of the jury, and shall require the person making the application to call such evidence and lay such facts and arguments before the judge to justify the making of the application.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment speaks for itself and proposes that where the defence are contemplating bringing up previous sexual history and other related matters, they <Col N="1866" /> be dealt with on a single application at the commencement of the trial and in the absence of the jury.  This is to ensure that this issue is determined at the outset and that the victim knows his or her position on entering the witness box and is not faced with the defence, half way through the prosecution, changing direction because they are not making progress in one particular direction, namely, towards issues of fact, what occurred on the occasion of the alleged rape, and going after the good character of the victim on the basis of his or her previous sexual behaviour.</P>
    <P>We believe that the springing of the tactic of going after the good character of the victim is fundamentally unfair, often encapsulated by the victim coming out of court and saying that the cross-examination, the surprise element, the trap and all that were worse than the original heinous act itself, the subject of the trial. We are proposing that such applications, where they are contemplated, should be made at the commencement of the trial so that the lines are clearly drawn so that the victim who is subject to the pressures that a trial necessarily draws down on him or her, goes into the witness box with some indication of where he or she will stand with regard to cross-examination.</P>
    <P>We are putting this amendment forward on the basis that there is a fundamental difference between cross-examining a person with regard to facts that happened on a particular occasion and cross-examining that person with regard to their previous, often unrelated and far removed experiences in the past with the defendant or indeed with anyone else.  We can differentiate between the trap or surprise being brought on an issue of fact and that of seeking unfairly, having brought the witness into the witness box and having gone in a certain direction, to change course in mid-stream seeking to make the witness in the witness box ill at ease.</P>
    <P>I believe this is a fair proposition and one that should commend itself to the Minister.  It is one that has been strongly argued for and the reasons for it better <Col N="1867" /> put by people who know more about this than I or anyone else arguing here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was being drafted consideration was given to including a provision of this type.  However, it was decided not to do so because it could impose unfair restrictions on the defence and it would not be of great practical benefit to the complainant.  In any event it is undesirable that such an application be made <i>in vacuo</i> and outside the context of the trial and evidence.  There are all sorts of practical disadvantages in having the application made in advance of the trial.</P>
      <P>Also a provision of this nature would be likely to promote such applications which, according to the Law Reform Commission, have been very few in number since, if there is any theoretical possibility that the defence may wish to resort to this option, counsel would have to protect his client by applying on a contingency basis.  The application, at least in most cases, would be of a hypothetical nature.  If an application were to be refused before the trial commences matters may emerge in evidence which would alter the position.</P>
      <P>It would appear, in any event, that the amendment put forward by the Deputy would be unfair if not unconstitutional as it does not allow an accused person to make an application during the course of the trial in any circumstances.  The Law Reform Commission, in their recommendation, were very careful to ensure that such an application could be made during the course of the trial, but the special leave of the court would be required.  One could easily envisage circumstances where information might come to light in the course of the trial which was not available to the defence at the outset and which would justify an application.  To prohibit such an application, as Deputy McCartan proposes, in all circumstances would strike me as an unjust and undue interference in the right of the accused person to conduct his defence.  I, therefore, have to oppose the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come back briefly on this because were I to remain silent my silence might be interpreted as agreement with the last words spoken.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Law Reform Commission say that the application should normally be made.  That is their recommendation.  We, as legislators, have to see if that can be translated into a provision that will fit neatly into a statute. On behalf of The Workers' Party I adopted the position that an absolute decision on this should be made at the beginning of the trial because I believe it is a net issue.  There is the victim on the one hand and the defendant on the other and this should be an issue well capable of determination at the outset or well before any trial.  It should be possible to determine whether there are previous relationships, facts or information available to the defendant that would justify the defendant raising this issue of previous sexual behaviour at any stage of the trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not something that can emerge, if one likes, out of a fishing expedition, and should never be facilitated, in the conduct in the course of a trial.  That notion of a fishing expedition was put to bed a long time ago &mdash; since 1981.  We have got away from this notion that it is fair game to go in there and find out everything possible about the woman &mdash; always the woman heretofore &mdash; by firing in the old gratuitous question about previous sexual relationships.  We have got away from that.  I am saying there is an issue here as to whether rape has been committed and one is then talking about whether there was consent.  The defendant should, in my view, be well armed in advance of any trial of all the information relevant to this issue or question of previous sexual behaviour.  Consequently there should be a global application that can be held in reserve.  Supposing they have information but are not clear whether they should use it, they can get clearance from the judge at the outset on that issue.  The defence will know where they stand but, more importantly from our point of view, victims will know where they stand.  The defence will have this information in their <Col N="1869" /> armoury and can elect at the appropriate time to use it.</P>
    <P>The idea of putting the victim into the witness box where she or he is on their own, and then springing the trap on them is unsatisfactory and unacceptable.  For that reason the argument that one should allow the trial run its natural course is too clever and is tilting the balance unnecessarily. The proposition that I have advanced might be better subject to a proviso that special leave can be sought from the judge.  I would be happy if the Minister indicated that he will consider this matter before Report Stage. However, I am convinced that the issue is a net one, does the defence have information that justifies the pursuit of this type of issue?  If they do they disclose their hand at the outset, get permission from the judge and then decide during the course of the trial whether they will use it.  The amendment is a worthy one. I am not dissuaded by the fact that the Law Reform Commission have brought in a rather inelegant term, &ldquo;should normally be made&rdquo;.  What is &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and what is not &ldquo;normal&rdquo;?  How would a judge work on that?  The Minister should consider this before Report Stage with a view to including the proviso, &ldquo;subject to special leave of the court during the conduct of the trial&rdquo;.  I will be happy to withdraw on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the final word might be seen as assent, I would emphasise that there can be no question of springing traps as was mentioned.  All such applications must be made to the judge in the absence of the jury to protect the interests of the complainant and therefore, there is no question of springing traps.  As I have said, detailed consideration was given to this.  The Attorney General was strongly opposed to the proposal to include it and I agreed with him.  He pointed out that it was not practical to determine such an application in advance of the trial.  He thought it would be inevitable that the trial judge would adjourn his decision to the appropriate stage in the trial.  The proposal would compel the accused person to <Col N="1870" /> decide on the form of his defence before the prosecution had adduced any evidence at all.  It would seem that the defence would have to make such an application in every case just to keep their options open.  Even if the judge decided against the application at the outset, matters could unfold during the trial which would force him to reconsider the application during the trial.</P>
      <P>Even ignoring the practical difficulties that would arise, and without going into the possible constitutional implications of its effect on the conduct of the defence of the accused, there does not appear to be any great advantage for complainants in insisting that such applications are made at the outset of the trial.  I would remind the Deputy that all such applications must in any event be made in the absence of the jury to protect the interests of the complainant.  Therefore, the question of somebody springing traps on the complainant in the witness box does not arise.  That would be unacceptable in the context of the legislation and the care aspect that was fundamental to our thinking in the drafting of the legislation.</P>

I accept that my amendment is too absolute and, therefore, I withdraw it.</P>

      <P>If the Minister's thinking is to stand, the previous sexual experience of the victim might be raised.  With changing behavioural patterns in our society many victim are likely to have had previous sexual experience which may or may not be relevant to the case. This raises the issue dealt with in the last section which is the need if not for legal representation certainly for legal advice. The handling of this issue would be crucial to the outcome of any trial.  The Minister said he might consider the issue <Col N="1871" /> of advice as distinct from assisting a victim to gain access to advice.  This is another matter that would be central to the case and advice would be absolutely vital in the context of a victim versus a skilled attorney.  It emphasises again the issues raised in the last section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 7 of the 1981 Act, which <Col N="1872" /> deals with the anonymity of complainants, residual authority is vested in the trial judge that in the public interest he may direct that detail be published that could potentially lead to the identity of the complainant or victim becoming known.  The term &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo; is too loose, non-specific, and is a cause for concern.  There should be an absolute prohibition against information being released under any circumstances that would lead to the identity of the victim or complainant being known publicly.  For that reason the proposal which I put forward on behalf of The Workers' Party should be included.  That would ensure that nothing would be done that might lead to the identity of the complainant being publicly known.  That is a very important assurance that a victim should be given when facing the difficult time of attending a police station, giving a statement, attending for examination and, ultimately, attending the public trial.  She, or indeed he in time, should be assured that in coming forward to make a complaint and give evidence their identity will not be made known publicly.</P>

      <P>Section 13, which amends section 8 of the Principal Act, deals with the anonymity of the accused.  Under the existing law, there are restrictions on the publication or broadcasting matters likely to identify a person accused, but not yet convicted, of rape. At present these restrictions may only be lifted on the application of the accused himself or another person charged with the rape offence at the trial.  Although it has not yet happened, as far as I am aware, circumstances could arise where a person charged with rape might escape from custody before the conclusion of the trial and it would seem absurd that, in such circumstances, information which might lead to his apprehension would not be published because of the provision of section 8 of the Principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 of this Bill, therefore, proposes that the restrictions on the information regarding identity of the accused <Col N="1873" /> could be lifted on application by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As I said, this provision deals only with the anonymity of the accused and has no direct implications for the anonymity of the complainant.  Apart from the fact that the amendment is technically faulty, a blanket prohibition of the type proposed by him would not be acceptable in any circumstances.  Indeed the proposed amendment would directly contradict section 7 of the 1981 Act.</P>
    <P>The fact that a husband can now be convicted of raping his wife has, however, caused me to look again at the anonymity provisions to make sure that they are watertight, particularly with regard to maintaining the anonymity of the complainant.  I am satisfied that these provisions are generally satisfactory.  I say &ldquo;generally&rdquo; because I have some reservations about two matters.  First, section 8 (2) of the 1981 Act allows an accused to apply to a court to have his anonymity lifted for whatever reason he wishes, but the section does not give the judge any discretion in the matter.  The provision may need some tightening up to ensure that the lifting of the accused's anonymity does not also, unwittingly, lead to the complainant's anonymity being lifted.</P>
    <P>The second matter which might need to be looked at results from the fact that the anonymity of the accused does not last beyond conviction.  While section 7 of the 1981 Act respects the anonymity of the complainant it clearly continues to apply even after an accused has been convicted, but the reference to the acquittal only of the accused in section 7 (4) might give the impression that that provision has no application after a conviction. Perhaps section 7 (4) should merely refer to the outcome of the trial. I will look at this matter and I will refer to it again on Report Stage.  It is a question of making it watertight, which is what we want to do.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1) The Director of Public Prosecutions shall be entitled hereinafter to appeal to a higher court all sentences, imposed under this Act or the Principal Act, which he considers to be unduly lenient or inappropriate.</P>
      <P>(2)  A higher court shall mean in respect of all matters heard before the District Court, the Circuit Court and in all other matters the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
      <P>(3)  Application for leave to appeal against an unduly lenient or inappropriate sentence shall be made by or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions to the trial judge at the conclusion of the hearing or within seven days of the conclusion.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a vitally important issue and I am glad we are getting the opportunity to address it here in the context of this Bill. I was worried that we might not have got this far and I hope that the proposition here will not present any difficulty to the Minister.  I hope he will accept what is being sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any argument at this stage against the suggestion <Col N="1875" /> that, in circumstances where the Director of Public Prosecutions is unhappy with the propriety of leniency of a sentence imposed in a court, he should not have the right to have that sentence reviewed by a higher authority.  It is proposed under subsection (1) that the Director of Public Prosecutions shall be entitled hereinafter to appeal to a higher court all sentences imposed under this Act or the Principal Act which he considers to be unduly lenient or inappropriate.  Subsection (2) clarifies the matter: cases from the District Court are appealed to the Circuit Court and cases from the Central and Circuit Courts are appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  There is also a requirement that, under subsection (3), the Director should indicate his intention to seek such a review within seven days of the conclusion of the trial.</P>
    <P>I have confined the amendment to deal with sexual offences or offences under the Acts as they now stand because, to do otherwise, would fall foul of the ruling that this is wider than the intended scope of the Act.  However, this principle should apply to all criminal offences but, in the context of the Bill, I am confined to its terms of reference and I wish to argue the proposition here.</P>
    <P>In the area of sexual offences in the last number of years, a special case is emerging because they have been unbelievable instances of inapprorpriate and unduly lenient sentences imposed in criminal trials, almost to the point of scandalising the community.  I am thinking of three particular instances, the Kilkenny case to which I referred earlier on is one.  A suspended sentence of three months was imposed on a soldier on conviction, after trial.  The circumstances were well known and I do not have to go into unnecessary details.  Two other cases in my own constitutency come to mind and the Minister referred to one earlier. The first case concerns a young man who was convicted on a plea of guilty before the Dublin Metropolitan Courts of sexually assaulting his next door neighbour. He was given a suspended sentence and sent back home, which is next door to <Col N="1876" /> that of the victim.  It has taken eight months of the most horrendous and traumatic experiences for the victim as she had to go through an examination, a psychological assessment and attendance at various different agencies, police stations and God knows where else before the trial.  The hearing lasted less than eight minutes and the defendant was sent back home on the day when the victim and her family believed that their lives might begin again on the departure of the accused, however temporary, to a place of detention.  It was an outrageous state of affairs and, regrettably, it led to an even more outrageous act when the home of the defendant was attacked by thugs with petrol bombs resulting in the family being obliged to move out.  All these acts were consequent on an inappropriate and unduly lenient sentence.  It should never have happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear that in mind. My final case refers to Mr. Justice Roe who, on his last day on the Bench before retiring, imposed a sentence of three years in open court which was subsequently in chambers, without consultation, reduced to 12 months.  The defendant was let out on early release by the Department or the Minister in advance of serving his full term.  The mother of the victim, whom I believe the Minister met and indeed referred to earlier on, first learned in the newspapers that the defendant would be coming home and living in close proximity to his victim, on the Friday before the Monday he was released.  It was the first that the Garda, the prosecution or the victim knew that the sentence had been altered. The director had no power, authority or function to proceed.  In any event, <Col N="1877" /> because the sentence had been shortened by ministerial order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will explain it because my understanding is that the sentence was reduced to 12 months and that he was released after serving nine months.  The only way that could have happened was by way of ministerial order.  However, I should welcome clarification because it is a very disturbing matter.  Two of the three cases which I mentioned originated in my own constituency and they illustrate the fact there seem to be occasions when our courts can get matters wrong by whatever series of events or throw of the dice.  I do not suggest an impropriety or lack of professionalism on the part of the Judiciary, but the throw of the dice can on occasion throw up a result that goes against the better judgement or the better view of the interests of the community, and here the director should have an active role to play.  There is not any constitutional bar to this proposition.  It is a proposition that is universally supported and now demanded.  I can anticipate a difficulty arising here because of the way I am confined to introducing a proposition relating to offences under this Bill, as it could be argued that there is a constitutional problem because we are treating one group of offenders differently from another.  Again I suggest that it is open to the Legislature within the constitutional parameters, to provide different rules with regard to the sentencing of offenders.  For example, first time offenders could be sentenced to community services, fines and so on and repeat offenders could be sentenced differently. That argument does not carry weight.  Where the common good is best served we can introduce a regime appropriate to the offence.  There is now a special case with regard to sexual offenders, although I would be happy to see this proposition universally applied. The Director of Public Prosecutions should have the power to appeal undue leniency and inappropriate sentencing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment. My opposition is not based on any rejection in principle to what it seeks to do.  It may well be that a system of appeal against what are seen to be over lenient sentences along the lines proposed by the Deputy is a good idea not just for the range of offences covered by the amendment but for all serious offences.</P>
      <P>I accept that occasionally cases arise in which mistakes are made and sentences are imposed which do not appear to fit the crime.  There is no doubt that these cases can reflect badly on the courts and I agree with the Deputy that we must look at the legal system to see if we can devise a procedure by which these mistakes can be corrected or avoided.  In an area like this where there are complex issues to be addressed, legislation should only follow detailed and expert examination. Furthermore, for the purpose of dealing with these issues, no distinction can be made between sexual and other offences.  As the Deputy is aware, the question of sentencing policy including the issue of whether the prosecution should have a right of appeal against sentence has been referred to the Law Reform Commission.  The processes employed by the commission are ideally suited to the examination of such matters. They can research the area thoroughly, canvass views from a wide range of interested parties and are also in a position to consider the problem in its widest context.  As I have indicated there is more to be looked at than just the question of over lenient sentences.  It would therefore be precipitate and wrong to proceed without awaiting the commission's recommendations.  In that regard, I am sure the House will be pleased to learn that the Commission's examination of sentencing procedure is well under way.  I can assure Deputies that when the report is published I will act on it expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair referred to a long and well justified tradition in the House that individual court decisions are not criticised unless it is necessary to do so in the context of legislation or, of course, unless it related to a debate on a resolution for <Col N="1879" /> the removal of a judge from office.  The Deputy referred to three cases.  I would like to touch on one, and it is with some hesitation that I comment on the point raised by the Deputy, but a Deputy referred to the fact that I met the mother of a victim in a case.  I have received many representations from my colleague Deputy Fitzgerald, the Minister Deputy Woods and other Deputies in relation to this.  I understand the position is that the judge in the case imposed a three year sentence on the offender.  About a month later he decided to suspend the final two years of the sentence on condition that the offender entered into a bond to keep the peace.  There has been a great deal of concern expressed by many people, including the victim's mother, at the perceived leniency shown by the judge in suspending two years of the sentence. There is even more concern at the way in which the decision was reached.  I understand that the judge decided to alter the sentence in chambers rather than in open court and it was only recently that the victim's mother became aware of the change.  It is understandable that it should have caused her a great deal of alarm and frustration.  I find it difficult to avoid being in sympathy with her.  The judge has now retired and it is only fair that we should acknowledge his long and distinguished service on the bench particularly in his capacity as President of the Circuit Court.  The judge has made known his reasons for changing the sentence. I do not doubt that he did so conscientiously and in good faith, and even though many people might have misgivings about this more lenient sentence, in situations like this it is important that the feelings of all parties be taken into account.  On reflection I am sure the judge will acknowledge that it would have been better to announce his decision in open court at the time before all the parties.  If this had been done some of the alarm and frustration caused to the victim and her family might have been avoided. It is arguable whether it was lawful for the judge to have revised the sentence in this way and whether the issue should <Col N="1880" /> have been brought before the High Court for review.  The responsibility for such matters rests with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I understand he considered the point but considered that no useful or effective action was open to him.  The Deputy and the House will appreciate that whatever personal views I might have on the subject, it was not open to me to intervene in any way.</P>
    <P>In relation to the amendment, I would emphasise that I am not opposing it on the principle of what it seeks to do but for the reasons I have outlined I cannot accept it at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important parts of the Bill.  Like the Minister I look forward to the commission's report on sentencing which has given rise to much anxiety and outrage throughout the community at times.  I note that the Minister says that in this context he feels we should not differentiate between sexual and other offences.  We have written into legislation that next to murder we consider sexual offences to be the most serious crimes.  Yet, under our present sentencing policies there are huge inconsistencies.  The submission from the Dublin Rape Crisis centre to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights makes the point that up to recently there has even been early release for some of these offences and that several of the clients of the Rape Crisis Centre have given evidence that the rape was committed by men who were out of prison for holiday weekends or who were on early release.  A matter of grave concern regarding the sentencing of sexual offenders is that it is well known and accepted that this crime will be repeated against future victims unless the offender receives treatment and unless monitoring is involved in the sentencing so that the sentence will not be completed until such time as the safety of other women is assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a horrific case some years ago and it was of such concern that we debated it here in the House.  It related to a sex offender who from his record and psychiatric files was known to be capable <Col N="1881" /> of committing the crime again.  He not alone went on to commit horrific crimes and rapes against women here and in England but ended up committing murder.</P>
    <P>I cannot stress enough the fundamental difference there should be in sentencing policy between sex offenders and other offenders.  Indeed, committees have been set up in other countries to monitor such offenders and to report on them every six or 12 months.  Such offenders are only released at their discretion, and not at the end of a statutory sentence.  While we cannot pre-empt what recommendations may emerge from the Law Reform Commission, given the way the Minister has treated this Bill and I know he would agree with me, we need to monitor and focus attention on sex offenders.  Even though this may cause constitutional difficulties I am sure everyone would agree that no offender should be released.  At present people cannot prevent such releases even though other people are at risk not alone of rape but of death.  Justice means nothing as long as that is not taken in context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy McCartan.  My only criticism would be that it is too narrow and deals only with sexual offences.  Members will recall that earlier this year Fine Gael tabled a Private Members' Bill which endeavoured to do throughout criminal law what Deputy McCartan's amendment endeavours to do in relation to rape and sexual offences. Therefore, we have no difficulty with the amendment.  Following the sad rejection of our Private Members' Bill, the Minister referred this matter to the Law Reform Commission.  I would have thought he would now be in a position to advise the House when he expects their report to be published.  I would go further and ask him to give a commitment that whatever report is published by the Law Reform Commission it will be laid before the House within a given timescale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has given rise to serious concern and, given the limited time available to us this evening, I will not go into <Col N="1882" /> detail on any decision which may have been made.  Suffice it to say there is grave public concern about inconsistency in sentencing.  I say that with the greatest of respect to the Judiciary who are independent under the Constitution.  The fact is that sentencing guidelines have not been imposed by the Judiciary or by someone outside the Judiciary.  This matter must be tackled.  This is a source of concern for everybody involved and in the interests of a more consistent and concerted approach, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who himself is independent, should have the option to appeal a sentence which, in his considered opinion, is lenient.  Such a facility is available in other jurisdictions in the western world where the defendant is afforded such an appeal, but the Director of Public Prosecutions is not.</P>
    <P>The arguments put forward by the Minister rejecting the Fine Gael Bill hold no more water this evening than they did at that time.  For this reason, I fully support the amendment.  Unless the Minister is prepared to outline a timescale within which he will tackle the problem, the House should divide on this matter given its importance.</P>

      <P>In case there is any misunderstanding I should emphasise again that my opposition to the amendment put down by Deputy McCartan is not based on a rejection of the principle behind it. The Law Reform Commission examination of sentencing procedure &mdash; I share many of the concerns voiced by Deputy Flanagan; there is nothing between us on this matter &mdash; is well under way.  I want to emphasise that as soon as the report becomes available to me I will act upon it as expeditiously as possible.  I can say no more than that at this stage.  It is likely that a discussion document will be published first by the Law Reform Commission to be followed by the report.  I will act on it as expeditiously as possible because I share Members' concerns in relation to this matter.  I am sorry but I have not got a precise date from the Law Reform Commission.</P>

      <P>I, too, support the amendment and feel very strongly about this lack in our legal procedures and have spoken about it many times.  Regrettably, the consequences of this lacuna are evident in the disruption caused in the community which has been referred to in this debate.  In some instances neighbours literally took the law into their own hands.  I think we will see a repeat of this if a similar situation occurs.</P>
      <P>The issue of sentencing policy has been debated down the years.  In their submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights in 1986 the Rape Crisis Centre states:</P>
      <P>We have kept records of the outcome of court hearings in rape and sexual assault cases since 1977.  The inconsistency in sentencing for these crimes is astounding.  It ranges from a three months suspended sentence imposed on a man who raped a 13 year old girl on 4/2/1982 in Wexford District Court to a 15 year penal servitude sentence imposed on a man convicted of rape in the Circuit Court in Dublin in 1979.  In fairness to both the victim and the accused, we recommend that sentencing guidelines be established to regularise the inconsistencies which currently exist.  It is quite obvious that sentences reflect the level of seriousness afforded to the crime of rape by the particular judge presiding.  The personal whims of judges can hardly be a sound basis for fair criminal hearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible when the new section in this legislation, under which all cases will be referred to the Central Criminal Court, comes into effect there will be greater uniformity in sentencing.  In relation to the work being done by the Law Reform Commission on this matter, we encountered the same problem when we debated the Committee Stage of the Child Care Bill in that the subject matter of many of the amendments proposed was under examination and consideration by the <Col N="1884" /> Law Reform Commission.  Thankfully, their report has been presented and their recommendations can be incorporated on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister notify the Law Reform Commission that their report is crucial to this legislation and agree to a timescale so that it is presented before this legislation goes to the Seanad, where their recommendations can be incorporated by way of an amendment?</P>

      <P>It is my intention to come back to debate the Report and Final Stages of this Bill this day two weeks and then to take the Bill, as passed by the House to the Seanad.  As this Bill was introduced in the Seanad, the Seanad has to take on board all the amendments made.  I think it would be the wish of all sides of the House that this legislation would be put on the Statute Book as soon as possible.  I have set the deadline as the Christmas break, with the co-operation of all the Members who have shown an interest in this debate.  That target can be reached.  In relation to the report of the Law Reform Commission, I do not want to hold up the Bill because it is not practical to say this can be done by Christmas. I have no difficulty with appealing sentences and I can assure the House that, in relation to sentences not just under this legislation but also in criminal cases, it is my intention to act immediately on the report as soon as the Law Reform Commission give it to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In order that we have consistency in this House I want to add my voice to the demand in this amendment that the perceived or actual inconsistency in sentencing be properly looked at.  Perhaps another court can be brought into the area of sentencing and the two can undo a wrong that is perceived to have been done.  Obviously the appropriate person to do that is the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We accept what the Minister had said &mdash; that he has asked the Law Reform Commission to look at this whole area.  It was the Fine Gael Bill that initially brought this about and highlighted the problem we had seen in <Col N="1885" /> civil law cases.  The lay people in this Chamber are inclined to take a lead sometimes from what we read in the newspapers and perceive that there is an inconsistency where there may not be.  If one were to dig into some of the cases cited, perhaps we would understand why certain decisions were made and that they were not inconsistent.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless there is concern among the public about a number of cases where it was hard to square what had been decided by judges with the crime.  When the Minister looks at the various dates on the Law Reform Commission documents he will see 1987 on a consultation paper which is coming out now, but we are dealing with the problem before the final paper issues.  If the Minister puts the pressure on as soon as he gets the consultation document, he can then bring forward legislation requested in this amendment.</P>

When I contacted the Minister's office on the Monday after that particular weekend, his officials agreed to come back to me to explain how that had happened.  My understanding &mdash; and I may be wrong about this &mdash; is that it can only happen by ministerial order.

In response to the publication of the Bill in 1988 one of the first submissions I <Col N="1887" /> received was from the probation and welfare officers' association comprising a delegation of probation and welfare officers who were concerned about an issue that was not addressed in the draft legislation and which they believed was central.  I support them fully and in response to their representations I sought to draft on their behalf and on behalf of The Workers' Party this amendment.</P>
    <P>The proposal is simply to put into legislative form a condition that an offender, sentenced for a sexual offence, should have a condition attached of the obligation and necessity for an assessment of his character and behaviour and in response to that the Minister should then be obliged to act.  The proposal is that it is now acknowledged and accepted that the crime of rape and serious sexual assault is not something that is inherently in the character or make up of a person, that it has something to do with a mental abnormality or deficiency but that it is an acquired behavioural trait based on aggression of one individual towards another, primarily aggression of the male upon the female.  Because it is acquired in the community and in the society in which the offender has moved and lived, it will remain there and will have a bearing on the offender once released unless something is done while that person is in custody.  Unfortunately, it appears that this proposition has not come home to the Minister or his Department.  I raised this matter on Second Stage and I quoted at length from Ray Wyre's document and research in England to illustrate the point because it is not something which I would claim to be an authority on but I feel very strongly about it, and he put the issues succinctly.</P>
    <P>Concluding Second Stage the Minister had approximately a one or two sentenced response that this issue was not germane to the Bill.  I could not agree less with him.  It is crucial and essential that we have a proposition written into the legislation because of the way it appears the Minister's office has haphazardly and grudgingly dealt with the <Col N="1888" /> idea of the administration of justice in the prisons.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare services have been forced to take voluntary action.  The existing schemes came about by reason of their own activities carried out through their own good offices outside normal work times.  It was they who established the project scheme in Mountjoy and in Arbour Hill in an attempt to illustrate to the Minister that there was merit in the representations they had made to him, and to his predecessors, for the last number of years.  I am not saying the matter rested entirely on the shoulders of the present Minister. Given the hard way in which they had fought on this issue and had made representations, and given the rather grudging response from the Minister, this House must act by introducing a legislative requirement that it be a necessary ingredient in sentencing for the future of all offenders, including any person specifically sentenced under the régime of these Acts.  What we are saying is that an offender once convicted and sentenced an absolute condition to be attached to all sentences and the Minister must provide a régime within the prisons for an assessment and ensure in the future that all sexual offenders, once committed to prison, will be not left to languish there, serve their sentence and have nothing more done with them.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the recent welcome appointment of a director of medical services. He will have a central role to play in the development of this type of scheme. Obviously, the welfare services who are the initiators and pioneers in this area in Ireland have a central role to play and should be consulted so that when offenders are released from prison they will at least be fully reviewed, assessed and have had something done to deal with their acquired behaviour.  Otherwise, the risk of reoffence must be huge.  I do not have anything more to say on this except to remind the House of the case we debated here some years ago of Mr. George Ireland.  That should remind Members of what I am talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the need for care, counselling and attention for prisoners.  Various approaches are being used within the system at present.  For example, at present counselling is normally carried out by welfare officers, psychiatrists and psychologists.  Of course, chaplains have a particular role to play in this area.  A group approach has been introduced in Arbour Hill prison and the progress of this group will be carefully monitored to see what changes emerge. This multi-disciplinary approach is appropriate and correct.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that compulsory assessment and treatment for sex offenders should not be provided for in legislation or imposed by any other means.  A cornerstone of any programme to help prisoners turn away from crime is that the prisoner is willing to help himself.  Various groups of people are employed in the prison service to help offenders become law abiding citizens but none of these can force a prisoner to conform; he must have the will to do that himself.</P>
      <P>I note that the Deputy's amendment envisages that a scheme or schemes for the rehabilitative treatment of offenders should be established in consultation with the Director of Medical Services.  The Deputy graciously acknowledged the fact that I recently appointed a Director of Medical Services.  The House will be aware that one of the important advances for which I was responsible since I took office was that appointment.  The Director of Medical Services took up office in early October and I can inform the House that one of the specific matters to which he will be directing his attention will be the general question of appropriate counselling, guidance and so on in the case of sex offenders committed to custody.  I believe that is the right approach rather than providing for statutory compulsion of any kind which, as I have already said, is not according to the best advice available to me on approaches likely to produce the best results in the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree also that it would be less than helpful effectively to tie the director's hands by introducing a <Col N="1890" /> statutory provision to the effect that the provision of special arrangements for sex offenders in prisons should be the responsibility of a particular agency.  I presume the reference to the prison welfare service is, in fact, a reference to the probation and welfare service, which is part of the Department of Justice.  It is possible that other agencies would also have a role to play.</P>
    <P>The approach being taken of non-statutory compulsory assessment and treatment is correct.  There are human rights implications, in relation to, for example, statutory treatment.  Apart from the human rights implications, what would be the value of a mandatory requirement that psychiatric treatment be provided in cases where the medical view was that the cause of the offence did not lie in any psychiatric disorder or where, for example, an offender simply refused to speak with the psychiatrist.  In line with the general advance being made under Whitaker who recommended that a Director of Medical Services should be appointed &mdash; he has only been appointed since October &mdash; instead of imposing statutory obligations with all of the human rights implications of that, it is better to leave the care, treatment, guidance and improvement of the position of the offender so that he, on his return to society, will no longer be involved in such horrendous crimes, to the Director of Medical Services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's response in so far as he does not believe there should be a statutory provision in this area, in debating legislation like this we have a responsibility to put down markers and to give pointers as to what we believe is necessary.  This should be elaborated on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that some commentators felt so badly about the crime of rape that they urged that those convicted of rape should be left to rot in jail, as it were.  This is a wrong approach.  It is shortsighted because people cannot be kept in jail forever.  If rapists serve their due time in jail, they are entitled to be released. <Col N="1891" /> However, these offenders have a tendency to repeat the crime.  The Minister should concede the statutory provision we are seeking so that it would be an intrinsic part of policy in sentencing in rape cases.  With all due respect to the Minister, I do not believe chaplains are the people who should deal with these offenders.  A chaplain may be able to look after the spiritual needs of prisoners in this category but in my opinion he would be ill-equipped to give the kind of counselling and therapy these men need.</P>
    <P>When I was in my car the other day I was most impressed by a radio interview &mdash; I think it was on &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;&mdash; given by a woman from, I think, the probation and welfare service, who does this counselling work in one of the prisons &mdash; I think it was Arbour Hill. This woman has been working for a number of years with child abusers and rapists who are in prison.  She explained in detail the type of work she does and said that months of counselling have to be spent trying to get the men to accept that the nature of what they did was wrong.  In most instances they cannot accept this, even in the case of child abuse.  They are able to rationalise and put the blame on the victims.  In 60 per cent of cases they believe that the victim was to blame.  Very intricate, detailed and professional work has to be done by special highly trained people.  The woman who is doing this work, and who explained it very well on radio, is doing an invaluable job.  That is the kind of help which should be available generally to anybody who is sentenced to prison for a sexual offence.</P>
    <P>I support the motivation behind this amendment.  We have to take due notice of it, however it is done.  If it cannot deal with this statutorily then it should be done with the agreement and active co-operation of the new Director of Medical Services in Mountjoy and the probation and welfare personnel involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill would be complete if this amendment was added to it in some form.  We should get a much <Col N="1892" /> stronger statement from the Minister that he is instituting what the probation officers suggested to him.  If treatment is not mandatory, convicted rapists should in some way be made attend treatment centres so that they can be evaluated. Experience has shown that prisoners who do not receive treatment are liable to repeat the offence when they are released.  The opposite is the case with those who have accepted treatment.  Very definitely they can benefit from such treatment.</P>
      <P>Having gone through the Bill and the Minister having accepted various amendments from the Opposition, a much stronger statement should go out to the public that there is a method of treating rapists which can be of assistance, rather than the treatment which Deputy McGahon put forward as ideal.  The debate on this Bill should not be known as having provided one simple solution to a complex problem.  We should have a firm statement from the Minister that treatment is available for people who transgress in this area.  Their families suffer greatly from their acts and they would like to know that the offender is not simply thrown into jail and forgotten, which would probably lead to his emergence from prison with far bigger complexes than when he was committed.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that the probation and welfare officer's opinion should be closely looked at and if possible accepted by the Minister and that there should be a comprehensive treatment section in the Department.  When the Minister spoke on the Estimate a year ago he promised that this would be done but we know that promises, particularly in the health area, have not been carried out.  This crime is not the same as others; it has an effect on many people beyond the victim and transgressor.  The Minister should ensure that proper treatment is available for offenders which should be strongly recommended to the transgressor when serving his sentence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of Deputy Kavanagh, who has taken such an interest <Col N="1893" /> in this legislation, and for the House generally, I emphasise that rehabilitative treatment is essential for offenders.  I agree that it requires very intensive work with the offenders.  An experimental project was undertaken in Arbour Hill Prison in October 1988 by officers of the probation and welfare service with nine sexual offenders.  The project consisted of 36 sessions spread over a 12-month period.  A second project for a further ten sexual offenders is due to finish next month.  These projects require firm and sustained commitment on the part of each of the offenders involved and for this reason offenders taking part must do so voluntary rather than statutorily.  The time commitment involved for officers in running a project for a group of sexual offenders in prison is considerable.  Such a project requires months of pre-planning and when it gets under way, apart from the actual group sessions, time must be allocated before each session for preparation and further time after each session to assess progress.  A group consists of no more than ten voluntary participants and officers of the service who undertake such a project do so in addition to their normal duties.</P>
      <P>Management of the service have a serious responsibility to ensure a balance between the provision of specialised projects for small groups and the provision of an adequate on-going service for all prisoners.  The current experimental project for sexual offenders in Arbour Hill Prison is due to finish in December this year.  When the programme outcome is known and written up, the probation and welfare service management will review and evaluate the project in association with the recently appointed director of medical services.  I assure Members and the general public that the care and rehabilitative treatment of sex offenders is a priority item for the new medical director, but by its nature it must be voluntarily rather than statutorily done. That is the only point of disagreement we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says a statutory programme is not appropriate. <Col N="1894" /> I agree fully with Deputy Fennell that as a House we should put down a marker. My amendment suggests that the only requirement should be that the offender be subject to assessment and, where appropriate, provided with a course of treatment.  If on assessment an offender says he is not interested or if it is found that a different course of treatment might be available, that action could be taken. I am not suggesting that we frogmarch offenders into a course.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to impose on the Minister an obligation to put in place a scheme.  The experience of the probation and welfare service to date has been that the point of the scheme has not come to the attention of the Minister. There has been an element of reluctance and they have had to fight hard.  In view of what the Minister has said today &mdash; and perhaps it is my fault that I am only becoming aware of this new commitment on the part of the Minister &mdash; I am happy to withdraw this amendment and to talk about it again on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I adverted to the fact that there appeared to me to be some contradiction in terms in regard to the introduction of this Bill in the first place in that its mover, Deputy John Bruton &mdash; now Leader of Fine Gael in <Col N="1898" /> which position I wish him well &mdash; declared that in 99.9 per cent of cases he did not see any problem with the local selection committees of VECs in putting the best prospective teacher into any given post. Nonetheless he appeared to have a very serious problem with 0.01 per cent of cases.  He reckoned this required us to change the whole system inside out to deal with what he regarded as a suspicion of political interference, or an idea in somebody's mind that he or she had not been appointed to a post because it happened that there were politicians on the relevant selection committee.  I know that, when one is going forward in Leadership elections, one must pander to minority interests now and again but I contend that that was taking the matter to an absolute extreme.  I find it difficult to comprehend why it is necessary to seek to change present procedures when one has problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> 0.01 per cent of cases only.  I know that when somebody mentions 99.9 per cent of cases usually he or she is using a figure of speech. Nonetheless such comment does indicate that, to all intents and purposes, there is nothing wrong with the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is even more intriguing is to discover that, on looking at the Official Report of 30 October last, Deputy Bruton, in proposing this amending Bill &mdash; that of allowing the Local Appointments Commission to deal with the appointment of teachers &mdash; said at the end of his contribution that, if the Minister had any problems with the Bill, that is that the Local Appointments Commission would replace the Vocational Education Committee selection committees, he would be prepared to listen to amendments tabled on Committee Stage. We now find ourselves in circumstances in which Deputy John Bruton, the proposer of this Bill, in the first place says there is nothing wrong with the system in relation to 99.9 per cent of cases, then introduces a Bill to put the Local Appointments Commission in their place, then says, before concluding his remarks, it need not necessarily be a Local Appointments Commission but <Col N="1899" /> somebody else, anybody except a politician. Of course what Deputy Bruton selectively omitted to say was that there is a very senior official of the Department of Education who serves as a member of every Vocational Education Committee selection committee.  Deputy Bruton also omitted to say that a chief executive officer serves in an advisory capacity and, in the case of some Vocationalo Education Committees, is a member of the selction committee.</P>
    <P>That brings one to pose the question: what is the point in introducing this Bill in the first place?  As I said last week, the big plus factor in Deputy Bruton's candidature as Leader of Fine Gael was the fact that he is an original thinker.  If one puts forward the proposition that, in 99.9 per cent of cases there is no problem encountered but that nonetheless one wishes to change the whole system inside out on that basis, that is original, that bears the stamp of an original thinker; it might not make much common sense but is original if nothing else.</P>
    <P>It is about time Fine Gael decided where they stand in relation to the democratic control of education.  I contend it is very important that we have a Vocational Education Committee system allowing local representatives have a say on behalf of the people who should teach in their schools.  It is a non-selective system, one which has given an awful lot to Irish education.  I served as a member of that system at one time.  As a local representative, I understand the importance of local decision-making.  Indeed that lends credibility to appointments in that they are the local representatives, plus a senior official of the Department of Education, who decide who will teach in vocational schools.  I fail to see how it would be in any way more democratic to have a centralised bureaucracy, such as is the case with the Local Appointments Commission, deciding who will teach in our schools when it is admitted by the proposer of the Bill that, in 99.9 per cent of cases, there is no problem encountered <i>vis-à-vis</i> such appointments.</P>
    <P>The whole logic of this Bill escapes me. <Col N="1900" /> Of course people like Deputy Bruton and others on the opposite side of the House contend we should give more powers to local representatives, that we must democratise the system, decentralise it but, heavens above, we should not allow them appoint teachers to our schools. That is quite a contradictory position to adopt.  Of course the impression is being given that, based on some suspicion, or on some figment of the imagination &mdash; since there is no hard evidence to suggest there is anything wrong with the present system; in fact Deputy Bruton states there is absolutely nothing wrong with the present system &mdash; the vocational education committee system is engaging in some type of time war, that they wish to retain some type of oblique patronage system which there is no evidence to suggest exists in the first place.  In fact the vocational education committees, the IVEA in particular, brought forward a very progressive document for discussion at special Congress at the end of this month, seeking to further democratise the system, to bring about new local education authorities, not restricted merely to the vocational education committee system but to primary, second-level and any tertiary education that exists within the area of operation of any vocational education committee.  In fact that proposal seeks to widen the representation in those local education authorities. It seeks to introduce representatives of trade councils, of parent councils, management associations, to deal with education on the ground on behalf of the people they represent.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to listen to politicians who seek to equate political activity in the area of education as being in some way wrong or open to suspicion. It is about time politicians, at national level, began to trust local politicians who, let it be said, put them in here in the first place.  It is about time national politicians, far from decrying their local counterparts, sought to back them up in the very limited area of activity in which they have discretion.  The whole idea in so far as this party is concerned is to <Col N="1901" /> give more discretion and responsibility to local politicians.  We must remember that, at the end of the day, they are not awaiting the cheque at the end of the month unlike their national counterparts. It is time politicians ceased to say of other politicians: if you become involved in this you will leave yourself wide open to any charge even though we agree that such charge is unjustified.</P>
    <P>It is about time leading politicians, particularly leaders of political parties, began to practise what they preach and not come into this House seeking to take away the very limited discretions available to local politicians while on the other hand talking about decentralisation and increasing powers at local level.</P>
    <P>My attitude to this legislation is one of contempt.  It is claimed there is support among the TUI for such a change.  Certainly I have not been lobbied by any member of the TUI to change the system, neither has it been indicated to me by any member of the Teachers' Union of Ireland that anything untoward has happened in my Vocational Education Committee area or in anyone else's.  I am not prepared to change legislation or a long established procedure within the vocational education committee system on the basis of someone's suspicion or grievance because he or she did not get a job.  I can name any area of political activity where such a grievance would exist.  If ten houses are to be given out by a county manager and there are 40 applicants he can put only ten families into ten houses and there will be a sense of grievance somewhere.  It is wrong to suggest that local representatives or the local selection committee will have any consideration other than the best educational reasons for appointing any teacher.</P>
    <P>The other bogey argument raised on Second Stage is that if a teacher had a certain political activity or political bent, that will deny him a fair hearing at a selection committee.  That is an outrageous remark.  Teachers at every level of the system, be it first or second level, are very much involved in politics.  There are many teachers on all sides of this <Col N="1902" /> House who, of course, are members of political parties and I am sure they never felt their jobs were at risk because they were politically active.  By the nature of Irish society teachers are very prominent, properly so, in every aspect of our public and local community life.  It is totally a bogeyman argument to suggest that because someone has a particular political bent he will be denied the prospect of a job.  It comes back to the argument that if one is involved in politics one is in some way tainted.  No politician should come into this House and make such suggestions without credible evidence, and the proposer of this Bill, the Leader of the Opposition, has no evidence.  He has mentioned a figure of 0.01 per cent of the cases; in fact, he has mentioned two cases out of I do not know how many appointments made.  As a member of the Vocational Education Committee, at every meeting I can put forward five or six temporary appointments, part time appointments, temporary whole time appointments and permanent appointments and not once is any of them questioned. Never does any member of the vocational education committee question such appointments.  It is outrageous to come into this House and say that there is a suspicion, that some poor devil did not get a job either because he was of some political persuasion or none.  You cannot come in and seek to undermine the vocational education committee selection committee system on that basis. Come in here with hard evidence or do not come in at all.</P>
    <P>The IVEA have put forward a very progressive document which seeks not only to widen the representation as regards policy decisions for local educational interests in any county but is proposing on the other hand to devolve even the power of appointment down to the local management committee of each individual school which again would involve representative vocational education committee management associations, teachers, etc.</P>
    <P>I find it amazing that the &ldquo;alternative Taoiseach&rdquo;, as he is now, has come into this House, proposed legislation to be <Col N="1903" /> changed, provided no evidence, accepts that in 99.99 per cent of the cases there is no problem, seeks to change the system inside out, then says at the end of his speech that he is not insisting that a local appointments commission would be the necessary mechanism by which this would be done, and finally seeks to involve a centralised bureaucracy which would not meet local needs.  In my understanding of the Local Appointments Commission it could take months to get a decision.  In the event of a teacher being absent or being required by any vocational school, are the Opposition going to wait for the Local Appointments Commission to make the decision or are they going to allow local representatives and the Department of Education officials to sit down and appoint a teacher which, in the words of the proposer of this Bill, in 99.99 per cent of the cases is the correct decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Cowen for his words of congratulation to our new Leader, Deputy John Bruton, however qualified they were.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton brought this Bill before the House after giving it detailed and careful consideration.  On the last occasion on which he addressed this House on this Bill he mentioned two instances where strong evidence was available to suggest that malpractice had taken place in the appointment of teachers.  He mentioned those as examples of what is happening in the system and what can happen on a day to day basis within the present system, not as the only two examples but as two of what he considered to be very many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to express my views in support of this Bill.  I would like at the very outset to state my position quite clearly.  I together with my Fine Gael colleagues, urge all parties within Dáil Éireann to support this Bill introduced by Deputy John Bruton and supported in principle by the Labour Party, The Workers' Party, the Progressive Democrats and, I remind Deputy Cowen many members of Fianna Fáil, when first <Col N="1904" /> brought before this House in 1989.  A clear mandate at that time was given in principle to this Bill and it appears both facile and superfluous that objections should suddenly appear in relation to a very obvious anomaly in our local authority legislation which has existed for over 50 years and has generated untold hardship, suffering and downright abuse in the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>This Bill raises a very fundamental question: why should one section of our community be treated differently from another, when a local appointments commission does exist and is capable of dealing adequately with appointments in so many other areas and yet teachers in our vocational sector are treated differently and, I may say, unfairly in many instances?  The reason for this is that teachers in the vocational sector are subjected to at times biased and often hostile appointments boards, who are neither impartial nor in many cases qualified to make judgment on personal skills or professional capabilities, yet an appointments commission exists which includes people who are trained and capable of selection within every other area of local government.  As a former member of Tipperary North Riding Vocational Education Committee and of the subsidary appointments board I have a knowledge of the behind-the-scenes activity that takes place and the pressure placed on selection committees.  I have, down through the years, witnessed unseemly rows where politicians were compromised, talented people rejected for spurious reasons, with accusations of patronage rife with the unfortunate outcome that students and the educational system suffered.  The existing situation is invidious and grossly unjust.  The major question remains as to what benefit the politicians have received.  The answer is, nothing but abuse and confirmation for the public that the old colonial cliches of &ldquo;pull&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jobbery&rdquo; are alive and well in contemporary Ireland.  Is this what legislative politics is about?  Do we wish to be reduced to moral misfits whose only function is to &ldquo;look after the lads&rdquo;?  Is that the kind of ideal we should be aspiring to <Col N="1905" /> as politicians?  I firmly believe that we should not.</P>
    <P>This amendment, though only a small issue in relative terms, is an opportunity for us to show people that we have the best interests of the public at heart.  I therefore call on this House to uniformly support this amendment and bury any personal interests that may exist.</P>
    <P>There are of course many other reasons why this Bill must be passed.</P>
    <P>I should have said at the outset that I wish to share my time with my colleague from Tipperary South, Deputy Therese Ahearn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very desirable that such requests be made at commencement. The Chair usually likes to put these questions to the House to get formal approval for them.  Otherwise it is taking the function of the selection of speaker from the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my wish.  I beg your indulgence on this occasion, I will get it right the next time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also has an effect on public and professional morale.  In the light of recent political events, it is vital that we restore credibility to the political process.  As a body, we must be seen to do the right thing and there have been many examples during the past 30 years where appointments have been controversial to say the least.  The most recent that comes to mind was the appointment of the vice-principal to St. Kevin's Community College, in Clondalkin.  As long as politicians remain on these appointment boards, controversy will continue.  All local authority officers are appointed by an independent non-political commission.  Why can this not exist for Vocational Education Committee teachers?  Vocational teachers at second and third level are appointed by an interview panel consisting, in the main, of politicians.  There are verifiable cases of political interference in appointments and bizarre examples of promotions. Appointments and promotions are surrounded by rumours which all too often are accurate predictions, and very few Vocational Education Committees <Col N="1906" /> operate the &ldquo;canvassing will disqualify&rdquo; rule.  Stories, however accurate or inaccurate, verifiable or unverifiable, circulate of unfortunate answers, slips or gaffes made by applicants at interviews. Teachers have the right to expect professional standards of interview and confidentiality. Since they have lost confidence in the system surely considerations of morale alone should ensure a change in the appointments system.</P>
    <P>Teachers in our society have been subjected to much abuse in recent years. Accusations of inefficiency, malpractice, lack of sensitivity and corporal punishment have had the effect of dehumanising the teaching profession in Ireland.  Teachers seem to be fair game for parents, the media and the law courts. The Vocational Education Committee appointments system only further accentuates the low profile of teachers and demeans their status in our society.  Even where an appointment is scrupulously fair, as in the vast majority of cases the suspicion still exists that influence may have been brought to bear, given the nature of the system.  This is demoralising for both those appointed and disappointed and undermines the vocational education system both at second and third level.  I know, from talking to teachers, the anger they feel as professionals to be treated in such an unprofessional manner when seeking appointments or promotion.  Many do not bother to apply as they feel it would be a waste of time.  I can fully understand and appreciate their predicament and their cynicism.  It simply is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Irish people today demand professionalism at every level of human activity, whether it be from politicians, or publicans.  Teachers are expected to be even more so.  They must be able to teach, be sensitive, act as parental guides, counsellors and mentors for today's youth.  If this level of professionalism is demanded publicly, then we as legislators must show the same professionalism in appointing teachers.  Let those who are qualified and less susceptible to outside influence or prejudice appoint the guardians of our youth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1907" /> The present system is damaging to local democracy in that it gives credibility to the view that it exists for jobbery and subverts the true importance of local democracy and decisions made by local representatives.  I have long been an advocate of the view that politics at a local level should not be reduced to getting planning permission for one client or water rights for another.  These rights that people should have irrespective of what influence is brought to bear, are enshrined in our Constitution.  Ordinary people at local level should not have to depend on local politicians for things which they are entitled to anyway.  The same principle applies to this amendment. The structures are there and it is neither necessary nor desirable that politicians should have such a direct influence over the mechanisms of democratic process.  The present system is additionally unfair to scrupulous local politicians in that it puts them in the invidious position of having to listen to representations by or on behalf of those seeking appointment or promotion who feel that in the light of the prevailing practice it is expected that they should make such approaches to politicians.</P>
    <P>Politicians are often accused of poor judgment.  It is indeed the yardstick by which we are measured as a body.  If we say or do the wrong thing we are quickly censored.  Yet, as a body, we sit in judgment on others in areas where we are unskilled and in many cases incompetent. Interviewing and appointing teachers requires skills of a high order.  It requires training for the interviewer in interviewing techniques, analysis of capabilities required, the applicants' capacity to fulfil those requirements, the applicants' ability to cope with added work stress, a knowledge of personality types and their implications, a professional understanding of the teaching profession, school and college administration, discipline, curricula, responsibilities, priorities, the nature of the job to be undertaken and so on.</P>
    <P>In my own experience, as a member of a vocational education committee <Col N="1908" /> appointments board, there were times when I felt inadequate and under-qualified in the above areas, and on occasions it was quite obvious to me that the applicant in front of the interview board was quite aware of the shortcomings of the interview panel also.  It devalued both the exercise and the applicant.</P>
    <P>The expertise can be, and is, available through the Local Appointments Commission. It is certainly not provided in the unskilled, non-professional and reactive type interviews provided by local politicians. A perfect example of the incongruity of this system is explained by the fact that, although a chief executive officer is appointed by the commission, a principal of a vocational technical college or a large school where salaries are similar to that of a chief executive officer must be subjected to the rigours and insanity of a politically dominated committee.  On national terms this reflects my earlier point about individual injustice and subversion by local democracy.  It has also been noted on a broader level that the ESRI identified the vocational education committee appointments and promotions procedure as one of the main reasons for the failure to get community colleges accepted within urban centres, as distinct from community schools which are not controlled by the vocational education committee.  This is also damaging to public sector education and local democracy.</P>
    <P>On a national level this Bill has many implications.  First, it highlights the vocational education committees and focuses attention on the negative side of public sector education.  When employees distrust a promotions procedure or any management mechanism, the natural human response is to become alienated from the system, and indifferent to challenges and responsibilities within it.  No system can afford to allow itself alienate the confidence and enthusiasm of its workers due to real or imagined malpractice.  This is particularly true of the educational system where challenges and responsibilities are rare and where financial incentive is not a <Col N="1909" /> major motivator.  Cynicism in the teaching profession is a terminal disease.  The level of cynicism in society is also the politician's measure of his own success and credibility.  Most people who do not vote, for example, have lost faith in our political system and belief in the word and promises of our politicians.  Cynicism is the politician's real enemy.  This Bill, if passed, would restore credibility and reduce that level of cynicism in one key sector of our community.</P>
    <P>Second, on a national level the vocational education committees have failed to develop any system of criteria on factors which indicate the route to promotion or employability.  This failure has resulted in a major loss to the system in terms of productivity because genuinely ambitious but scrupulous teachers could not see the route to promotion which would serve to encourage greater effort.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, this is an issue which, as I have said, has been evident for 30 years, with many incidents countrywide.  It is not, therefore, a local issue.  There are, as may be argued, good and bad vocational education committees but this is not the haphazard way in which we should be moving.  A local appointments commission would by-pass individual problems and seek the general good.  This type of activity only encourages the catch-cries of jobbery and patronage and leaves us continuing with a procedure set up by the English administration for the purpose of controlling appointments on religious grounds or otherwise.  Is this the policy we wish to inherit?  Is this the colonial legacy we choose to inflict on our fellow countrymen and on future generations? I do not believe so, and I am convinced that the Bill merits the support of the House on those grounds.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the Bill within the European context.  How would our European colleagues view such an archaic and unprofessional anomaly in our appointments system?  If we are serious in our role as legislators we must support the Bill and show our European colleagues that politicians in Ireland are committed to democracy at national and <Col N="1910" /> local level.  I have outlined a very considered case in favour of supporting this legislation.  I am aware that there are objections to it and I would like to deal with these briefly and indicate how they can be refuted.</P>
    <P>Some people may argue that the Local Appointments Commission are too slow and cumbersome.  This point can be contested on three levels.  First, due to the educational cutbacks the number of appointments is small and could be handled adequately by the commission.  At present the commission have no mechanism for the appointment and promotion of teachers but they are prepared to establish such a mechanism and consult with the employers and unions about the setting up of such an apparatus.  If the House can agree in principle to the Bill on Second Stage this would mean removing appointments from the political arena. Discussions could then begin between all interested groups before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are also those who argue that a change in the appointments system will weaken democratic control of education. However, local democracy would be much better served if the Bill is passed. In terms of education, the appointment of one teacher over another is not a matter of public policy.  Public policy is what local government is all about.  The only criterion for appointment is suitability for the job.  This is a matter for experts, not local politicians.  As I have clearly stated, this Bill will strengthen local democracy by enhancing the image of community colleges and by removing the whiff of jobbery that clings to the system.</P>
    <P>Finally, any objections made at this point on the basis of party allegiance or otherwise would indeed be sad considering that almost all parties agreed to the Bill in principle in 1989.  While Fianna Fáil did not agree, they did not oppose the Bill.  I urge all Members to support this Bill which represents a step forward.</P>
    <P>Every Bill presented to the House must be given equal value and consideration. Democracy is only served when vigilance is guaranteed at every level of our <Col N="1911" /> society.  If we wish teachers to promote democracy in our schools we are obliged to provide an appointments mechanism that is equitable and fundamentally democratic.</P>
    <P>Such a mechanism would benefit the working of our system at a local level, free politicians to do other more valuable work, end the individual elements of pull and patronage in our system, and encourage the evolution of local democracy in a more open and free manner.  It would give politicians more credibility and allow skilled people appoint vocational teachers, a group of professionals who play a vital role in our community.  On a national level, it would generate a positive attitude among people towards the body politic and undermine the cynicism that exists.  It would give greater status and morale to the teaching profession and encourage incentive for promotion and success among teachers generally. On an international level, we would be seen in a rightful role as legislators, providing structures for the healthy development of democracy at all levels here. Finally, this anomaly in our system must be eliminated simply because it can and does lead to biased and discriminatory activity and has consistently done so for more than 30 years.  That is too long and it is time for such colonial legacies to end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Lowry for sharing his time with me.  The Bill is not an attack on vocational education committees, or an attempt to undermine local democracy.  It is not, as claimed by Deputy Dempsey last week, aimed at casting a slur on teachers appointed by the present system to our vocational education committee schools. I was a vocational school teacher, I am a member of the Teachers' Union of Ireland and I am also a member of South Tipperary Vocational Education Committee. Therefore, I speak not only with personal interest but also with practical experience.  My unique position allows me to state, without fear of contradiction, that there is enormous unease and dissatisfaction among vocational education <Col N="1912" /> committee teachers with the present system of appointments.  Furthermore, I know, as do the Members who are opposing the Bill, that the majority of interviewing boards are politically loaded. Based on this fact is it any wonder that so much doubt, suspicion and fear exists among applicants for vocational education committee positions, having regard to the possibility that political rather than educational factors will determine an appointment?</P>
      <P>The job of the vocational education committees is to ensure democratic control of education.  The members' role is to act as a watchdog for the public and ensure that the best possible education is available to all who attend our vocational education committee schools.  Their job is not to administer and should not be to appoint teachers.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer, and staff, administer the local vocational education committee system, based on guidelines agreed by members of the vocational ducation committee, just as the county manager and staff do in a local authority. Why then should a vocational education committee have the authority to appoint when no such powers belong to a local authority?  Vocational school teachers are the only group of officers in the local authority service still to be appointed by politicians.  We, the Members of the Oireachtas, do not appoint the civil servants to the various Departments.  We decide the policy and the Civil Service administer that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same principle should apply to vocational education committees.  The members should decide policy but, as in all other areas, they should not appoint staff.  Most members of vocational education committees are good at working for the general good of the public and in ensuring that good, sound education is provided for students, but the majority have no special training or expertise to deal with the appointments of teachers.  They have no training in interview techniques and little or no knowledge as to whether an individual applying for a teaching position has the required skills for the job.  Applicants <Col N="1913" /> for teaching positions always have the educational qualifications to do the job, but there are many other qualities necessary to be successful.</P>
    <P>As well as subject knowledge, a person needs skills of communication, inter-personal skills, ability to discipline, and control, to motivate, stimulate, coax and uplift.  Above all they need to have the stamina to face a full and, more often than not, over-crowded classroom every day, year after year, classrooms of students who are full of energy.</P>
    <P>There are vocational education committee appointment committees round the country who do not have even one member, apart from the chief executive officer and an inspector, who has ever stood in front of a class, were not in front of a classroom for 20 years.  How can they be expected to know the calibre of a person needed to cope with teaching today?  Under the Vocational Education Act, 1930, vocational education committees have the right to co-opt members to the committee with special expertise. I am sure it was visualised that they would have a role in the appointment of teachers, but we all know what happens. Solid party people &mdash; usually men &mdash; of the political party which controls the vocational education committee are appointed as a sort of thank you for services rendered.  This, of course, totally undermines an admirable principle that was part of the Vocational Education Act.</P>
    <P>The appointment of teachers must be an educational, not a political matter. Furthermore, interviewers should be actually involved or have practical experience in education.</P>
    <P>For my own part &mdash; and from my experience in a vocational school &mdash; I believe the principal of any school should have a role in the appointment of teachers.  The principal is a person who knows the type of student in the school; the principal is a person who knows the type of character to inter-mix with the rest of the staff; the principal is a person who could determine what applicant is best for the education in the school.  Unfortunately, in the present <Col N="1914" /> system, the principal does not have a role.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposed by Deputy John Bruton will remove not only the suspicion but also the possibility of any political influence.  The present system, whereby teachers seeking promotion to principalship, vice-principal and indeed to those nameless posts just called A and B, appointment to which, in the final analysis, rests with politicians, is unhealthy.  Indeed, much can be judged from the fact that those interview committees, as selected by the Vocational Education Committee, proceed to interview for posts of responsibility where the nature of the post is not known by the applicant or indeed by the interview board.  That must be changed immediately. It is not possible &mdash; and indeed it is inconceivable &mdash; that an applicant for a principalship of a large vocational school can be interviewed by members of an interview board who never stood in a classroom, who know nothing about the environment of school life and who are unskilled in requirements for inter-staff relationships, never mind appreciating the needs and requirements that such decisions require.</P>
    <P>The real contradiction lies in the fact that the appointment of the CEO is not made by the local Vocational Education Committee.  If, as the Minister asserted in her speech, the present appointment of vocational teachers is the essence of local democracy why then does she not extend it to the appointment of the CEOs?  The present system is unhealthy but the Minister does not have the courage to change it.  Surely everybody, even those opposing this Bill, must admit that it is distasteful to see highly qualified graduates driving round the countryside and visiting the interview panel in order to state their case?  Any system that leads to, or worse still, encourages this type of canvassing is wrong and that is what the present system encourages.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the majority of appointments to Vocational Education Committees are correct and above board but, unfortunately, there are unpleasant examples as outlined by Deputy Bruton <Col N="1915" /> in introducing the Bill.  Deputy Cowen said that perhaps 99 per cent of the appointments are correct but surely he must agree that even one appointment made on any basis other than on merit is a grave injustice to the applicant?</P>
    <P>The appointment of vocational teachers must operate under rules, procedures and criteria laid down by an independent, non-political body.  The most important factor in all this is that the teachers have lost confidence in the system.  Because of the excellent education they have imparted over the years they deserve a fair and independent method of appointment.  On those grounds, I urge the House to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an gceist tábhachtach seo. Bearing in mind that he is the originator of the proposed legislation, one must immediately congratulate Deputy Bruton on his elevation to the leadership of the second largest party in the House and wish him well in his efforts to improve the lot of the people.  Having said that, I will return to the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, on the basis of this legislation, Deputy Bruton intends to proceed as leader of his party he will fail because, on his own statement, the standard of excellence which he requires is not possible. Here I take slight issue with Deputy Lowry who said that Deputy Bruton gave two of several examples.  He gave two specific examples, details of which, he said, were available.  One referred to 1987 and the other to 1979.  If Deputy Bruton is sincere and concerned that there should be this excellence which he thinks is possible, there was an obligation on him to move earlier and to deal in another way with the Bill before us.  It does not require legislation because, in the presentation of this Bill before the House, he is affronting and doing a disservice to one of the greatest elements in our educational system, vocational education.  It exists, not for teachers or politicians, but for students.  Can anybody here demonstrate that in that area <Col N="1916" /> of education the students of this country, who before that had been left aside by the prevailing system, did not get value from it?  I was a part of that system as a school principal, appointed by a Fine Gael committee, but they did not appoint me because of my political persuasion, they appointed me because they knew I would do my best to serve the system.</P>
    <P>What is the perception of Deputy Lowry and Deputy Ahern of education? Why would they dismiss people from contributing to it who had been elected by their neighbours, thousands of people? Are they saying that their contribution would reflect on the quality of the voter, that they would return a person devoid of an opinion as to the suitability of a teacher under the system?  It is not the politician who gives qualifications to the teachers, teachers are already there, having graduated from our third level institutions.  The obligation on the public representative is, as far as he or she can, to adjudicate on the general suitability of the candidates before him or her.</P>
    <P>In the words of Deputy Bruton himself, the system has been 99 per cent successful but he would now jettison it because he asserts there is a possibility that the public are distraught about the manner of the appointments.  By their fruits you shall know them.  The fruits of that system are there to be viewed by everybody.  I have become cynical over the years, not with public representatives but with public representatives who seem to indulge in self-denigration.  There is nobody more important than the person who comes before us as the elected representative of the people.  While every other profession is prepared to laud its virtues and to admit its omissions, will we perpetuate the cynicism outside the House that politicians are fit for nothing and not capable of making a decision without being influenced by political considerations? We condemn all when we condemn one.</P>
    <P>I ask Members to consider their remarks in respect of their own profession, not as teachers but as politicians, especially in view of the fact that in vocational education there was an <Col N="1917" /> awakening and an awareness which had not been manifested anywhere before.  I do not accept that the interpretation of what is educationally suitable is the preserve of the academic.  For far too long we have seen what has happened and that academics, if they had their way, would substitute a new type of capitalism for education and would charge the maximum for giving it.  That applies to all professions.  Here we have a type of education which has benefited the vast majority of children of PAYE taxpayers. We are now throwing cold water on this system because of the fact that there is a type of a &ldquo;dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean eile&rdquo; that there was somebody appointed, whether in Tipperary or somewhere else, who was friendly with the politician. What politician in his or her senses would agree to the appointment of a teacher on his political affiliations?  I would say that there is not anyone in the Fine Gael Party, not anyone in The Workers' Party or the Labour Party and I would be very disappointed to think that there was anyone in the Fianna Fáil Party who would do it.  Imagine a member of a vocational committee &mdash; and this is the assertion &mdash; who would place the presumed interest of his political party ahead of the interest of the students who should be the beneficiaries under the system.</P>
    <P>If I were to operate in the illogical fashion that seems to be the purpose of Deputy John Bruton, I would endeavour to introduce legislation here that would provide against a situation that occurred in my constituency during the recent election when a teacher at primary level told students to go home and tell their parents not to vote for a certain candidate because he told a lie.  I do not condemn all teachers because I am aware of one teacher who did that, but I will tell the House I will pursue that to the point where, having assembled the evidence, I will take whatever action I can against a particular teacher.  Do I introduce legislation because of a situation at a personal or private level, when my daughter who is attending a convent school here, during the times when circumstances in our party were not dissimilar to those which <Col N="1918" /> existed in the Fine Gael Party some weeks ago, is asked by a teacher, a political activist for some other party, &ldquo;now what does your daddy think of Mr. Haughey?&rdquo;  Was I expected to run in here and look for legislation rather than go to the school and insist that my daughter be taken from that class?</P>
    <P>I have given time to the House to think about what we are doing.  What we would presume to do here is on the basis of rumour, on the basis of catering for some presumed cynicism that exists.  If we give way we are perpetuating the feeling outside. We should ask for the evidence.  I, too, am a former member of the Teachers Union of Ireland and I know them as well as anybody else who speaks for them.  We have all been defeated at different levels and we naturally take refuge in some form of consolation and will say &ldquo;I would have got it only for ....&rdquo;.  Is that the basis of this legislation?  I am afraid it is.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to talk about education and to define what it is.  Is it that which I referred to earlier, a new capitalism, which I am afraid it is.  Is it free as we claim it is?  It is not.  That is a fallacy.  Exposing students to the same curriculum does not guarantee equality in education.  Is there a return for the investment we make in our graduates?  Is that what education is about; the new-found, new fangled idea of making education relevant and presupposing that we do nothing except produce specialists in certain areas and that we leave aside the humanities?  Is that what we are talking about?</P>
    <P>Here again, I yearn for and want the retention of the public representative who will guarantee that education is what it should be, and that we are not concerned about academic pursuits alone but about preparing our young people for life, for their occupations and for leisure time which everybody knows is increasing at a dramatic rate.  Here again, I see the importance of having on committees of selection people who are not academics but who are well rounded people, people like Paddy Donegan, a former trade union official who served with me on the Dublin City Vocational Committee.  He <Col N="1919" /> would not claim to have been a graduate, a professional, but there was no better man in deciding on the suitability of any teacher to serve the purpose, to serve the great needs of the young people of this city and indeed students who came from elsewhere.  Would we dismiss him because he had been invited on to the committee by the Labour Party as their representative?  Would we say to him or to the late Jimmy O'Keeffe and other great people of that time, &ldquo;while you were there you were a party to the appointment of teachers on a political basis?&rdquo;  I hope this great House will be here to interpret real needs.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to keep looking at the clock.  With the permission of the Chair and the agreement of the House I propose to share my time with Deputy Michael Kitt.</P>

      <P>I gather that Deputy Durkan will give the House the benefit of his views.  I have heard the views of Deputy Brian O'Shea, a man for whom I have great respect.  Are these Deputies convinced that because of facts known to them it is essential now that we jettison or bring discredit to a system of education that has served our people so well?  I do not want to do their thinking for them but if they look, as great statesmen before them have done, into their hearts they will have to agree that there is not the need to do so.  If they are privy to information and details on which they can base a better case than Deputy John Bruton, they should let the House or the Minister have it, but they should not take away from that aspect of education, the important ingredient which it has, different from all others, the voice of the people, <i>vox populi</i>, there to interpret, better than I see it and more idealistically than any academic or anybody else, what education is about, and the need it should serve.  The proof is there in the countless number of students, the products of that system of education who responded to <Col N="1920" /> the system.  They were guided by the teachers appointed under this system, now belatedly discovered by 0.01 per cent of the people as being defective and which it is said should be jettisoned.  That is the basis on which this proposal is before the House.  Is it a sound basis?  If we accept it as being sound, think of its application throughout society and every other area because that is the decision, as I would see it, the Deputy is being asked to make and that is the basis on which it has been brought before us.</P>
      <P>Apart from the loss, which is the whole purpose for my breaking with tradition and coming in to address the House, the Deputy should think about what he is going to do to that aspect of education which is at the moment and has been flowering.  Is the Deputy going to blight it by saying &ldquo;a whole lot of things were wrong because public representatives, good lay people, were involved in the appointment of teachers&ldquo;?</P>
      <P>My first concern is for education and students and my second concern is for public representatives.  I have said and continue to say that until politicians establish an institute for themselves we are going to have a perpetuation of this system when in response to a whim a politician thinks he is serving his cause or his party's cause and would then presume to be serving the cause of education or the people he represents by denigrating himself and his colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I too wish to congratulate Deputy John Bruton on his election as Leader of Fine Gael.  Along with Deputy Bruton, I have been a member of the Council of Europe for the last year and he has certainly done very well as rapporteur on the Culture and Education committee.  Indeed, he has done far better than in bringing this Bill before the House.  I totally oppose this Bill and it is only right that I should say here that teachers in the vocational education system are of the highest calibre.  There has always been keen competition in relation to appointments within the vocational educational sector <Col N="1921" /> and we have excellent teachers as a result.</P>
      <P>These teachers were appointed following an interview with a committee comprised not only of politicians elected by the people but also of Department inspectors and representatives of the IVEA.  No reference has been made to this interview system by many of the speakers in this debate.  This system was introduced by the late Donogh O'Malley in 1967 and amended by Deputy John Wilson in 1979.  It is not as time-consuming as the one operated by the Local Appointments Commission.  Local knowledge is required, which representatives on the committees have.</P>
      <P>In my own county there are vocational schools on the Aran Islands and Cornamona. In each of those areas a specialist teacher of the Irish langauge is needed and I am not sure if the Local Appointments Commission could select the person needed by those schools.  The teachers, the committee and in particular the selection committee have been unjustifiably castigated in this debate during the past two weeks.  The selection committee select a candidate who is appointed by the VEC having undergone a fair interview.</P>
      <P>I should also make the point that there are six members of the TUI on the County Galway Vocational Education Committee, one of whom was chosen by the TUI.  That is a very good example of local democracy and the work that needs to be done.  They have to appoint principals, vice-principals, full-time teachers, temporary whole-time teachers and part-time teachers.  I wonder how the Local Appointments Commission could deal with all those appointments and cope with the number of appointments which have to be made given the manpower shortages in the LAC.  It is also worth noting that people have to live with the appointments they make in contrast with the position under the bureaucratic LAC system.  I have great faith and confidence in the vocational education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said last week, this motion is extraordinarily selective, referring to 6 per cent of schools in Ireland. <Col N="1922" /> To her credit the Minister has always stated that she wants to devolve as much responsibility as possible in the educational process to local managements but this motion asks us to do the very opposite.</P>
    <P>I would like the House to consider the nature of appointments.  Vocational education committees may not know what their requirements will be for a particular year until close to the start of the new school year.  In recent years there has been an increase in the number of students repeating their leaving certificate and we also have the very popular VPTP schemes.  Other vacancies may arise during the course of the year.  For example, if the B post teacher gets the A post, there will be a vacancy for a B post teacher.  Likewise, if the A post teacher becomes vice-principal there will be a vacancy for an A post teacher.  If the vice-principal is appointed principal there will be a vacancy for a vice-principal and so on.  The Local Appointments Commission would not be able to cope with the large number of vacancies that arise during the course of the school year.</P>
    <P>No reference has been made either in this debate to some of the other fine work being done by the vocational education committees, namely the adult education courses.  Teachers work long hours on those courses, in the process providing a great service for the community along with the work they do during teaching hours with students.</P>
    <P>What I find objectionable is that Fine Gael have brought in this Bill at a time when they accuse us, as they did last year, of running away from the local elections. They said we were afraid to hold the elections and criticised us for not holding the elections in 1989.  That can now be seen for the hypocrisy it is.  We have stated we believe in local democracy and local knowledge in relation to the appointment of teachers by vocational education committees, yet they are now saying that this process should be centralised and they are not in favour of allowing the vocational education committees to continue to hold the powers that they have.  They have been shown up <Col N="1923" /> as hypocrites in relation to the statements they made last year and they are beginning to make the same ones again.</P>
    <P>I ask Deputy Bruton, does he want to give any responsibility to local bodies? That is the reason we oppose this Bill.  It is against local democracy and is moving towards a centralised system, this at a time when we are trying to promote decentralisation of Government Departments. Deputy Bruton must not trust local politicians because he has certainly undermined their confidence in bringing forward this Bill.  In his contribution last week he talked about the 0.01 per cent of cases and went on to give two examples. Deputy Lowry said there were many examples he could give but, in fact, he mentioned only one case; that was in Clondalkin.  I make the point that the VECs can do the job of appointing teachers better than any other body.  That is the reason I suggest that the <i>status quo</i> be maintained.  We must remember that the facilities are being improved all the time in vocational schools and I give credit to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, for what she has done in my county of Galway, where all 14 vocational schools now provide a leaving certificate course which was not the case up to 1980.  Extensions have been built to these schools and transport arrangements and so on are being improved by the committees.  The message from Fine Gael seems to be that while the VECs pay the salaries, provide the materials for the schools, arrange school transport etc., they should not be given responsibility for appointing the teachers.</P>
    <P>I would make the point that on County Galway VEC there are very fine members of Fine Gael and that while they are represented on the selection committee and on the TUI, they have never raised this matter at VEC level. Certainly they have never contacted me as a local Deputy on any concern they might have about the present system of appointments.  Indeed the members of the TUI have never approached me about their concerns in the matter of the appointment of teachers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> I believe this Bill is doing a great disservice to vocational education and I hope Deputy Bruton would reconsider what he has put before us.  He has been an excellent rapporteur on the culture and education committee but he has made a serious mistake in putting forward this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for listening to my contribution.  I hope this will be the last we will hear of this Bill and that we will revert to local democracy, responsibility and accountability of local committees and that the great work of the committees will be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody in this House recognises that the vocational education school system has been extremely good and efficient and has many good points.  One of the main things is that the system has come within the reach of virtually every boy and girl in the country regardless of their background and of their political affiliations. That is as it should be.  The VECs have done a great deal to embellish the educational system in Ireland but particularly on the technical level.  This is something for which we should all be grateful having regard to the need for those with technical qualifications, a demand that will be even greater in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, any system that has been in operation for a number of years is entitled to be reviewed.  That does not necessarily mean that in the review we are either denigrating the system as it has existed or denigrating ourselves when we suggest a change.  I refute entirely the suggestion by Deputy Dempsey last week that the bringing of this motion before the House was a slur on the VECs and on the appointments made by them, in other words, the teachers appointed by those committees.  I would not consider that to <Col N="1925" /> be the case at all nor do I think the proposer of the Bill intended any such slur.  The intention was to bring to the attention of the House the views of a political party having regard to the views expressed by members of the teaching profession and by parents, and in the interests of the students.  It is legitimate that an issue such as this should be discussed in the House and that we should examine both the merits and demerits of the existing system and, perhaps, of any anticipated system.  We should examine the strengths and weaknesses of the system that has prevailed up to now and ask ourselves if there are ways and means by which we can improve it.  We must always strive to improve and embellish any system with the objective of ensuring, first that it is fair and equitable, that it is seen to be such and that it is above and beyond reproach.  To achieve the perfect is the ultimate but we are all human and regardless of whether it is a local appointments commission or any other body who makes appointments, there will always be somebody who will be disappointed and who will say afterwards: &ldquo;Had it not been for the system I would have won out&rdquo;.  Notwithstanding the fact that our present system has worked exceptionally well for a number of years, some instances have been alluded to in the course of this debate which would indicate that there may have been miscarriages of justice.</P>
    <P>I have never been a member of a VEC so I speak with second-hand information on these matters.  However, potential applicants for teaching posts in various schools have approached me and asked how the system works, on what basis, etc. appointments are made.  What amazed me when I began to delve more deeply into this aspect of it was how it was possible to achieve the single decimal point of a unit in favour or against a particular applicant.  I know the people who are carrying out the interviews have done so with the very best of intentions but I must say I would be worried about my own ability, if I was sitting on such a board to determine whether one applicant was 0.01 of a point ahead of <Col N="1926" /> another.  It is only when you multiply the number of differences by the number of people on the board that you arrive at an answer.  What is even more difficult to work out is that when there would almost be a tie between two or three applicants for a particular post the position could be determined by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We heard from Deputy Kitt of the value of local knowledge.  I agree that this is something that has always been beneficial to politicians in that they know their own terrain and the people in it.  I do not mean to cast any aspersions on what Deputy Kitt has said but imagine a situation developing where two or three applicants tied virtually on a part of a percentage point.  How then would the local knowledge come into play and how would it determine who was to get the position?</P>

      <P>If I were an applicant for one of those posts and I suddenly saw, sitting across from me on the interview board, a political opponent &mdash; which could happen in certain circumstances &mdash; could I honestly say to myself that, although I was equal to all the others, I <Col N="1927" /> would be equal when the interview was over?  I am not saying that to in any way denigrate the people who have done this job for years but it is a possibility and it is something we should take into account and try to avoid in case it arises in the future.</P>
      <P>Let us look at another point that troubles me a little, and this is something of which I would have some knowledge. It would apply regardless of who actually carries out the interviews.  There is what is known as a short list system.  Many difficulties can arise within that system. Anyone who sits down to short list a group of, say, 100 applicants, and this can happen in the case of a number of appointments to any board and, in particular, the appointment of teachers to VEC schools in any constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that I accept it but I would have to say that by determining the short list one can ultimately determine the outcome of the interview.  That is a fact and there is absolutely no getting away from it.  By simply determining who is going to be interviewed and having regard to the qualifications, experience and so on required of the successful applicant, one can determine who will be the successful appointee.</P>
      <P>I know from discussions with colleagues in various constituencies who have been on VEC boards that there are times when they believed other people should have been interviewed.  Going through a whole series of interviews is a very tedious job &mdash; Members who are more enlightened than I and who have spent years doing this job will readily admit that it is almost an impossible job &mdash; but in the context of this Bill I should like to see some improvement in the short listing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the CEO can take advice regarding the short list but I will not go <Col N="1928" /> into that matter too deeply at this stage other than to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that a system will have to be devised which will show that one is doing things fairly, and is seen to be fair.  A system will also have to be devised to determine who should be on the short list.  Otherwise everybody will have to be interviewed, which will be a mammoth task.</P>
      <P>When the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was on the other side of the House he said that by denigrating each other politicians denigrate themselves.  I do not think this Bill was intended to imply that we were putting ourselves on a lower level.  In fact, it tries to ensure that politicians at this level are seen to be endeavouring to introduce something new which will be an improvement on what existed.  There was no question of any aspersions being cast on the political system or on politicians in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various problems can arise in regard to appointments at local level where people know each other.  I am not saying that problems do not arise in the case of the Local Appointments Commission, but it is the system which has been set up by the State, it has worked well, it has been seen to work well and it is accepted as being above and beyond political reproach.  Some Members have suggested that the proposed changes envisaged in this Bill are a slur on VECs.  I reject that.  Those suggestions could also be construed as a slur in some ways on the Local Appointments Commission.  I do not think a slur was intended or that it is applicable in any event.  However, I have to say that there are inherent dangers in a system where an applicant, coming before an interview board, faces a person he or she knows well &mdash; perhaps he or she has worked or is working with that person, or Lord forbid, he or she is a political opponent.  It could well be suggested in certain circumstances that an appointment was made because the person was a political opponent&mdash;in fact, that suggestion has been made from time <Col N="1929" /> to time.  That could be either an indication of the fairness of the system or an indication of its weakness.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that there is an inbuilt danger in the interview boards being in the hands of people who appoint people, not for any reason of alleged conspiracy or corruption but simply because of their familiarity and their local knowledge to which I referred.</P>

      <P>It can also make it very difficult for the interviewer and the interviewee. For that reason I do not think it is any harm for all Members of this House to examine the possibility and the merits of improving that system by way of the changes envisaged in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I support this Bill and call on all sides of the House to support it for the reasons put forward and not to cast aspersions on what has happened heretofore.  It has been suggested that there have been slight errors made in the past&mdash;I would have to admit that there were &mdash; but would it not be better to eliminate the possibility of errors rather than to have at some stage in the future the prospect of some difficulty arising whereby both politicians and the general public could point the finger and suggest there was some miscarriage of justice?

Deputy Dermot Ahern spoke at considerable length but much of what he said was not relevant to the Bill.  I should like to take issue with the Deputy for saying that the Local Appointments Commission were slow and cumbersome. It was very disappointing to hear a Deputy of his stature &mdash; indeed, he is very ambitious and expects to move up the ranks in Government circles &mdash; cast aspersions on the Local Appointments Commission.

However, I must compliment him &mdash; I think we can respect him for this &mdash; for saying that he has never made, and hopes never to make any overtures to anybody on VECs about the appointment of teachers.  That was a very positive statement and I commend him on it.</P>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Durkan, I congratulate the VECs for the marvellous work they are doing.  The County Westmeath VEC have to be commended for their enlightened approach not just to mainstream education but to the wide range of subjects covered in night classes, in day courses for the disadvantaged, etc.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with only a minute part of the work of the VECs.  I welcome the Bill which proposes to improve and update section 23 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1931" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £19,898,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1990 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission, and for payment of certain grants, subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>I propose to follow the traditional approach of speaking on the main subheads at the outset of this debate and in the light of contributions by Deputies to respond to requests for additional information or to queries raised on any other subheads.</P>
    <P>Before going on to the detail I would, however, like to comment immediately on a variety of statements made in the last two days that this Supplementary Estimate does not involve extra payments to farmers.  This is patent nonsense. The expenditure on the Vote is up by £54 million compared to the original provision.  This involves substantial additional expenditure on on-farm investment grants, headage, disease control and intervention activity, which is, of course, designed to support producer prices.</P>
    <P>This additional expenditure is partly offset by additional receipts of about £34 million of which £32 million is coming from the Community and £2 million from farmer levies.  Therefore, the vast bulk of the extra expenditure is of direct or indirect benefit to producers.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the receipts, the net Supplementary Estimate is for about £20 million.  This increase is due solely to my decision to bring forward into 1990 payments of about £10 million on on-farm investment grants and £9.3 million in headage which would otherwise have not been paid until 1991.  I did this in order to improve the cash flow situation for farmers in view of the relatively difficult producer income situation this year.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on on-farm investment <Col N="1932" /> grants will be over £50 million compared to £27 million last year.  Payments from the Vote and FEOGA under the various livestock headage and premium schemes will come to £321 million in this year compared to £159 million in 1989, an increase of over 100 per cent.  By any standards these are substantial increases and clearly give the answer to statements made in recent days that what we are dealing with here is not real increases for farmers.</P>
    <P>The general public and individual farmers are certainly not impressed by the cynical reaction of some who are never disposed to welcome any positive development but prefer instead to luxuriate in the habitual and by now predictable complaint, even when much needed extra money is being provided.</P>
    <P>In passing, I would emphasise that, as I have indicated on previous occasions, both the original Estimate and this Supplementary Estimate represent only a minor part of the total spending of my Department.  As part of ongoing support from the EC for Irish agriculture, my Department oversee and supervise a large number of activities which are fully funded by the EC.  These measures will result in expenditure of £1,250 million, that is £1.25 billion, this year from the FEOGA Guarantee Fund, while expenditure of another £900 million will be financed from borrowings for the purchase of products into intervention.  The benefits of the intervention safety net for beef which I negotiated last year means that what would otherwise have been a disastrous collapse in prices has been averted.  The total amount purchased into intervention this year will be well in excess of £1 billion.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for an additional £13.53 million under subhead L1. This is to cover the cost of grant payments to farmers in respect of works undertaken under the various farm development schemes.  The original provision under this heading was £37 million.  The demand however has been greater than expected and, as I have already said, the indications are that expenditure this year will <Col N="1933" /> be in the region of £50.5 million, including the £10 million brought forward from 1991.</P>
    <P>The increased demand for grant aid is a reflection of the high level of on-farm investment.  It is estimated that this will exceed £120 million this year.  Such a level of activity is an indication that, despite any temporary difficulties they may have, Irish farmers still have confidence in the future of the industry.  This confidence is vital for the future development of the industry and must not and will not be undermined by those who prefer to complain even about good news.</P>
    <P>I am seeking an extra £9.3 million under subhead L3 to enable my Department to make extra payments under our disadvantaged areas schemes over and above the number that would normally be paid in 1990.  The original provision of £67 million scheduled to be paid in 1990 was already the largest amount for headage grants in any single year since these schemes began in 1975 and the additional sum of £9.3 million will now provide a further £6.5 million for applicants under the cattle and equines headage scheme in the more severely handicapped areas plus an extra £2.8 million for applicants under the beef cow and equines headage scheme in the less severely handicapped areas on top of the existing provision. Over 56,000 applicants under the cattle and equines headage scheme and over 11,500 applicants under the beef cow scheme will be paid before the end of this year as a result of this extra allocation of funds, while nearly all applicants under the sheep headage scheme in the disadvantaged areas &mdash; some 30,000 in all &mdash; will have received their grants by the end of the year also.</P>
    <P>Given the farm income situation this year, I am particularly pleased that payments that were originally scheduled to be made next year can be brought forward to December 1990 and, as far as possible, made before Christmas.  I believe Deputies will be equally pleased that I am not only avoiding a repetition of last year's delays in payments but am also ensuring payment of a record number of grants this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> In regard to the case put forward to the Commission for extending and reclassifying the disadvantaged areas, Deputies will be pleased to know that this is at an advanced stage.  I am also glad to announce that when the new areas are approved we can then put in place the appeals procedure to which the Government are committed.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, when ERAD was established the Government undertook to maintain their financial commitment to the running costs of the eradication schemes.  Accordingly, I am providing an additional £11 million in 1990 under subhead C2 to cover increased expenditure by ERAD.  The approval for the increase in expenditure follows a review by the Government in June of this year of certain operational aspects as well as the financial position of the schemes.  The programme put in place for 1990 continued the exceptionally high level of testing of the previous year with a consequential high level of reactor removal, including necessary depopulations both for TB and brucellosis.  In the circumstances, the Government felt that it would be irresponsible and wasteful of previous expenditure not to make the necessary extra funding available for the continuation of the programme.  On the other hand, the Exchequer could not be expected to cover the entire extra costs.  It was decided, therefore, that an increase in the bovine diseases levies would also be necessary.  The House will recall that regulations to implement increases were introduced with effect from 1 August this year.  Over time these measures will maintain the original basis of the financing of the schemes which was that the farming community and the Government would fund the running costs in a ratio of 2 to 1 and on a 50:50 basis when allowing for the costs of administration.</P>
    <P>As regards EC funding a detailed national programme for 1991 is being submitted to the Commission.  I am hopeful that funding will become available next year.  Such funding will, more than likely, have specific conditions attached, <Col N="1935" /> which could mean that certain operational aspects of the programme will have to be altered.</P>
    <P>I should, at this point, reject out of hand the following suggestion attributed in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> to the President of the IFA:</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the selective leaking of the ERAD report is politically motivated with the aim of pinning the blame on farmers for the lack of progress in disease eradication.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no foundation for that allegation.  Indeed it is unworthy of any responsible leader of a farm organisation. It certainly does not contribute one iota to progress under this vital scheme for Irish farmers and our economy.</P>
    <P>Subhead C3 &mdash; General Disease Control and Eradication &mdash; is a subhead where expenditure can fluctuate considerably depending on the disease situation in any particular year.  In those circumstances, it is normal practice to make only token provision in the initial Estimate and to provide additional funding as and when needed.  Unfortunately, 1990 has turned out to be one of the costly years because of an accumulation of factors.</P>
    <P>The first and most important of these was the situation which arose because of BSE.  We do not have a BSE problem &mdash; the low sporadic incidence of 25 cases over 2 years, 6 of which were imported animals, in a cattle population of 7 million, represents a spill-over from the United Kingdom.  Yet we have encountered trading difficulties with third countries.  But I believe that the efforts I have made to convince our trading partners of the absolute safety of Irish meat will bear fruit and very shortly.  In the light of the trading difficulties that were encountered, there has been a general consensus among farming organisations, the meat trade and others, that a voluntary depopulation by herdowners themselves, with financial assistance from my Department, would be desirable. To that end a sum of £2 million is required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> The second factor relates to the occurrence of fowl pest in poultry.  Two outbreaks are involved.  The first occurred in November 1989 and the cost of eradication at £15,000 fell for payment in 1990. The second outbreak occurred in September last and it is expected to cost £572,000 in eradication expenses this year.  In this case a total of 200,000 laying hens were slaughtered.  It is vital that exotic avian disease should be kept at bay and that the high health status of our valuable poultry industry should be maintained. All told, a sum of £623,000 is required for poultry diseases.</P>
    <P>The third factor relates to the unexpected discovery of enzootic bovine leukosis in the national herd.  This disease was first imported into Ireland about 1977 in Canadian Holstein cattle.  The outbreak, which affected 13 herds, was rapidly cleared up by slaughter of the reactor animals.  A national round of blood testing was commenced this year, using the bloods collected for the brucellosis round, as a result of which ten herds have now been discovered with positive animals.  The purchase of testing equipment and the slaughter of reactors, plus depopulation where necessary, will cost a total of £477,000.  It is absolutely essential for trade reasons that we rid our national herd of this disease.  Already, Northern Ireland has requested the testing of breeding animals moving North.</P>
    <P>Subhead H1 provides for a grant-in-aid to Córas Beostoic agus Feola&mdash;CBF&mdash; for general purposes.  This year has been a difficult one for those producing and selling beef&mdash;faced as they were with the triple hurdle of closure of the Iraqi market, the knock-on effects of BSE in the United Kingdom and a general sluggishness in Community prices.  To help overcome these difficulties I am pleased to propose additional funding of £250,9000 towards CBF's promotion activities.  Already the benefits of enhanced promotion programmes are clearly evident.</P>
    <P>The fact that producers and the industry work closely with CBF and indeed fund an important part of the board's expenditure enhances the realism of <Col N="1937" /> CBF's promotional programmes and I am confident that the additional funding of £250,000 will bear further fruit in coming months.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on intervention this year is at an historically high level and indicates the level of support available under Community measures to underpin prices in a period of market pressures caused by the Gulf crisis and other problems. Substantially increased use of intervention has led to the increase in expenditure under this subhead.  This increase has, however, been more than offset this year by EC receipts.</P>
    <P>As is the practice with this particular subhead&mdash;Market intervention losses by deficiency, accident etc. &mdash; initial provision was for a token amount of £500,000.  Developments during the year require an upward adjustment of the provision by £1,100,000.  The increase is due in the main to the fact £1.3 million was paid in settlement to two companies in respect of EC export refunds.  This particular case has been the subject of discussion in this House and is the subject of correspondence between my Department and the EC Commission with a view to the financial consequences being borne by the Community budget.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would repeat that the extra expenditure being provided will largely and substantially benefit producers whose incomes are under pressure this year.  I look forward to the contributions from the Deputies who will speak on the Estimate.  Of course I will reply to points of details at the close of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for Agriculture presented this evening by the Minister is quite dishonest.  Indeed, some of the leaks that appear to have emanated from Agriculture House to the media over the last day or two suggest somehow or other that this is a mini rescue package for farmers.  I will let this House know exactly where the £20 million is going and why it is going to the particular channels earmarked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the Government are giving <Col N="1938" /> the impression that they are bringing forward this package of £20 million to alleviate some of the financial problems of farmers.  There could be nothing further from the truth.  As the Minister well knows, part of the provision was for the payment of grants owed to farmers over the past four to six months.  I have received a basketful of queries from farmers all over the country awaiting grants from the Minister's Department. So let nobody tell me the Minister is doing them any favour.  He is merely giving them what he had contracted to give them many months ago; that absorbs the major portion of that £20 million.</P>
    <P>Second, the Minister is giving the impression that, because he is bringing forward payments under the 1990 cattle headage scheme within the calendar year, farmers will be better off.  Certainly they will be better off by Christmas, but let me place on the record that this is not the first Christmas farmers will have received their entitlements within the calendar year.  If one reverts to 1985-86, one finds the answer there, when they were paid on time.  Indeed, there was no more disastrous year than 1989 when there was a total mess made of the scheme and farmers waited five to six months for payment. Indeed the Minister accepted in the course of his introductory remarks that 1989 had been a bad year.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aside, the most dishonest and scandalous performance of all on the part of the Minister is his decision not to pass on to farmers in severely handicapped areas the Exchequer savings accumulated in 1990 by virtue of the increased recoupment rates negotiated with the EC.  Up to this year all headage payments were funded on a 50:50 basis by the EC and national Governments. The EC pay 50 per cent of the cost this year.  As a direct result there will be an actual saving of between £4 million and £5 million to the Irish Exchequer in respect of cattle headage payments.  It is nothing short of scandalous&mdash;in a year in which many farmers suffered a 30 per cent cut in their disposable incomes&mdash; that the Minister for Agriculture and Food should take this money and use it <Col N="1939" /> for purposes other than helping the most vulnerable section of Irish farmers.  That decision speaks volumes for the Minister's interest in and commitment to directing maximum EC aid to our farmers.  I repeat it is scandalous and the Minister knows it to be so.</P>
    <P>It is very significant that the Minister is beginning to attack farm organisations because now they can see the folly of what he has been doing throughout this year and have come out unanimously against him this week.  It makes an absolute nonsense of the self-congratulatory remark the Minister attributed to himself here last week over his handling of the GATT negotiations.  Indeed, he is making a most dishonest case in asserting the results of his efforts in Brussels during the GATT negotiations increased the overall acreage of the disadvantaged area to over 70 per cent of the land area of this country.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Several other countries had their cases made and processed and had our Government displayed the willingness to help farmers all new areas would be getting their cheque for this Christmas and it is a scandal that they are not.  There is no connection whatever between Ireland's application for reclassification which, we are told, was forwarded to Brussels last May and the so-called compensatory aspects of the GATT negotiations.  Only at this stage are farmers realising the con job being played on them by the Minister in those negotiations.</P>
    <P>The decison to give an extra £250,000 to CBF, the meat marketing board, is derisory.  To put this figure into perspective, I understand CBF would need an extra £2 million to really get down to the business of promoting Irish meat abroad.  The Minister knows that, everybody in the country knows it, and the paltry sum of £250,000 they are getting falls far short of what they were getting two years ago.  The Minister in his speech noted that because of his wonderful negotiating skills we now have a huge amount of meat in intervention.  Does he not <Col N="1940" /> think it is now important for the Government and him to see that the only way forward is to sell our product abroad? Does he seriously tell this House that an extra £250,000 will do that?  Surely he does not expect anybody in the agri-business to accept that?  The Government's strategy on marketing is entirely on its head.  There is neither head nor tail to it in any shape or form, and, as we mentioned in this House last week, the food processing industry is non-existent; in fact, we are in reverse.</P>
    <P>Subhead A.4&mdash;travelling and incidental expenses &mdash; is difficult by any standards to understand.  It seems the Department are tonight looking for an extra £600,000 for travelling expenses made up as home travel, foreign travel and so on.  I find it very difficult to understand that.  The Minister's Department had several of their agricultural officers paid but grounded in the various farm development services offices for more than half the year.  They were paid to do a job they were prevented from doing. Farmers were paying £30 a visit for a service they needed urgently but for whatever reason the Minister decided those people would be held in barracks, they would not be allowed out for several months of the year, and I am told there are several counties this very day where officers of the Department have not got the necessary travelling allowances for them to do their jobs.  Let me put on the record that for farmers to get the approval certificate it is necessary to have one if not two calls from an agricultural officer, and the farmer pays £30 per visit. For whatever reason the Minister for Agriculture and Food has decided there is a certain upper limit beyond which he shall not go, and this year the Department have paid civil servants to do nothing.  The civil servants themselves did not want it that way but that is how it turned out while hundreds of farmers were waiting anxiously for help, particularly in regard to anti-pollution measures and they could not have the services of those people.  Even more difficult to understand, for the first time for many years agricultural officers in the <Col N="1941" /> headage section visited and inspected on farm only about 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the herds.  That being the case, I would like the Minister to outline to the House at the end of this debate how that system could be looking for another £600,000 or explain to me who incurred the travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>It is important that people who are owed money by the Department, whether for headage grants or building grants, be paid immediately.  I make one final plea to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy: Will the Deputy not be here next week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister but I might if I have to in future. Let him not depend on me always to be mannerly in that regard.</P>
      <P>There is a massive emergency in Irish agriculture and the Minister smiles his way through the debate.  Farmers are desperate because of his lack of action, despite the rosy picture he paints for us. Farmers are fighting desperately to hold on to their farms and we get this nonsense from the Minister.  I would describe it as a piece of fancy accountancy.  The Minister and his policies have led us directly to the point we are at now, this crisis in agriculture, and we get this, what I describe as insulting nonsense to Irish farmers from the Minister.  It is not really a Supplementary Estimate at all, it is simply showing the savings in various places, late payments, miscalculations about the moneys due from the EC, putting them all together and saying the farmers will get their payments before Christmas.  I say to farmers the Minister is a very false Santa Claus.  He is robbing Peter to pay Paul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take a few examples of the savings we are talking about, which incidentally and coincidentally amount to exactly the amount the Minister is proposing to give on the headage payments and to CBF. For office machinery he is taking out £2.8 million, half of what was provided.  The exchange rate guarantee on loans is £0.4 million out of a total of £1.4 million statutory contribution to the land bond fund £0.47 out of £4.3 million, untenanted land income deficiency £1.25 million, half of what was provided and &mdash; most interesting of all &mdash; the much vaunted scheme beloved of the Minister and praised by him regularly, the integrated rural development scheme £3 million provided by him earlier this year in the budget and he is now taking out £2 million because he was not capable of organising the scheme he praised regularly. He has taken out two-thirds of his own budget.  I am delighted to see the set-aside scheme was a total flop.  The total is £9.7 million and coincides &mdash; strangely &mdash; with the amount of deontas or bonus the Minister is talking about. <Col N="1943" /> The farmers are not and will not be conned by this and they will not accept the crumbs from the rich man's table the Minister is offering.  All we are talking about is crumbs.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the EC have increased their share of the cost to 65 per cent and the Minister's share is now 35 per cent., he has been ineffective in getting his colleagues in Cabinet to increase the levels of payment.  He was not even successful in getting his colleagues at least to hold to the level of payments for which the Government previously were responsible. He also seems to have rejected the offer by the EC to double the headage payments grants.  He seems to have refused that and certainly did not make a case for it.  That is a mean and miserable attitude on the part of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the fact that no increase has taken place since 1981, and the real value of these payments is now about 50 per cent of what it was in 1981. The Minister, by his own words, tells us that this is the best method of transferring money to where it is needed within Irish agriculture.  Yet he has miserably failed to increase these headage payments to even hold the level of Government contribution towards the payments or take up the offer from the EC of doubling the headage payments.</P>
    <P>The type of media hype and fancy accounting that we have seen from the Minister will not cut any ice with Irish farmers.  We are dealing with cuts in other areas like Teagasc where the field officers are told to go out and earn £10,000 regardless of where they get it.  That ensures that those who need advice most will not get it and there will be delays in payments in other areas.</P>
    <P>Every penny in this Supplementary Estimate is due to Irish farmers and it is no deóntas or bonus.  The Minister, if he seeks to convert it in any way will, I am afraid, be rejected even more than he was at the meeting I was at last night in Ballina where a brave backbencher from the Minister's own party &mdash; certainly not <Col N="1944" /> a front bench member &mdash; turned up to hear of the anger of Irish farmers against the policies the Minister is now telling us are excellent and working so well.</P>
    <P>The Minister, strangely, boasts about the fact that £1 billion of our beef went into intervention this year.  The Minister tells us repeatedly that his job, and the job of his Department, is to create the atmosphere for progress and prosperity of Irish agriculture.  He created a safety net in the event of anything going wrong. Safety nets are put under tight wire walkers and the Minister never even got on to the tight wire but was on the ground and in the net from day one.  The fact that we have to sell £1 billion worth of beef into intervention is a sign of the massive scale of failure on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have the further near farce of £250,000 being given to BSF.  That brings the figure to less than one third of what the budget for the Meat Marketing Board was when the Minister took over.  As a result of closing down Irish Meat Marketing, the Minister is now boasting that practically all our produce is going into intervention.  That is not acceptable.  That is not the way to do it or create the atmosphere the Minister tells us is required and that he will create.  The Minister has failed to create the atmosphere for progress; he has failed to ensure that farmers have a decent income and he smiles his way through the debate.</P>
    <P>Let me say again that £1.6 billion comes from the European Community in various forms to assist Irish agriculture. The Minister, effectively, has that amount of money at his disposal.  He might not like some of the regulations under which he has to apply it, but they are not made in isolation.  We are also represented when the regulations are made.  If the regulations do not suit us our voice should be heard.  This washing of hands, saying the EC are making regulations and that we have no say, does not cut any ice any more.</P>
    <P>What I am asking the Minister to do now, in view of the fact that the GATT negotiations are going in the direction I said they would, and that we are about to <Col N="1945" /> lose approximately £600 million to Irish agriculture, is to ensure that the £1.6 billion that will be available in some other form from now on is redirected to the people who need it.  The farmers I met in Ballina last night, are desperately struggling to hold on to their small farms.  They want to hold on to them and be involved in their local community.  A system that gives 80 per cent or £4 out of every £5 of that £1.6 billion to the top 20 per cent of farmers is no longer acceptable to those people.  If the Minister does not put something in place soon the £1.6 billion will be eroded and we will have a serious crisis in agriculture.  Gur raibh maith agat a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that must be said about this Supplementary Estimate is that it is an attempt to mislead the farming community into believing that something significant is being done to assist those who are in trouble when, in fact, virtually nothing is being done. There has been much juggling around with figures and if we look at the small print we find that while the net increase in the Supplementary Estimate amounts to just under £20 million there is a net increase in revenue or appropriations-in-aid of £34 million which is accounted for, in the main, by EC money.</P>
      <P>When I spoke here in the debate on agriculture on 25 October, I made the point that farm incomes had to be viewed over a number of years, taking the good with the bad.  I made the point that farm income in 1990 is likely to be about equal to the average over the past five years. However, there are 15,000 fewer people working on the land than there were in 1984 when total income was more or less the same as now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advise the Minister that unless a firm commitment is given by him to set up an appeals board to enable farmers who have been left out of the Government proposals submitted to Brussels to make their case, then many more thousands will be out of business in farming.  That is the policy the Minister for Agriculture and Food is pursuing.  He must be well aware that without the benefit of the <Col N="1946" /> headage payments accruing in disadvantaged areas farmers will not survive in agriculture, as was pointed out by the previous speaker.  The fact is there for all and sundry to see.</P>
    <P>Many farmers have done very well in recent years but others have benefited little from the EC bonanza.  A very large number of farmers, around 65,000 or some 35 per cent of farmers who are totally dependent on agriculture, earn less than the average industrial wage. About half of these have an income of less than £5,000 and these are the rural poor.  Over recent years we have heard very little from the IFA about their plight, but now farmers are on the streets demonstrating about the crisis in agriculture. What has caused the change of attitude and made militants of the leaders of the IFA is that, for the first time in recent years, the very large farmers who have done well &mdash; in some cases accumulated vast profits since we entered the EC &mdash; are now finding their incomes dropping and are angry as a result.</P>
    <P>My concern, and the concern of my party, is for the position of the small family farmers who, it is acknowledged are facing difficulties.  We have always been sceptical about the Common Agricultural Policy, a policy which encourages the production of goods for which there is no market, which adds up to £15 per week to the consumers' food bills, directs 80 per cent of all farm supports to the top 20 per cent of earners and has done so little to reduce rural poverty.</P>
    <P>The distinguished agricultural economist, Mr. Raymond Crotty recently pointed out that if the £1.5 billion approximately currently flowing to Irish farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy was distributed among all adults each would receive £590 per year, thus making a major dent in urban and rural poverty.</P>
    <P>When we look at this Estimate we find once again that a huge portion of it &mdash; £21 million &mdash; is accounted for by payments in respect of storage, freezing, handling, transport and other arrangements for purchasing products into intervention.  It is generally acknowledged throughout Europe that we are now entering the final <Col N="1947" /> phase of the Common Agricultural Policy as we know it, but the message does not seem to have got through in Ireland.  We seem to be doing little or nothing to make the structural changes necessary if the maximum number of people are to be allowed to remain on the land with the acceptable level of income.</P>
    <P>A major area of expenditure provided in this Estimate is the extra £11 million allocated for bovine TB and brucellosis eradication.  It has been said before, and deserves to be said again, that the failure to eliminate these diseases in our cattle herd, despite the expenditure of more than £1 billion of public funds, is one of the greatest political and financial scandals in the history of the State.  Twentyfive years after the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Haughey, declared our national herd to be disease free, we are still facing a major crisis with the taxpayers being asked to put their hands in their pockets once again.</P>
    <P>A small number of people have made a great deal of money out of our failure to eliminate bovine tuberculosis.  It has made some vets very wealthy indeed. About one-third of the money spent each year has gone on veterinary fees.  Fees paid annually to veterinary practitioners for testing under the disease eradication scheme in recent years can be broken down as follows: in 1983, £10.6 million; in 1984, £8.3 million; in 1985, £11.5 million; in 1986, £11 million and in 1987, £12 million.  There are fewer than 1,000 vets in the country; so in recent years they have been earning an average of £10,000 a year from disease testing alone.</P>
    <P>I understand there are plans by ERAD to appoint 100 temporary vets to the Department of Agriculture and Food to make an all out assault on those areas where the disease is endemic.  I welcome this step particularly in the light of the spectacular failure of private vets.  Do we need to rely on highly paid vets at all? Much of the work done by vets in this area could just as easily be done by qualified technicians.  If you go into hospital for a blood sample, it would more than likely be done by a nurse.  Why can blood <Col N="1948" /> sampling under these schemes not be done by properly trained technicians? When the Bill to establish Teagasc was going through the Dáil in 1988 the new body was specifically excluded from carrying out disease eradication tests largely, I understand, as a result of objections from the vets.</P>
    <P>The small number of farmers who continually flout the regulations have a lot to answer for.  They are endangering not only their own livelihood but also the interests of their neighbours and the taxpayers who are footing the Bill.  When replying to this debate I hope the Minister will state clearly and categorically that moneys will be provided in future Estimates to meet the cost of headage payments if new areas are to be included as disadvantaged.  As has been pointed out, there has been no increase in the amounts of money allocated for headage payments since 1981.  I would ask the Minister to state whether he will increase the number of inspectors to process claims for headage payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a time for negative political confrontation, and those who indulge in such cynical exercises are doing a disservice to the farmers and, indeed, to the agricultural industry. I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate and I fully support the Minister in bringing the Supplementary Estimate to the House. The purpose of the Estimate is to deal with the backlog of outstanding farm grants and other support for the agricultural industry, mainly in the area of marketing.  I cannot understand the attitude of Deputies who come into the <Col N="1949" /> House for the purpose of expressing criticism of a Minister who is doing his best in what is generally regarded at European and national levels as a very difficult situation.</P>
      <P>Regardless of what other Deputies may say, this news will be welcomed by the farming community particularly at a time when the industry and individual farm families are under serious financial pressure.  I would ask the Minister and his staff to do everything possible to expedite the payment of grants.  It was reassuring to hear the Minister say he is endeavouring to eliminate delays and that grants would be paid as quickly as possible.  It is a sad reality that for many livestock farmers the subsidy we are talking about represents a considerable part of the declining profit margin in agriculture today.  There is at present, and understandably so, a lot of anxiety about the future of the industry, and in particular the future of the small farming families in this country.  Gone are the days when national Governments had complete control over shaping the destiny of the agricultural industry.  That is something Deputies should remember.  We are now part of the larger European agricultural industry and are subject to the marketing controls of that broader community.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the future of the industry in Ireland is very much dependent on our ability to negotiate the best possible deal in terms of market share and commodity support.  That is what the Minister and the Agriculture Commissioner are endeavouring to do in their negotiations at European level.  In this regard, and particularly in regard to the current crucial GATT talks, we are fortunate in having Ray MacSharry, the Agriculture Commissioner, negotiating on our behalf at European level.  His understanding of the Irish agriculture industry and his commitment to our small farmers are reflected in the present tough negotiations ably supported by our Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy.</P>

      <P>I welcome in particular the assurances given by the Commissioner and by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy, which is the only long term guarantee for the future of the agricultural industry.  It is reassuring to hear the Commissioner and the Minister reassert their views in relation to the importance of those negotiations.  I welcome too the efforts of the Minister and the Commissioner to emphasis the importance and value of export refunds &mdash; which are crucial to safeguarding agricultural income&mdash;&mdash; and agricultural exports which are part and parcel of the economy.  I would urge the Minister and the Commissioner to continue their efforts to reach agreement with regard to income support related to production and geared towards the smaller producers who are the most vulnerable.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for increasing the grant aid to CBF.  The future of the industry is dependent on our success in providing quality food in the first instance and in marketing and selling our produce abroad.  CBF have the commitment and the structures to take this important work on abroad.  I have no doubt that the restoration of the grant, which the Minister announced here this evening, will enable them to undertake that work very effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" /> I also want to refer to our increasing dependence on EC support as far as the farming enterprise is concerned.  For that reason, it is imperative that we succeed in getting the maximum possible area of our land designated under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The Minister and the Government should be congratulated on having authorised one of the most extensive surveys even undertaken in this country.  I will not waste the seconds left to speak about the submissions made by the former Minister for Agriculture on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to consider the need to negotiate the best possible appeals procedure because it has transpired that even though such an extensive survey was undertaken, many townlands meet the criteria to qualify for designation under the scheme.  I know, from my discussion with the Minister, that he has a total commitment to our farmers in this regard and I also appreciate that he acknowledged there are serious anomalies in this regard in County Laois.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to spend my time in cross-talk.  I welcome the sum of £11 million which has been allocated to TB eradication.  My constituency was almost clear of the disease 20 years ago <Col N="1952" /> when there was a high incidence in the South.  Just across the Border South Fermanagh also has a high incidence of the disease and the cross-Border initiative gives us an opportunity to eradicate &mdash; and prevent &mdash; the disease.  I hope that our Department and the Department in the North will avail of the opportunity of this funding to combat the disease which will stop people in Fermanagh blaming Monagham and Cavan for spreading it and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned fowl pest, which is relevant to my constituency, where we produce 90 per cent of turkeys and 75 per cent of broilers, 3.3 million turkeys and 35 million broilers.  We also produce half the eggs and we use something like half a million tonnes of feed per year.  We take a very serious view of the disease and we have had many complaints&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am encouraged by what I heard in the House, particularly by the welcome expressed by some colleagues in relation to the expedition of the rate of payments.  I want to assure Deputy Hyland that the intention is to expedite the payment of grants and, as I said initially, to ensure that the maximum amount will be paid before Christmas.</P>
      <P>It is also my intention to put in place a visibly fair appeals procedure to deal with some of the anomalies which have arisen as a consequence of the survey.  I can confirm to Deputy Leonard that the TB eradication scheme and the commitments for which he asked will be put in place. That is why the Government made such a major contribution of taxpayers' money available to ensure that continuity.  I also wish to express my appreciation to the poultry producers of Monaghan and Cavan for the manner in which they co-operated with my Department in helping to rid us of the avian diseases which were a matter of very considerable concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also reassured by the frustration <Col N="1953" /> and the nature of the reaction of the Opposition to my proposals.  I will miss the scientific analysis of the kind I have come to expect from Deputy Connaughton. His range extends to &ldquo;balderdash&rdquo;, &ldquo;rigmarole&rdquo; and &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo;.  I feel a certain sense of nostalgia when I do not have his scientific analysis.  If I may engage in the same kind of terminology, it is a little hypocritical for Deputy Connaughton, whose own Government spent four and a half years in bringing forward 2 per cent extension of the disadvantaged areas, to complain about 12 per cent extension within 12 months.</P>

He is not even capable of quoting basic facts which can be ascertained by anyone who has the disposition to check them.  For instance, Deputy Stagg, as a representative of The Labour Party, stated that £1.6 billion is available this year from FEOGA.

    <P>
      <Col N="1955" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £12,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of December, 1990, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of Public Works, and for services administered by that Office, including the Stationery Office as part of the Government Supplies Agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate of £12 million sought for Vote 10 arises mainly from the decision to proceed with the refurbishment of the former College of Science building as a priority project.</P>
      <P>Subhead E of Vote 10 originally included a provision of £1 million for the cleaning of the stonework of the former College of Science.  In January last it was decided that the main project should proceed on a fast-track basis to resolve once and for all the accommodation needs of the Department of the Taoiseach, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Attorney General's Office and the Department of Finance as part of a major rationalisation of accommodation being undertaken by the office of Public Works.  Accordingly, following the invitation and consideration of tenders, a contract was placed in March with McInerney Contracting Ltd. the lowest bidders for the total refurbishment of the former college premises, including the Engineering Block at the rear of the college.</P>
      <P>This project also constitutes an important advancement in the Government's programme of restoration of major public buildings which has already seen excellent schemes carried out at Dublin Castle, the Custom House and the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  It also forms part of the drive to improve the fabric of, and achieve maximum functional benefit from, the collection of public buildings in the Merrion Street-Kildare Street Block.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent reply to a Dáil question the Taoiseach gave details of the project. The value of the contract is £13.2 million <Col N="1956" /> excluding VAT, of which approximately £6.5 million will be paid out in wages. The total budget for the current project is approximately £17.6 million to include VAT, professional fees, inflation and contingencies.  The work involves the refurbishment of the buildings to modern standards in keeping with their role as the centre of Government.  As well as providing accommodation for the Taoiseach and his Department, a substantial extra area will be provided for Members and staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Department of the Taoiseach take possession of part of the refurbished building at the end of this year.  As a consequence of that move, the Attorney General's Office will take over extra rooms in the north block of Government Buildings to accommodate additional legal staff currently being recruited.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance will be allocated most of the offices currently occupied by the Department of the Taoiseach in Government Buildings and will, in exchange, release other premises at present occupied by them mainly to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the project, the Dáil will gain much needed space in the refurbished Engineering Block building as well as more accommodation in Kildare House and accommodation at present occupied by them in Merrion Square &mdash; and by the Department of Finance in Upper Merrion Street &mdash; will also be released.  Thus, a major reorganisation of Government and Dáil accommodation will be effected and the State will be in a position to release accommodation in other areas as a consequence of the refurbishment works.  Indeed I am sure that in their comings and goings from the House many Deputies have been impressed by progress on this project.  I want to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the contractors, the consultants and the staff of the Office of Public Works on a job carried out speedily and to the highest standards.  I also want to thank Deputies for their patience and co-operation while this major work is underway.</P>
    <P>Some extra expenditure also arose on <Col N="1957" /> a number of relatively minor works bringing the total additional sum required on subhead E &mdash; New Works, Alterations and Additions &mdash; to £14.5 million.  These mainly involved works necessitated by Ireland's Presidency of the EC in the first half of the year.</P>
    <P>Smaller additional sums are required on a number of other subheads.  On subhead B1 an extra £250,000 is needed mainly to meet the cost of travelling arising from works at new sites under the EC Structural Funds programme and extra areas of responsibility.  Increased subsistence allowances are also a factor. Decentralisation projects, wildlife acquisitions and new parks are among the responsibilities giving rise to the extra costs.</P>
    <P>An additional £120,000 is required on subhead D &mdash; Purchase of Sites.  This arises mainly from the purchase of sites for approved projects including the proposed employment exchange in Tallaght, a contract for which is likely to be placed next year.</P>
    <P>Subhead F1 &mdash; Maintenance and Supplies &mdash; requires an additional £800,000. As Deputies are probably aware, individual Departments carry the financial responsibility for the maintenance of buildings which they occupy.  However, there are a number of centres, mostly important State buildings, which are exempted from this system and whose maintenance remains the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  These are mainly Leinster house itself, the Museum, the National Gallery and the complex generally.  It is largely on these that the extra cost arose, particularly in the context of the EC Presidency.  Compensation payments and the extra cost of service charges added significantly to the overrun.</P>
    <P>An extra £190,000 is required on Subhead F4 &mdash; Fuel, Electricity, Water, Cleaning Materials etc.  This subhead covers energy and other costs at certain major State buildings.  The extra requirement arises mainly from the energy costs at Dublin Castle, including the new conference centre, which was used to its <Col N="1958" /> maximum during the EC Presidency, and the Royal Hospital.</P>
    <P>On subhead L3 &mdash; Arterial Drainage-Maintenance &mdash; an extra £300,000 is needed.  This is for urgently required maintenance work which arose to a large extent as a result of damage caused by severe floods which occurred early in the year, mainly on the Swilly embankments and the River Inny and some work in Ballyheigue in Wexford among others.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that receipts in subhead O &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash; will be £1 million in excess of the estimated figure.</P>
    <P>The main increase arises from charges for services carried out by the Government Supplies Agency &mdash; £300,000 &mdash; and from charges for various other services carried out on a repayment basis-£700,000. These returns reflect the ability of the Office of Public Works to operate in the commercial arena and the quality of the service which they provide.</P>
    <P>The other main area of increase is from charges for admission and services at parks and national monuments where the estimated return will be extended by £310,000.  While this figure reflects the Government's drive to boost tourist numbers and spending, it also reflects the consistently high qualify of the work of the Commissioners of Public Works in the conservation and amenity area, including top-class presentation of these sites to the public.  Deficiencies in the returns in other areas reduce the overall increase from Appropriations-in-Aid to £1 million.</P>
    <P>While the extra requirements which I have outlined on six subheads total £16,160,000, this is offset by a cumulative saving of £3,160,000 which can be achieved over a range of subheads.  The gross supplementary total is thus £13 million.  However, this is reduced by increased receipts to a net figure of £12 million which is less than the amount required this year for the refurbishment of the former College of Science, the project which gave rise to the Supplementary.</P>
    <P>I commend this Supplementary Estimate of £12 million to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome the decision to give priority to the College of Science restoration project.  Everyone both inside and outside this House has known that block of buildings as Government Buildings for several years.  Even though it is a relatively new complex it is nevertheless architecturally significant and important.  The visual effect of this complex is beautiful.  The complex forms an important and integral part of a block of streetscape &mdash; I am referring here to the remaining part of red brick Georgian Dublin.  For this reason we must welcome this because that streetscape is unique.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned that there is a utilitarian value to what has been done to the building, in particular inside the building, providing greater space for the Department of the Taoiseach, the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Finance and Members of the Oireachtas.  While I must enter some doubt at providing greater space for the Taoiseach &mdash; I say this because on my visits to the Taoiseach's office in the past I found it both spacious and indeed opulent &mdash; nevertheless, some space must be provided to relieve congestion among the staff, and this is to be welcomed.  In the same way we welcome the provision of additional space for the Attorney General and his staff and for the staff of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Let me also say &mdash; we are often reluctant to say these things here &mdash; that we warmly welcome the provision of additional space for Members of the Oireachtas and their secretaries.  Very often Members of this House work in appalling conditions which would not be tolerated elsewhere.  The law provides for minimum space in accommodation in the workplace but that law does not seem to apply to Members of these Houses or their staffs, in spite of what the Gay Byrnes of this world and other people outside this House, who misrepresent the conditions Oireachtas Members have to work under, may think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the Supplementary Estimate is for £12 million but the total cost in the current year will <Col N="1960" /> be £15 million.  This means that £3 million have been found elsewhere in savings from the current year's budget for the Office of Public Works.  The Minister referred to that without giving too many details. While we welcome any savings we must condemn some of the savings that made up that £3 million saved in the Office of Public Works.  We think some of the saving under certain headings should be looked for elsewhere.  It is utterly disgraceful that almost £1.3 million of the £3 million saved is accounted for by a cut in the moneys provided this year for the care of national monuments, the Wildlife Service, national parks, inland waterways and conservation works.  In all these areas we should be increasing expenditure because the funding we provide is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>It has often been said on these benches and in many places outside this House that we have disgracefully neglected our national monuments, particularly in recent years.  During the past three years approximately one-third of the professional staff attached to the national monuments section of the Office of Public Works have left, many of them on retirement but many others out of sheer frustration, and none has been replaced. The people I am referring to are archaeologists, engineers and architects, the people we need if we are to have a conservation and preservation policy of national monuments.</P>
    <P>The amount of money provided for the care and protection of our 700 or so designated national monuments is pathetic.  To say that those monuments are in care is in most cases a complete misrepresentation because absolutely nothing is done to protect them or to prevent them from falling into ruin or destruction.  Where restoration is being carried out, excellent work is being done to protect and preserve monuments, but many monuments designated as national monuments get absolutely no care at all with the result that they will continue to fall apart, fall down or into ruin.</P>
    <P>Recently the archaeological site at Lough Crew near Oldcastle, County Meath, was brought to my notice.  This is <Col N="1961" /> a designated national monument.  As the Minister may know, it consists of a mega-lithic passage tomb complex with a unique collection of standing stones. These stones are in an accelerating state of destruction as they are out in the open and have no protection.  The elements are wiping away the decorations, the motifs and the reliefs on this unique set of middle Stone Age tombs.</P>
    <P>I should also mention an archaeological site in my own constituency of Roscommon.  I am referring here to Ballintubber Castle.  It is unique because it is the first and one of the very few Gaelic or Celtic stone castles in Ireland.  By and large, stone castles are of Norman influence or origin, but this one is unique in that it is a purely Gaelic or Celtic one.  It is one of the largest stone monuments in the country and has a little more than 1,000 feet of curtain wall.  Even though the condition of this castle has been raised in this House, in the other House and elsewhere, nothing has been done.  It has been estimated that it loses about 5 per cent of its curtain wall each year to ruin because it is exposed to the elements and there has been no intervention to save or protect it.  Those are just two examples to show what is happening to our national monuments, which are part of our national heritage.  Nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>Sadly, we find in this Estimate, even though money is being provided to restore this relatively new College of Science &mdash; which also forms part of our heritage &mdash; the amount being provided to protect and preserve these ancient sites and buildings is being cut back.  There are about 70,000 archaeological and historical sites throughout the country which have not been designated as national monuments.  Under the last National Monuments Act they were designated as historic monuments, but there is quite a distinction between a national and a historic monument.  Those buildings do not either enjoy the limited care that the designation &ldquo;national monument&rdquo; can bring.  We are losing those by the dozen, maybe even by the hundred each year; we do not know how many for sure.  They <Col N="1962" /> are being destroyed by commercial forestry, by so-called farm improvements and, in places, to urban development. This is happening because no resources in terms of manpower or money are made available to protect them.</P>
    <P>The National Museum, next door to this building, must be unique among national museums in that it does not have a proper conservation laboratory to date, identify and preserve artefacts and treasures found on various sites from time to time.  Taking money in the name of savings from the preservation of our archaeological and historical inheritance almost raises a question about our commitment to civilisation.  If we forget for a moment the imperative placed upon every generation to preserve their inheritance and see it only in cold economic terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not need all that time.  The Labour Party will be opposing this Supplementary Estimate.  We oppose it on the basis that the Government have been guilty of the most appalling and gross mismanagement on the issue of the developments at the College of Science project, and its related project, namely, the management and sale of the properties across the road in Merrion Street. We have seen an amazing development <Col N="1963" /> by the Government under which that group of once valuable houses have been allowed lie idle and to fall into a state of dereliction over two years.  No realistic or urgent effort was made by them to sell the houses when they were supposed to be sold, on a rising market and provide a substantial portion of the moneys required for the development of the College of Science.  The intention was that there would be a substantial appropriation-in-aid of some £6 million from the proper management and sale of those properties when the time was right.  What has happened?  As a result of the appalling failure of the Government to do their job properly the tide has been missed, the market is now downward and those valuable State-owned properties are deteriorating month on month, week on week and there they lie.</P>
      <P>Instead, we find that the House is presented with a Supplementary Estimate for £12 million.  The Government have gone away from their original proposals for the College of Science which was for an interim expenditure for the year of £1 million.  They decided to designate this a priority project.  They decided, in the words of the Minister to put this project on the fast track.  If one looks around one will see what other pressing items need the priority project treatment.  What are the other needs of the people that require the fast track response?  What has been the response of the Government to them compared to their response to the College of Science project involving an expenditure of £17 million?  If one looks at the housing needs of our people one will see that there are thousands of people in every local authority area &mdash; every Deputy and councillor is aware of this &mdash; waiting for housing accommodation without hope of getting a home for themselves in the foreseeable future.  The Government have failed to manage their affairs properly and do not have the political will to provide funding to build local authority houses for people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that the Government can call for fiscal rectitude and cutbacks in <Col N="1964" /> the housing programme and put the College of Science project on the fast track to provide additional offices for the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Attorney General and Members of the House.  Members of the House do need additional accommodation and that should be tackled on a gradual basis but we do not need the super luxury extravaganza of a Merrion Street project put on the fast track.  At the same time one has to face the fact that they have mismanaged the project by failing to capitalise on their important asset which was supposed to have been integral to the whole development.  They have gone ahead on the fast track on the expenditure side but made a mess of the Merrion Street properties resulting in a loss to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>If those properties had been disposed of properly the £6 million that would have been forthcoming could have been put to the urgent needs of local authorities and given some hope to those who have no hope, either now or in the foreseeable future of getting a home.  There are no plans to build houses and the money being provided in the current year and next year is not sufficient.  It is strange that the Merrion Street project was put on the fast track and taken off the gradual planned basis, arranged for in the Estimates at the beginning of the year.  Did the Government come to Dáil Éireann and say, &ldquo;we are contemplating putting this project on the fast track, changing what the Members voted on and accepted at the beginning of the year, namely, an expenditure of £1 million and instead we are setting about an expenditure of a further £12 million&rdquo;?  No, they went ahead and spent the money.  That is the irony of the situation and it is a complete misnomer to call this a supplementary estimate.  This is not an Estimate, it is a bill because that money has been spent.</P>
    <P>This evening it is not a question of whether we should go ahead with this project, of debating whether it is a good idea or whether, there are more pressing priorities, such as the housing needs of the people.  It is a <i>fait accompli</i> because the job has been done and the money <Col N="1965" /> spent.  The Minister has told us that the money has been spent and introduced this Supplementary Estimate to cover it. That is not acceptable, it is not good enough.  It is not good enough for the Minister to compare this super luxury provision in these difficult times for so many of our people to the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  There is a very big difference between the two.  At least the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham is a very fine premises which is open to the public. Thousands of ordinary citizens from Dublin, and outside, visit it to attend functions and exhibitions.  At least there is a public exhibition element to the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposals for the College of Science how many members of the public will ever see this magnificence and super luxury?  The answer is, very few indeed.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, it is an idle exercise voting against the Supplementary Estimate for the reason that the money has been spent and the job has been done, but nonetheless the Labour Party put down their marker as a protest at this project.  They are protesting at the way it proceeded, the way the Government mismanaged public funds to the extent that they have denied £6 million of public money by leaving those houses to fall into increasing dereliction instead of, two years, 18 months or one year ago, organising their affairs and selling those properties so that if a supplementary estimate was needed it would have been for about half of the amount the Minister proposes. Those moneys could have been made available to provide very urgently needed houses and accommodation, health benefits, social welfare increases and so on for the people of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to challenge the Government's decision to grant yet another lump sum of £12 million by way of a Supplementary Estimate to the Office of Public Works and I do so because of my dissatisfaction and concern about the way in which these huge sums of money are being spent.  When we consider, for example, that over £96 million was already sanctioned by this House this year for the Office of Public Works and we look at the breakdown of how that money was spent we can see that by far the biggest amount was spent under Subhead E &mdash; new works, additions and alterations. When we look closely at the figures we can see that £24.69 million has been spent under this subhead this year, an increase of 44 per cent over the amount spent last year.  This heading also consumed the greatest percentage of funds last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight the Government are seeking sanction for another £14.5 million under Subhead E.  To be blunt about it I am concerned at the Taoiseach's reply to a parliamentary question on 24 October 1990 that &ldquo;the whole engineering block&rdquo;&mdash; that is at the College of Science complex &mdash;&ldquo;at my personal insistence is being provided for accommodation...&rdquo;.  The taxpayers of this country deserve to know how their money is being spent.  I disagree with my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Quinn, who believes that it is money well spent.  While I have a desire for and appreciation of nice things like, for example, fine architecture, beautiful office furnishings and the new ceremonial staircase to the first floor offices to the core of An Taoiseach's new suite of offices under the impressive dome in the College of Science building, access to which can be by helicopter which will land on the roof of the building, I have to balance expenditure on these things &mdash; with the view of my constituents, who equally appreciate nice things, that too <Col N="1967" /> much money was spent last year and this year on these so-called nice things when parents of children with mental handicap are marching outside these buildings looking for residential care for their children, very often children who are adult dependants of very elderly parents.</P>
    <P>How democratic is it, for example, for the Taoiseach to &ldquo;personally insist&rdquo; on spending a vast sum of £17.6 million?  It is important that our State buildings are maintained in good repair &mdash; and I accept that the Government should have comfortable accommodation &mdash; but £17.6 million is excessive and is more in keeping with the sentiments expressed that &ldquo;it is very important to project Government buildings in a good light &mdash; after all we are a European capital&rdquo; than with the actual need to spend all of this money on this building.  Outer appearances to visitors should not be a reason for spending this money, particularly when so many sacrifices have been made by many people over the past number of years because of cutbacks in vital services such as health, education and the public house building programme which was mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>I want to pose the question: how can an elected public representative, who hears this Government talk about projects as though they were using monopoly money and, for instance buying a second jet such as the £30 million Gulfstream 3 jet, explain to those patients on public waiting lists for heart surgery, some of whom are dying as they wait, the equity of this approach?  If £21 million is spent on modernising the recently magnificently refurbished Dublin Castle and one third of the population are living in poverty, then I think it is time we agreed that we could satisfy ourselves by spending half of the £17.6 million on the college buildings and still give ourselves accommodation of adequate quality and comfort.</P>
    <P>I am not against spending some money on public buildings but the Government have a responsibility to be balanced in their approach to the spending of taxpayers' money.  They should not be extravagant, flamboyant or ostentatious <Col N="1968" /> when we cannot afford to be.  Although Dublin is a capital city in Europe we should not attempt to project ourselves as a nation of equal wealth to that of our EC partners.</P>
    <P>My comments must not be seen in any way as an attack on the Office of Public Works or the men and women who work there.  They are admirably suited to their jobs and they carry out excellent work. Indeed, evidence of this can be seen in this building in the restoration of the Seanad ceiling and the Members' Library which after a dry rot attack were refurbished under the direction of the Office of Public Works.  These people do excellent, quality work.  They do what is expected of them by the Government who decide on how much funding they are going to make available to them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the Government have apparently no great difficulty in spending vast sums of money &mdash; an extra £12 million here tonight in the time it takes to say Cock Robin &mdash; when at the same time schools have difficulty in getting a remedial teacher or a caretaker and parents have difficulty in getting residential units for their mentally handicapped children.  When I balance the social needs of our society with the needs of the relatively well off people in our society, TDs, Senators and the top civil servants who are accommodated in these extravagant buildings, I do not think we are looking the problem in the eye.  It is extremely difficult for any public representative to attempt to sell to the public, particularly the one third of them who are in desperate need, the voting of an extra £12 million here tonight on what is mainly high grade fashionable accommodation which is unnecessary, given the plight of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works.  I will also have something to say about the comments made by some previous speakers.  The Supplementary Estimate has been brought forward for work which will benefit not only the Taoiseach but the nation.  Reference has been made to <Col N="1969" /> the £14.5 million provided for new works, alterations and additions and it has been said that this money was spent mainly in Merrion Street.  That may be true, but anybody who looks at the contracts will see that £6.5 million was paid out in wages to workers on that project.  Deputy Byrne and Deputy Taylor will realise that many of their constituents were probably recipients of some of this money.  This is far more likely in the case of their constituents than in the case of mine in Sligo-Leitrim.  I am not making any derogatory remarks about those workers. The skill and craftsmanship they have shown is a credit to them and this project will go down in history as one of the finest works performed by the Office of Public Works in modern times.  They have had many major successes.</P>
      <P>I welcome amounts provided for arterial drainage which will help to speed up several necessary schemes especially in my part of the country.  Deputy Connor will agree that the work on the Boyle and Bonet drainage scheme is of great importance to the area.  I hope that work to complete the Bonet drainage scheme will be completed in the not too distant future.  The section outstanding is from Dromahair to Lough Gill and involves several tributaries.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works do not get the credit they deserve.  They take on works which could not be done by the private sector at any cost.  This year in my constituency they opened Parkes Castle, a major tourist attraction.  Their work is not only for the benefit of archaelogists. It is also to preserve public buildings which are a major part of our heritage.  They are not given as much funding as we would like.  Numerous archaelogical sites need to be preserved but sufficient money is not available.  I would agree with Deputy Connor that the Office of Public Works have a major contribution to make at several sites in my area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Works done this year on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnel canal will be of great benefit to the entire nation.  I do not see how Members can complain about these works.  Some of the travelling and incidental expenses claimed are in <Col N="1970" /> respect of the Lough Allen canal.  It is a major scheme and will mean the opening up of Lough Allen as part of the Shannon navigation system.</P>
    <P>While we might complain that certain works have not been done quickly enough, the standard of work carried out by the Office of Public Works will never be held up to ridicule by any architect in the future.  Their work is meant to last for three or four generations and to show that we have preserved as much of our heritage as capital resources allowed.</P>
    <P>The money spent in Merrion Street is well spent and will yield benefits in the years ahead.  Like Deputies Taylor and Byrne, I have problems with regard to cutbacks in other areas.  Are we to allow ourselves to be downgraded at all levels? Are we to allow buildings of prominence in this city to go to ruin?  We have a responsibility to see to it that buildings of merit are preserved.  The fact that the engineering block in Merrion Street is being turned into Government offices is evidence of forward thinking.  It is important that people who come to this country should see that we have reasonable accommodation.  If people do not have proper facilities where they work, it will be understood they will not provide good facilities for others.</P>
    <P>The work being done on inland waterways will be of great importance in the future.  Supplementary Estimates brought in for this purpose are justifiable. It is necessary that works undertaken by the Office of Public Works continue and that high standards be maintained. Deputy Byrne talked about doing a lesser job.  A job half done is a job not done at all.  Work should be done to the highest standards.  When people see that the cost of this project is approximately £17.6 million they may think the building is being provided solely for the people who work there.  That is not so.  The scheme will give a major return to the State in that the people who work on the project will pay their taxes and there will be VAT refunds to the State.  Many such schemes are of major benefit to the country.  The saving in welfare benefits in respect of the people working on the scheme is of <Col N="1971" /> major proportions.  Workers there receive very high wages for doing a skilled job.  We should not run down contracts such as this and give the impression that the project is designed to create a luxury office for the Taoiseach and top civil servants. It will be there for future Taoisigh. Two weeks ago the Taoiseach told members of the Opposition that it will be a facility that might be of use to them some day.  They should realise these are facilities which are being provided for future Governments.  They are necessary facilities.  If there is to be a helicopter pad on the roof of the building, that provision is quite in order because people entering this city are entitled to observe that our Government have facilities on a par with those provided in other European capitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not proposed contributing to this debate but I have been listening on the monitor to the various contributions particularly those of Labour and The Workers' Party.  The reason I have decided to contribute is that I regard the Estimate before the house &mdash; apart altogether from the excessive language concerning helicopter pads and so on &mdash; as nothing other than pandering to the general perception on the part of the public and that there is over-expenditure in respect of the Houses of the Oireachtas whereas nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Chief Whip, sharing accommodation with seven Deputies and four Senators in No. 89 Merrion Square, I can honestly say that the conditions there are so Dickensian were inspectors asked to inspect the level of accommodation, it would be closed forthwith.  That is when we would indeed have a crisis and public scandal.  There are leaks in the roof, the building is substandard by no means up to the standard one might expect for basic, mundane office accommodation, even <Col N="1972" /> the most fundamental office accommodation never mind the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is my honest opinion that what we are now about to pass in this House represents a very sensible arrangement, that is to put in place an office accommodation arrangement for Members of this House and their secretaries.  There is nothing elaborate in it; it is comprised of ordinary fluorescent lighting, no chandeliers or cocktail cabinets but rather standard desks, chairs, filing cabinets and so on, nothing more.  If we cannot afford such basic accommodation then we should not be in the business of politics in the first place.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the accommodation in Merrion Square the conditions prevailing in Leinster House are not on a par with those in most other EC member states.  They are cramped and overcrowded, with two and three Deputies sharing office accommodation; likewise two and three secretaries working on top of one another.</P>
    <P>To come into this House this evening and oppose this Estimate on the basis of empathising with the public perception that we are providing ourselves with something beyond the norm is doing ourselves an enormous disservice.  We are prostituting ourselves to the basic public perception, particularly that of the media, that we are spending money wastefully.  The secretaries working from No. 89 Merrion Square do so in extremely difficult circumstances.  They are the people who must man those offices when we have left the premises.  They have got to communicate with people in this House, commute backwards and forwards, even for photocopying purposes apart altogether from the other core facilities such as restaurants and so on.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are not doing ourselves justice by availing of this opportunity to create a division in this House.  I would appeal to Members of the Labour Party and The Workers' Party to do the sensible thing, accept this Estimate as reasonable, as being within the ordinary perameters of expenditure, something we can afford. As I have said already, if we cannot <Col N="1973" /> afford basic office accommodation then we should not be in the business of politics at all.  There is nothing excessive in this expenditure.  I have seen the offices concerned.  They are very basic; in comparison with the general extravaganza of the business world they are fairly mundane, and spartan.  In the name of heavens let us not go down the road of pandering to the media who did not even do us the honour of listening to our contributions this evening.</P>
    <P>I attend a Whips' meeting every Thursday when we set the Order of Business for the following week.  Invariably it happens that the Whip of the Labour Party and The Workers' Party raise, as a final item, the matter of office accommodation.  I listen to Members of The Workers' Party complain incessantly about their accommodation in the College of Art.  This Estimate represents to step to take us out of the College of Art and No. 89 Merrion Square, allowing us move into the core facilities of Leinster House proper. Rather than fighting this evening about a £12 million supplementary Estimate for fairly basic, mundane office accommodation, what we should really be talking about is knocking this existing structure, building a whole new complex in order to put ourselves on a par with other democratic parliamentary institutions.  It is not resplendent, extravagant, does not involve waste of money.  Let us do the sensible thing for once and collectively support this Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>May I repeat that the College of Science complex contains some of the most historic and important public buildings in this city, that the entire series of interlinking buildings are of great national and historic importance?  I might add also that the project represents the first major refurbishment of that complex since the foundation of this State. As Deputy Jim Higgins rightly said, we hear constant complaints about facilities <Col N="1974" /> and lack thereof for Members as well as others.  When this opportunity presented itself if was important that we took a decision to go ahead and complete that project to the very highest standard.  I want to avail of this opportunity to thank Deputies who have been constructive here this evening although we did have the usual negative contribution from Deputy Taylor.  We hear it on numerous occasions here.  As has been said already, any one of us could indulge in that kind of pandering to the general public.  The general public know and appreciate the important work being done here.  In fact we receive numerous requests from people to see the work done there, generally regarded as being of first-class quality, the workmanship being of the highest quality and standard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connor referred to the fact that we were saving some money under some important subheads on which he would like to see more expenditure incurred.  Part of the reason for that was that in some areas we had hoped to have land acquisitions completed especially in relation to the extensions of parks and our responsibility in that area.  Because of problems in finalising these acquisitions it was possible to effect some additional savings in that it would not be possible for us to complete and pay for some of these projects before the end of the financial year.</P>
      <P>There were also specific problems we encountered in dealing with Structural Fund projects, in many of which we were involved not as full owners or disciplines but in partnership with other organisations or bodies, also leading to some delays in the completion of projects and involving some savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure Deputy Connor that, in regard to his concern about national monuments generally, we have embarked on detailed specific surveys. For example, I recently launched the 20th survey of archaeological and historical sites, on a county by county basis, in Kerry and previously in Sligo.  That work is now well in hand and will enable us to allow programmes of conservation to be undertaken on many important sites and <Col N="1975" /> in areas neglected in the past.  This will also put on record, on a county by county basis, a detailed survey of monuments undertaken with the skills of the Office of Public Works utilising modern technology and aerial photography.  In Sligo something like 1,000 additional sites in the county were identified as a result of a survey completed this year.  We are pushing ahead with that registration and identification of national sites and monuments which will be welcome and important not only for the Office of Public Works but for many voluntary bodies, planners, local authorities and so on so that they identify precisely the location of these important sites and ensure that they are not damaged in any way in development works or planning projects of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne raised the matter of dissatisfaction with the total expenditure involved under a particular subhead and took issue with the amount of money being spent under that subhead.  I might remind him that the projects covered by this subhead are mainly in the area of the provision of public offices throughout the State generally.  For instance, Garda stations account for £86 million of the expenditure under the subhead.  The Deputy will be aware that in many parts of the country, in addition to there being substandard office accommodation here, there has been substandard Garda accommodation in various locations. Approximately £6 million of the expenditure incurred under the subhead is being expended for that purpose.  There is also ongoing restoration and refurbishment taking place in Templemore in the training centre and another £6 million is being spent there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>The Deputy made the point that on the overall subhead we were spending about £20 million this year and he queried whether this was money well spent.  This subhead does not apply only to the College of Science building.  It <Col N="1976" /> covers matters such as Garda stations, Templemore Training Centre, provincial Government offices, Defence headquarters and many others such as the Revenue Computer Centre and the National Museum.  We can give the Deputy a breakdown of the procedure on all these matters which are all being undertaken to very high standards with the most speedy expedition possible.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the question of the failure of the EC Finance Ministers to reach agreement yesterday on the compromise measure on the 48-hour cross-Border shopping rule and the question therefore, of the ongoing illegality under EC law of Ireland continuing to <Col N="1977" /> enforce the 48-hour rule declared unlawful by the European Court.  The Deputy has five minutes at his disposal and the Minister five minutes to reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The position on this matter is bizarre in the extreme.  For some months past the Minister is operating in flagrant violation of the law.  The 48-hour rule has been declared unlawful by the European Court.  European law is the law of this land.  Consequently there is no legal basis, as I understand it, for continuing to apply a law which has been declared unlawful by the European Court.  The matter was raised here in this House immediately after the decision of the European Court in Luxembourg was given and the Minister's response on that occasion was that he had not got official notification of the judgment, he required a few days in which to consider it and so on.  He has had quite a long time now to consider it and he insists on maintaining all along that he is enforcing this law.  He also indicated he intended to seek the approval of his fellow-Ministers for Finance to some new arrangement that would be agreed, a compromise proposal, but that has fallen by the wayside; it has not happened.</P>
      <P>It is totally unacceptable that a Government and a Government Minister should flagrantly, openly and in public maintain that he supports and adopts a position in this country that is palpably and clearly unlawful.  Either we are a member of the EC and abide by its rules and regulations or we do not.  The position could be that if a person is stopped by the Minister or the Minister's agents for an alleged breach of the 48-hour rule and raises in an Irish court the question of his being brought before the courts by reason of his compliance with European law which takes precedence here, it is my belief the person would be entitled to be and would be supported by the court in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand and appreciate the Minister's difficulties and I sympathise fully <Col N="1978" /> with the position of traders in Border counties, but that matter has to be addressed by the Minister for Finance in some other way.  It is totally unacceptable that a Minister of this State should be seen in European eyes and in the public eye as totally disregarding European law. What is the position going to be after 1992 if the Minister cannot cope with the situation now under present excise and VAT regulations?  Citizens of this country are obliged to abide by the law, and that applies to Governments in the EC context and to Ministers.  This defiance of EC law, week in and week out, by the Minister represents a very bizarre position.</P>
    <P>One wonders what must be the thoughts, comments and private sayings in Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg and elsewhere on the Irish position.  While we apply for and obtain substantial benefits from the EC where those are appropriate, when it comes to compliance with EC law we purport to act in flagrant violation of those rules.  It is a bit like seeking to eat one's cake and have it.  It is totally unacceptable.  Something has to be done about it.  The matter has to be rectified.</P>

      <P>Deputy Taylor's question refers to the failure of EC Finance Ministers to reach agreement on a compromise measure on the 48-hour rule.  This is a gross over-statement of <Col N="1979" /> what transpired at yesterday's Council meeting.  The plain fact of the matter is that there was no discussion of travellers' allowances by the Council; the Commissioner simply suggested that consideration of the issue should be deferred until next month's Council meeting and that was agreed.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear that the Irish request for a derogation in relation to travellers' allowances is being considered in the context of a proposal from the Netherlands on relaxing general Community restrictions on travellers' entitlements. This proposal has been under discussion by the Council of Ministers for some time now.  Ireland has already made it clear that we can support the Netherland's proposal provided it is amended to deal with the question of cross-Border distortions.</P>
      <P>We have assured our Community partners that we have no difficulty in granting allowances to genuine travellers but that measures are required to deal with the distortions of trade associated with short duration travellers whose journeys are undertaken solely to benefit from tax differentials. Member states and the Commission have reacted positively to the Irish request and I am confident a mutually satisfactory solution can be agreed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has informed the House on a number of occasions, the Government unequivocally support and accept the ruling of the European Court that, through the operation of the 48 hour rule in relation to travellers' allowances without a specific derogation, Ireland failed to fulfil its obligations under the European Community Treaty.  However, we cannot accept a situation in which there is an extensive abuse of the travellers allowance regime to the serious detriment of Irish business and the taxpayer generally. Accordingly, pending the outcome of consultations with the European Commission and in order to safeguard the <Col N="1980" /> important financial and economic interests involved, the 48 hour rule is being maintained in operation.  The fact that Denmark already has Community approval for a 48 hour derogation indicates that our request is not unique and that the Community recognises the cross-Border trade distortions that can occur.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should mention it is by no means unusual for some delay to occur between the handing down of a judgment by the European Court and action by a member state of the Community on foot of that judgment.  The fact is that in this instance there were already proposals under discussion on a new Community regime for travellers' allowances which has complicated matters.  As I have said already, the Minister's position is that he feels that a mutually satisfactory solution can be agreed on this issue shortly.</P>

Deputy Browne has five minutes to present his case and the Minister five minutes to reply.</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult to think that in 1990 a firm could close down overnight in, as far as I am concerned, cowboy fashion.  They simply called in one of their key workers who had been with them for six and a half years, at 6 o'clock on Sunday night, told him the company was closing the following morning and that the workers would be paid statutory redundancy at 11 a.m. on Monday.  It is incredible that this could happen in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They did not consult the IDA from whom they got grants.  They did not call <Col N="1981" /> in the union and, above all, they did not tell the workers that they had a problem. The question is, did they have a problem? Up to the year ending April 1990 they made a profit of £103,000, or they made a profit on their production line of £70,000. From April to November they ran at a loss of £4,000 but in fact, while they may blame the workers, I want to put it on record that any loss they had is because they could not make up their minds which way they were going to treat the glass. There is a treatment for glass called annealing and there is also unannealing, and they could not decide which way they wanted it.  If they had four million items returned to them as being defective, I would suggest it was management's fault. If they had been advised that the old plant which supplied oxygen to them was out of date and was not producing the right oxygen, or if they were told that for about £10,000 they could provide the proper oxygen, I would suggest that the other 600,000 items they say were defective would not have been returned to them if they had acted on that advice.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely flabbergasted that that could happen.  They say that they packed up the equipment, they had it loaded, and they had done all this on the advice of the Employers' Federation.  I would be amazed if this was true, if that is how our employers look on workers in this day. All the statutory payments were ready a week ago.  Everything was done in advance.  It was the same as pulling a trapdoor on the workers.  It is not good enough and I sincerely hope the Minister will make sure that this company pay back every penny they have got in grants and will also make every effort to ensure that job possibilities continue there.  I have been informed that one standing order from one company alone would keep ten workers going all the time.</P>
    <P>There were 18 workers there.  It might sound a small number, but 18 workers in Graiguenamanagh would be the equivalent of a couple of hundred workers in a normal sized town.  This is something <Col N="1982" /> the area cannot put up with.  I would like to ask why this company that had made money up to last April should suddenly decide that they would not improve the oxygen supply for the glass treatment; why, for the first time, they just did not service the machinery this summer; and why they would import a machine costing over £60,000 and leave it on the floor because the oxygen was not right, and then do nothing about it.  Could it be that they had planned in the summer to disappear?</P>
    <P>How much money was paid in grants to this company?  I believe there was £.25 million, and they were supposed to take on 40 workers when they were given these grants.  Is this true?</P>
    <P>On a positive note, what are the possibilities of the workers taking over this venture?  If there are locals who are prepared to do that, what help can they get? If that cannot be done, will the Minister assure me that the IDA will do everything possible to get a replacement industry for this town because 18 jobs in a town the size of Graiguenamanagh is a major loss?</P>

      <P>Glassform Limited, Graiguenamanagh, County Kilkenny, was, originally, an overseas small industry owned by Anchar Glass, a UK company from London which no longer control the operation.  The company is now represented in Ireland by a Mrs. Rosen. Glassform Limited was approved for IDA grant assistance in 1980.  The contingent grant liability period now appears to have expired.  Grants approved and paid to the company were as follows: capital grants, £45,274; training grants £21,361.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mrs. Rosen from the parent company is in charge of the closure.  The IDA contacted her and she responded to the IDA regional office in Waterford today by stating that machinery was being returned from the factory to the UK this week.  However, this machinery is not now being moved pending a meeting <Col N="1983" /> between the IDA legal representatives and company representatives tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The company has a 25-year lease on an IDA 7,000 square foot factory.  It is the company's intention to return this building to the IDA.  When the building is returned to the IDA it will of course be vigorously promoted by them.  The company manufactured laboratory glasses and test tubes and over the last three years, employed on average 15 people. These test tubes are manufactured from raw glass material.  Recently the company has been the subject of intense competition from Japan and the Far East. These companies have been producing low cost plastic test tubes.</P>
    <P>The workforce was advised on the morning of 19 November 1990 that the company was closing immediately and that the employees would be paid in lieu of notice.  The IDA had no prior notice of the closure.  Indeed, the first indication of the closure came from a member of the local community.  The main reasons for the closure given by Mrs. Rosen to the IDA were that they had production problems resulting in £30,000 worth of stock being returned to the plant because of poor quality.  She stated that this money is now completely lost.</P>
    <P>Even though the number of workers is very small indeed, I agree with the Deputy that in a very small place like this it has an impact on the locality.  For that reason, and now that the factory premises will be available, the IDA will make every effort to have it filled once again at an early date.  I hope it will be possible for some indigenous industry, perhaps from the locality, to occupy it in the future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pat Rabbitte gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the reported plan by publicans in Dublin and in a number of other parts of the country to raise the price of the pint by 4p or more, and if the Department of Industry and Commerce intend to take any action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for permitting me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The reported decision by publicans in Dublin and in a number of other areas throughout the country to raise the price of the pint by 4p or 5p is a matter of concern which merits the close attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The very least the Minister should do is to use the powers available to him to freeze the price at its existing level until an investigation can be held as to whether there was a valid case for all or part of the planned increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of the pint has increased significantly since the last order freezing prices in Dublin was lifted by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Ray Burke, in November 1988. I notice the figures published this evening suggest that the price of the pint has soared ahead of inflation.  The example given was that the pint was £1.22 in 1985 compared with £1.52 in April of this year, a 25 per cent increase as compared with a cost of living increase over the same period of 17 per cent.  That differential is before the purported increase of 4p to 5p.  I would draw the Minister's attention <Col N="1985" /> to the statement by the bar persons union to the effect that they are fearful that there could be job losses consequent on this latest threatened increase.  The pint of plain which, as I am sure the Minister agrees, is your only man, is getting out of reach of the ordinary pint drinker.</P>
    <P>The standard response from the Minister has been that competition is sufficient to keep the price of drink down, but there has been substantial evidence in the past of publicans operating as a cartel to fix prices at an agreed level.  The Minister and the publicans must think the public are very naive if they expect us to believe that publicans spontaneously decide to raise the price of the pint by the same amount on the same day without any consultation with one another.</P>
    <P>Some people might say that an increase in the price of the pint is not a very important issue, but there is very big money involved here.  If the planned increase of 4p per pint in the Dublin area was to be applied to the country as a whole, it would take in the region of £25 million out of the pockets of the consumers and put it mainly into the bank accounts of the publicans.  Part of the extra revenue will also go to the Government as the VAT element of the price increase and the prospect of this bonus may explain why there seems to be such reluctance to do anything about the increase.  The price of alcohol is already exceptionally high in this country and further increases will do nothing for our tourism industry.  The pub forms an important part of Irish social life and the Government should take steps to ensure that customers are not the victims of profiteering by publicans.</P>
    <P>There is a number of related areas which I would also like to refer to.  Publicans are required to display the price of drinks, but a recent survey by the Office of Consumer Affairs showed that 82 per cent of pubs in the Dublin area were ignoring regulations regarding display of prices and that 57 per cent of pubs outside of Dublin were ignoring the rules.  There <Col N="1986" /> are also huge variations between prices charged in different pubs for the same products and the outrageously inflated prices charged in pubs for minerals and &ldquo;mixers&rdquo;.  All of this points to the need to strengthen both the powers and the resources of the Office of Consumer Affairs.  In his report for 1988 the then Director of Consumer Affairs, Mr. Jim Murray, contrasted the position of his office with that of Strathclyde Regional Council in Scotland, whose trading standards department covers a population of 2.4 million spread over a smaller area, yet has a staff of 242.  This was ten times the number of staff available to Mr. Murray, whose office was responsible for enforcing almost 50 consumer protection, trading standards and competition laws.  If we are serious about defending the rights of consumers and protecting them against exploitation, then we must provide the resources to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports that publicans are planning to increase prices.  I have also seen reports that the organisations which represent publicans have denied that there is any collusion in respect of price increases.  I have not as yet seen evidence that, as suggested by the Deputy, there is a concerted plan to increas prices in Dublin and in other parts of the country.  The Restrictive Trade Practices Intoxicating Liquor and Non-Alcoholic Beverage Order, 1965, provides that a retail trade association or a group of persons engaged in retailing of such drinks may not decide or recommend retail selling prices.  The order prohibits price fixing by the trade. The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has taken prosecutions under the order but so far unfortunately without success.  On the basis of his experience from these cases he is conscious of the high standard of proof that is apparently required to satisfy our courts before a <Col N="1987" /> conviction for this offence can be obtained.</P>
      <P>It is clearly much easier to allege collusion than to establish legally that it exists to the satisfaction of the courts beyond reasonable doubt.  I am of course unhappy that a potential for price fixing exists which is to a significant extent apparently immune from prosecution.  It may well be that restrictive practices or competition legislation is not the best route to tackle concerted price rises in the licensed trade.  It may well be that the restrictive licensing system is at fault.  If the system creates barriers to entry that make collusion easier and limits competition, then perhaps it should be liberalised.</P>
      <P>While drink is not a necessity I am concerned about the matter because it has a very heavy weighting in the consumer price index.  As a consequence, increases in the price of drink have an inordinate influence on the rate of inflation and accordingly have an effect on wage negotiations, particularly for example the negotiations that are ongoing at the moment.  Excessive wage increases in turn lead to a lack of competition and increased unemployment.  I would find it totally unacceptable if publicans were to push up their prices by collusive action, with consequences going far outside a simple price increase.  This is all the more undesirable when the economic conditions are as benign as they are today.  Inflation is at a lower level than for decades past.  From the evidence of property prices for public houses, particularly in Dublin, it is clear that there is an exceptionally high level of profitability in the licensed trade.  In these circumstances, publicans need to fully justify any increases, not just to me as Minister but particularly to their customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have outlined the favourable economic climate for publicans.  I know that business can have increased costs but <Col N="1988" /> these need not always be passed on automatically to the consumer.  At present the rate of increase in costs is lower than it has been for very many years.  Every other business looks to achieving savings by increased efficiency.  In the current case I note a report in the newspapers that a trade union official, as Deputy Rabbitte has adverted to, has said in the last day or two that recent wage increases would give rise to the need for no more than a 2p increase in prices.  In any event, I cannot see that increases, where they are justified, should be uniform.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some regret that in the on-license trade there is little or no evidence of competition. Consumers should bear in mind that there is plenty of evidence of competition in the off-license trade and in supermarkets.  Consumers, having compared prices and made a judgement, should support only those publicans whose prices fairly reflect the product and service on offer.  Consumers should take advantage of price information displayed.  The proper display of drink prices is a matter of continuing concern to me.  The Director of Consumer Affairs will, at my request, institute an immediate survey of licensed premises and rigorously enforce the law by court action if breaches are discovered.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset the difficulties of proving collusion under existing legislation.  This is an area which is receiving my particular attention in the preparation of the Competition Bill.  In other jurisdictions, where competition law is based on the principles of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome &mdash; as the Bill will be &mdash; it is not necessary that written agreements exist to establish &mdash; and for the courts to accept &mdash; that there has been collusion.  It is possible to reach that conclusion on the basis of examining the behaviour of the parties concerned.  I will be doing what I can to ensure that the courts are enabled to follow a similar line.</P>
    <P>The public need protection from price <Col N="1989" /> fixing arrangements, whether formal or on the basis of a wink and a nod, and I hope when that measure is being considered in the Competition Bill, I will have the support of all sides of the House.</P>

I should like to emphasise that the difficulties are not due to any financial restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board are making every effort to replace the staff on leave but have not yet been successful due to the difficulty in recruiting replacement staff for short time periods. <Col N="1991" /> However, arrangements for an emergency service have been made.  The Southern Health Board are urgently reviewing the situation with a view to restoring the <Col N="1992" /> service as quickly as possible.  The in-patient service is not affected.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 21 November 1990.</P>

      <P>Up to 1986 payments under the employment incentive scheme were made every four weeks.  However the system was extremely difficult and cumbersome to administer as employers had to complete and return reimbursement forms every four weeks which had to be checked by FÁS staff.  Random visits to firms to inspect wages records were necessary as part of the checking procedure.</P>
      <P>It was decided in 1986 to change to a lump sum basis of payment which is considered to be satisfactory and it is not proposed to reintroduce an instalment method of payment.</P>

      <P>The Irish citizen in question, together with a British companion, was arrested on 9 May near Tiberias following an altercation with an Israeli security guard.  The citizen and his companion were later charged with causing grievous bodily harm, illegal use of a motor car, damage to the vehicle and unlawful possession of a firearm.  In addition, the Israeli security guard has filed a civil suit against both men for damages.</P>
      <P>The Irish citizen was tried with his companion on 25 May and sentenced to one year's imprisonment.  He appealed the sentence and, at the appeal hearing on 30 September, his sentence was reduced by 25 per cent.  A parole board meeting was held on 13 November at which it was agreed that he would be released shortly. It is understood that on his release he would be deported from Israel. However, because of the civil suit, he is still in custody.  His case will be the subject of a meeting between his current legal adviser, the legal adviser of the aggrieved person and the Israeli legal authorities which is expected to take place shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department was informed of the arrest by the Ambassador at Athens, who is accredited to Israel, as soon as he had learned of it.  The Embassy has since then stayed in close contact with the citizen in question by phone.  A representative of the Embassy attended the appeal hearing in September and met the citizen and his lawyer.  Contact has been maintained with the citizen's current lawyer so as to <Col N="1784" /> monitor the legal developments in the case.  The Embassy has actively liaised with the British Embassy at Tel Aviv on all aspects of the case.</P>
    <P>My Department also maintains close and continuous contact with the citizen's family.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to the Israeli authorities on a number of aspects relating to the case.  The main representation related to the method in which his then lawyer represented the citizen's interests at the trial.  The Israeli authorities investigated the issue but pointed out that the citizen had pleaded guilty and was sentenced accordingly. Representations regarding telephone calls and post have also been made to ensure that his rights in these regards were upheld.  The Embassy has also sought his transfer to a more open prison than that in which he was initially held. The Embassy is currently working with the citizen's lawyer to have the meeting to discuss his release held as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Embassy will continue to stay in touch with the citizen, and his lawyer, and render him all possible consular assistance and advice.</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that US draft papers may only be issued under the authority of a specific Act passed by the US Congress.  There is no such Act in force at the moment and I am not aware that this Congress is currently considering any proposal to introduce new legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that US law specifies that male US citizens and male aliens with permanent resident status and living in the US, who are between the ages of 18 and 26, are required to register with what is known as the Selective Service System.  The Selective Service System is an independent agency within the executive branch of the US Federal Government which, under US law, fulfils the role of administering a call-up system to the <Col N="1786" /> armed forces in time of emergency in accordance with requirements established by the US Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>Those eligible Irish emigrants who have successfully obtained US immigrant visas would generally have been informed by the relevant US Embassy or Consulate of their obligation to register with the Selective Services System at the time of the issuance of their immigrant visa.  The Selective Services System would, on the basis of information provided by the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service, send the eligible person, following the commencement of his residence in the US, a formal letter of notification and the relevant registration forms which he would have to complete and return.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise the fact that, even though a male is required under US law to register with the Selective Service System, it does not follow that he would necessarily be drafted.  In the event of the US Congress passing a Bill authorising the reintroduction of the draft, a registrant subject to induction would have his eligibility for service determined based on his individual situation at the time.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the carer's allowance scheme which came into operation on 1 November 1990, including the categories of pensioners to whom the scheme applies, are set out in the Social Welfare Act, 1990.  Under the legislation the scheme is confined to Irish social welfare pensioners who are so disabled or invalided as to require full-time care and attention.  Any question of extending the scheme to other categories such as those mentioned in the Deputy's question would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Persons in permanent and pensionable employment in the public service are insured at a reduced rate of PRSI contribution which does not provide cover for retirement or old age contributory pension.  They are covered for income related pensions under their terms of employment as public servants. The question of extending coverage for retirement and old age pension to public servants has been under consideration and discussions have been held with the trade unions on this matter.  This issue has also been raised in the context of the examination which is being carried out by the National Pensions Board into pensions generally.  I expect to have the board's final report early next year.</P>

    <P>The timing of the issue of creditors payments is a matter for each individual agency to decide.  It should also be noted that in considering the above figures the amount outstanding to creditors on any particular date is related to the timing of payments rather than an indication of financial performance.

    </Speaker>
    <P>When issuing the block allocations to the health boards, my Department notified them of the following conditions attaching to grants issuing from the block allocations: grants may be allocated to community based projects under the headings: mental and physical handicap, the elderly, psychiatric services, child services, personal social services (including information and counselling services); at least 70 per cent of the block allocation should be allocated to local voluntary groups; grants should not be used in substitution for section 65 grants and particular care should be taken to ensure that grants are made only to viable schemes which will be completed within a reasonable period.  The health boards should take particular care to assess the ongoing <Col N="1814" /> revenue implications in determining the priority of schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department are monitoring the spending of the block grants in a number of ways.  The health boards must ensure that all grants are expended on the authorised project only and that adequate certification of expenditure is submitted to the board either on completion or as soon as possible after the end of the financial year in which the allocation was made.  It will be a matter for the local government auditors, appointed by me, to ensure that these procedures are fully complied with.  In addition the health boards are also required to submit to my Department details of projects listed for assistance and of amounts to be issued. This must be done as soon as possible after the relevant decision is made and also at the end of the financial year.</P>

      <P>Health boards and mental handicap <Col N="1816" /> agencies give priority to the people with mental handicap who require residential care urgently.  If a permanent residential place is not available immediately, other services, such as respite or day care, are provided to assist the individual and his or her family.</P>
      <P>At present, co-ordinating committees, representative of the statutory and voluntary providers of services for people with mental handicap, are preparing plans to identify and meet the priority needs of those with mental handicap throughout the country.  When these plans have been prepared, firm figures will be available about the numbers requiring additional services and the kind of services required.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional respite facilities is a priority of service development. Respite care, by offering families regular and planned breaks from the responsibility of caring, enables families to cope better and to continue caring for their handicapped member for a longer period at home.  Attention is also being given to strengthening support at home to families caring for persons with mental handicap.</P>
      <P>In the past, persons with mental handicap were referred to mental hospitals for residential care.  It is now policy that persons with mental handicap, unless they have a psychiatric disorder, should not be referred to psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>In 1990 an additional £2 million was allocated for persons with mental handicap which enabled 170 residential places, 442 day places, expanded support for 66 families and an extra 25 staff to be provided. The question of providing further funds in 1991 for residential and other needs will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the light of the resources available for the development of the mental handicap service.</P>

    </table>
    <P>The length of time patients have to wait for an operation depends on the degree of urgency involved in the treatment of a particular case.  I understand that the average waiting time for Beaumont is approximately nine to 12 month and for <Col N="1818" /> Cappagh is five to six months. I recently officially opened two new theatres at Cappagh Hospital which I am sure will help to further reduce the waiting times for patients.  The number of hip replacement operations performed nationally has increased from 1,624 in 1987 to 1,904 in 1989 and I am confident that the figures for 1990 will reflect a continued substantial increase in performance.</P>
    <P>Arrangements regarding an individual patient's position on a waiting list and when his/her operation will be performed are entirely a matter for the clinician concerned and the Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter in which I have any involvement.  However, I would suggest to the Deputy that if the condition of the person referred to in Question No. 117 has deteriorated, his general practitioner should contact his consultant in order to stress the urgency of the case.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the need to have the proposed replacement building at St. Mary's Diocesan School, Beamore Road, Drogheda, County Louth, ready for use in September, 1992 due to the pressure on numbers in the school; and if she will make a statement on the matter with particular reference to the projected completion date.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the need for the proposed extension to St. Mary's Diocesan School in Drogheda.  Every effort will be made to have the planning of the project completed as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the position is that the rate at which this and other such projects may proceed is dependent on the availability of capital resources and on my Department's other commitments and priorities. <Col N="1822" /> In the circumstances I am not in a position at present to indicate a completion date for the project.</P>

      <P>The terms and operation of the higher education and related grants schemes are subject to annual review. The question of adjusting income eligibility limits to take account of cases where more than one member of a family is concurrently seeking third level funding will be considered in the context of the 1991 review having regard to, among other things, the availability of Exchequer resources to support the additional expenditure to which the proposal would give rise.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Kill is in the Naas post-primary catchment area.</P>
      <P>In 1985 my Department undertook a thorough appraisal of the future post-primary needs of the Kill area.  This appraisal showed clearly that the number of pupils seeking post-primary education in the immediate Kill area could not sustain a post-primary school of a reasonable size.  The most recent statistical data available supports this conclusion.  My Department, therefore, are of the view that pupils from the Kill area can best be catered for by the three existing post-primary schools in Naas.</P>
      <P>I have this year sanctioned the provision of additional accommodation at the Mercy secondary school, Naas, which, it is anticipated will be shortly completed.  A building project for the CBS is also at architectural planning stage.</P>
