      <P>I wonder would the Taoiseach be prepared to provide time next week for a short discussion on the remarks of the EC Trade Commissioner, Mr. Andriessen, suggesting that the Commission may be prepared, in negotiations in the GATT round of talks, to concede much larger reductions in farm support than had been envisaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we are now in unprecedented circumstances in that the Taoiseach is responsible for three portfolios, as Taoiseach, Minister for Defence and Minister for the Gaeltacht, could he inform the House if he has anybody in his back benches in whom he has the confidence to appoint as Minister for Defence?  Will an announcement be made?</P>

Would the Taoiseach take time today to make a statement to the House with regard to the position in the Gulf, the likely event of the United Nations Security Council adopting a resolution permitting the use of force against Iraq and the implications that would have for Ireland arising from our membership of the United Nations? I think the Taoiseach will accept that it is a serious matter, one which warrants the opinion of this House to be expressed.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Damage Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="576" /> move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a measure of law reform which will, I think, be generally welcomed.  It simplifies and modernises the law of criminal damage to property and in this it gives effect to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in their report on this subject which was published in September 1988.  It goes further in penalising interference with computerised data and other forms of computer misuse.</P>
      <P>I shall deal first with criminal damage to tangible property.  The present law is contained in the Malicious Damage Act of 1861, which has survived with only minor amendments to the present day. The first 50 sections are devoted to specific offences of malicious damage to different kinds of property by different means.  The Law Reform Commission report I have referred to sets out no fewer than 108 kinds of property and 62 different words to express the causing of damage.  The Bill cuts through all this complicated verbiage by providing just three offences of damage to property in general.  These are, first of all, a simple offence of damage to another's property; second, an aggravated offence of damage to any property where the damage is done with intent to endanger the life of another or with recklessness in that regard; and finally, an offence of damage to any property where there is an intent to defraud. There are also two subsidiary offences of threatening to cause damage to property or to have custody or control of anything with intent to cause damage with it.  All these offences are covered in three provisions &mdash; sections 2, 3 and 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also deals with a problem of much more recent origin, that is, that of computer misuse by what is called hacking.  By hacking I mean getting access to computerised information without the permission of the owner of the computer system or the information.  It can be done either from inside an organisation or from outside by someone who has no legitimate connection with it. &ldquo;Insider&rdquo; hacking takes place when an employee with legitimate access to the <Col N="577" /> data equipment either uses it for a wrongful purpose or exceeds his level of authorisation in accessing particular data: The &ldquo;insider&rdquo; may of course be using a terminal that is located far away from the central processing system of the organisation concerned.  &ldquo;Outsider&rdquo; hacking takes place when a person who has no legitimate connection with a data system gains access to it by using a computer in his own home or office connected to the telephone network.  It is the kind of activity that people most often think of when referring to hacking but it is no different in principle from &ldquo;insider&rdquo; hacking.</P>
    <P>Before computer systems became common, confidential information was kept locked away in filing cabinets in locked rooms so that it could not be tampered with or copied by persons outside the organisation, though of course there was always the posibility of collusion between employees or burglary.  Nowadays information on any computer system linked to the telephone network is vulnerable to access by complete strangers. The situation has been compared to paper files kept in a locked cabinet but left in a public place.  It is just a matter of finding the right key to fit the cabinet and the person who wants to read the files &mdash; in this case the hacker &mdash; can spend as long as he likes trying different keys until he finds one that opens the lock.</P>
    <P>The motives of hackers vary considerably. At one end of the scale, they could be altering, say, payroll programmes for fraudulent purposes.  Those who do so are liable to the penalties prescribed by the law governing fraud.  A crime is a crime irrespective of whether the criminal uses a jemmy or a computer to commit it.  At the other end, there are those, usually young people, who are motivated by a sense of achievement on being able to penetrate the security systems of organisations not only in this country but worldwide and who may just &ldquo;look around&rdquo; the system or copy the information on it or perhaps add on a message of their own.</P>
    <P>Hacking can cause very serious <Col N="578" /> damage, whether the computer system is used only for storing information or has an operational role.  If the system is dealing only with information storage, the hacker can erase the information or introduce false data.  If it has an operational role &mdash; if it is dealing with, say, inter-bank fund transfers, air traffic control, stock control and automatic reordering, airline and hotel bookings, payrolls and so on &mdash; the hacker can reprogramme these systems or add false data with the possibility of causing substantial damage and financial losses.  In both cases, he can introduce &ldquo;viruses&rdquo; or &ldquo;worms&rdquo;, that is, programmes that replicate themselves and either use up the capacity of the system or delete existing programmes or data.</P>
    <P>That is why we have added to the measures recommended by the Law Reform Commission in relation to damage to tangible property a number of provisions to ensure that any interference with data held on computerised systems will be equated with damage and be punishable accordingly.  But not all hackers interfere with the data held on the target computer on every occasion that they engage in this activity.  They may not have any particular computer system in mind when they start off and be merely seeking to log on to the first system they gain access to, whatever it may turn out to be. And when they do gain access, they may be satisfied just to &ldquo;look around&rdquo; it without modifying the data in any way or they may want to proceed further into the system but find that they are unable to do so because they cannot penetrate the level of security provided by it.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that hacking activity which does not result in data or programs being modified &mdash; the &ldquo;looking around&rdquo; activity I have mentioned &mdash; should not be made an offence on the grounds that, first, what is involved is merely a breach of confidentiality and, second, that such breaches are not punishable under the criminal law except in two cases, these being breaches of the Official Secrets Act, 1963, or of section 22 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, which makes it an offence to disclose personal data that has <Col N="579" /> been improperly obtained.  I think that many people would regard the breach of confidentiality as sufficient, without more, to justify criminalising this activity and I sympathise with that view but the Government's reason for doing so is based on other grounds.</P>
    <P>The fact is that hacking is a matter of major and legitimate concern to users of computer systems.  To counter it, ever more sophisticated security measures have to be put in place which reduce their speed and efficiency.  In addition, the systems must be monitored regularly to check whether there have been unauthorised attempts at entry.  If any instance of hacking, however trivial, is detected it must be investigated to see if any damage has been caused.  Even if it has not, it may be advisable to close down the system and rewrite the software completely as a precaution.  In particular, hacking into operational computer systems, such as those I have mentioned &mdash; and they include such operations as air traffic control &mdash; could have most serious consequences. That is why in recent years any form of unauthorised access to computer systems has been made an offence in many countries, including the US, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Iceland and France.</P>
    <P>Section 5, then, makes it an offence merely to access or attempt to access data or, as the section puts it, to operate a computer with intent to access any data that are kept either inside or outside the State.  It applies whether any data are actually accessed and whether the intention is to access any particular data.  It will also be an offence under our law for anyone abroad to try to access data kept on a computer here.  The offence is punishable on summary conviction by a £500 fine or imprisonment for a maximum term of three months or by both a fine and imprisonment.  Of course, if as part of the hacking activity any data are modified, the modification constitutes an offence under section 2 and makes the hacker liable to the far heavier penalties provided there.  Also, a person who is found not guilty of modifying data under <Col N="580" /> section 2 may be found guilty, if the facts justify it, of the lesser offence of unauthorised access under section 5.  That is provided by section 7 (3).</P>
    <P>Before leaving secion 5, I should explain that it does not cover what is called electronic eavesdropping, that is, the remote monitoring of electromagnetic emissions from computer equipment.  It is possible to pick up the radiation from a computer screen in much the same way as radio or television transmissions are picked up and to convert this radiation into an image on the eavesdropper's own computer screen. But all that can be seen on that screen is whatever happens to be on the screen that is being monitored at that particular time and, in practice, the results are likely to be unsatisfactory because of the limited strength of the radiation &mdash; and consequently the limited area over which it can be received &mdash; and also because of its susceptibility to electrical inter-eference. This kind of surveillance is essentially no different from any other kind of electronic eavesdropping of current activities.  It is &ldquo;passive&rdquo; and does not have the potential, as hacking does, of reading all the data files of the company being hacked or of going further and manipulating or even rendering useless its entire information system.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the provision being made for the mental element in the offence of damage to property. Under the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, damage had to be done &ldquo;maliciously&rdquo;. Ever since 1861 this term has been interpreted as meaning intentionally or recklessly and the word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; has been given a subjective meaning.  In other words, a person would be regarded as reckless only if he had foreseen that the particular kind of harm which in fact was done might be done and yet had gone on to take the risk of it.  The Bill incorporates that subjective definition of &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; in section 2 (6) to make it clear that there is no intention of making any change in the traditional interpretation of the &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; element in the offence of criminal damage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> I may say that the Law Reform Commission, while equally anxious to ensure that a subjective interpretation of &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; would be retained, proposed a formulation taken from the tentative draft of the United States Model Penal Code.  However, this proposal was made on the basis that there would be a common approach to the mental element &mdash; the <i>mens rea</i>&mdash; in criminal offences generally, unless there were special reasons for adopting a different approach having regard to the particular offence under consideration.  The Government took the view, pending the adoption of a common standard of recklessness under the general criminal law, that it would be better to retain the traditional formula.</P>
    <P>It was also a requirement under the 1861 Act that damage had to be done &ldquo;unlawfully&rdquo; and this element in the offence is being retained by the use of the words &ldquo;without lawful excuse&rdquo;.  Some of the circumstances in which an accused person may have a lawful excuse are set out in section 6 but these special defences are without prejudice to any other lawful defences that a person may have under the existing law, such as the defence of necessity.  Under section 6 a person who damages property, or modifies data, will have a lawful excuse if he has an honest belief that the person entitled to consent to or authorise the damage or modification had in fact done so or would have done so had he known the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The other special defence provided by the section is an honest belief that it was reasonable to do the damage, or make the modification, to protect oneself or another or to protect property belonging to oneself or another or a right or interest in property which was, or which he believed to be, vested in himself or another.  In that case there must also be an honest belief in the immediate necessity of protection and in the reasonableness of the means of protection adopted or proposed to be adopted. Neither of these defences applies if there is a life endangering element in the damaging of the property.  Accordingly, the operation of the section does not extend to the aggravated offence of damage <Col N="582" /> under section 2 (2), to threats to cause damage or to possession of something with intent to cause damage with it, where the threat or intention relates to damaging property in a way which the offender knows is likely to endanger the life of another.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (2) introduces a procedure aimed at avoiding what the Law Reform Commission describe as an element of unreality in requiring the owner of damaged property to identify the property as his in cases where it patently does not belong to the accused and also to say that he gave no one permission to damage the property.  Under this provision, in prosecutions in relation to damage to property belonging to another, it will not be necessary for the prosecution to name the person to whom the property belongs and it will be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that the property belongs to another.  It will also be presumed, again until the contrary is shown, that the person entitled to consent to or authorise the damage concerned had not done so. The latter presumption will also apply to modifications of data but only where the person charged is not an employee or agent of the person keeping the data.</P>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to have such a presumption for employees because there can often be genuine misunderstandings about the extent of an employee's authorisation to access and modify data.  So, if an employee is charged with modifying data without authorisation it will be up to the prosecution to prove the absence of authorisation in the normal way.  The presumption will apply to unauthorised modifications of data only where the person charged has no connection with the person or firm whose data are being hacked.</P>
    <P>Section 9 enables a court to require a person who has been convicted of damaging property to pay the owner compensation not exceeding the amount of the damages that in the court's opinion would be recovered in a civil action.  The object is to ensure as far as possible that offenders who can afford to pay for the damage are made to do so, or to start <Col N="583" /> doing so, as quickly as possible.  But, as a practical matter, it will not be always possible for the convicting court to establish who the owner of the damaged property is and the exact extent of the damage and the cost of making it good.  So it will be utilised only where the owner is identified and where the approximate cost of making good the damage is readily ascertainable.</P>
    <P>The section also requires the court to have regard to the convicted person's means so far as they appear or are known to the court.  Again, the object here is to try to ensure that the compensation order can be realistically enforced without causing hardship.  Special provision is made where the convicted person is under 17 and the court is empowered under section 99 of the Children Act, 1908, to order the fine, damages or costs awarded to be paid by the parent or guardian instead of by the child or young person.  In such a case the court must have regard to the means of the parent or guardian.  Payment of the compensation may be made by instalments so long as the period of payment does not extend beyond 12 months.  The object of imposing a maximum limit on the repayment period is to ensure that payment cannot be so prolonged as to be oppressive or indeed unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The section, in effect, allows the court to give preference to making a compensation order rather than imposing a fine where it seems to it that the means of the offender are insufficient to pay both an appropriate fine and appropriate compensation, though in such a case it may impose a fine as well if the offender can afford to pay it.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission also recommended that criminal damage offences should cease to be scheduled under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  Scheduling these offences means that a person may be arrested under section 30 of that Act for a malicious damage offence and be detained for up to 48 hours, during which period he may be questioned about other <Col N="584" /> offences.  The commission concluded that the scheduling of malicious damage offences could not be justified as being necessary to investigate other offences and that it led to unnecessary confusion and expense.</P>
    <P>This recommendation of the commission is not relevant to the proposed Bill as the scheduling, or descheduling, of an offence is a matter to be effected by a Government order under section 36 of the 1939 Act.  Section 36 (3) provides that, whenever the Government are satisfied that the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order can be secured through the medium of the ordinary courts in relation to offences of any particular class or kind or under any particular enactment, it may by order declare that those offences shall cease to be scheduled offences.  The need to continue scheduling particular offences is reviewed periodically but at this juncture I do not propose asking the Government to deschedule malicious damage offences. In any event, the matter will come up for review by the Government when the Bill becomes law, as that will necessitate a consequential amendment of the scheduling order, which, as it stands, refers to provisions of the 1861 Act which are now proposed for repeal.</P>
    <P>The repeals effected by the Bill make it necessary to make a consequential amendment to the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  The 1976 Act extended the State's criminal jurisdiction to certain acts done in Northern Ireland that, if done in the State, would constitute one of the offences specified in the Schedule to that Act.  Corresponding legislation was enacted in the UK.  These offences include the common law offence of arson, which the Bill proposes to abolish, and sections 1 to 7 of the 1861 Act dealing with arson offences, which sections are being repealed.</P>
    <P>When the 1976 Act was passed, the 1861 Act applied both here and in Northern Ireland, but in 1977 the provisions of the English 1971 Criminal Damage Act were extended by order to Northern Ireland, resulting in the abolition of the <Col N="585" /> common law offence of arson and the repeal of sections 1 to 7 of the 1861 Act. However, in order to maintain the necessary correspondence between the offences specified in the 1976 Act and those applying in Northern Ireland, the order provided that, for the purposes of the UK legislation, the abolition of the common law offence of arson would not have effect in Northern Ireland and that sections 1 to 7 of the 1861 Act would continue to apply there.</P>
    <P>I believe that the criminal law jurisdiction legislation here and in the UK should reflect the changes that have been made in UK criminal damage law and those we are now proposing to make in Irish law.  Section 14 (4) proposes, therefore, to update the Schedule of offences in the 1976 Act to take account of the changes being made by the Bill and to bring this provision into operation when a reciprocal amendment has been made in the corresponding UK legislation.  In the meantime the necessary correspondence with Northern Ireland law is being preserved by section 14 (3).</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think it is fair to say that the Bill is a useful and practical measure of law reform.  On behalf of the Government I wish to express thanks and appreciation to the chairman and members of the Law Reform Commission for their excellent report, which has greatly facilitated the preparation of this much needed amendment of the law. The Bill is, I think, non-controversial and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that this Bill is non-controversial and I have no difficulty in accepting it in principle.  I am convinced that our antiquated, largely Victorian criminal laws are totally inadequate as a legal framework within which the fight against crime in the late 20th century can be conducted.  Essentially, loopholes in our legislation have not been closed and, because we have been so slow in updating our criminal laws, many an accused has been able to escape his just desserts.  The Malicious Damage Act, 1861, which we are now replacing clearly falls into this category <Col N="586" /> of outdated legislation.  I would agree with Professor Brian Hogan's assessment of the Act when he wrote in 1969 that &ldquo;In retrospect it seems astonishing that Parliament, or rather the lawyers responsible, could have foisted on the public and the profession so inelegant an instrument as the Malicious Damage Act, 1861&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That Act has survived for almost 130 years but it has run into many problems, particularly with interpretation.  The problems associated with the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, were never so clearly highlighted in recent times as when the prosecution was brought in 1986 for the malicious damage to the famous moving statue in Ballinspittle, County Cork, not far from where I live.  Great public concern was voiced following the acquittal in that instance and the case clearly provided further corroboration, if that was necessary, for the updating and simplification of legislation dealing with criminal liability for damaged property.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is largely based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report.  Since I accept the recommendations of that report, I have no difficulty in accepting in principle the Criminal Damage Bill, 1990, but there are few aspects of it I want to refer to in more detail later.  However, in principle, it is a good Bill.  The updating of this aspect of our laws highlights the glaring inadequacies in other areas.  The Government committed themselves in the Joint Programme for Government to the process of codifying and updating the criminal law in general but no great progress has been made on this front.  While the present Minister for Justice has produced occasional items of worthy legislation he will stand indicted unless he tackles the problem in a comprehensive manner.</P>

      <P>I am a very fair man and I accept that a few Bills have been produced &mdash; in the main good Bills &mdash; but that is not the way we are going to provide the comprehensive, modern, updated legal framework within which to conduct the fight against crime.  I have consistently praised the Law Reform Commission for their work while at the same time I have highlighted the fact that such a commission as at present constituted, dealing with everything from debt collection to the death penalty, do not have the resources to undertake the comprehensive examination of our criminal justice system which is a necessary base to the process.  I will raise again with the Minister the desirability of establishing a separate criminal law reform commission to undertake this work.  This is an absolutely necessary part of the process of codifying and updating our entire criminal law.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Criminal Damage Bill, the Minister has been wise in this instance in largely following the recommendations to the Law Reform Commission. The commission pointed out that the UK Criminal Damage Act, 1971, was a model of simplicity, and decided to use that Act as a model for reform.  This led to the conclusion that the long list of specific offences established by the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, should be replaced by a more general offence in respect of criminal damage to another person's property.  I like the broader definition of property proposed in the Bill and the fact that computer hacking is also covered.  Making unauthorised accession to automated data an offence is another worthy inclusion.</P>
      <P>In case the Minister might think I am praising him too much, I will now raise a few issues on which I am not in total agreement, and the principal one relates to criminal intent.  The Law Reform Commission saw an advantage in establishing a common approach to the question of <i>mens rea</i> in relation to criminal offences generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> The Minister pointed out in his speech that the Bill incorporates the subjective definition of &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; in section 2 (6) to make it clear that there is no intention of making any change in the traditional interpretation of the &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; element in the offence of criminal damage.  He mentioned that the Law Reform Commission had a somewhat different approach and proposed a formulation taken from the tentative draft of the US model penal code which I have seen referred to, in another document, as the best criminal code of the 20th century. The Law Reform Commission consider that there should be a common approach to the mental element in criminal offences generally.  We talked about this when debating the Bill dealing with handling stolen goods but the Minister shied away from this issue.  In that Bill, he did not follow the proposals of the Law Reform Commission and the same is true in relation to this Bill.  The Minister merely said that the Government took the view, pending the adoption of a common standard of recklessness under the general criminal law, that it would be better to retain the traditional form. Quite frankly, that is not good enough because there is a whole area of uncertainty on this very point.</P>
    <P>The first thing anybody learns in studying criminal law is that no person commits a criminal offence unless he commits it in fact and in mind.  The prosecution must prove that the criminal knew what he was doing at the time of the alleged crime. That is the most fundamental concept in the criminal justice system.  The trouble is that criminal law generally refers to certain fundamental concepts in varying orders of grievousness ranging from &ldquo;intention&rdquo;, &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo;, &ldquo;criminal negligence&rdquo;, &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;, &ldquo;strict liability&rdquo; and &ldquo;absolute liability&rdquo;.  The difficulty is that nobody knows exactly what these concepts are because they are not written down anywhere in Irish law. There is, therefore, much argument in our courts interpreting these concepts, argument largely based on case precedent in the English, Australian and American courts.  There has been endless <Col N="589" /> argument in our courts, huge delays in trials and an inconsistency in verdicts in some instances.</P>
    <P>Even in the United Kingdom they have problems in that regard because, in recent years, there have been a number of prominent cases where the House of Lords reversed itself three different times in the space of a couple of years.  It is important to have clarity when we are talking about criminal intent and we are merely adding another but to the patchwork quilt in this Bill with the proposal of the Minister.  While I accept that the Law Reform Commission have suggested a common approach, when will we have it?  The Minister said he refused to accept the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the offence of receiving and he is doing the same in relation to this Bill.  Does he intend to have a general criminal justice Bill which will deal with this point?  If so, when? Pending all this, will we just sit and wait while the present state of uncertainty in our laws prevails.  The Minister is shying away from a very serious &mdash; although admittedly rather difficult &mdash; problem but the longer he continues to do so the longer he will continue to do a disservice to our criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views on another issue touched on in the report of the Law Reform Commission, whether legislation should introduce an offence of &ldquo;causing or risking a catastrophe&rdquo;. Such an offence has been created in a number of American states. The principle on which this offence is based is that fires, explosions, floods, and so on, are properly the subject of criminal law where they are intentionally or recklessly created by human agencies.  I accept that the concept of causing or risking a catastrophe is of a somewhat uncertain scope and that our criminal law already covers much of the range of conduct embraced by this type of activity. This area was delved into by the Law Reform Commission's report and this would be an appropriate occasion to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted the view that I &mdash; and indeed many others &mdash; expressed <Col N="590" /> in relation to enabling the court require the person who has been convicted of damaging property to pay compensation to the owner.  I am very glad that this approach has been adopted because victims of crime are too often the forgotten people in our criminal justice system. I favour a much broader approach in relation to general criminal law whereby the courts would be given power in virtually all cases to order compensation to be paid to the victim of the crime and, if necessary, to enforce such orders by way of confiscation of property or attachment of income.</P>
    <P>While the detailed provisions of the compensation section will need to be teased out on Committee Stage, I am very much in favour of the principle. However, I should like the Minister to deal with one point in his closing remarks at the end of Second Stage.  I refer to the question of parental responsibility which is touched on in section 9.  I appreciate that in the case of a person under 17 years of age, there is an existing power under the Children Act, 1908, to require the parent or guardian to pay any fine, damages or costs imposed on the child or young person but as far as I can see, the Minister has not clarified the point in relation to a compensation order.  It is not clear from the Bill that it is included and the Minister skirted carefully over that point in his speech.</P>
    <P>I accept that under the Bill the court shall have regard to the means of the parent or guardian in determing the amount to be paid by a young offender but the Bill does not appear to extend power to require such parent or guardian to pay compensation.  The whole question of parental responsibility needs to be explored further.  This must be recognised by the Minister and I invite him to give his views on that matter.  Should there be parental responsibility in relation to the payment of compensation?</P>
    <P>There is one further point in relation to compensation provisions on which I am slightly at odds with the Minister.  He provided that payment of compensation may be made by instalments as long as <Col N="591" /> the period of payments does not exceed 12 months.  He explains his approach on the basis that the object of imposing a maximum limit on the repayment period is to ensure that payment cannot be so prolonged as to be oppressive or unrealistic. That will not wash.  Why tie the hands of a court in such circumstances? In some cases it might be quite oppressive to have an instalment order which would be limited to 12 months but in others it might be quite oppressive no matter how long the period was.  Surely this is a matter for the court and the court should decide, taking all of the circumstances of the individual case into account.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to have another look at this proposal.  I agree in principle that there should be an arrangement for the payment of fines by instalment.  Part of our problem relates to people living on social welfare or who have poor means and may be unable to pay straight off, for instance, a fine of a few hundred pounds for a road traffic offence.  The instalment approach would be very beneficial in such cases.  I am not against the introduction of the instalment arrangement but I oppose the limitation of the period to 12 months.  The hands of the courts should not be tied by an unnecessary statutory restriction.  The court might find it sensible in many instances to order an instalment period of 24 months, or a couple of years.</P>
    <P>The Bill on the whole is satisfactory. Some points will need to be clarified by the Minister and some issues will have to be teased out on Committee Stage, but the Second Stage of the Bill can be approved.</P>
    <P>I accept that some of the issues I have raised might more appropriately be raised in a Dáil committee on crime.  It is quite outrageous that the Government have not seen fit to allow this Dáil committee on crime to be set up.  We in the Opposition are not party to any sweetheart deals with the Progressive Democrats and we do not accept that precedent should be broken in relation to the chairmanship of such a committee. The last such committee had as chairman <Col N="592" /> Deputy Michael Woods who was then the shadow spokesman on Justice.  It is outrageous that Fianna Fáil now in Government are holding up the establishment of this committee with their unprecedented demand that the chairman of it should be a member of one of the Government parties.  I understand that this is one of the sweetheart deals between the two partners in Government. We want to see the committee on crime established on the same basis as heretofore, with an Opposition chairman. I do not see any justification for the approach adopted by the Government and I challenge the Minister to provide such justification if he can.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us can be approved on Second Stage and I look forward to teasing out some of its provisions in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's observations that this Bill is, by and large, uncontentious, and it will no doubt get the support of all parties.  The Workers' Party will support the Bill on Second Stage but will seek to raise with the Minister a number of matters concerning provisions of the Bill and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are putting aside legislation that has been on our Statute Books for upwards of 130 years. It is an incredible illustration of the ineffectiveness of this House and successive Governments that in an area of such importance &mdash; to the extent that it is referred to in the Law Reform Commission report and in the Minister's explanatory memorandum as an area of crime of extraordinary prevalence &mdash; we have taken so long to reform the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister's officials for counting out the incredible statistics and for outlining that there are 108 kinds of property mentioned in the Act.  I tried to do that in preparing for this debate.  I got some way down the line and gave up in exasperation.  There are 62 expressions of the kinds of damage that can be done. Whoever worked on this legislation so <Col N="593" /> long ago has to be applauded for ingenuity. One can imagine the kind of game that was played as that legislation was being prepared.  The unworkability of the legislation is well illustrated by the moving statue case.  The defendant in that case, when asked for a comment said, &ldquo;if it moves again I will be back&rdquo;.  That case outraged people generally and made us wonder exactly what our laws mean.  I commend the judge in that case for his courage in ruling in favour of the defendant. As it transpired the indictment was specifically laid, alleging that the area was a place of sanctity.  There was under the legislation many other opportunities to lay different indictments.  The State picked one and did not prove their case, and that was it.  It was the complexity thrown up and the opportunities to draft any number of indictments that drew the legislation into question.</P>
    <P>The previous Attorney General, Mr. Rogers requested the Law Reform Commission to look at this area of the law and he is to be commended for that.  The Law Reform Commission deserve the praise of this House.  I am glad that we are modifying our law.  Look how simply it can be done?  This is very modest legislation reducing many decades of sections to four basic sections in the Bill.  The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing it forward.</P>
    <P>I would like an explanation for the fact that it is two years since the Law Reform Commission report was published and the Minister circulated the Bill.  Is two years not too long a period to wait if we are responding quickly to the work of the Law Reform Commission?  There may be an explanation in the area which the Minister has added with regard to computer hacking and interference.  It is not satisfactory that it should take two years to circulate legislation on foot of a comprehensive and succinct report from the Law Reform Commission in an important and urgent area.  That is my only reservation.  I welcome the Bill in principle and also the actions of the Minister in bringing it forward.</P>
    <P>The work of the Law Reform Commission makes our job easier.  It must be <Col N="594" /> noted from the Order of Business that we have immediately after this a further Bill arising directly from the work of the Law Reform Commission.  This signals a new departure to the extent that we are now working directly in partnership with the Law Reform Commission.  The Minister is adopting in principle the general thrust and the content of those reports.</P>
    <P>The legislation before us contains some very important issues that should be looked at.  I welcome the Minister's decision to include the whole issue of computer hacking and interference with computer programming, etc.  It is important that our legislation is keeping abreast of modern technological developments. It is a good feature of this legislation that we have provided so comprehensively in its definition and workability, the protection of the computer as a concept and of the computer content as an item of ownership.  I will be supporting those provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned, as is Deputy O'Keeffe, with the Minister's departure from the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission regarding criminal intent in this area.  I am surprised the Minister has not gone along with the provisions in the Law Reform Commission Report.  He also disagreed with the Law Reform Commission in the area of criminal intent in the handlers Bill, in which we dealt with the question of intent by those receiving and handling stolen property. It is curious that the Minister is at variance so often with the commission on this point.  They have argued for a universal formula.  It is important that this line of consistency should exist in our legislation.  The idea of introducing into various Bills various offences for different criminal concepts of intent, is not a good one.  The incredible complexities that that will develop in terms of judicial precedent will be a minefield for the courts and for the prosecuting authorities. In his concluding remarks the Minister should tell us when he expects to be in a position to introduce the universal test for one common standard that has been argued for and which is maintained by the Law Reform Commission in this <Col N="595" /> and in previous reports.  How does the Minister see this now because I am a little confused about the offences of arson. Will it remain a separate offence as recommended or is it intended, by implication in this legislation, that the offence will no longer be known in our law?  I cannot find the answer clearly set out in the legislation or in the memorandum. I believe the offence of arson should be retained as a separate offence &mdash; we argued that the concept of rape, as an offence, should be retained and developed.  It is a particular heinous and unacceptable form of criminal activity. Since its consequences are horrendus, it is important that we retain the offence of arson, irrespective of the universality of the provisions of this Bill in the area of criminal damage.</P>
    <P>I support the conclusions of the Law Reform Commission in regard to the suggestion that we should introduce an offence of causing or attempting to cause a catastrophe.  I do not believe we should introduce such an offence into our code. Circumstances are, perhaps, somewhat different in other jurisdictions, particularly in America, where they have introduced it.  It is an unnecessary concept of crime in our jurisprudence.  I welcome the fact that the Minister accepts the recommendation of the commission on that point.</P>
    <P>Some points of the more technical aspects of the legislation worry me.  I welcome the way the universal definition of &ldquo;property&rdquo; has been laid out.  I welcome also the concept of a universal definition of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; as set out in the legislation, but I am concerned about the Minister's refusal to accept the recommendation that malicious damage should be descheduled for the purposes of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939. This is not a small matter.  The use of malicious damage as a vehicle to detain people under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act is an abuse of the legislation.</P>
    <P>This is best illustrated by the famous case of Timothy Bowes who was arrested on the suspicion that he had committed <Col N="596" /> murder, which is not a scheduled offence for the purposes of the 1939 Act.  Since the gardaí who arrested him were anxious to detain him as long as possible for the purposes of questioning, he was detained for the offence of malicious damage to the knife that was used as a weapon. Apparently a kitchen knife had been used to kill the unfortunate victim and in the process the blade has been bent.  The Gardaí alleged that that amounted to malicious damage of the knife and on that basis Mr. Bowes was arrested and detained.  The High Court, the President and current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, had no difficulty in decrying that as a device and saying that it was an abuse of the use of the scheduling of malicious damage under the Act.  Mr. Bowes was cleared of the offence on the basis that his detention was unlawful and that a device of abuse had been employed by the gardaí to detain him.</P>
    <P>Malicious damage, as a scheduled offence, is used daily to detain people of all ages &mdash; as young as 14 years and under &mdash; in Garda stations for questioning at their ease over 24 hours or 48 hours, as provided by the 1939 Act, and is used in a way that was never intended by the Legislature.  The Title of the 1939 Act says it is an Act designed to suppress offences against the State and other serious crimes.  Because, since 1973, malicious damage is now a scheduled offence within the workings of the 1939 Act, anyone alleged or accused of having committed the offence of malicious damage can be detained by the gardaí for up to 48 hours.  Unfortunately, it is used wholesale in circumstances which were never intended by the Legislature but is technically within the parameters of the legislation.  The Law Reform Commission do not shy away from this point; they made this point.  The Commission recommended that, because we are now providing a comprehensive provision in regard to malicious damage, the time was opportune to take it out of the scheduling of the 1939 Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion that this is not the appropriate legislation or time to do that is regrettable.  The Minister <Col N="597" /> suggested that, because we are amending the law and fundamentally repealing it in this legislation, that the issue of rescheduling, scheduling or amending of the scheduling will have to come back before him and the Government for consideration. Can he tell this House the position with regard to the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission? When it comes back for consideration in the context of this legislation, once passed, will the Minister recommend to Cabinet that the Law Reform Commission's recommendations be complied with, and that this recommendation should lead to the descheduling of malicious damage.  This is the vehicle under which people can be brought before the Special Criminal Court.  It is necessary for the Director of Public Prosecutions to actively certify that the ordinary courts are sufficient to deal with malicious damage on indictment before the case can be left to the ordinary courts.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, under the law, must actively intervene in prosecutions of malicious damage to ensure that they remain before the ordinary courts and are not sent to the Special Criminal Court, irrespective of the circumstances of how minor or non-organised terrorist or otherwise the crimes.  That is not a healthy situation.  The Law Reform Commission made this point.  I ask the Minister to indicate the position clearly to us.</P>
    <P>Another worrying aspect of the legislation is the restriction on the right to election to trial.  The legislation provides that the right to jury trial will now be reposited entirely in the hands of the Director of Public Prosecutions and he will be the only one who can decide.  That is a regrettable step.</P>
    <P>The right to a jury trial is a right of the accused and should always be so.  It has been a trend in recent criminal amending legislation to introduce the formula that the right will only reposit with the Director of Public Prosecutions who may decide that the facts are so serious, or taking other matters into consideration, that the proper location is for a trial <Col N="598" /> before a jury.  That is a serious curtailment of the right to a jury trial and it is repeated in this legislation.  I do not think this provision should be included.  I accept that the Law Reform Commission recommended its inclusion but they are fundamentally wrong in their suggestion. I shall pursue this matter as vigorously as possible on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The right to a jury trial is the right of the accused and our legislation should always provide that it is the accused who can make that choice.  One could argue that there should be a limit.  The Malicious Damage Act, 1861, provides that damage of £50 and under, as provided by the Criminal Procedure Act, 1851 is of necessity summary and an accused can only be tried summarily but an accused who causes damage of £50 and over has the right to trial by jury on election.</P>
    <P>Some formula like that should be included in this legislation because, irrespective of how minor an offence, a conviction can have catastrophic consequences for an accused.  Under the law, if a person is accused of stealing goods worth 1p from a shop, for example, a toffee bar or a sweet, he has the right to a trial by jury.  That is correct and it should be that way.  It is because a conviction can have horrendous consequences in some circumstances for an accused &mdash; for example, it might mean the end of a person's career, he may lose his job and it might have consequences far beyond the immediate apparency of the minor nature of the charge &mdash; a person should have the absolute right to say, &ldquo;I want this issue decided by a jury of my peers because I believe that is the best way I can protect my innocence and my future&rdquo;.  To take that right away is not a good precedent.  I ask the Minister to look at this issue before Committee Stage and not to persist with the proposition contained in the legislation that the right to decide should reposit only with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I ask him to consider bringing forward a formula which would ensure that offences of a minor nature would be necessarily summary and after that the right to a trial <Col N="599" /> by a jury would be a choice and right of the accused.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the provision in relation to barring orders and that the concept of ownership should rest with the person who has obtained the barring order.  In 80 per cent of cases, and perhaps more, which come before our courts in which a barring is made the person barred, usually the man, turns up on the doorstep late at night with drink on board demanding entry to the house and often forcing his way in by breaking a door or window or causing some other damage. It has been a major problem in the prosecution of that type of offence to prove ownership beyond that of the woman in the house who has obtained the barring order.  That prosecution has not been available to the Garda because a defendant can say, &ldquo;It is my house, I am merely barred from it and I can damage my own property in whatever way I desire&rdquo;.  The provision in relation to barring orders is a very good development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the removal of the issue of ownership.  This will make the prosecution of this type of offence very easy in the future.  Over the decades it was very difficult for many gardaí to lay a good case before the courts where damage had clearly been caused because they were not able to produce the owner in court.  Those people involved in terrorist and organised crime gangs also used this device to bring pressure to bear on those whose property had been damaged, bombed or burned not to turn up in court.  That will not happen in future because the whole issue of ownership has been removed.  In those circumstances people can be prosecuted where it can be clearly shown that they were not the owners and were not entitled to damage the property.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the provision for civilian arrests and I should like the Minister to look at it again before Committee Stage.  Section 12 provides that a person can be arrested by a Garda or a civilian if they think an offence has been committed.  Section 12 (2) provides that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> Any person may arrest without warrant anyone who is or whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects to be in the act of commiting an offence to which this section applies.</P>
    <P>If I understand that subsection correctly, it will be a very substantial extension of the common law right of a civilian to arrest.  My understanding of the common law right of a civilian to arrest &mdash; by civilian I mean a person who is not a member of the Garda Síochána &mdash; is that a civilian who observes a crime being committed can apprehend an offender at the place of the crime.  This provision will give a civilian comparable powers to a member of the Garda Síochána and will allow a civilian who suspects with reasonable cause, not having witnessed the crime being committed, to arrest a person.  That is a very worrying extension of the powers of a civilian in this area.  It means that a person walking innocently down the road, far removed from the scene of a crime, could be set upon by a civilian on the basis that the civilian thought he had caused damage to property three or four streets away.  That is an incredible and very worrying extension of the powers of common law arrest by a civilian.</P>
    <P>One can imagine the rows which will take place, and the problems which will arise, when a do-gooder decides he is going to clean up a locality and haul off people to the nearest police station on reasonable cause of suspicion.  It is only right that members of the Garda Síochána should have the power to arrest people on reasonable suspicion.  They are trained, are aware of their rights, are fully accountable, are subject to a line of authority within the force and must explain all of their actions.  We as a community give to them the power to arrest for reasonable cause and suspicion, but if we give that power to civilians it will be dangerous in the extreme and will rebound greatly on this legislation and the integrity and reputation of the Minister if he persists with it.</P>
    <P>I was amazed that the Law Reform Commission made this recommendation <Col N="601" /> and I do not accept the tenuous grounds they advanced in their report for its inclusion in the Bill.  The Minister should reflect further on this provision before the legislation passes through both Houses.</P>
    <P>The final issue of concern to me is the provision in relation to parental compensation. I want to state clearly that it is not a good proposition.  I accept that this provision exists in the 1908 Act but the Minister will have to concede that by and large it is not employed by courts at all because it is unworkable.  The concept of penalising parents who have a truculent and difficult child is not the way to deal with such issues.  It is interesting to note that we are providing this draconian provision in the context of compensation to the victims of damage to property only. It is curious that in all our legislation it is the victim of the damage to property who is provided for.  Of course, they are a particular class of people.  They are not the majority, but those who in this society do not have a great deal of property. There is no provision in our legislation whereby the victims of personal attack and assault are compensated or which obliges the parents of children who attack others to pay compensation.  This is a curious imbalance in our legislation, if one is committed to this concept of compensation as a universal principle.  The position is even worse because for many years the State provided a tribunal to compensate the victims of personal injury and loss.  That Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal was abolished by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, to their disgrace.  Fianna Fáil, then in Opposition, created a hue and cry about it but since they have come back into Government they have not re-established the tribunal.  Consequently when we talk in this House about concern for the victims of crime, we are talking about the victims of the very specific crime of damage to property.</P>
    <P>The motivation in all this comes from the insurance companies who cream the market of insurance cover on property but are happy when courts can extract from defendants, often hapless, the means of repaying the loss to the injured <Col N="602" /> person.  Where a person recovers in the courts, the insurance company is exonerated and relieved of meeting any obligations under the certificate of insurance.  This is where the pressure is coming from for the idea of tying in parents.  That is why it is being repeated in this legislation.  It is not a good principle to penalise parents for the acts of children over whom they often do not have control.  Consequently it is a provision I will certainly oppose.</P>
    <P>I welcome in principle the provisions with regard to compensation but I should like to see them extended to cover all crimes or perhaps see the reintroduction of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  It is all the more welcome if it results in fewer people being sent to prison.  The Minister, in explaining this legislation to judges in any memorandum, should advise them of the importance of the compensation provisions and ask them to work the legislation on the basis that it should lead to fewer people being locked up in prison and being doubly penalised.  It would be a far better system if defendants who could afford it were forced to pay in compensation for their crime.  This should be done together with work in the community, probation or a suspended sentence rather than imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  There will be points to be thrashed out with the Minister on Committee Stage, but it is legislation which, in principle, deserves support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome the introduction of this Bill which has been awaited for many years, particularly since the elimination of compensation for malicious injuries.  There are many points in the Bill that would be better dealt with on Committee Stage and it will be interesting to hear the Minister's explanations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is designed to protect the interests of the general public and is a welcome addition to legislation under that heading.  One must ask how this is to be done.  Many Bills are introduced but unless we give the necessary resources, in this case to the Garda, the legislation will <Col N="603" /> be useless.  I am particularly interested in the new dimension of hacking.  This word has a new meaning and most of us would have understood it in an entirely different way.  It will be interesting to get more detailed information under this heading.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not indicate who is to supervise this complex operation.  Will it mean that new technology will be introduced at Garda headquarters or at divisional headquarters?  What will happen in regard to the training and education which will be required in respect of updated technology within the Garda? Will there be a special section dealing with this matter?  What equipment or finance will be given to update technology and the means of supervising it?  If it is at divisional headquarters level, will there be special units there to cope with this very complex matter?  One would not expect the Bill to spell out that type of detail but it would be important to indicate how the complex operation of supervising and tracking down defaulters will be done.  I can find no reference to it in the explanatory memorandum and I assume it will be done by regulations issued under the legislation.</P>
    <P>Those of us who were and still are involved in local authorities remember the very serious position that developed with the previous method of compensating people for criminal damage. This was eventually eliminated and rightly so.  At that stage the local authorities paid the bill and were given a rebate by the Department of 90 per cent of the total cost.  It took at least two years before people were compensated for the alleged offences.  It reached the stage where the operation of the system got out of control and it was well known that in many cases people were committing offences themselves with a view to being compensated.  The logical question is, who compensates the person whose property is damaged and in what way?  Unfortunately, many people who might commit this type of crime are not in a position to pay anything.  Even if one places the onus and responsibility on parents of young offenders &mdash; the Minister will know this <Col N="604" /> better than anybody &mdash; very often one discovers that they, in turn, may be in receipt of unemployment assistance, or some social welfare benefit and are not in a position to make any contribution by way of compensation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the question must be posed: who pays the bill; who compensates the person whose property has been damaged and in what manner will that be done? It is all very fine to commit somebody to prison for having committed an offence under the provisions of this Bill.  Even if a person serves an amount of time in prison, at the end of the day, if they or their family do not have the resources to pay the cost of that damage, that is not much good to the person whose property has been damaged.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy McCartan, I contend that the whole aspect of insurance companies' involvement in this operation must be teased out.  We are aware that, under the Malicious Damage Act and the regulations pertaining thereto, very often insurance companies were let off the hook.  If such an offender was caught and convicted, then the question of compensation did not apply at all; the victims were not entitled to any.  The Minister should spell out this aspect more clearly for the information of the general public. Let us say I have my home covered comprehensively for insurance purposes and that a person of no means, for whatever reason, burns down my home, is caught, convicted and sent to prison, does that mean that the insurance company get off the hook and pay nothing?  That is what used happen under the previous system of compensation under the Malicious Damage Act.  Indeed, people found it very difficult to understand the real operations of that system.  Usually, at the end of the day, it transpired that it was simpler for people to cause the damage themselves, ensuring that the offender would not be caught, thereby passing the bill to the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>From my perusal of the Bill, and the explanatory memorandum, I am not clear whether an attempt is being made <Col N="605" /> to come to grips with the circumstances I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>I might refer briefly to the question of barring orders.  I am sure all Members could cite examples of such incidents in their constituencies.  For example, I learned recently of an individual in my constituency who, because his wife had been granted a barring order against him, burned the house down.  The net result of that event was that the woman and her family were left without a home.  Of course, the man was convicted and duly dealt with by the courts in accordance with the legislation obtaining.  That case involved complex legal questions as to who owned the house, who was entitled to be compensated and so on.  Of course the offender concerned did not have any means of rebuilding the house, nor did he have any cover for insurance purposes and so was not entitled to claim any money from an insurance company. Nonetheless, at the end of the day, it was the wife and children who suffered most. In those circumstances the question which must be posed is: in what way will the provisions of the Bill apply to cases or circumstances where barring orders have been granted, against either husband or wife?  Who will be deemed to be responsible for the payment of damage caused and in what way will that provision operate?  I shall be interested to know whether the Minister can offer the House any further enlightenment or explanation in that regard.</P>
    <P>All Members are very conscious of the severe pressures on the Garda Síochána at present.  The provisions of this Bill will place additional pressures on them in the matter of detection and prosecution under the terms of what is a very technical Bill, particularly with regard to the new offence of computer hacking.  For example, will the Garda be given the necessary resources to undertake the requisite supervision under its provisions. I should like to know what plans the Minister has in this regard.  The Labour Party welcome the Bill and look forward to teasing out its details on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to comment on legislation which has long been necessary in our increasingly technological society.  Computer crime has grown alarmingly in recent years because of the increase in potential targets, that is strategic information stored in the form of computer data.  Computer hacking incidents in international computer networks &mdash; so-called computer viruses &mdash; and the passing of the Data Protection Act all have served to focus the attention of Irish computer users on data security since the mid eighties.  In fact the proliferation of computer security companies, and computer security divisions within major financial firms are further proof of an ongoing serious problem in the area of automated data.</P>
      <P>A recent report of Coopers &amp; Lybrand states that losses arising from computer security breaches suggest that this type of crime has risen by approximately 18 per cent per annum.  It was reported to me recently by an employee of a large Dublin computer firm &mdash; connected to a worldwide network &mdash; that that firm's computer has an average of four attempted unauthorised entries each day, some of which have been traced to as far away as Connecticut in the United States. In addition, the increased usage of communications networks to transmit data legally greatly expands the computer criminals' illegal theatre of operations. Constant innovation and improvement in computer technology brings with it a bewildering array of devices and processes which can be very profitable to a criminal but, worse, lethal in the hands of a potential sabateur or terrorist &mdash; witness the increasing dependence on computers in such strategic areas as air traffic control and within military systems.  Such trends last year prompted 28 major firms, including Allied Irish Banks, Telecom Éireann and DIGITAL to establish the European Security Forum in a move to block the growth of computer crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although welcoming the sentiments of the Bill I must voice certain reservations about its potential effectiveness in <Col N="607" /> dealing with the very real problems facing computer technology here.  Because of the intangible nature of automated data I can forsee several instances in which difficulties will arise, both in the detection of offences and in the enforcement of the law in relation thereto.</P>
    <P>From my scrutiny of section 5 (1) (a) it would appear to me that attempted unauthorised accessing of automated data, not involving their modification, shall be deemed to be an offence.  How does the Minister propose that this provision be implemented?  I am given to understand that automated data may be accessed on a grand scale with no fear of detection, due to the existence of computer networks which allow remote connection to a computer.  How will the Minister address that?  Given the logistics involved in attempting to monitor computer users, has the Minister any concrete notion how the Garda or others will go about apprehending the many thousands of computer users who, viciously or otherwise, access privileged data?  I believe they do this on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>Regarding the provision which covers unauthorised accessing of data from outside the State, how does the Minister propose to levy the quite insignificant £500 fine on a perpetrator of such crime who may be resident in any other country?  There are many Irish companies in the forefront of technology whose computers store information worth more than £500.  A person convicted of such an offence would have data worth more than £500.</P>
    <P>Section I now includes data as property and defines how damage may occur in relation to data.  Although all forms of damage which occur in relation to data are comprehensively covered, we must look at the mechanisms by which damage may occur before the shortcomings of the Bill can be seen.  I am informed by persons knowledgeable in the field that damage to data may occur from the following areas.  A computer virus is a programme introduced into a computer system, usually surreptitiously <Col N="608" /> and usually maliciously, and masquerades as a normal computer programme, it then sets about destroying or corrupting the data leaving the computer useless and in need of extensive overhaul. Computer hacking is the popular term for gaining unauthorised entry to a computer's data files and is usually practiced at a remote location.  Why risk detection at source when it is usually a simple matter to contact the computer over a leased communications line or on the public telephone network?  These are the main methods by which automated data may be damaged.  In the case of a computer virus, a seemingly innocuous disc about three and a half inches in diameter can be passed from person to person and loaded on to many computers in the guise of a video game, for example.  This is how the computer virus gets its name; it spreads from computer to computer until detected, usually too late.</P>
    <P>The increased use of local area networks which can connect all a company's personal computers together serves to make the job of the computer virus even simpler and the detection of the perpetrator more difficult.  Severe damage may be caused to many computers' data banks by innocent parties acting in good faith.  It would seem impossible to trace the virus to its original source, yet a saboteur could quite easily introduce it to a computer network simply by leaving the disc, entitled, say, &ldquo;Space Invaders&rdquo; on someone's desk.</P>
    <P>The subject of computer hacking in recent years has had extensive media coverage, especially in the US where embarrassing lessons have been learned about the ease with which confidential or strategic data have been accessed.  A lesson learned in other countries is that computer hackers operating from remote locations are very difficult to trace and thus to apprehend.  Only those hackers who make no attempt to conceal the origin of their operations can be caught, yet in the hands of a knowledgeable computer enthusiast such a device as a personal computer or a telephone modum &mdash; which I believe is the term &mdash; which allows computers to communicate with <Col N="609" /> each other over the public telephone network can be the tools of sabotage and extortion.  I ask the Minister to expand on how the law relating to these offences can be enforced.</P>
    <P>Given the sophisticated concepts involved and the degree of new, changing technology in the area of computers, I suggest that, although the Garda Síochána perform the essential role in the prevention of crime and the apprehension of criminals, surely there is a need for a specially trained unit within the Garda to be able to deal with this area of crime effectively.  Surely there is also a need for an authority to monitor the trends in computer crime and new developments. With every new breakthrough in the area of computer technology a criminal mind will find a way to put it to illegal use. Assuming a special unit were set up to deal with this problem, how does the Minister propose to apprehend computer hackers resident outside the State?</P>
    <P>With regard to establishing a special unit to deal with the problem, in Singapore a task force has been set up with the right to search premises and they can deal with the problem of softwear piracy and copyright breach.  However, if we can overcome the obstacles to apprehending criminals, the next step will be to bring the case to the court where I fear similar problems will exist.  Taking into account the bewildering technologies covered by the Bill, is it safe to assume our Judiciary have the wherewithal to deal with cases of computer crime?  Can we prosecute the perpetrator of such a crime without first becoming <i>au fait</i> with the concepts involved?  This area is fraught with ambiguity and grey areas concerning privilege to data, and the Bill does not appear to be tailored to these eventualities.</P>
    <P>The Minister should examine the present climate for computer crime. Since the introduction of the Data Protection Act and the post of data protection commissioner little has changed to alter the climate for computer criminals. The office of the data protection commissioner, I believe, is severely understaffed.  So far no codes of practice <Col N="610" /> enforceable by law have been established, and that can only serve to promote apathy regarding security.  In France the insurance industry provides strong incentives to companies which prove they have sufficient data protection mechanisms in place.  Have we to wait for a widely publicised breach of security, say in our strategic services, before we get more effective legislation?  The hackneyed expression &ldquo;prevention is better than cure&rdquo; is true, nonetheless and we should bear it in mind when deciding our strategy for dealing with computer crime.  One area of business which realised the wisdom of this saying is the banking sector and for the past decade, they spent the bulk of their expenditure on data protection.</P>
    <P>In summary it can be said the Bill will adequately protect my computer from the attentions of a hammer wielding villain. However, the protection ends there. Most criminals in pursuit of my data will doubtless use a more subtle approach.  As I have stated, the gathering of evidence related to something as intangible as automated data will require extensive training.  Although the problem must be addressed, I propose we examine more closely means by which we can stem the growth of computer related crime.  Let me quote at this stage the head of an Irish computer security firm.  He said: &ldquo;If there are fewer opportunities for computer crime in other countries, this country might be seen as a place with easy pickings&rdquo;. Is Ireland getting a reputation as a soft target?  I can only conclude that this Bill does not go far enough, as enforcement of its provisions seems to be very difficult.  On Committee Stage I hope this can be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like most other speakers I welcome the Bill with a few reservations. It is a very technical Bill and as a non-lawyer it took me a long time to &ldquo;hack&rdquo; through it &mdash; hacking is in the air today I was known as a pitch and putt hacker in Cork, and that is the new term today in computer technology.  As a layman, having gone through the Bill as best I could, I have some comments to make <Col N="611" /> because I believe the whole area of legal reform must not be left in the domain of the legal profession alone.  As Members of this House we have the responsibility to push ahead with law reform.  We should take the initiative because there is a certain opposition from the legal profession to changes.  There are lawyers in every party in this House and I know there is inbuilt opposition to change although it may not always be obvious.  I admire the Minister for the way he has taken on certain issues since becoming Minister.  Any criticisms I have today are not personal; the Minister is a victim of circumstances.</P>
      <P>I believe there should be a Minister for legal reform, that the Ministry of Justice should be split into areas of responsibility. For example, there is the area of security, the Garda and prisons, and there are all these fire brigade actions that have to be taken from time to time. The result has been that no Minister has had the time to take on the complicated issue of law reform.  Because of that we have one of the most complicated legal systems in the world that can be manipulated by experts, and the public are the ultimate victims.  I had hoped that we would have a splitting up of the Ministry of Justice.  Instead the Minister for Justice got the extra job of Minister for Communications leaving matters in a far worse situation.  We have a legal jungle full of inefficiencies and abuses with the public open to exploitation by the systems, and being exploited almost on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a law society which is becoming more conscious of its public image. Up to recent times they did not give a damn; their arrogance was unbelievable when questioned about the possibilities of law reform.  Their attitude was that it should be left to them, that we knew nothing about it.  It is only in recent times that they have become more conscious of public relations.  Recently in Cork a man was jailed for one month for owing Bank of Ireland Finance £1,000.  When questioned those representing the legal profession in Cork said that they checked <Col N="612" /> with the bank and with their solicitors to find out the facts.  They never bothered to check with the man himself who would have given them a different story.  That is just an example of the arrogance of the profession when questioned showing very little respect for the rights of the individual or the rights of a public representative to represent an individual.</P>
    <P>The dispensing of justice should be done for the good of the public and not for the profit of the dispensers, and profit seems to be a priority with many practitioners in the legal area at present. Access to the law should be available to all, irrespective of class or ability to pay, and that is not the case.  On the Order of Business this morning there was a question as to when the most recent report of the Law Reform Commission will be acted upon by the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Energy, and I am sure the Minister for Justice would have an input into this.  There is no sign of any legislation coming forward.</P>
    <P>There have been many statements about commitment to reform but very little real reform.  What we had is movement towards reform in family law and marriage laws but, let us not be fooled, these areas are a gold mine for the profession. There is no mention of reform of the relationship between the legal profession and the public and reform of the courts.  It is about time we took the initiative in this House, took it out of the hands of the people who stall things, let things drift on in the hope that people will get tired of talking.</P>
    <P>It is important to have real legal reform because our programme of employment creation and economic development depends on it.  The present legal jungle results in high litigation costs which leads to higher insurance costs.  Insurance costs are so high today that there is almost no point in going into business.  In regard to motor insurance, we have high costs because of the inefficiencies in our court system and in the whole legal profession. Economic development and legal reform go hand in hand.  One is dependent on the other.  Until such time as we have an efficient legal system here, our job <Col N="613" /> creation programme will never reach its full potential.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is very complicated which I welcome, with some reservations. As stated in the Explanatory Memorandum it seeks to simplify and modernise the law in respect of criminal damage to property by replacing the large number of offences contained in the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, with three offences: damage to another property; the aggravated offence of damage to any property where the damage is done with intent to endanger the life of another or was reckless in that regard; and the aggravated offence of damage to any property where there is an intention to defraud.  There are also the new offences of threatening to damage property, and property has been extended to include data, and unauthorised accessing or attempted accessing of data.  There is, further, a scheme empowering the courts to pay compensation to owners of damaged property.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the Explanatory Memorandum the draft Bill follows the recommendations set out in the Law Reform Commission's report of 1988 on malicious damage.  The law in relation to malicious damage heretofore is contained in the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, which lists in a number of different sections specific offences of damage to specific property, including a catch-all section of damage to property not specifically covered in another section. The difficulty from the prosecution's point of view under this Act was that the correct section had to be specified in the indictment or charge.  Deputy McCartan referred earlier to the famous Ballinspittle case where persons were charged with damaging the moving statue and were charged, contrary to section 37 of the Malicious Damage Act, under an indictment which described Ballinspittle as a place of divine worship.  Notwithstanding the fact that the section specifically refers to damage to &ldquo;any statue or monument exposed to public view&rdquo;, the Circuit Court judge decided that as there had been a misdescription <Col N="614" /> on the charge sheet of the article damaged, the charge would have to fail, and the accused walked free.</P>
    <P>I recall cases where persons charged with malicious damage to sheep were indicted under section 40, which refers to damage to cattle.  Although the term cattle has been defined in law to include horses and pigs the judge held that the defendant ought to have been charged under section 44 with damage to animals other than cattle, and directed an acquittal. Clearly such results are gratifying to the lawyers representing the defendant but those decisions do not necessarily add to the common good.  Hence the need for a simplification and codification of the law.</P>
    <P>The Irish Bill and the report of the Law Reform Commission follows in the main on the principles established by the English Law Commission in their report in 1970, which led to the English Criminal Damage Act, 1971.  The principle therein established, which is adopted here, is that &ldquo;distinctions based upon the nature of the property or its situation or upon the means used to destroy or damage it or upon the circumstances in which it is destroyed or damaged should not affect the basic nature of the offence&rdquo;.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;such features as the means used or their consequences or subsidiary matters relevant if at all, in regard to sentence&rdquo;.  The general approach of the Law Reform commission was that the provision for a long list of specific offences should be replaced by one based on a general offence in respect of criminal damage to another person's property and that that general offence should be supplemented by a small number of other offences dealing with liability in specific instances.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be welcomed in general. The area in which it departs from the Law Reform Commission report is in relation to the inclusion of data under the heading of property.  That has been referred to by a number of speakers.  This is not mentioned in the Law Reform Commission report but, as I have said, it is desirable.  My criticism of the Bill <Col N="615" /> relates to the scheme providing for compensation to victims of maliciously damaged property.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with some of the sections at this stage.  Section 1 is a definition section which defines damage as including the destruction of the object. This is important as the Irish Bill states the offence as being to &ldquo;damaged property&rdquo; whereas the English Act which does not define &ldquo;damage&rdquo; as including the destruction of property states the offence as being &ldquo;destroy or damage&rdquo;.  It is necessary to include destruction as an offence in order to obviate the possibility that somebody who, for example, burned down a hayshed could be said to have destroyed but not damaged the object. In England the objective is achieved by the creation of an offence of destroying or damaging.  In Ireland the offence created is only &ldquo;damaging&rdquo; but &ldquo;damaging&rdquo; is defined in section 1 as including destroying.  That, I admit, is probably a neater way of achieving the same results as the English law.</P>
    <P>Data is defined in section 1 (1) (b) as meaning information in a form that can be accessed by a computer including a programme.  Section 1 (1) (c) provides that &ldquo;to do any act within the State that damages property outside the State&rdquo; is also to damage within the meaning of the Bill.  Under section 1 (1) (d) today any act outside the State that damages property within the State is also to damage within the meaning of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 1 (3) where a spouse is subject to a barring order under the Family Law Act, 1981, or is otherwise excluded from the family home by an order, the property is treated as the property of another person rather than that of the spouse.  Accordingly, somebody barred from home who damages that home may be treated as damaging the property of another and liable to prosecution. Were the provisio not to be inserted in the Bill, somebody damaging his home, unless it could be established that he was doing so either to endanger the life of another or with intent to <Col N="616" /> defraud somebody, would not be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 2 creates the various offences which are proposed to replace the large number of offences under the Malicious Damage Act, 1861.  Under section 2 (1) there is the offence of damaging another person's property.  Under section 2 (2) there is the aggravated offence of damaging any property, whether belonging to that person or another, with intent to do so and to endanger the life of another or being reckless in that regard.  A person who damages any property with intent to defraud is guilty of an offence.  The need for this offence arises from the loopholes open to a party charged with, for example, setting fire to his own property, who has not made any claim under his insurance because he is apprehended before such a claim could be made.  Were he to process a claim against his insurance company he could be charged with fraud. Any man is entitled to burn down his property under the present law but under the proposed Bill, it is an offence to do so, or to otherwise damage the property if it can be established that there was an intent to defraud.</P>
    <P>It can be pointed out, however, that to prove an intent to defraud in the absence of any claim made to an insurance company may well be difficult, and the powers of this section may in practice be very limited.  If somebody burns down a property it will still be necessary to prove the intent to defraud and the obvious way to do this is to establish that he claimed against the insurance company.  In the absence of such a claim it is doubtful whether a court would draw an inference in a criminal trial that an accused person intended to defraud.  It must be said also, however, that it is doubtful whether any formulation of words would achieve the desired effect in this regard, and there would always be room for argument in any case.  The rest of section 2 is straightforward enough.</P>
    <P>Section 3 creates the new offence of threathening to damage property.  Section 4 creates the offence of possessing objects with intent to damage property. Section 5 creates the offence of unlawful <Col N="617" /> accessing of data, or hacking.  It should be pointed out that this section in relation to data in the criminal code is new and it remains to be seen what way the courts will treat prosecutions brought under it. It should be pointed out that the Department of Justice may not be equipped with sufficient personnel trained in computers to deal with computer fraud and in particular, under section 5, to prove somebody operated a computer outside the State with intent to access data kept within the State.  As as I have said, &ldquo;data&rdquo; is defined in section 1 as being information in a form in which it can be accessed by means of computer and includes a programme, but &ldquo;access&rdquo; in relation to data is not defined.  How the State could prove that any person operated either within the State or outside the State a computer with intent to access data is unclear.  Deputy Cosgrave dealt with this matter in detail and I will not duplicate it, but I would like the Minister to clarify it in his closing statement.</P>
    <P>A case can be made that section 5, in particular, is badly drafted, that the authorities are not equipped to deal with it and that convictions will be difficult &mdash; if not impossible &mdash; to obtain under it even if &ldquo;accessing&rdquo; could be detected. In this regard a case can be made for improving facilities in the Department of Justice, and the Garda, dealing with computer fraud generally.  I have very strong reservations about the ability of the Garda, the Fraud Squad and the specialised sections to deal with modern day &mdash; white collar &mdash; crime.</P>
    <P>The inconclusive investigations so far by the Garda Fraud Squad in relation to Aer Lingus Holidays is lamentable and I do not expect very conclusive findings from their investigations.  The best way to investigate the crime against the taxpayers in relation to Aer Lingus Holidays is to have inspectors from the Department of Tourism and Transport examine the matter.  It should not be left to Aer Lingus Holidays, the executives or management of Aer Lingus and the Fraud Squad to investigate a crime in Aer Lingus.  The Garda, through no <Col N="618" /> fault of their own, because of lack of resources and expertise, cannot deal with highly sophisticated white collar crime at present.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the lawful excuse in relation to damage to property.  As stated in paragraph 7 of the Law Reform Commission Report, the general principle is that no one may be convicted of a crime unless, in addition to having brought about the harm which the law forbids, he also had, at the time a &ldquo;guilty mind&rdquo;.  In relation to malicious damage, this means that the accused must either have intended to cause the damage or been reckless as to whether he caused it. I cite a case of the People <i>v.</i> Hayes who successfully appealed a conviction for setting fire to a church in Tullamore.  The evidence was that he broke into the church searching for money and, as there was no light, he used candles.  While searching the confession box for cash the curtain caught fire which spread throughout the church.  The appeal was allowed and that says enough.</P>
    <P>The present law, as stated in paragraph 27 of the Commission's report, leaves conscientious jurors in a position that, while they suspect an accused is not telling the truth, they are left with only his account of events, proclaiming his inadvertence to the actual risk without any independent evidence suggesting advertence. Successful prosecutions for arson, in the absence of clear evidence regarding petrol or some other commodity being used, will depend on statements of admission by the accused persons that they were reckless in relation to the place catching fire.  A case could be made for strengthening section 6 by making the test not just the honesty of the person but also that it was reasonable. In this regard, section 6 (3) is the key.  The Law Reform Commission came down in favour of a test of the honest belief but if the subsection was altered to read &ldquo;for the purpose of this section a belief must be honestly and reasonably held&rdquo; or, alternatively, that section 6 (2) can be altered by substituting &ldquo;he believed&rdquo; to <Col N="619" />&ldquo;he reasonably believed&rdquo; then convictions would be easier.  That is the opinion I got in regard to that section.</P>
    <P>To adopt such an approach would make convictions considerably easier to obtain but would radically alter the purpose of the Act.  It remains to be said, however, that with the defence of &ldquo;honest belief&rdquo; giving rise to &ldquo;lawful excuse&rdquo; under section 6, juries faced with an accused swearing to the effect that he honestly believed he had one of the excuses mentioned in section 6 might well have little choice but to acquit, notwithstanding their view that this supposed honest belief was entirely unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is desirable in that the District Court have no general jurisdiction to decide issues of title as to property and if a person charged with maliciously damaging property could say that there was a dispute as to the ownership of it, it could be argued that the District Court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter. Accordingly, this section removes any doubt about the matter and proceedings can be taken in the District Court, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in chapter 11 stipulate that a compensation provision for persons who have suffered injury by others in criminal damage should be included in the Act.  It is important to note that this scheme for compensation, while similar to it, is distinct from the method whereby some person who is injured &mdash; or whose property is damaged &mdash; can claim damages in the civil courts for that injury.  The scheme proposed under the Bill provides a method where someone who is convicted of an offence can also be ordered to pay compensation to the victim up to the value which the court considers appropriate as a measure of loss the party would have suffered if the court had been a civil court or if the court had been trying a civil claim by the injured party for compensation against the wrongdoer.</P>
    <P>This brings in the whole question of vandalism and who pays the injured party.  The Minister should state his views <Col N="620" /> in regard to victims of vandalism in urban areas.  Too often in urban areas, through lack of Garda manpower, damage is done to property whose owners cannot bear the cost of repairing it.  Wrongdoers are getting away with a suspended sentence in most cases although sometimes they get a period of detention.  Parents should be responsible for the activities of their children but, in these cases, they do not accept responsibility.  In the area of compensation the parents of young offenders should be held responsible for the acts of their children if it can be proved that the parents had been negligent.  Any responsible parent should know where his or her child is at midnight or 1 a.m.  If parents were held responsible for the activities of their children and had to compensate their victims there would be a dramatic drop in the levels of vandalism and joyriding.  The Ministers should take all this into consideration.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the question of damage to property by wandering horses which is a problem in Cork city.  Small fines are imposed for the damage done but there is no provision for compensation. There should be a strengthening of the Act in relation to wandering animals as irresponsible people bring their horses into urban areas and the animals damage houses and property. This means that we prevent industrialists from setting up in those areas and I strongly call on the Minister to introduce legislation to strengthen the laws dealing with wandering horses in urban areas. This is the only opportunity I have to ask the Minister to look at the issues of parental responsibility and the whole question of owners' responsibility in the case of wandering animals.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the proposal in the Bill, the Road Traffic Act, 1961, had a similar scheme where the victims of road traffic accidents could be reimbursed in respect of damages incurred.  This scheme did not affect the rights of the injured parties to sue in the civil courts, although any sums that had been paid under the Road Traffic Act would have to be taken into account when assessing damages.  Over time little damage <Col N="621" /> resulted to property in road traffic cases. The section was declared to be unconstitutional in Colin v. the Attorney General in 1979 because it gave to the District Court, which has only jurisdiction in summary matters, the power to impose what was in effect punishment which brought the crime out of what was reasonably to be construed as a minor affair.  It is with this in mind that section 9 (2) of the Bill provides for a limit of £2,500&mdash;the same limit that applies to the District Court in respect of civil claims &mdash; to be imposed on compensation orders payable under the Act.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that chapter 11 of the Law Reform Commission report does not provide for any specific scheme whereby the compensation is to be assessed.  The scheme provided in the Bill is objectionable on a number of counts. At section 9 (1) there is power for the court, instead of or in addition to any other penalty, to make a compensation order requiring the accused to pay compensation in respect of the damage to the owner of the property.  This figure is limited to £2,500 in the District Court and must not exceed the amount of damages that, in the opinion of the court, the owner of the property concerned would be entitled to recover in a civil action against the convicted person in respect of the damage concerned.  The compensation order may provide for payment of the compensation by instalment during a period not exceeding 12 months.</P>
    <P>At subsection (6) where the Court considers it appropriate, the court may, if it is satisfied that the means are sufficient to justify doing so, make a compensation order and impose the fine as well.  There is also provision under subsection (7) that after a compensation order has been made but not fully complied with, the District Court may reduce the amounts paid or direct that no further payments may be made if it appears to the court that the means of the convicted person are insufficient to satisfy the order in full or that damages in respect of which the order was made are less than they were taken to be for the purpose of the Order. If the amount paid under the order <Col N="622" /> exceeds the amount appearing to the court to be reasonable, then the court may order the excess to be repaid by the owner to the convicted person.</P>
    <P>This procedure under section 9 (7) is cumbersome and will involve a multiplicity of legal proceedings in which orders may be made to the detriment of the injured party under, for example, section 9 (7) (a) (i) without him being represented if he cannot pay for this representation. Generally, a good scheme of compensation allowing for periodic payments over 12 months could well form the basis for constant review by the courts over that period and would probably have the effect of negating the good of section 9 in general.  The provisions in allowing for an appeal of a compensation order would be sufficient to allow a higher court to review the making of an order if it is unfair rather than having regular applications to the District Court to do so.  The whole process of the law is cumbersome, and here we have a section which will have people running in and out of court with all the attendant expenses.  That is good for some people, but not for the general public.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the suspension of compensation orders pending appeal and provides for the right of an appellant in court to null or vary any compensation order made.  The section by itself would be sufficient to set right any injustices that arise.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that any damages awarded in civil proceedings must not be more than the amount, if any, by which the damages exceed the amount paid under the compensation order.  If the damages assessed are less than any amount paid under the compensation order, the owner of the damaged property may be ordered to repay the difference. It should be pointed out that the court which has power to order the injured party to repay the difference is not specified.  The Minister should clarify which court should make the order in this case.</P>
    <P>It can clearly be seen that if the District Court order makes a compensation order to somebody whose property has been <Col N="623" /> damaged up to, say, £2,500 and that injured party issues proceedings in the Circuit Court claiming say £5,000 but actually recovers £2,000, then it is not clear which court should order, if any, the compensation to be repaid.</P>
    <P>Furthermore it may well seem that if a party has been injured and has been ordered to receive £2,500 in a court and subsequently another court holds that the true measure is £2,000, the injured party actually loses money by taking the case.</P>
    <P>I suggest that section 11 (b) (ii) should be excluded from the Bill.  The effect of this would be that if someone issued civil proceedings as a result of damage and had been the beneficiary of a compensation order, his net award would take into account any compensation actually paid under a compensation order.  There is a serious flaw in the last clause of section 11 which says:</P>
    <P>and, upon the award of damages or, as the case may be, the making of the order by the court, the compensation order shall cease to have effect.</P>
    <P>The effect of this clause is that once an award for damages is made the compensation order ceases to have any effect.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 (b) (i) the award of damages in the civil courts must amount to only the difference between the gross amount considered appropriate in the civil court and what was actually paid under the compensation order but after the award of damages.  Then, by virtue of the last clause, the compensation order ceases to have effect and even if some money remains outstanding under the compensation order it cannot be paid. The argument in favour of the clause as drafted is that once the civil award for damages is made, the injured party can proceed to enforce that award in the normal way as a judgment debt.</P>
    <P>The potential injustice of the Bill as drafted is illustrated by the following example.  If the District Court made a compensation order for £2,500, £2,000 of which had been paid by the time the civil claim for damages came before the Circuit Court which, in turn, awarded <Col N="624" /> £3,000 as being the gross amount of compensation, under section 11 (b) (i) the net amount of the award would have to be reduced by the amount actually paid, that is, £2,000 leaving a net decrease of £1,000.</P>
    <P>If the District Court made a compensation order of £2,500, £2,000 of which had been paid by the time the civil claim for damages came before the Circuit Court which in turn awarded £3,000 as being the gross amount of compensation, under section 11 (b) (i) the net amount of the decree would have to be reduced by the amount actually paid, £2,000, leaving a net sum of £1,000.  The difficulty lies in that a method of enforcement by, for example, monthly instalments as ordered in the District Court under the compensation order for the balance of the £500 still unpaid would cease to have any effect and the injured party would be forced to rely on civil methods of enforcement in respect of the balance due.</P>
    <P>I suggest that objections could be made to section 11 as presently drafted.  Section 11 (b) (ii) should be excluded and the last clause should be redrafted to provide that upon the award of damages the compensation order shall continue to have effect but that the total paid to the person in respect of damage to any property under the compensation order and the award of damages should not exceed the greater of the two figures.  I put that to the Minister for consideration.</P>
    <P>Sections 12, 13 and 14 are straightforward. Despite the criticisms I have made, which I ask the Minister to consider, the Bill is welcome.  It is a step along the road of dealing with inefficiencies in the legal system.  I have serious reservations in relation to the scheme of compensation which was not specified under the Law Reform Commission's report.  Furthermore the portions of the act dealing with data were not specified under the Law Reform Commission report and it remains to be seen whether there are adequate resources available to the Garda to deal with hi-technology or white collar crime <Col N="625" /> or whether the offences created under this section are capable of successful prosecution.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to respond to the issues I have raised.  I hope he does not take the criticisms I made about duplication of his portfolio as personal. They were intended as a general criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which simplifies and modernises the law in relation to criminal damage to property. Contrary to the criticisms made by my constituency colleague, Deputy Allen, any fair minded Deputy who looks at the record of this Minister and the amount of time he spent in this House dealing with legislation knows of his commitment to legislative reform.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen referred to the problem of wandering horses, and I appeal to the Minister to consult with the Minister for the Environment in this regard.  It exists not only in Cork but in many parts of the country.  Parents are concerned about the dangers to young people.  At present the law does not give local authorities or the Garda power to deal adequately with wandering horses.  I ask the Minister to take note of this serious problem and see if it can be resolved satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>This Bill is another in a series of measures being taken by the Minister to update and simplify our criminal law.  The Criminal Damage Act, 1861, was very complex and detailed legislation.  It was out of date.  It was so detailed that it was extremely difficult for the Garda to prosecute for damage to property.  Unless they found the precise crime involved in a particular section of the Act the case would be thrown out of court.  This Bill replaces a large number of offences of damage to specific kinds of property with three offences of damage: a simple offence of damage to another's property; an offence of damaging any property with intent to defraud, and an aggravated offence of damage to property where danger to another's life is involved.  This simplifies the whole process and will make the task of the Garda in enforcing the law much easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> I am glad that the Minister has dealt with the area of compensation.  The Bill provides for an important development in the power of the court to pay compensation to the owners of damaged property.  This has long been a contentious area.  People suffered huge losses but they had no redress to the courts. Frequently the courts are concerned with interpreting Acts governing particular circumstances and the vast amount of legislation has greatly increased the workload of the courts, and they must keep up with legislative change.  It must be difficult for citizens to keep up with and know what laws govern them and society.  Despite this everyone is supposed to know the law, and ignorance of it is no excuse.  Many who practice law would be reluctant to say that they know the law as it pertains to many topics.  The list of complex law is extensive: road traffic, road transport, local government, the courts, criminal justice, criminal procedures and finance.  Consolidating legislation is beneficial to those who deal with the law.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the committee set up to report on crime, lawlessness and vandalism from 1982 to 1987.  I was advised that shortcomings in various legislative provisions hampered the Garda in the discharge of their duties. One of the basic anomalies lay in the area of power of arrest.  In common law a power of arrest without warrant exists only for felonies and a few other isolated offences.  The scheduling of offences into arrestable and non-arrestable is necessary. They should be categorised on the basis of gravity.  Irish criminal law incorporates the common law from England together with 700 years of statute law from the Dublin and Westminster Parliaments before Independence and also statutes enacted since 1922.  For the most part current Irish criminal law reflects English legal thinking from the mid 19th century, and this can be seen in the 1916 Larceny Act.  Generally, Irish law has followed closely, though slowly, rationalisation of English law.  For example, 1957 redefined the situation in which capital punishment was applicable and <Col N="627" /> this was a change closely paralleled by the Irish Criminal Justice Act, 1964.</P>
    <P>As regards substantive law there are defects in several areas.  In one of its reports the committee referred to the fact that it is virtually impossible to prove the offence of receiving stolen goods in the absence of a statement from the suspect. Statutes such as the malicious damage Act were drafted in a tortuous and disjointed fashion and could easily be replaced by the cover-all offence of malicious damage.  The Government have changed the law in relation to receiving stolen goods.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has introduced this Bill.  Much of our legislation on criminal matters dates back to the last century.  The committee recommended that the task of updating and consolidating criminal law should be undertaken in a structured manner.  This Bill will simplify the unnecessarily complicated network of criminal legislation by which the Garda are hampered.  I am glad the Minister has taken a keen interest in law reform.  He is delivering on an undertaking given to this House earlier this year to increase law reform output in his Department.  It is true to say that many areas affect the community. There is no doubt that the legal situation here has got to be looked at.  We have become very legal conscious whether in schools or in regard to local authorities. One would almost need a legal adviser for every move one makes.  That is the unsatisfactory situation we are heading into in this day and age.  Nevertheless, we must face up to the reality that we live in different times and in a different society and we must take on board the need for radical change in our laws as they affect the general public.</P>
    <P>I should like again to pay tribute to the Minister and thank him for the interest he has taken in a very complex area. People may be critical of him and it is easy to stand up and point the finger.  As I said to my colleague, whom I hope is not trying to take over from Deputy Jim O'Keeffe by his major contribution today, our record, on law reform and that <Col N="628" /> of the Minister, is there for everybody to see.  I compliment him on that.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a short contribution to the debate on this legislation and I compliment the Minister on introducing it. My only criticism is that the legislation is not nearly capable or competent to deal with the problems that are likely to arise. There is a reference in the Minister's speech to electronic eavesdropping, a subject I have had an interest in for some time and in relation to which I raised questions in the House.  The Minister, indeed, responded though not always to my satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of modern technology, and the greater use of computers, obviously lends itself to the risk of illegal or unauthorised accessing.  That is one of the major purposes of this legislation.  If one examines the possible consequences one will see it is tantamount to interfering with the postal system.  It is tantamount to interfering with a written message being transmitted from one area to another in a sealed container by whatever means and gaining access to it illegally.  I am aware that in the world of computers, one cannot ban the use or sale of computers <Col N="629" /> because everybody lives by them nowadays but the amount of confidential information which is stored and can be accessed illegally is growing by the day.</P>
    <P>We have all read or heard of instances of students operating from their own home, perhaps in a remote area, a miniature computer and being able to gain access to confidential information of a highly sophisticated nature with obvious disastrous consequences for the firms involved.  That has not happened on one but on several occasions.</P>
    <P>We also have greater use of mobile or car telephones.  We should examine for a moment the potential of those machines. It is possible to gain access to your debit or credit column in your bank account by keying in the appropriate digits on one's mobile telephone.  The amazing thing is that on the miniature screen one can see the exact position provided one knows how to operate that system.  If it is possible for an individual to obtain this information in relation to his own account I am sure some enterprising individual has worked out how to gain access to somebody else's account.  That has happened in relation to confidential information and it is one of the issues this Bill is supposed to tackle.</P>
    <P>People will say that the chances of getting worthwhile information by scanning a system might not be all that great but that, of course, is entirely dependent on the sophistication of the devices used and how modern they are.  With every passing day a new and more sophisticated device is being developed which will access information more quickly.</P>
    <P>One area the Bill does not cover, although reference has been made to electronic eavesdropping, is the use of eavesdropping equipment which is readily available and for sale here.  This equipment, which is produced outside the country, has the ability to eavesdrop telephone messages transmitted through radio telephones.  It is now generally accepted that useful and confidential information can be gleaned from the use of these scanning devices.  They are very small devices, about the size of the palm of a hand, and they are for sale in the <Col N="630" /> city.  They are being used by criminal elements to gain useful information and to listen to confidential and classified conversations by the law enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right in saying they are illegal but so long as they are available it is immaterial whether they are illegal or not.  The only way they can be eliminated is by banning out of hand their importation and sale.  The fines for such importation and sale should be extensive because &mdash; and I mentioned this previously in the House &mdash; information gleaned in that fashion has been used, in the past, by the criminal fraternity to good advantage particularly if they learn that they are under observation for a particular purpose.  The Minister should consider banning those machines and not rely on the legislation which declares illegal the interception of information of a confidential nature to which one has no right.</P>
    <P>One must recognise also accidental access to information.  If, for instance, one can accidentally gain access to confidential information by the use of a computer the chances of gaining access when one deliberately sets about doing this using cross references and various numbers increase enormously.  If one relates that to the unauthorised listening to radio telephone conversations, obviously the information gleaned by the person who sets out deliberately to listen to conversations between Government Departments, business people &mdash; either nationally or internationally &mdash; and so on will, first, be selective and, second, will be very useful whether that individual intends to use it for extortion purposes, blackmail, business advantage, industrial espionage or whatever the case may be. The Bill does not cover those matters.  I fear that with the development of modern technology some of the less law abiding elements in our community will become very nonchalant about the use of such devices.  As a result, this practice may become as prevalent as car theft was a few years ago.  I do not think this would be either beneficial or useful.</P>
    <P>Information is very important &mdash; it can <Col N="631" /> even mean power &mdash; and once unauthorised persons have access to information they can use it in a way that will not be beneficial either to the agency from which it has been extracted or the country as a whole.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to seriously consider banning the importation and sale of scanning devices now used, without authority to intercept radio telephone conservations.</P>
    <P>I know that as time goes on devices will be installed in telephone systems which will scramble conversations and thus eliminate that security threat, but nonetheless I believe the simple and short answer to this problem at present is to ban the importation, sale and distribution of these scanning devices.  As I mentioned previously in the House, last year weapons and one of these devices was found in a motor vehicle which had been used in a robbery in my constituency.  I am sure that that scanning device was not used by the person who owned the car to listen into the telephone conversations of his next door neighbour or somebody's girlfriend: it was bought and used for an illegal purpose.  This proves beyond any shadow of doubt the validity of my request for the total banning of such devices.</P>
    <P>Many other speakers have made valuable contributions and I do not wish to repeat anything which has already been said by them.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate for the warmth of the welcome they have extended to this reforming measure.  My response to many of the points made by them would be more appropriate on Committee Stage.  Therefore, I will restrict my remarks to a number of points only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the definition of &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; and complained that the Law Reform Commission's proposed definition had not been accepted. He said that the present definition had given rise to uncertainty.  That is not so. The definition I have included in the Bill <Col N="632" /> has been accepted in this country for at least 90 years and was included in the definition of &ldquo;malice&rdquo; in Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law of 1902.  It is true that uncertainty has been caused in England by not defining the word &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; as we have done, but we have avoided the situation which has arisen in England by the manner in which we defined &ldquo;reckless&rdquo; here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also referred to section 9 (5) which provides for the authorised payment of compensation by instalment under a compensation order but imposes a limit of 12 months on the period of payment.  The object of imposing a maximum limit on the repayment period is to ensure that payment cannot be so prolonged as to be oppressive or indeed unrealistic.  There is no particular sanctity about the period specified in section 9 (5) and Deputy McCartan and others argued that it could be a little longer.  However, if the convicted offender is a good mark for the damage, the owner of the property will get an order for the full amount in civil proceedings. Maybe we can tease out this point further on Committee Stage.  I am not tied to the 12 months period so I would be prepared to hear the comments of the Deputies opposite on this point.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the lack of action in updating criminal law.  As I have already said by way of interruption, I am in the Dáil and Seanad day in and day out.  In fact, another Bill is being handled in the Seanad today on my behalf and on behalf of the Department of Justice. There is a considerable amount of legislation from this Department &mdash; when the second stage debate on this Bill is completed we will move to the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, 1990, and I will be back here again next week to deal with the rape Bill and other legislation.  There is a considerable amount of work going on in this area. The Deputy was concerned that criminals could go free because of defects in the law.  I am not sure this is as big a problem as the Deputy thinks, and I will be making a statement on this within the next ten <Col N="633" /> days and I look forward to the Deputy's response to my suggestions.</P>
    <P>As I said in this House yesterday, I expect to get Government approval shortly for the drafting of a criminal evidence Bill which will include provisions to give effect to the proposals in the Law Reform Commission's report in respect of the giving of evidence by children and mentally handicapped persons. That report was only published last September.  There has been no delay and I will deal with it shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to arson. The position is that the common law offence of arson is being abolished but where property is damaged by fire the offence will be charged as arson.  This is provided for in section 2 (4).  The word &ldquo;arson&rdquo; will continue to be used to describe damage to property by fire even though it is now a statutory offence.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan also referred to the uncertainty arising from the definition of reckless.  I want to emphasise that rather than the position being as outlined by Deputies O'Keeffe and McCartan, the opposite is the case.  In fact, the use of any different formula would be liable to cause uncertainly.  The courts are familiar with the traditional definition which is again embodied in this Bill.  We want to avoid uncertainty as far as possible.  The Deputy asked about my position regarding my review of the scheduling of malicious damage offences under the Offences Against the State Act.  I will, of course, by guided by the advice of the Garda at all times in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the powers of arrest being given to civilians under section 12.  My advice is that the powers of arrest simply restate the common law rules on powers of arrest in relation to felonies.  The same powers are set out in section 19 of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  I will have a look at this provision in view of the Deputy's concern and I will come back to him on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also urged that a person should have the right of trial by jury in malicious damage cases if the damage is over £50 or is, in all events, non-minor. <Col N="634" /> The Law Reform Commission recommended that it be left to the discretion of the court to either prosecute summarily or, on indictment, leave it to the Director of Public Prosecutions as it is in many other cases.  The Director of Public Prosecutions would not be allowed to prosecute summarily a case that was not a minor offence because the District Court, if satisfied that it was such an offence, would not try the case.  This is the advice I got on this matter.  A number of other points were raised by Deputy McCartan which I will deal with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell made his first contribution as spokesman for Justice on behalf of the Labour Party.  I compliment him on his appointment and look forward to working with him.  He raised several questions about hacking and talked about interpretation.  Hacking relates to the unauthorised penetration of a computer system.  The Garda would normally commence to investigate hacking when a complaint was made by the computer owner concerned.  I believe they have a fair amount of expertise in this area already, but I have no doubt that they would have no difficulty in getting it from Telecom Éireann or people in the computer industry.  I can assure them that facilities will be made available wherever the Garda request them.</P>
    <P>It might be of interest to the House to give some examples of incidents of hacking which have occurred world wide. For example, access may be gained to a hospital computer, with a view to amending data on prescribed dosages.  Incidents have been reported in Britain of hackers amending computerised data on cancer patients and a computer virus corrupted medical records in Michigan hospitals. Earlier this year, in Britain, a youth calling himself &ldquo;the mad hacker&rdquo; caused £25,000 worth of damage to computers at a number of universities.  US police allege that a 14 year old boy in California used his home computer in August 1989 to hack into New York's Citibank computer and obtain more than $11,000 of mail order goods and a Visa gold credit card with a limit of $10,000.</P>
    <P>A large international system was <Col N="635" /> entered by a hacker who appeared to have acquired a sufficiently high level of privilege to be able to read and collect passwords.  The entire system was closed down and the software rebuilt to exclude any possibility of the hacker's having rendered it insecure.  The work had to be completed within 72 hours and occupied upwards of 10,000 man-hours of highly skilled staff.  The fact that &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; can be a transnational activity is illustrated, for example, by the activities of school children at the Dalton School in New York State who infiltrated about 20 Canadian data banks, including the files of public authorities.</P>
    <P>Another is the violation of the NATO system in Norway from the United States, the breaking into the NASA worldwide data network or into computers in Japan, all done through the use of the international telephone system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked about the enforcement of provisions against damaging automated data.  I accept that it will be difficult to trace hackers who use the public telephone network.  This poses a serious technical problem.  To a certain extent, the replacement of the existing analog network by a digital system will help.  Of course, enforcement will be easier when the hacker is an employee of the firm concerned.  Statistics indicate that most computer crime is done by employees.  These enforcement difficulties are not peculiar to our country, they apply everywhere and reflect the insidious nature of the activity.</P>
    <P>Section 13 gives power to search premises where hacking is supposed to be taking place and the gardaí can seize anything believed to be used for this purpose. Hackers themselves help because they usually have lists of codes and passwords. Even if the hacker is not found in the act of committing the offence, we can get him on that.  I am prepared to listen to any suggestions from Deputies opposite to tighten up this area even further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen made a long and detailed contribution which is more suitable for response by me on Committee Stage.  I have taken note of what he said.  I totally <Col N="636" /> refute his statement regarding my work in Justice.  The record shows the amount of legislation which has been brought through this House and the Seanad in major law reform areas.  Matters that have been awaiting action for many years are now being tackled.  This is acknowledged day by day by spokespersons opposite who, while they may be critical of the detail of legislation, can sometimes be very generous in their comments on the amount of business being done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace referred to the need to update criminal law.  This process is ongoing on a daily basis.  The work of the Law Reform Commission is very helpful and I pay tribute to that work.  Deputy Wallace also mentioned the problem of wandering horses.  While it does not come directly under this Bill, it is a problem in Cork, Dublin and many other places and I have provided extra resources to the gardaí.  For example, in the Finglas area of Dublin we have secured the use of a horsebox and a jeep for the gardaí which they are using quite effectively.  I have taken note of what the Deputy has said. My responsibility is the enforcement of legislation.  I have noted his view that there is a need for updating and I will pass on his comments to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to electronic eavesdropping and I look forward to discussing that matter with him on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their contributions and the welcome they have extended to this reforming legislation. The current law dates back to 1861 and this Bill cuts away 108 kinds of property and 62 different words to express the causing of damage, reducing it to three. That is a major advance which should be of great benefit to the gardaí in the performance of their duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.  This Bill is designed to rectify an injustice, and a possible unconstitutionality, in the present law regarding the limitation of actions for personal injuries.</P>
      <P>This injustice, and the constitutional implications of the present statutory provisions in this area, are analysed in detail by the Law Reform Commission in their report published in 1987 entitled <i>The Statute of Limitations: Claims in respect of Latent Personal Injuries.</i>  This Bill gives effect to that report's recommendations.</P>
      <P>Briefly put, the present law is that, with certain exceptions, where a person is injured by the wrongful act or neglect of another, he or she has three years from the date of the accrual of the cause of action in which to commence proceedings to recover damages.  If legal proceedings are commenced after the three year limitation period has expired, the defendant can put a stop to them by what is known as &ldquo;pleading the Statute&rdquo;; in other words, by invoking the provision of the Statute of Limitations, 1957, which specifies the limitation period.</P>
      <P>There is nothing wrong in principle with having limitation periods as such.  It is in the interest of society as a whole that, if an occurrence gives rise to legal action, the action should be taken with reasonable promptness.  Delay can lead to a denial of justice through the deterioration of evidence or the blurring of witnesses' memories.  It can be unjust and lead to a proper sense of grievance if a person finds himself the defendant in an action which could have been commenced many years before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose it can be said that the law of limitation of actions generally illustrates the tension between justice and certainty which is a feature of any developed legal system.  On the one hand there is the <Col N="638" /> argument that litigation should not be unduly delayed and that parties should be clear as to their position under the law. This points to short limitation periods measured from a fixed date, with no possibility of extension.  On the other hand, there is the view that such a rigid system will inevitably lead to injustice in particular cases and that this argues for longer periods measured perhaps from an uncertain date as, for example, the date when a plaintiff actually discovers that he has a cause of action.</P>
    <P>This is the difficulty addressed by the Law Reform Commission in their report. The commission refer to the instances where injury or damage to a person does not manifest itself at all until long after the act or omission which caused the injury took place.  If the normal three year limitation period has expired before the injury becomes evident, then the injured person has lost his right of action even before he knew he had such a right. That is where the injustice lies and the tension to which I have referred is stretched to breaking point.</P>
    <P>In looking at the law in this area, the commission considered how the apparent injustice of the Statute stands in the context of the Constitution, and set out three possible interpretations as to what the state of the law is, or might be determined to be given a suitable case in which all of the arguments were opened to the court. The important message of the commission's report is that the law in this area is unclear, and possibly unconstitutional. Some of the doubts were removed in a Supreme Court decision of 8 February, 1990, in the case of Hegarty <i>v.</i> O'Loughran delivered since the publication of the commission's report.  In that case, however, the constitutional aspects were not put in issue by the parties and, therefore, not argued before the court.  Accordingly, there still remains a substantial degree of uncertainty as to the precise state of the law and the constitutionality of the statutory provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill removes the uncertainty and the injustice by providing, at section 3 (1), that the three year period that applies in claims for personal injuries is <Col N="639" /> to run from the date of accrual of the cause of action, which is the case at present, or from the date of knowledge of the person injured, if later.  This latter date is known as the date of discoverability of the injury.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill sets out what is meant by a person's date of knowledge. In order for a person to be fixed with knowledge of an injury, and therefore for time to begin to run, the person must not only know that there had been injury but also that the injury was significant; that it was caused at least partially by an alleged wrongful act or omission; the identity of the defendant; and if the defendant is someone other than the person who did the wrongful act, the additional facts supporting the bringing of the action against the defendant.  Time begins to run from when a person actually knew all the relevant facts or from when he could, by reasonable inquiry, have found them out, if earlier.</P>
    <P>The net effect of these provisions will be to remove the present injustice from the law by giving those who could not have discovered that they had a right of action within the normal period running from the time of the actual injury an opportunity to make a claim.  The limitation period of three years which applies to claims of this type will now run from the time when the injured person discovered, or should have discovered, the necessary facts about his injury.  The law will still operate, as it does at present, so as to discourage undue delay on the part of potential plaintiffs,</P>
    <P>Section (3) (1) which I referred to a moment ago, can be regarded as the core provision of the Bill.  The remaining provisions of the Bill are largely concerned with making the changes in the law necessary for consistency with the core provision or completeness of its effect.  I will comment briefly on the more important of these.</P>
    <P>Subsections (3) and (4) of section 3 carry the principle of the discoverability provision into other statutes which contain limitation provisions resulting to personal injuries cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> Section 4 of the Bill deals with the situation where an injured person dies before the limitation period has expired. In such a case, an action arising out of the injury may survive for the benefit of the estate.  The Bill provides that the personal representative of the deceased will have three years from the date of the death, or from the date of the representative's knowledge of the injury, if later, in which to commence the action.</P>
    <P>This type of action, known as a survival action, can arise in any case where an injured person dies while there is still an outstanding claim in relation to the injury, whether or not the death was caused by the injury.  Where the injury did cause the death, the surviving dependent relatives may have a claim under section 48 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, against the person who caused the injury. This type of claim is distinct from survival action.  Both claims may be made in the same case.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill applies the discoverability provision to claims under the Civil Liability Act.  It provides that such a claim may be made within three years of the death &mdash; as at present &mdash; or of the date of knowledge of the dependent relative for whose benefit the action is brought, whichever is later.  Where there is more than one dependent relative, the discoverability test will be applied to each; and any person outside the time limit will be excluded from the action unless either there is an agreement not to invoke the defence of limitation or the person comes within the terms of the provision I am about to comment on.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that when describing the present law earlier in my speech, I mentioned that there were certain exceptions to the present provision which specifies that the three year limitation period runs from the date of accrual of the cause of action.  Those exceptions arise when the person injured was under a legal disability at the time of the injury. &ldquo;Disability&rdquo; in this context means mainly either being below the age of majority or suffering from a mental disability.  Section 49 of the Statute of Limitations, <Col N="641" /> 1957, specifies that in these circumstances, the three year period will not start to run against the injured person until he ceases to be under a disability.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill modifies this provision to take account of the discoverability concept.  The effect of the section is that where a person is under a disability, either when the right of action in a personal injuries case accrues to him or at the date of his knowledge, then the three year limitation period will not start to run until he ceases to be under a disability.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill applies the new discoverability test to all causes of action relating to personal injuries, whether accruing before or after its passing and to proceedings pending at its passing.  This provision is unusual in that it has retrospective effect, something normally avoided in the introduction of new law. Let us consider what the effect of this provision will be, that is, that some people who did not realise that they had a cause of action because their date of knowledge was more than three years after their injury will now in fact be able to proceed.  This is precisely what the Bill as a whole is designed to do.  Indeed, the Law Reform Commission, in recommending a provision on these lines, said that to provide otherwise:</P>
    <P>...would clearly frustrate in a number of cases the objective of the proposed reform of the law.</P>
    <P>That is from page 53 of the 1987 report. While I am on the subject, I would like to take this opportunity to record our thanks to the commission for the production of this report.  As with many of their reports, this set out the background to the problem and the various approaches to it taken in other jurisdictions before canvassing the various options and setting down a clear path for legislative action.  This is an invaluable service which can ease the work of the Legislature in determining how best to reform the law.  I think I can speak for all sides of the House in offering our gratitude to the commission.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  We will be supporting it on Second Stage, and indeed in principle, subject to our being able to table and speak on a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to concur with the Minister in his comments in so far as the Law Reform Commission are concerned.  While listening to the Minister replying to the Second Stage debate on the previous Bill before the House I noted he went to considerable lengths to clap himself and his Department on the back for the manner in which they had produced legislation in the area of justice and law reform generally in recent months.  I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that the Law Reform Commission played no small part in enabling that legislation be drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rightly so.  Nevertheless the Minister will be very aware of the number of reports of the Law Reform Commission that have not been acted on to date.  In view of the speed with which the Minister has acted in recent times &mdash; now that the momentum has been built up &mdash; let us hope that the decks can be cleared with regard to a number of reports stretching back to the early eighties. Of course, I acknowledge the tremendous input of the Law Reform Commission in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House essentially is a simple one.  Nevertheless its provisions are of considerable consequence, redressing an injustice in the matter of personal injuries and the entitlement of an aggrieved party to sue notwithstanding the overall provisions of the Statute of Limitations, 1957.  Quite rightly this Bill seeks to remedy an injustice and, in many ways may pre-empt a Supreme Court ruling at some time in the future to the effect that the Statute of Limitations, 1957 &mdash; so far as personal injuries are concerned &mdash; is unconstitutional.  By enacting this measure we will perhaps obviate the need for the Supreme Court to thrust such a judgment upon us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> The House will be aware of a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill circulated in 1988 prior to the 1989 general election, and what is before us today broadly follows the provisions of the 1988 Bill with some minor modifications.  It is clear that the three year limitation period for personal injuries is unsatisfactory, in particular where an injury cannot be immediately or simply detected.  The Law Reform Commission in their 1987 report discussed the pros and cons of the various approaches to solving the problem.  On balance the Minister has adopted what the commission have recommended, and the Bill represents the most rational and reasonable approach in the circumstances. It is important that the legislation enacted does not allow for a free-for-all which would give rise to claims of a speculative and dubious nature.  I agree with the provisions in the Bill that the limitations will run from the time the injured party could have reasonably discovered the injury rather than the date upon which the injury was sustained initially.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (b) provides that the injury in question must have been significant. The Minister has broadly followed the recommendations of the commission in this regard, nevertheless there is something here that perhaps we should try to tease out in greater detail. The English legislation, which is broadly similar to what we have before us today and which amended the Statute of Limitations in that jurisdiction went as far as to define &ldquo;significant&rdquo; or &ldquo;significance&rdquo; in regard to injury as one which the plaintiff would reasonably have considered sufficiently serious to justify the institution of proceedings against a defendant who did not dispute liability and who could be established as being a justifiable mark in terms of compensation or damages.  We have not done that. Obviously, the idea is that the court will decide on the question of significance, and I hope the operative date of the significance will not give rise to confusion.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (b) says: &ldquo;that the injury in question was significant&rdquo;.  Was that at <Col N="644" /> the date on which it was discovered or a significant injury occurring on the date on which the accident took place?  If one were to opt for the latter one would be somewhat defeating the spirit of the legislation. The Minister when replying to Second Stage in the Seanad dealt with the question of significance and made a very reasonable point that an injury could on the date of its occurrence be of a trivial or minor nature and of the type this legislation is not deemed to cover but at a later stage it might become significant. As I said, I hope the question of the operative date of significance will not give rise to undue confusion.</P>
    <P>It will be incumbent upon somebody relying on the legislation to be satisfied with the provisions of section 2, and the criteria therein must be clearly established before the court.  Sectin 2 (2) (d) is the identity of the defendant.  This may give rise to disappointments in certain quarters.  I realise the Minister is in difficulty but I thought he would have addressed himself to the difficulties relating to what can be described as hit-and-run accidents where the offending party is never brought to justice because the identity of the offending party never becomes known.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it is regrettable that the Motor Insurers Bureau cannot find their way to compensating these injured parties, the bureau being the available body from whom the injured party or plaintiff may be entitled to recover.  When the identity of the person is unknown that has given rise to very serious hardship and difficulties.  A small number of people would appear to have been left with no form of redress where the identity of the defendant has not become known.  I understand there is an appendix to the regulations of the Motor Insurers Bureau which states something to the effect that a form of <i>ex gratia</i> payment might be made in the circumstances, but to the best of my knowledge it is not deemed satisfactory because the fundamental rule under which the body have been established is that they will pay only on the basis of their being in a position to <Col N="645" /> recover at a later stage from the defendant or an offending party.  Maybe this is not the legislation under which to look at this problem but I think it is worthy of an airing.  If the name of an injuring party in a hit-and-run accident does not become public or at least known to the claimant within the Statute of Limitations period, should that name become evident sometime later following the three year personal injury rule notwithstanding the date of accident or date of injury, is such a person covered?  I hope so but I am not entirely clear from the legislation as presented whether that is the case.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is welcome.  The Minister referred to it in so far as he stated that the application of the Bill addresses all causes of action whether accruing before or after the passing of the legislation.  A number of likely claims can now perhaps be set in motion on foot of the passing of this legislation, notwithstanding the difficulties the House has encountered in attempts on numerous occasions to introduce legislation that appeared on the face of it to be somewhat retrospective.  I am glad the Minister has faced the matter head on and trust there will be no difficulties with this matter in the courts at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill although it is not without its drawbacks.  While the legislation addresses personal injury and personal injury claims, the Minister could have availed himself of the opportunity of incorporating claims against property damage along the lines he has suggested for personal injuries.  I do not wish to speak on behalf of the Minister, I am sure he will reply to Second Stage, but he will probably refer to the fact that the legislation is based on the Law Reform Commission report of 1987, and that dealt solely with the Statute of Limitations in respect of claims of latent personal injuries.  There is a parallel there that will wreak considerable hardship in certain quarters.  On the one hand we are allowing an exemption or an extension to parties who suffer personal injuries, yet people who may suffer severe hardship, as has often happened and is continuing to happen as regards likely claims for <Col N="646" /> defective premises etc., are not being accorded similar treatment.  That is unjust in manys ways and perhaps we can look at it in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One example might underline the point I am making.  If the beam of a house falls on somebody's head and causes injury, that would be covered by the legislation, but should the house fall down and the unfortunate owner of the house escape personal injury but is left without his sole asset, his castle if one likes, that is not covered if he is outside the period of limitation which, I know, is longer than that for personal injuries.  Many cases have, however, come to light after the common law rules have expired or, indeed, the period of limitation in the case of defective premises.  It is a serious drawback.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission did not address the problem.  They said that it was perhaps worth noting that in the report they confined themselves to the question of latent personal injuries; and that they had already addressed the complex question of latent defects in buildings in their report on defective premises published in 1982.  It is a pity the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to bring forward some of the recommendations of that earlier Law Reform Report as far as defective premises are concerned.  Parties have been injured, parties have suffered considerable damage by losing all their possessions due to latent defects in a house coming to light some years later &mdash; for example, water pipes leaking beneath a concrete floor, roof problems or damp problems for which the house builder would have been clearly responsible in terms of his duty of care to the buyer. Because of the limitation period being invoked the builder is not liable in law, although the person has suffered severe loss and hardship.</P>
    <P>This matter was considered by the Construction Industry Federation in their submission to the Law Reform Commission in 1982 and, if my memory serves me correctly, they recommended that <Col N="647" /> there should be an extension of the limitation period to ten years for defective premises, notwithstanding the various agreements between the parties, the structural defects indemnities or indeed insurance that people may take out.  I feel that the entire problem has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>A case has been brought to my attention regarding the sale of a house where a substantial defect has been discovered. It is not, of course, possible to obtain a willing purchaser and the situation is compounded because once one willing purchaser pulls out, recognising a serious defect, it is easy for the house to get a bad name and become unsaleable.  This sort of thing has happened throughout the length and breadth of the country and gives rise to serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>In principle, the argument must be as relevant to cases of material loss as it is to cases of personal injuries where people face extreme hardship and are possibly on the verge of bankruptcy.  The legislation should be extended to cover non-personal injury and damage.  I would hope that we could discuss that in more detail on Committee Stage.  In the Law Reform Commission Report of 1982 to which I have referred, there is a reference to an earlier working paper of 1977 wherein it is provided that:</P>
    <P>for the purpose of the Statute of Limitations a cause of action against a person undertaking or executing building work should be deemed to have accrued:</P>
    <P>(a)  where the work undertaken was executed to the order to any person, at the time when that person notified the person responsible for the work (whether or not he undertook the work in question) that he first accepted the work as conforming to the order or at the time when the first person took possession of the premises, whichever is the earlier;</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, having considered the matter further between 1977 and 1982 turned that premise on its <Col N="648" /> head and stated that there was clearly a case for an extension of the limitations as far as property was concerned and that there was need to have such provisions that would not lead to injustice where defects in a building became first manifest long after the building had been completed. It is fair to say that the only course of action available to the Law Reform Commission from a common sense point of view was to determine that it was not uncommon that such defects do remain hidden for many years.</P>
    <P>The commission went on to recommend that time should not begin to run, for the purposes of the Statute of Limitations, until the prospective plaintiff knew or ought to have known of the injury or damage suffered, and that is remarkably similar to what the Minister has brought forward in section 2 of this legislation as far as personal injuries are concerned.  If it is sufficient to bring forward legislation as far as personal injuries are concerned, then it should have the same force as far as property is concerned. If we are bringing forward legislation to pre-empt a decision of unconstitutionality by the Supreme Court, then perhaps we might consider what would be the perspective of the Supreme Court in regard to property, having particular regard to the passsing of this legislation.</P>
    <P>It has been remarked that the Bill might have an effect on the insurance industry.  While I again submit that this is a matter more suitable to another debate, I believe there is general consensus throughout the country that the Government must tackle the many problems being experienced by the insurance industry, in particular where costs are concerned.  On the publication of the legislation, the Insurance Industry Federation were cautious about any increases in premiums that this legislation might bring about.  They did not foresee any great influx of claims.  The reality, however, must be that, particularly in the area of employee liability cases and also in cases of medical negligence, there will be a number of cases brought.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for <Col N="649" /> Industry and Commerce must make every effort to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Medical negligence insurance for people engaged in the medical profession is alarming, something in the region of £10,000 per year.  That is not going to decrease without some action being taken by the insurance industry.  Claims are on the increase.  We seem to be following the line of the United States of America as far as that is concerned. Similarly, from an employer's point of view the exorbitant cost of employer liability insurance is something that is certainly impeding job creation and expansion, particularly in small industries.</P>
    <P>While on balance one must look to justice rather than cost, the legislation gives us an opportunity to examine the other side of the coin, that is, the very high cost of insurance and the fact that this legislation will certainly not help in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome recent comments by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the Fair Trade Commission report on the legal profession.  That is another important and eagerly awaited piece of legislation that will ultimately be brought forward.  The Solicitors Bill is also something which we have been promised on numerous occasions in the past number of years.  I hope the legislation is at a very advanced stage, having regard to the publication of the Fair Trade Commission's report earlier this year and the discussion on it at Cabinet level which I understand is taking place.  When dealing with insurance and the cost of insurance, the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission and the legal profession are very important.  I hope we will debate that matter at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  While the question of cost may well be a factor as far as the legislation is concerned, I believe that the balance between justice and cost must be weighed.  Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.  The people who are suffering because of the absence of this legislation will ultimately have their case adjudicated by a court of law.  This <Col N="650" /> measure will put the minds of many sufferers at ease.  It is extraordinary that a technical statute like the statute of limitations should deny somebody with a significant injury access to justice.  I await the Minister's comments in regard to property.  That is the one serious omission from the Bill, and I hope we will give further consideration to that aspect on Committee Stage.  Nevertheless I welcome the legislation as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be brief in respect of this legislation.  It is fully supported by The Workers' Party both in principle and in content.  It is a very welcome amendment to the Principal Act of 1957 with regard to the limitation of statutes.  It seeks to correct an anomaly that developed from the 1957 Act.  Even subsequent to the publication of the report, the case Hegarty <i>v.</i> O'Loughlin and Edwards in February 1990 was dismissed by the Supreme Court because under the 1957 Act action could be taken only at the time the injury was inflicted or the accident occurred.  Consequently any latent or non-discoverable injuries that would emerge after the three year period had expired could not be the source of subsequent action.  That was clearly unfair, and is being rectified in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in the day we discussed other legislation based on a report from the Law Reform Commission.  Again I take this opportunity to commend the commission on the thorough way in which they go about their work.  I would not have learnt so much about the laws of Canada, Australia and America were it not for their reports.  The commission carry out very exhaustive studies on our behalf.  As I said earlier, it took upwards of two years to produce the legislation we discussed this morning.  In this case it took three years to present the legislation to the Seanad, the report having been delivered by the commission to the Attorney General on 19 August 1987. The Minister did not respond to my question at the conclusion of the last Bill and therefore I will ask him again whether it is satisfactory that periods of between <Col N="651" /> two and three years should elapse before the House acts on reports that are comprehensive, well researched and detailed, and which provide a basis for legislation. I do not want to be unduly critical about this but it is a matter that should be considered.  Why should it take so long for legislation to be produced?</P>
    <P>The principles contained in the Bill are very much to be welcomed and will be supported by The Workers' Party.  The introduction of a provision whereby people who have been injured by way of accident or neglect can take an action from the time it was reasonably possible to discover the injury has to be welcomed and supported.  In an age when products are becoming more sophisticated and we are learning far more about the pollutants in the community generally that affect the individual and are capable of causing injury that might take years to develop or become apparent, it is only proper that our legislation should reflect these changing circumstances.  People who were unable to realise the injury that has been inflicted on them or the deteriorating process that was developing within their bodies should be allowed the opportunity, after a certain period, to bring action and to have recourse to the law.  I welcome the fact that the legislation requires a certain degree of prudence on the part of individuals, requiring them to take all reasonable steps and to act on information that could have been known or available to them.  I do not believe it would be useful in our system to have an open-ended process whereby action could be taken at any stage on the whim of the individual.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that we are addressing the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  The provision in regard to the sale of motor cars free from defects is being amended and brought into line with the general principles of the statute of limitations.  In the case of the death of a person who has taken an action, the personal representative of the deceased person will be allowed to bring <Col N="652" /> the action.  That again is a fair and reasonable proposition and should be supported.</P>
    <P>It is to be particularly welcomed that the provisions in the 1957 Act in regard to a disabled person or a person of unsound mind are being amended to allow the person to take action some time after he has been cured of the disability.  Also to be welcomed is the fact that the provision is to be implemented in a way that would have regard to the capacity of the person to discover the disability from which they suffer.</P>
    <P>The provision in regard to retrospection is a reasonable one.  I would like to ask the Minister a question in this regard.  Where an action has been initiated, the case has been pleaded successfully by the defendant and the action struck out or dismissed, will that person have the opportunity to go back to court by reason of this legislation being passed? To put it succinctly, would Mr. Hegarty, the plaintiff in the action that was dismissed by the Supreme Court in February 1990 on the basis that the injury became known after the three year period, have the right, as a result of this legislation, to go back to court?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that matter because it is not absolutely clear in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one item that is mentioned in the report.  The EC Directive on Product Liability published by the European Community in 1985 has, as is illustrated in the Law Reform Commission's report, direct relevance to this whole area of liability and subsequent action.  The directive required member states to have the relevant legislation passed into law by July, 1988.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation, of which I was then a member, considered the directive, prepared a final report and presented it to Government in late 1987, if my memory serves me correctly, but certainly in ample time to meet the July, 1988 deadline. It is regrettable that no legislation has been brought forward by the Minister to date and it shows us up in a very poor light.  When do the Minister or the <Col N="653" /> Government intend to bring forward legislation to meet the EC Directive?</P>
    <P>In debating the whole question of compensation to people who suffer injury in our community we should highlight the very recent remarks of the Fair Trade Commission report in this whole area which said that we should be questioning whether the courts and the taking of civil actions are the best vehicles for ensuring that people are properly compensated and whether we should be debating or considering at this stage a State run nationalised scheme of no fault liability. In short, while the rules we are introducing here are fair and will help to redress a certain imbalance in favour of the beleaguered and injured person, we must look at some stage at the overall context in which we are bringing in this legislation.  Are we simply amending, trying to put right and improve on a system which is fundamentally and basically flawed?</P>
    <P>I fully support the report of the Fair Trade Commission on this point and I hope that, in time, the Minister will act on it.  It is stated at page 309 of the report, paragraph 17.50, that:</P>
    <P>More fundamentally, the Commission suggests that the received wisdom should be questioned, that is that an injured party is only entitled to receive compensation if it is possible to prove negligence against another party or parties, and that this negligence must be proven in a court.  In many cases, there is no doubt that a person has suffered an injury, and deserves compensation, but the person against whom negligence has been alleged, for example, finds it necessary to defend himself against the charge in order to protect his professional reputation or his career, and any insurance company bearing the loss finds itself obliged to defend the proceedings.  This has led to very lengthy and costly adversarial proceedings, involving, at times, a hearing in the High Court, an appeal to the Supreme Court, and a further trial in the High Court.  The Commission believes that there must be a <Col N="654" /> better way of resolving issues of this kind.  We are aware that, in some other countries, there has been introduced an annuity insurance system of no fault compensation for personal injuries, where negligence does not have to be proved.  Bearing in mind that such a system could be abused by the unscrupulous, the Commission recommends that the introduction of such a no fault compensation system in Ireland be examined as a matter of urgency, with emphasis upon its practicality and the methods by which it might be funded.</P>
    <P>While the legislation is welcome in putting right a wrong highlighted by the Supreme Court in their 1990 decision, there is a more fundamental job to be undertaken by the Minister in the whole context of ensuring fairness and a proper system of compensation for people injured, a system of national &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; liability which would get over many of the difficulties which this rule is addressing and would also get over many of the difficulties which the courts and their administrative processes cause at present.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I welcome the Bill and, for the second time, I congratulate the Minister on bringing in useful legislation. Well done to the Law Reform Commission for doing much of the work for us.  The fact that we not only acted in the wake of the report of the Law Reform Commission but closely followed their recommendation is welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I join other colleagues in welcoming this Bill.  It is a simple one but it deals effectivley with an injustice and anomaly in the law which has existed for a considerable time.  I also agree with the comments of other speakers in relation to the Law Reform Commission and it must be gratifying to them to see that their report and recommendations are being acted on.  We should thank them for the work they have put in as they obviously effectivley teased out many of <Col N="655" /> the problems encountered by the lack of effective legislation in this field.</P>
      <P>This Bill will also be welcomed by the trade union movement, in particular the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who have lobbied in respect of this subject for many years.  Solicitors and barristers who deal directly with the trade unions will be well aware of the large percentage of cases in this area which go through the trade union movement because of the fact that the largest proportion of claims under this heading will, obviously, come from the workplace.  The trade unions have performed a very important function in this field because of the lack of effective legislation in so far as they have policed the operation of this subject in the workplace. Most of the trade unions have their own legal department and legal advisers who provide a service for workers who are injured in the workplace.  They do this very effectively but, unfortunately, thousands of workers are not covered by trade union organisations and do not have the facilities and service within the workplace or industry generally to assist them when they are injured at work by way of direct accident or by illnesses directly attributable to the industry in which they work.</P>
      <P>While welcoming the Bill, I suggest that this type of legislation could effectively be dealt with by way of committee and brought into the House by all-party agreement on Committee Stage.  If corrective Bills of this nature were to be dealt with in future, perhaps the Minister would consider having them dealt with by committees instead of using the time of the House which could be used to deal with equally important legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to two points the Minister might consider on Committee Stage.  Two forms of accidents have created problems in industry and for workers generally.  For example, where there is excessive dust and lack of proper ventilation in certain industries, many workers contract industrial diseases &mdash; illnesses caused by dust.  After much lobbying by the trade union movement, especially those in the bakery industry, <Col N="656" /> the former Deputy Barry Desmond highlighted the question of baker's asthma which is a very difficult illness to detect and has created problems for a number of workers.  I have knowledge of a recent case where the person concerned was out of work on a number of occasions due to illness directly caused by inhaling flour and because of bad ventilation in the workplace.  Unfortunately, as in certain aspects of the textile industry, it is difficult to detect and very controversial medically because specialists will consistently disagree on the cause of the illness.</P>

      <P>I expected to get a more lengthy and comprehensive reply from the Minister.  Arising from his reply will the Minister agree that there is no point saying that the restriction on employment has been lifted since January 1990 and that health boards can employ staff subject to the availability of funding, because is not that the kernel of the problem.  If the Minister has restricted the funding available to the health board, they cannot employ people.  This funding restriction applies to the acute hospital system, the community care system, the psychiatric health system and to the mental handicap <Col N="657" /> system as we have been told vociferously by representatives of those people.  There is a shortage of staff because the health boards are not in a position to employ staff.  Will the Minister clarify the position and will he say that he has recognised the problem and will make the necessary funding available?</P>

      <P>There are special circumstances in relation to the recent build up of the waiting list at the Mater Hospital. The decision made by the cardiac surgeons to retain patients at the Mater Hospital for the full duration of the post-operative stay has resulted in a reduction in the number of bypasses being performed and a consequent increase in the number on the waiting list.  I have provided special funds for the provision of ten additional cardiac beds to restore activity to the target figure of 750 which was agreed between my Department and the Mater Hospital in 1987.  The total costs involved in the project are very considerable: £235,000 for renovation and upgrading, £186,000 for equipment and a £400,000 annual staffing costs.  The work is under way and it is hoped that it will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In view of the success of CABG's which has resulted in an increasing demand worldwide for these procedures which is also reflected in this country, my Department's chief medical officer in consultation with the Irish Cardiac Society is examining the waiting list and other aspects of the service so that an overall strategy can be developed to meet the future demands for cardiac surgery consistent with proper patient care.  In that context I am currently investigating the capacity of the public and private systems to reduce the current waiting list.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the number of public patients awaiting cardiac surgery has increased at the National Cardiac Centre from about 300 in January of this year to over 1,000 now? <Col N="659" /> Will the Minister confirm that over 100 people have died who were on these waiting lists?  Is the Minister aware of a statement made by an eminent cardiologist who referred patients to cardiac surgeons on this list that some of the patients died because they could not get access to open heart surgery?  Does the Minister not have any sense of responsibility to those patients and to their families?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance the reason for the reduction in the number of procedures performed at the Mater was the unilateral decision of the consultants after the allocation of money. Quite a substantial increase was made to the Mater Hospital and they decided they would retain the patients for the full ten days' post-operative stay rather than five days as formerly.  That resulted in a reduction in the number of procedures they were able to perform.  That was their decision.  I do not dispute their right to make that decision.  It was a clinical decision and I respect it as such, but that was done without any reference to my Department.  When we discussed that with the hospital we agreed to restore their capacity to 750 procedures per annum and we provided the funding for that.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's point that the waiting list is over 1,000.  I accept that there is a substantial waiting list, but it is a very dangerous exercise for Deputy Yates to come in here and play God in relation to people dying.  People on waiting lists die, unfortunately.  People on waiting lists have always died.  Indeed, one of the cases Deputy Yates referred to where a consultant cardiologist said that a patient on the waiting list had died, was a person who had been on the waiting list only a couple of months.  That patient was not waiting a long time for the procedure and it is hypocritical of any Deputy whose party was in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a cardiac committee where the consultants have made known their view that they were not prepared to discharge their patients after four days, that some of those patients had had serious relapses and that the patients were threatening litigation against the consultants whose legal responsibility it is to discharge those patients?  Is the Minister further aware that the surgeons had no other choice but to keep those patients in hospital for the full ten days and that the real problem was that there were only 25 beds in the Mater centre?  Will the Minister now address the question he was asked: in order to avoid a further loss of life, will the Minister make arrangements through the medical officer of his Department to ensure that those most urgent cases who cannot be treated under the two operations per day rule, will be treated in private hospitals on a tender basis, on a once off system, to ensure that further lives are not lost.</P>

What I quarrel with is that the first we knew about it was when we read it in the newspapers.  No one came to the Department and said they needed funding as a result of this change in their practice.  We are looking at all options in conjunction with the Irish Cardiac Society.  To an extent we are victims of our own success.</P>
      <P>Since I became Minister we have installed some of the most sophisticated cardiac investigative equipment in the world.  We spent £10 million in St. James's Hospital and as a result more sophisticated investigations can be carried out on patients and more people are coming on the waiting list.  We recognise our responsibility and are looking at how we will provide for patients.  In Cork there is a cardiograph unit with only one consultant and it is my intention to rectify that as a matter of urgency.  As regards the short term problem, I agree with Deputy Yates that we must see if it can be done more economically and rapidly through the private system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The number of recorded suicides for each year since 1985 is as follows: 1985, 276; 1986, 283; 1987, 245; 1988, 266; 1989, 252; and 1990, (to 30 June), 145.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that there is some under-recording of the number of suicides in Ireland, as in many other countries.  However, media reports that the real suicide rate may be very much greater than that shown in the official data are not borne out by recent studies with which the Central Statistics Office has co-operated.</P>
      <P>These studies suggest that, in the areas studied, the official statistics understated the number of suicides by at most 15-20 per cent.  Discussions are taking place between my Department, the Department of Justice and the Central Statistics Office to consider the feasibility of any changes in the reporting arrangements which might help to increase the accuracy of the official statistics.</P>
      <P>Statistics published by the World Health Organisation show that Ireland's suicide rate is among the lowest in the European Community.  There is no evidence of any marked worsening of the problem and I do not consider the establishment of a commission or review group to be warranted at the present time.</P>
      <P>The causes of suicide are complex. Changes in the cohesiveness of society, depression, an erosion of traditional values, a lack of employment opportunities and social isolation are all factors which can contribute to individual distress. The health services provide support to those immediately identifiable as distressed and our psychiatric services are being further developed to provide early intervention treatment programmes at local community level and to help people under psychological stress.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the annual reports of a number of coroners have suggested that on death certificates deaths have been recorded as misadventure and so on when they were suicide cases?  Is he aware of the significant increase, for example in the Waterford area, in the number of young people committing suicide?  Community psychiatric services were never weaker or more vulnerable.  This is a product of that situation.</P>

      <P>A number of surveys have been carried out in recent years involving the CSO and all the evidence is that the level of under-reporting is extremely small.  There was a substantial increase in the number of recorded suicides since 1970 but it is accepted that this is because we had a low base.  In the seventies suicide was rarely recorded as a cause of death.  That has been accepted. The surveys showed that the figures were under reported to a very small extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The Tallaght Hospital project is at a very advanced stage in the planning process and the Tallaght Hospital Board have recently submitted a list of selected tenderers for approval by my Department. This list is currently being considered in the Department.</P>
      <P>The question of allocating funds to enable a start to be made on the project will be considered in the context of the capital funds available to my Department in 1991.  The construction period for the project is estimated at four years.  The expected date of opening and the extent to which the new facilities will be available on that date will depend on several factors which are difficult to predict at this stage.  On average, however, equiping and commissioning of a hospital project of this size would take 18 months after the completion of the building work.</P>
      <P>The specifications for the contract for this building project will include a &ldquo;local labour&rdquo; clause as follows:</P>
      <P>Persons engaged upon the works should in so far as is practicable and without affecting the efficiency of the work be recruited from the local offices of the National Manpower Service to the extent that the total labour requirement of the contract exceeds the contractor's core workforce.</P>
      <P>In relation to the medical procedures which will be available at the hospital, I have already given an assurance on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government in statements made to the Seanad and in this House and elsewhere that 40 places will be reserved for training nurses from the Adelaide tradition and that all medical procedures now available at the Adelaide will also be available at Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister's reply that, if tenders have not yet been accepted, the construction <Col N="666" /> period is four years and the opening would not be likely to take place until 18 months later, the scheduled date we have been working on for the opening of the hospital in Tallaght is likely to be delayed?  Has he had recent meetings with the board of the Adelaide Hospital? Has he agreed with them the management procedures for the Tallaght Hospital, and specifically the medical procedures referred to in the question? Are they satisfied with the agreement?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Tenders are being studied in my Department and the Deputy is correct in saying that no tender has been selected to date.  Regarding the management of Tallaght Hospital, the Deputy will also be aware that I met representatives of the board of each of the three hospitals which are moving to Tallaght.  They agreed to meet with an independent chairman and to come back to me with agreed proposals from the management of Tallaght Hospital.</P>

Do I take it also that there is no agreement with the board of the Adelaide Hospital concerning assurances to them that the particular ethos of that hospital and its tradition would be continued at Tallaght?</P>

I assured the Seanad, when I spoke there, and also Deputy Rabbitte here and the representatives of the board of the Adelaide Hospital that, so far as I was concerned, the ethos and the procedures practised in the Adelaide Hospital would be maintained in Tallaght.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, with the best will in the world, the three hospitals must agree among themselves about the particular character and ethos of the hospital in <Col N="667" /> Tallaght.  I gave a guarantee to the Adelaide Hospital that the procedures then in place would continue and that the management of the hospital would continue the traditions and ethos of the Adelaide Hospital in association with the culture of the other two hospitals.</P>

Furthermore, can he confirm to the House that in the talks he referred to between the three hospitals, the management group, that he put four options to them for the future structure of this hospital and that those talks are proceeding on that basis?

      <P>Yes.  It is a hypothetical question whether the talks fail.  The representatives of the three hospitals are very anxious to reach a consensus.  It is important, as the Deputy will appreciate, that the management of the hospital is acceptable to the three hospitals.  I reiterate that both myself and the Taoiseach when he met the Church leaders made it clear that we were very anxious that the Adelaide Hospital would be satisfied with the new arrangements for the management of Tallaght Hospital.  The three hospitals agreed to appoint representatives who are meeting with an independent chairperson and to come back to me within a reasonable time, say, before <Col N="668" /> the end of the year, with whatever arrangements they wish to put in place.</P>

      <P>I notice the Minister's reaffirmation of the assurances he has given to the Adelaide Hospital concerning the maintenance of the legal and medical procedures that that hospital has for so many years carried out in the city, but why has the Minister not reached agreement?  Why does the board of the Adelaide Hospital continue to be dissatisfied with the tenor of the discussions with the Minister?  Why has agreement not been reached with the board of the Adelaide Hospital at this late stage to assure them that the traditional ethos will be incorporated into the Tallaght Hospital?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Adelaide Hospital have been given all the guarantees that their ethos will be protected and will be preserved in the Tallaght Hospital.  I am not so sure about the question of disagreement with the Minister.  I met them on a number of occasions.  They agreed to participate in discussions with the representative of the Meath Hospital Board and the National Children's Hospital Board.  I understand those meetings are on-going with an independent chairperson, so that I am not directly involved in those meetings.  I cannot see how the Deputy is of the view that they are in disagreement with me.  The Deputy will appreciate that the three hospitals must be accommodated in Tallaght and must be satisfied with the board of management. It would be a recipe for disaster if you were to say to one hospital: &ldquo;Go <Col N="669" /> and take over the management of the hospital and what odds about the other two?&rdquo;  The Deputy will agree with me on that issue.  Our aim is to reach consensus. There is no reason why every hospital should not be satisfied, while ensuring the position of the Adelaide in the new hospital in Tallaght.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 25 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the desire of people who have adopted children in Romania and elsewhere to have their status regularised under Irish law.  This is a very complex matter involving questions of national and international law but I am anxious to be as helpful as I can.  I am in consultation with the Attorney General on the matter and I have arranged a meeting with the group representing the adoptive parents of Romanian children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that due to the dramatic decrease in the number of children available for adoption in this State, an increasing number of Irish couples are adopting outside Ireland?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that there is an urgent need for legislation to provide for the recognition of foreign adoption orders? Will he indicate whether it is his intention to bring before the House, either prior to the Christmas recess or early in the Dáil session after Christmas, legislation to implement the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in regard to foreign adoption orders and their recognition?  Has the Minister given any consideration to the contents of that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The adoption of foreign babies by Irish people is a new development. As Deputy Shatter realises, all our law is national law dealing with Irish infants.  As the Deputy also appreciates, adoption law is complex and difficult. Indeed when new law was introduced in the past, it was necessary to hold a referendum on one occasion and on another the Bill was referred to the Supreme Court before it was enacted. As I said, I am in consultation with the Attorney General because we are anxious to be as helpful as possible in view of the number of people adopting Romanian babies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether he has read the report published <Col N="672" /> by the Law Reform Commission in June 1989, a year and a half ago?  Does the Minister intend to implement the recommendations of that report?  Will he indicate where he believes the Law Reform Commission found constitutional difficulties with the recognition of foreign adoption orders?  Finally, in view of the fact that more than 100 couples from Ireland are reported to have adopted children in Romania during the first ten months of this year, may I ask the Minister to take steps to ensure that social workers, at least those attached to health boards, will assist the authorities in Romania and those couples by undertaking social work assessment reports so as to ensure that when adoption orders are made outside Ireland they are made in respect of couples who are appropriate to adopt?  The couples involved want such reports undertaken but the health boards will not co-operate with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Law Reform Commission dealt with the question of foreign adoptions they did not indicate the basis on which designations should be made, apart from observing that recognition would probably be confined to countries whose legal, social and political structures are similar to our own, presumably with the European Community. this is a complex area and we are examining it with the Attorney General.  As I have said, we want to be as helpful as possible and will certainly look at what assistance health boards can give to people who are going to Romania to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a final brief supplementary.  Does the Minister accept that the difficulties in this area result in children adopted abroad being regarded as second-class children in our legal system because their adoptions are not recognised in Ireland?  It is a matter of substantial urgency that we tackle this problem so as to ensure that those children do not end up in the same legal limbo in which illegitimate children found themselves in years gone by?  Will the Minister indicate whether he has any <Col N="673" /> intention at this stage to bring legislation before this House to tackle this problem this side of Christmas and, if not, in 1991? From what the Minister has said it appears the Government have no plans to do anything about this problem.</P>

What does the Minister propose to do to replace almost 300 beds which were eliminated in the Cork area in recent years?  Is the Minister aware that as a result of the elimination of these beds people have died who may not have died?  Admission officers in hospitals are at breaking point and some &mdash; I stress the word &ldquo;some&rdquo;&mdash; consultants are profiteering from the long waiting lists &mdash; I can substantiate this allegation &mdash; by encouraging people who have medical and hospital services cards and who are entitled to treatment under the Health Act to go private&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated in the House, a Supplementary Estimate will be introduced to take account of increased allocations to all the health board agencies and voluntary hospitals. This is being introduced following the flu epidemic.  As I have indicated it will come before the House in the next couple of weeks.  The number of beds in use in any health board area is, of course, a matter for the individual health board.  In the <Col N="676" /> Deputy's case it will be a matter for the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of consultants' profiteering from the long waiting lists, I am always anxious to get evidence of this.  I would be very pleased to receive the evidence from Deputy Allen and I will investigate it.  Admissions to public hospitals should be on the basis of need.  If patients decide to go into a private hospital that is their own business but admissions to public hospitals must be on the basis of need and must be seen to be on the basis of need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that in the area of orthopaedic and ear, nose and throat surgery there are substantial waiting lists of between 12 and 18 months.  The Minister must be aware that the same people who are on the waiting <Col N="677" /> list could get treatment within a month if they had VHI or other insurance cover. The Minister has a responsibility to look at this whole area.  If he is challenging anybody to substantiate allegations, I can give him details of the case of a 50-year-old man who required surgery and was told he would have to wait a year or more, but if he would pay £800 for the surgery he could have it within a matter of weeks.  I can show the Minister the bills.  The patient had surgery within a week.  The Minister should investigate.</P>

      <P>The Minister will investigate any case brought to his attention and he will also monitor the position, but the Minister prefers to adopt a different approach by reducing the waiting lists for hip replacement and ear, nose and throat treatment.  In the current year we will be increasing the number of joint replacements by about 40 per cent above the 1986 figure when the party opposite were in Government.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons in this country suffering from (a) AIDS and (b) HIV infection at the latest date for which figures are available; if he intends to take any further steps to deal with the spread of these two conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest figures available for HIV infection and AIDS are as follows: HIV infection 1,005; AIDS 174.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my speech in the House on Tuesday last, 27 November, in response to the Private Members' motion put down by Deputy Yates in the course of which I outlined in full the Government's strategy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated on that occasion, since the early eighties the Government have been implementing an AIDS Strategy consisting of the monitoring of cases of, and deaths from, AIDS and the trend in HIV infection; prevention through the protection of the blood supply; prevention through information aimed at the <Col N="680" /> general population and at groups which are at particular risk of contracting the disease; the provision of risk-reduction services such as methadone maintenance and syringe-exchange; research into aspects of the disease; the care and management of persons suffering from AIDS and HIV; and the co-ordination of policy and its implementation at national and local levels.</P>
    <P>As I also said to the House on Tuesday last, this strategy is in line with the recommendations of international bodies and compares very favourably with strategies adopted elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy on AIDS is adopted in line with the changing epidemiology of the disease and with international requirements and recommendations.</P>
    <P>A recent significant development in this area is early-medical intervention for persons with HIV.  Research studies have indicated that if HIV-infected persons are placed on certain medical products at an early stage of their infection, it will have beneficial results.</P>
    <P>The rate of infection tends to slow down and life expectancy is increased. In this context, Ireland has the widest spectrum of medicinal products licensed to use for HIV.  We are in fact the first country in the world to license one of these products.  There is, however, a number of questions relating to early medical intervention which need to be addressed.  A major international medical symposium on the subject is being held in the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland on Friday next, 30 November 1990, at which the issue will be addressed and it is hoped that the symposium will go some way towards progressing our knowledge in this area.</P>
    <P>A crucial element in our AIDS strategy is the role of each acute hospital in caring for and managing persons with AIDS from its catchment area, people who require in-patient treatment.  The patient would be treated by the appropriate consultant depending on the clinical presentation of their illness.  This has always been our policy and I am concerned that all acute hospitals play their part fully.  I <Col N="681" /> might add that this was reiterated to the health boards and acute hospitals in a circular which issued from the Department this week.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned to the House on Tuesday last, the Government are satisfied that the AIDS strategy being implemented is appropriate and equitable towards dealing with persons who suffer from the disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the evidence of an increase in the number of people with AIDS and HIV infection and also in view of the fact that the proportion of babies born in this country with HIV infection or full blown AIDS is the highest in Europe, would the Minister agreed that the involvement of the voluntary bodies is crucial in tackling the problem?  Regarding the allocation of additional finance, would the Minister agree that it is essential to liaise with voluntary bodies?  Will the Minister recognise the problem by increasing the finance available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that there is a problem worldwide as a result of AIDS and HIV infection.  It is a major public health issue.  In my view the management of people already suffering from AIDS is best done in an integrated way.  For a number of reasons, including not discriminating against AIDS patients, they should be treated in the first instance by their family doctor because illnesses associated with AIDS &mdash; such as pneumocystis pneumonia, which is a pneumonia, tumours, cancers, Kaprosi Syndrome, psychiatric illness &mdash; can be dealt with within the general medical services which is the correct way to proceed. As regards paediatric AIDS, I should say we are involved in a major study with the EC on this matter.  With regard to funding of voluntary organisations, we have provided over £2 million to voluntary organisations who are complementing the excellent work already being done through the public health services.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to rehash the <Col N="682" /> debate which took place in this House over the past two evenings.  Nonetheless, I would like to ask the Minister two specific questions arising out of this question and that earlier debate.  First, will he arrange, in 1991, to run a public information campaign as was the case in 1988? Second, will he now take steps &mdash; in view of the wrangle over the past three years &mdash; to open a unit similar to that located in St. James's Hospital at the Mater Hospital so that the north side of Dublin will have that facility, indeed as recommended by the Minister's own working party?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will already have heard me say, in response to Deputy Sherlock, that the correct way to proceed in the treatment and management of persons suffering from AIDS is by way of the integrated services that exist already.  With regard to the report of the working party, the fact that the Deputy, in an outburst at the end of the debate in the House last evening, held up and read out a list demonstrates just how seriously he takes what is a very serious public health issue facing this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Prevention measures, particularly up to the mid-thirties age bracket, have an important role to play in preventing the onset of osteoporosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard exercise and a balanced diet which includes sufficient calcium intake should be followed by the general population and especially women who are at greatest risk of this condition. Material on exercise, diet and healthy eating with particular relevance to women is already available from my Department's Health Promotion Unit.  In addition, we are considering the possibility of developing material specifically <Col N="684" /> on osteoporosis as part of the unit's information dissemination programme for 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Given that it is now known that osteoporosis in women, over middle age, is preventable, either by the administration by regular doses of calcium or, more importantly, by regular doses of hormone replacement therapy &mdash; HRT &mdash; will the Minister accept that to be an undisputed fact?  Given that reality &mdash; with need for greater information about HRT, from the administration of which many women would benefit enormously, perhaps involving a saving on the Exchequer in later years &mdash; is he aware that there is a dearth of information in relation to this therapy?  Would he consider it to be his responsibility to provide such information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept there is a dearth of information; there is plenty of information around but whether it is reaching the people at whom we would like it targetted is another matter. I have referred to a number of publications by my Department dealing with eating habits in a more general way, which do make recommendations with regard to dietary intake.  What we are considering for 1991 is the publication of some information leaflets specifically on osteoporosis.  I would agree with Deputy Fennell that it is something that is preventable and on which information should be available, particularly to middle aged and elderly women.</P>

Indeed, the Irish College of General Practitioners are very concerned that general practitioners would involve themselves more in health promotion and the prevention of illnesses.  I might add also that within my Department, I have established a national nutrition committee, chaired by Dr. Emer Shelley, who has quite a record in this area.  That committee will be advising me, as Minister, and my Department on how we should ensure that everybody &mdash; not merely in regard to osteoporosis &mdash; has better information available to them and once available to encourage people to use it.</P>

Will the full 60 residential places for handicapped adults be brought into service in the first couple of months of 1991 or are the <Col N="690" /> majority of them to remain unused as we head through 1991 into 1992?</P>

      <P>The resources provided for mental handicap services have been protected in real terms since 1987.  This year approximately £140 million will be spent on services to people with mental <Col N="694" /> handicap.  Earlier this year the Government allocated £2 million for the development of additional services.  As a result, an extra 149 residential places, 21 respite places, serving about 200 people, 442 day places, family support for 66 clients and over 25 additional support staff were provided to meet priority needs.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the current level of service provision falls short of meeting all needs, particlarly those of the adults with mental handicap.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on mental handicap services will be published shortly.  This report will provide guidelines for the development of services at national and local level.</P>
      <P>At my request, the health boards are preparing five year plans to meet the needs of the mentally handicapped, in consultation with the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees. These plans will form the basis for the preparation of a national programme for the menatally handicapped to be implemented in accordance with the resources made available to me for this purpose.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to repeat a question to the Minister in relation to injury caused by the inhaling of dust and other obnoxious vapours.  I pointed out that in many cases trade unions, for example, through the various agencies available to them, have great difficulty in proving that the injury was caused by dust.  I pointed out that workers in these cases can be out of work consistently over a period of time, and it is only after a very lengthy period that the cause of the illness or injury can be proved.  Very often the unfortunate worker has to go back to the workplace where the injury or illness is reactivated.  For example, when a person inhales flour it may not show up when the person concerned is out of work but only when they are in the working environment. I would ask the Minister if he is satisfied that that matter is adequately covered in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to a matter that arises quite frequently.  In many cases workers are not covered by insurance due to the fact that employers do not take out the necessary cover.  I am particularly concerned about this matter. <Col N="736" /> In the case of foreclosure, for example, it can take quite a long time for the affairs of the company to be dealt with through receivership or liquidation.  Very often the insurance cover for the workers is not adequate and that only comes to light in the event of a closure.  I would like to have seen a provision in the Bill to deal with this.  Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on it.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with cases where workers are injured in the workplace and the employer leaves the jurisdication. Under existing legislation, unless the claim is lodged to the insurance company prior to the employer leaving the jurisdiction, it is virtually impossible to do anything about it.  On the other side of that case, perhaps the Minister has plans within his Department to deal with the length of time it takes to process claims, even asuming that they are lodged within the specified period laid down in the Bill. We all know that it can take from four to seven years to process a claim through the courts.  In these instances it may be that the injured worker is suffering from a disability &mdash; perhaps permanently confined to bed &mdash; and the case can drag on for years.  There is no provision in legislation which would encourage the legal profession or the insurance companies to process such claims within a reasonable time.  I would be particularly interested to hear the Minister's ideas in that regard.</P>
    <P>This legislation is probably unique in so far as it will have retrospective effect. Would the Minister indicate his intention regarding a time schedule.  Many people who may have been outside the statutory time limit for making claims will be very interested to know whether they will be able to make a retrospective claim under his legislation.  I would like to hear the Minister's thinking on that.  Obviously there is some reason for this most unusual provision.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 6 of the Bill, I would like to know what the position is in relation to a person who has made a claim and then dies.  I assume that the relatives of the deceased person would then pursue the claim.  I would like to <Col N="737" /> know who would have the right to pursue such a claim.  For example, if a second parent dies, would the children of the deceased person have the right to pursue the claim individually or collectively?  I do not think there is much more to be said about this legislation.  I welcome it because it proposes to correct an anomaly.  It will also be welcomed by the trade union movement, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and workers generally. I congratulate the Minister in taking this initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this very important and progressive legislation which remedies a long-standing injustice in our legal system.  I am particularly pleased the Minister has seen fit to follow the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, thereby overcoming the problem highlighted by the Supreme Court in 1987 and 1989.  In the case of Hegarty V. O'Loughlin and Edwards the court removed any doubts in regard to the provisions of the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957, accommodating those cases where either the injury or the cause of action was not discovered within the three year limit, as was provided for in that Act.</P>
      <P>Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill tackle the problem of extending the time to enable cases to be brought before the court. Sections 4, 5 and 6 deal with additional matters.  Section 3 amends the 1957 Act by providing that the limitation period during which an action must be brought will run from the date of knowledge by the injured person or, where the injured person is not the claimant, his representative or dependant.  Section 2 defines the date of knowledge of the facts.  Sections 2 and 3 provide that in the case of a person who contracts a serious illness as a result of exposure to dangerous substances, where the effects of any such illness do not become apparent until after the three years form the date of exposure, a claim be be brought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1957 Act the claim would have been barred by the time limit before <Col N="738" /> the illness was apparent.  The reform of these sections also saves the case of those who may know that they have contracted a serious illness but, because of the lack of scientific knowledge, cannot connect that illness to be the wrongful act of another person.  The time limit for these people will only begin to run from the time that the scientific knowledge necessary to prove that the illness was caused by the wrongful act of another becomes available.</P>
    <P>It is apparent from this Bill that the range of legal cases affected by it will be relatively small as a proportion of total claims for personal injuries.  Any fears of a major increase in insurance costs are unfounded.  The kind of cases that have been time-barred under the 1957 Act &mdash; and which this Bill seeks to redress &mdash; have in the main been confined to latent diseases contracted by workers as a result of exposure to dangerous substances while at work.  Clearly, the Bill will affect their situation.  It is possible to imagine that the occurrence of major disasters, such as radioactive leaks from a nuclear installation, would give rise to claims well into the future.  However, under the 1957 Act, they would become time-barred but the likelihood of a substantial number of claims arising under this heading must be regarded as remote.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the identity of the defendant as part of the relevant knowledge clearly implies that in hit and run accidents the time limit will not apply until the identity of the offending driver is known.  This provision in the Bill seems to be the only one which would affect road traffic cases, hence motor insurance. The impact of any additional claims because of this on the cost of motor insurance will be negligible.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce should be wary of extravagant claims about the cost effect of this provision.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his speedy response to the situation which was only finally clarified by the Supreme Court in 1989.  I have no doubt that this Bill is an important milestone in the ongoing process of legal reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to conclude the Second Stage debate on the Bill by thanking the Deputies who contributed for their comments. Some points are worthy of specific attention and I will refer to them briefly.  I will deal with other points on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell is present and I congratulate him on his appointment as spokesperson on Justice.  I wish him a long period in that position and I have no doubt that we will make progress together in the House on behalf of the people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the Private Members' Bill introduced on this subject on 3 March 1988 by the former Deputy George Birmingham.  The previous Government decided to support this Bill in principle subject to certain amendments, mainly of a technical or drafting nature.  These changes are readily apparent to anyone looking at the text of both Bills.</P>
      <P>The Private Members' Bill lapsed on the change of Government in June 1989 without ever having been debated.  I do not know why the Bill was not reintroduced by the party oposite and this, of course, answers Deputy McCartan's criticism of the apparent delay in bringing the Commission's proposals before the Oireachtas in this matter.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, however, with regard to Deputy McCartan's point about the implementation of Law Reform Commission reports, the Commission would be the first to concede that their reports are not normally expressed in a form which permits immediate implementation of their recommendations, even assuming that their recommendations accorded with the views of the Government, which is not always the case.  In some cases, extensive work is still required in my Department and in the parliamentary draftsman's office.  Furthermore, that work can only be done in the context of the resources available to me and to the Attorney General and, most importantly, questions of settling priorities between different items of legislation are inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> Deputy Flanagan referred to the absence of a definition of &ldquo;significant injury&rdquo;.  This is quite deliberate and in accordance with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  The publication, entitled <i>The Supreme Court Practice,</i> which is the authoritative guide to practice and procedure in English law, comments at paragraph 6152 of the 1988 edition that &ldquo;significant injury&rdquo; is defined in a somewhat curious way in the English legislation.  It asks: &ldquo;On this basis, that liability is not in dispute and the money is there for the asking, what injury would not be sufficiently serious to make a claim for compensation worthwhile?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission at page 17 of their report, noted this criticism and pointed out that the likely effect of such a provision would be that time would start to run against a person who became aware of an injury, however trivial; thus a person who received an apparently minor injury and let matters drift because of the minor nature could, if the injury turned out to have serious consequences after a period of years, find himself held to a date of knowledge considerably earlier than that on which he realised that the injury was significant in the normal sense of the word.</P>
    <P>If the law contained a definition of &ldquo;significant injury&rdquo; on the lines of the English provision, then the injuries in a couple of examples which I can give would be &ldquo;significant&rdquo; and the injured person would be fixed with a date of knowledge contemporaneous with the accrual of the cause of action.  This would seriously diminish the effectiveness of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan, Deputy Cullimore and others referred to the problem of hit and run accidents where the identity of the defendant is not known.  He should check the position in this regard with the Minister for the Environment as it does not arise in the context of this Bill.  As I understand the position, changes were brought about in 1988 in these cases as a result of the implementation of an EC directive and that the MIBI scheme now covers the question of compensation in these cases.  The new scheme replaces the <Col N="741" /> earlier 1964 agreement in the case of road accidents occurring on or after 31 December 1988.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Cullimore also referred to the insurance implications of the proposals in the Bill. I acknowledge that, to some extent, we are stepping into the dark here.  The high cost of insurance in the categories of motor, medical, public liability and employers' liability is always a worry. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has primary responsibility in that regard and Deputies will be well aware that measures to tackle these costs are high on his list of priorities.  It is also relevant that, when similar changes were introduced in the neighbouring jurisdiction, there was no significant rise in insurance costs so it does not automatically follow that costs here will rise inexorably as a result of this legislation.  The Government took the decision to proceed with this Bill having considered all the circumstances in detail.  The present law is patently unjust and the strongest hints have come from the highest court in the land that it is also unconstitutional.  We must have a fairer system and it may be that we have to pay a price for that fairer system.</P>
    <P>I do not want to let this opportunity pass without adverting to the recent judicial criticisms of the insurance industry in the matter of the high cost of claims. When two eminent judges of the High Court come out within a month suggesting that the insurance industry should look to see if their own competence and procedures need examination, then it is time to take notice and I hope they will.</P>
    <P>The position regarding cases on which a final determination has been made by a court is that this Bill will not allow them to be reopened as the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> applies.  To provide otherwise would, I am sure Deputies agree, lead to total uncertainty in that a court decision could no longer be held to mean what it said.  For those cases where proceedings have not yet commenced, or where proceedings have commenced but have not yet been finally determined on the <Col N="742" /> coming into effect of the new law, these provisions can be invoked.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell raised a point in relation to this and I want to assure him that where a case has not been decided on, the claim can come forward at this stage, not just from the passing of the Act, but prior to it.  If somebody has been injured when the prior time limit was there under the new Bill they will be able to claim, which is a significant step forward.</P>
    <P>As to the action on the EC directive in regard to products' liability referred to by Deputy McCartan, I wish to inform him that this does not come under my jurisdiction.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The question of the introduction of a scheme of &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation raises complex issues far outside the scope of debate on this Bill.  It may well be a better way of dealing with the matter but it would require very detailed examination and consideration before we could decide to replace our present system of compensation for personal injuries.</P>
    <P>The type of disease or industrial injury which Deputy Bell raised is exactly the sort of thing which this Bill is designed to encompass.  The point the Deputy raises about insurance cover in the event of the employer's liqidation or related difficulties is outside the scope of this Bill. The point about long delays occurring in processing claims, not just personal injury claims, is of great interest and concern to me and I assure the Deputy that I am as anxious as he to ensure that justice is not only done, but is speedily done.  With this in mind, I made statements only last week in relation to initiatives in the area of legal reform.  I also have under active consideration specific proposals in relation to improvements in court systems and procedures, which will meet some of the genuine and legitimate concerns expressed by Deputy Bell.</P>
    <P>I thank all Members who spoke for their warm welcome for this measure.  If there are other points to be covered we can debate them at length on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for referring in his response to some of the comments I made.  Will he perhaps address the difficult problem I raised regarding property?  This legislation is redressing an injustice in relation to personal injury but are we compounding a further injustice by not redressing actions against the property, having regard to the earlier comments of the Law Reform Commission in 1982 with regard to a defective premises, a family home, or, in some cases, the fact that the sole assets of an individual could be wiped out due to a latent defect that might only be noticed some years after?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to that in my response.  The problem of defective premises is covered by a Law Reform Commission report which is within the area of responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  I do not have any legislative responsibility for the matter covered by that report.  The Deputy is correct in surmising that a claim for personal injuries sustained as a result of a building defect would come within the compass of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity.  I have been contacted by pig farmers throughout the length and breadth of the country, particularly in the last 14 days.  They all told me that they are about to go out of business that they are losing between £5 and £8 per pig and that if this continues, their position will be totally unsustainable and they will go out of business.  These <Col N="745" /> calls came primarily from young trained farmers who were rightly told at one time that pig producing was a very good line of business, which even with the advent of GATT negotiations, was likely to provide a livelihood.  They borrowed very heavily and now find themselves in an extraordinarily difficult position.  There are three or four aspects of this I would like to put to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I understand that the major reasons for the worldwide downturn in prices are the problems in Eastern Europe, the volume of imports into the Community and the depressed state of the Japanese and Danish markets.  However an EC aids to private storage scheme would take some of the product off the market very quickly and would halt the downward spiral in prices.  I ask the Minister to comment on reports that there is still smuggling from Northern Ireland and that this is distorting the market in the north-west. Many farmers, including two young farmers who rang me today, complain of unfair competition from Paschal Phelan. That company received funds under the business expansion scheme and decided to produce &ldquo;green&rdquo; pigs for export.  We wish them the best of luck with that but I have been informed today that because of a breakdown in marketing the company are sending their pigs to the Dublin market.  They are in direct competition with ordinary pork butchers.  This is causing problems for those who borrowed at high interest rates.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>
      <P>Almost 800 families are affected by the sharp downturn in pig prices.  Is there any possibility of exporting pigmeat to Russia?  We all know the problems Russia has in relation to food shortages and it may not be any more costly to export the meat directly there than to implement some other aid schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to people in the industry and to those involved in marketing and they say that the outlook for the next five or six months is extremely bleak.  Someone will have to do something.  As we are members of the EC perhaps the first thing would be to get the APS scheme under way or, more importantly, seek an outlet <Col N="746" /> for this meat.  Otherwise we will have the same problem in five months' time.</P>
    <P>There is something very wrong when an extremely efficient owner of a 180 sow unit says that he could not buy his week's groceries out of the cheque he received but had to pay it all to the bank.  He is thinking of applying for farmer's dole.  I had this checked out professionally and that is the position.  Are the Government in a position to put pressure on the EC to introduce aids to private storage?  The Minister might give an indication of whether it would be possible to do something about sending meat to Russia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a very important meeting with a delegation from Clear Island and Bere Island which is off the coast of south-west Cork.  I am glad that this matter was raised by Deputy Connaughton because the pig industry and pig producers are facing an acute problem at present.  It is a worrying time for producers and indeed processors too, not only in Ireland but in the EC generally. As the Deputy is no doubt aware the pigmeat market is a volatile one and prices and margins vary considerably from year to year.</P>
      <P>Following a period of reasonable profitability throughout most of 1990 producer prices began to fall in July this year. The decline continued into September and October and prices in both Ireland and the EC generally now stand at about £103 per 100 kgs, a drop in Ireland's case of some 21 per cent on the prices applying in the corresponding period last year. Feed prices have also dropped, but not to the same extent, resulting in a reduced feed price ratio of below 5.5 to 1, which indicates that many producers are now making a loss.  It is an acute problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> The market is poor particularly in Japan and this has resulted in increased product, particularly from Denmark, appearing on the European market.  This combined with increased East German product and the reappearance of increased supplies of Belgian pigmeat on the EC market, following the end of a severe outbreak of classical swine fever in that country, has also not helped the situation.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Connaughton may be aware, there are only two market support measures available to us in the pigmeat sector, aids to private storage and export refunds.  The Department have monitored the market position closely in recent months and the officials are consistently pressing the EC Commission at management committee level to increase export refunds particularly on exports to Japan, our main third-country outlet to assist in restoring this market and to ease the over-supply position on the European market.  Following discussions between officials and a joint delegation representing both producers and processors on 15 November last, the Commission were again formally approached and strongly urged to introduce an immediate aids to private storage scheme combined with an immediate and substantial increase in export refunds to alleviate the worsening market situation.</P>
    <P>Indeed as recently as Tuesday last, my colleague Deputy O'Kennedy raised the matter at the Council of Ministers.  Commissioner MacSharry on behalf of the Commission while fully aware of the present poor market situation, did not propose to introduce the measures requested immediately, as prices were, he indicated, expected to stabilise shortly.  The Commission will be keeping the situation under very careful review. I assure Deputy Connaughton and the House that I, too, will be keeping in close touch with the situation and should prices fail to improve I will be pressing the Commission, through all available channels, to introduce the necessary support measures, without further delay.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note I would like <Col N="748" /> to mention the progress made to date on the major development programme for the slaughtering and processing sectors of the industry which I announced in 1987.  The plan envisaged that there would be about eight centralised slaughtering plants.  I am glad to report that the programme is well advanced and almost completed.  When the programme is fully in place it will be of immense long term benefit not only to processors but also to producers by ensuring our continued competitiveness on both EC and world markets.  However, that is the long term. In the short term we are pressing very strongly for aids to private storage and third country refunds.</P>
    <P>I take the Deputy's point in regard to the supply of meat to Russia and will take it up through the appropriate channels and with the Commission to see if something can be done.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for permitting me to raise the urgent question of the crisis in our mental handicap services, the persistent neglect by the Government and particularly the Minister of the expanding need in this area and, most scandalously, the Minister's efforts to conceal the extent of current need.  Although the Minister for Health has, on his desk since last summer, a major report on mental handicap he has refused to publish this report or to make it available to Members of this House.  It is disgraceful that his Department have published no figures on the extent of need in the community and that despairing parents, who have been driven to protest on the streets and outside of this House, have been compelled to use their own knowledge and resources to compile <Col N="749" /> statistics and identify service requirements.</P>
      <P>The Minister's claim, in the midst of cuts in the health services, to have protected these services sounds very hollow indeed to the distraught, despairing, parents who are obliged Sunday and Monday, Saturday and Tuesday, every day of the week, every hour of the day, summer and winter, to cope within their own resources with the care of handicapped sons and daughters and relatives. There is scarcely a Member of this House who could be unaware at this stage of the heart-rending and harrowing experiences of those parents who despair of the Minister's neglect.  I can supply the Minister with details of a recent case in my constituency where a mother, driven beyond the bounds of human endurance, attempted to take her own life.  Sadly and tragically she is not an isolated case.</P>
      <P>The parents' association for people with a mental handicap &mdash; PAM &mdash; have attempted to construct a profile of need in the Eastern Health Board area.  This shows that there are 642 people wait-listed for service in 1991.  Of these 642 people, 220 have no service at present while 440 require a service adjustment. There are 422 people on the waiting list for residential placement this year and because of the population bulge, and because handicapped people nowadays have virtually a normal life expectation, it is estimated that this figure will rise to 1,500 by 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe a report going to the next meeting of the Eastern Health Board will broadly confirm those figures.  Surely the Minister acknowledges that services for people with a mental handicap have dramatically failed to keep pace with the numbers demanding those services.  How can the Minister plan for the provision of services for the mentally handicapped when we do not even have official figures on the service requirement?  I do not know, and the Minister does not know, unless he is concealing the information, the precise situation outside the Eastern Health Board area.  What we do know is that because of demographic trends and <Col N="750" /> medical progress the need is expanding.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board area alone it is estimated that the additional day and residential facilities would require a current commitment of almost £8 million and a capital commitment of almost £4 million.  This cannot be met without a specific significant improvement in next year's budget and the lifting of the staff embargo in respect of care, education and training in the mental handicap area.  The Minister does not appear to acknowledge, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that handicapped people have the same rights to realise their human potential as the rest of us.  If one's five year old child does not attend school the Department of Education wants to know why.  If a mentally handicapped school-going child of any age does not attend school nobody, and no Department, seems to care.  At Question Time today, for example, the Minister refused to tell the House the parameters of the formula agreed for the utilisation of the 60 vacant places at Cheeverstown and when those 60 places, that have been disgracefully lying idle since the construction of Cheeverstown, will be fully utilised.</P>
    <P>This, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is a crisis.  It is a term I use advisedly and accurately in respect of the services for the mentally handicapped.  It is one dimension of the health services where the Minister has not managed to protect the service and where parents are driven now to marching on the streets, to protesting outside this House because they cannot even get requisite information from the Minister on when a planned programme for the care of the mentally handicapped is likely to be devised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity of coming into the House again, today, to respond to this debate.  This year approximately £140 million will be spent on the provision of services to people with mental handicap of which about £40 million will be spent on services in the eastern region.  About 11,000 people received day or residential <Col N="751" /> services last year.  Four and a half thousand of these places were located in the east.  This does not include services provided by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties which exist in our mental handicap services at present.  For this reason regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees were reactivated by the Minister for Health throughout the health boards to produce multi-annual plans for the developmet of the service in a prioritised and coordinated way.  These committees have been in operation now for some time and are already making a difference.</P>
      <P>This year an additional £2 million was allocated to meet the immediate priority needs identified by the co-ordinating committees.  This extra allocation enabled 149 residential places, 442 day places, 21 respite care places to provide breaks to about 200 people to be provided. It was also possible to approve 25 extra staff for other supports.</P>
      <P>Because of the particularly serious situation which existed in the Dublin area, £1 million of the £2 million extra allocation was allocated to provide an extra 91 residential places, 184 day places and an expanded family support service for 66 clients.</P>
      <P>I must also point out that allocations to voluntary mental handicap agencies funded by my Department have been protected since 1986 in real terms in recognition of the vital service they provide. I feel, therefore, that this Government's record shows a commitment to mental handicap services, and an understanding that this area should be regarded as a high priority.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board have submitted their priority requirements for service developments in 1991.  These are being considered by my Department at present and will be incorporated with the plans from the other health board regions into a national programme for the development of mental handicap services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined that the priority needs established in this national programme will be dealt with, in line with the funds <Col N="752" /> made available to the health service in 1991 and future years.</P>
    <P>We have nothing to hide.  We conceal nothing.  We stand on our record of maintaining in real terms the level of funding being provided, of having provided extra funds this year and, in co-operation with the statutory bodies and the voluntary agencies we will continue to give the priority that the services for the mentally handicapped deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise this matter is that there is an accommodation <Col N="753" /> crisis on the CBS secondary school in Naas.  I sought to raise it because of the history of this case.  A letter issued from the Department of Education on 24 July 1985 requested the school to upgrade its intake to 600 pupils.  The request was made by the Department to the school authorities to raise the pupil intake from 450 to 600 pupils and to expand their catchment area to specifically include the Kill catchment area where a second level school had been refused by the Department.</P>
      <P>Arising from this prefabricated accommodation had been provided at the Naas Christian Brothers school.  That is now at an advanced stage of delapidation.  It is certainly a disadvantaged educational environment for the pupils there and, arising from gross overcrowding, there is a risk of injury to the pupils and to their health.  Naas is a growing town and further additional accommodation will be required.  Five years on from 1985 serious doubt was cast by the Minister for Education on the proposals for the additional accommodation at Naas CBS.  In reply to a parliamentary question on 6 March 1990 the Minister said a review of all building programmes was being completed and arising from that, no dates or concrete proposals could be given for Naas CBS.  However, on 20 November 1990 in reply to another parliamentary question the Minister indicated that that review had been completed and the 1985 decision had been confirmed.  Naas seemed to be back on track from that reply.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister of State to confirm that the 1985 proposals are continuing and that the review which took place in between has not affected the provision of additional accommodation at Naas CBS.  In the context of the Department's geography in mapping out the stages of various projects at various times, this school is at stage III.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to warn the Minister and the House that next September no new pupils from the catchment area which has been allocated to Naas will be taken in by this school.  There is no room for new pupils in Naas CBS and they will have to be <Col N="754" /> turned away.  As a result there will have to be restricted access to the school. There is no other school in that area to which these pupils can go.  As I have said, the population in this area is growing rapidly with many new housing developments. These are not housing developments for first time house buyers; they are housing developments for second and third time house buyers who have children at second level schools.  These children as well as children from outlying areas will have to be refused access to the school if action is not taken by the Minister in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a policy of providing classroom space as a first priority.  Naas CBS fits perfectly into that policy category. I ask the Minister to ensure that there will be some definite action during 1991 where bricks will be put on bricks at this school rather than continuing the present position where paperwork is being sent around in circles with no definite end in sight.</P>
    <P>The school authorities, including the management of the school, the parents' association and others, have sought a meeting with the Minister.  I ask the Minister of State to impress upon the Minister for Education the usefulness of meeting such a deputation and the positive results there will be of informing the parents at first hand of her intentions regarding Naas CBS.  As I have said, her reply to the parliamentary question on 20 November seemed to indicate that the position in relation to this school is positive.  We are now basically talking about a timescale and crisis point will be reached in September next year.</P>

However, having collective responsibility as members of the Government, I am very pleased to be here on their behalf&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to reply to the matters raised concerning the proposed extension to the CBS secondary school in Naas, County Kildare.</P>
      <P>If I may, I would like to give a brief outline of the background to this project in order to put the matter in context and to illustrate both the careful planning that goes into all such building projects and also the effect which changing economic and financial circumstances can have on school planning.</P>
      <P>The initial plans and discussions for the extension of this school commenced in 1985.  Careful consideration of the various aspects of the planning and design process, such as the assessment of the school's requirements, the preparation of detailed schedules of accommodation and examination of the suitability of the site involved, were carried out in the normal way.  Following agreement on the site's suitability, a planning briefing meeting with the school representatives and the design team took place in early 1987 to advance the project.  Following this meeting, the outline sketch scheme was received from the design team and subjected to careful examination by the Department of Education's technical and professional staff.</P>
      <P>In the following year, 1988, progress on the planning of the project was affected by the amount of capital finance available for building projects which was restricted in line with the Government's commitment to reducing the national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, in common with many other projects there was little scope to advance the project at the CBS Naas. While the Minister for Education accepts that this was very regrettable, it was one of the unavoidable consequences of the very necessary measures required to deal <Col N="756" /> with the economic circumstances faced by the Government at that time which placed very severe constraints on the availability of funds for the Public Capital Programme generally.  I should point out, however, that due to the particular circumstances of this school, the Minister for Education had the position reviewed towards the end of 1988 and she was pleased to be able to advance the planning of this project at that time.</P>
    <P>Since then the architectural planning has proceeded to the stage where a developed sketch scheme has been prepared. As part of the planning process, however, it is also necessary to critically review requirements at periodic intervals in order to confirm that the proposals will meet the school's needs fully.  Therefore, in common with other such projects the accommodation proposed for this school had to be reviewed in the light of general demographic trends in the area and projected enrolments for this school.</P>
    <P>This review of the project is expected to be completed shortly and the building unit of the Department of Education will be in contact with the school authorities as soon as possible.  I must point out, however, as has been evident from my earlier remarks, that the rate of progress of this and all other such projects is dependent on the availability of capital resources and on the Department of Education's other commitments and priorities.  Therefore, while we fully appreciate the difficulties being encountered by the school at present, I am not in a position to say when precisely it will be possible to proceed with the contract for this project.  However, I will ensure that the planning arrangements are completed as quickly as possible so that construction can commence as soon as circumstances allow.  I will convey the Deputy's sentiments to the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>When the Government came into office in 1987 and the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, took up her appointment, there were 750 projects unattended to and needing replacements, repairs or extensions at a total projected cost of approximately £1.5 million.  Since <Col N="757" /> then the Minister has done her utmost to ensure that timing, red tape, bureaucracy and unnecessary delays have been minimised as much as possible and several projects have been released by her Department.</P>
    <P>I should point out that student admission is a matter for the management of any school.  The Deputy can be assured that the children coming from the catchment area of any school will be guaranteed admission to that school and that whatever facilities are necessary to ensure that provision is made for their attendance at the school will be made by the Minister and her Department.  If there are any difficulties in that area the school authorities should communicate with the Minister for Education who will attend to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments do not reflect on AnCO and its successor, FÁS. There is a danger of the collapse of various FÁS apprenticeship schemes due to the fact that it is virtually impossible to get into any apprenticeship scheme unless one can obtain direct sponsorship from an employer.  Apprenticeships with 30 places have only eight or nine places directly funded by FÁS, the rest depend entirely on the goodwill of sponsorship and employers.  However, because of the difficult situation and the cost of sponsorship, it is becoming virtually impossible for extremely talented apprentices to get places on these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employers who sponsor apprentices are faced with a bill of £60 per week maintenance and the full cost of tool kits in addition to £500 employers' liability insurance.  Apart from the prohibitive cost factors, employers cannot understand why their employer liability insurance must be extended to cover injury risk to apprentices working over <Col N="758" /> 100 miles away under someone else's supervision.  Because of the failure to give adequate European social funding, hundreds of skilled young people are unable to obtain apprenticeship sponsorship and many of them have to emigrate.  What is happening is that parents are now paying the cost which should be paid by the sponsoring employer.  This is circumventing the scheme and only those who can afford it can get in.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to revamp the scheme.  I understand that FÁS have made a detailed submission to him recommending a restructuring of the apprenticeship scheme.  I ask the Minister this evening to undertake that examination as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins is correct in that I have asked FÁS to review the apprenticeship system with a view to introducing a standard based system rather than the existing time served system, ensuring a satisfactory balance between supply of and demand for apprentices, and reducing the cost to the State while maintaining quality and ensuring more equity in recruitment.</P>
      <P>I agree that there are weaknesses in the present system.  The main weaknesses are the absence of compulsory standards, inadequate provision for evolving technology and inequity at entry.  The present system is not always based on the best candidate getting an apprenticeship. Deputy Higgins and I would be in agreement on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must strive for a high skill base to compete effectively in the Single European Market.  Most European countries operate standard based apprenticeship systems.  Mutual recognition of qualifications within the Community will lead to increased pressure for competency-based apprenticeship certification and Irish workers will require internationally recognised qualifications to better avail themselves of the opportunities presented by the free movement of workers within the EC.  Industry's involvement in apprenticeship training in some other European countries is far <Col N="759" /> greater than it is here.  This area must be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>Under our system a person serves a period of time and never actually completes one part of the system before moving on to the next.  All the other European countries have a modular system covering a number of years, but a person must qualify in each year before moving on to the next.  This does not apply in our system and we will have great difficulties in the years ahead, particularly after 1992, if we do not conform. That is why I asked FÁS to look at the present system.</P>
    <P>In response to my request for a review of apprenticeship the board of FÁS established a review body representative of the social partners, FÁS and the Departments of Labour and Education to consider the matter.  This body compiled a discussion document which FÁS published at the end of last year and invited written submissions by the end of March this year.  The review body took these submissions into account when finalising their proposals which were then considered by the board of FÁS.  The board <Col N="760" /> decisions on the review are now with my Department for consideration, as I advised the House last week.</P>
    <P>The proposals visualise a modular system of training with greater industry involvement but with FÁS and the Department of Education continuing to co-operate in the provision of off-the-job training.  There is provision in the proposals for mature entrants and for an increase in the number of under-privileged, disabled and women entering apprenticeship.  The proposals are complex and some areas are very contentious. As such they require careful consideration. I indicated to the House last week that the proposed payroll levy on employers to finance apprenticeship and other types of training was among the areas of possible contention.  This question of a payroll levy has been included in the current discussions on the development of a new programme for economic and social development.  In the circumstances, I am sure the Deputy will agree that I should not comment further at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 December 1990.</P>

      <P>The working party report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> estimated that between five and eight per cent of persons aged 65 and over suffer from dementia.  It is expected that by the end of this decade there will be approximately 20,000 persons over 65 suffering from the disease, of which a smaller number would be severely affected. There is no firm information available at present on the numbers of those affected under the age of 65.</P>
      <P>The working party report, which has been agreed by Government as policy towards the elderly, recommended that in each community care area responsibility for developing services for those with dementia and their relatives should lie with the co-ordinator of services for the elderly.  It recommended the appointment of care assistants to provide support in the home of the person suffering from dementia.  The report also specified requirements in relation to day care and day hospital places and recommended the appointment of additional psychiatrists with responsibility for the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> Public awareness of Alzheimers Disease has also been heightened in recent years by the tremendous work which is being done by the Alzheimers Society. This is a voluntary organisation formed by relatives of persons suffering from the disease.  Their aims are to provide support to families of sufferers, to carry out research and to campaign for better services. Lottery grants and section 65 payments have been made to the society on various occasions and the society has been further supported by an additional national lottery grant of £20,000 last week.  This grant will contribute towards the society's costs in funding the first study of the prevalence of Alzheimers Disease in this country.  This research will also include information on those under 65 who are suffering from this disease.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department that the needs of people with Alzheimers Disease and their carers will be met in the first instance by community care services supported by specialist psychiatric and geriatic services.  The first two psychiatrists specialising in the care of the elderly mentally ill and infirm have been appointed recently in Dublin.  The north Dublin service is based in James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  The facilities provided include a high support day care centre at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview and in James Connolly Memorial Hospital. The south Dublin service is based in St. James's Hospital.  Both services provide domiciliary assessment of persons with dementia.  Proposals are at an advanced stage to appoint a third psychiatrist specialising in the care of the elderly mentally ill and infirm in south Dublin, based at St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
    <P>In 1988 two 32 bed units specifically designed for the elderly mentally infirm were opened at Vergemount Hospital, Clonskeagh and plans are at an advanced stage for the opening of a new unit at Tivoli Road, Dún Laoghaire.  A further two such units are also planned for St. Clare's, Ballymun.</P>
    <P>The Government in the budget statement of January, 1990 made an additional £5 million available to the health <Col N="700" /> service in the current year to implement the recommendations of the report. Comprehensive plans for the deployment of these funds have been prepared by the eight health boards and are being implemented at present.  The additional allocation is being used to strengthen and expand home care and community facilities for the elderly including those with Alzheimers Disease.  The home care teams for the elderly being established by a number of health boards with this additional funding will greatly increase the support available to sufferers of Alzheimers Disease and their carers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 76 and 77 together.  There has been no reduction in the level of funding for the mental handicap services provided by the Western Health Board and the Brothers of Charity.  This year approximately £24 million will be spent on services to people with mental handicap in the Western Health Board region.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I allocated £235,000 for additional services in this region.  As a result, 19 residential places, 40 day care places and four respite places have been provided to meet immediate priority needs.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department met recently with the Brothers of Charity and discussed their financial situtation and their plans to further develop services. Their request for additional funds will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the light of the resources available in 1991 for the mental handicap services.</P>

      <P>The tracing of female offspring of women who took diethylstylboestrol (DES) would be almost impossible for a number of reasons.  Principally, in practical terms, few women could be expected to remember the drugs administered to them during pregnancy in the forties, fifties and sixties and, given the lapse of time, few patient record cards kept by doctors for that era would remain in existence.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has had consultations with the Institue of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland with a view to the possibility of preparing suitable material in the matter.  In considering the material to be published I will obviously have regard to the May 1989 resolution of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>While I am conscious of the concern in relation to the development of DES related cancer in the daughters of women who received treatment with diethylstylboestrol, I feel that this whole area should be approached cautiously so as to ensure against unduly raising fears among women in relation to the possibility of their developing cancer.</P>

      <P>Prozac is a product which contains the active substance fluoxetine and is used in the treatment of moderate to severe depression.  In 1986, application for approval to market Prozac was made to the National Drugs Advisory Board, which is responsible for advising me on matters relating to the safety, quality and efficacy of drugs and medicines.  Following detailed consideration of all the available documentation, the National Drugs Advisory Board recommended that authorisation be given to market Prozac and the marketing of this product was authorised in April 1988.</P>
      <P>The product was the subject of post-marketing surveillance by the National Drugs Advisory Board for a period of 18 months after its introduction onto the market and the results of the surveillance noted that the side-effect profile did not indicate any untoward drug associated risks.  The National Drugs Advisory Board obtained full details of the studies carried out in the United States together with expert psychiatric evaluation of the results of those studies.  Following a thorough investigation, the board have concluded that the incidence of overall suicide in depression was, in fact, slightly reduced in patients on fluoxetine.</P>

      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recently published preliminary report of Cork Youth Federation and University College Cork on smoking, drinking and other drug use arising among Cork city post-primary school pupils, a copy of which I have received and examined.  The findings of this study, in relation to teenage alcohol use, correspond with those of other similar studies carried out in the recent past.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health I am concerned that all young people should be in a position to make informed decisions about alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The influences and pressures on young people to start drinking are very strong. This is why I recently launched two national alcohol education initiatives for young people, aimed at encouraging them not to drink before they reach the legal age limit, and to assist them to make informed decisions on whether they <Col N="712" /> should drink at all in their teenage years, and, further, if they decide to drink, then they will do so in a moderate and responsible fashion which will not endanger their health or well being or that of others.</P>
    <P>The Drink Awareness for Youth (DAY) programme aims to inform and educate young people about alcohol and the dangers associated with its abuse.  It is a prevention programme that seeks to equip young people with the personal and social skills necessary to make responsible decisions regarding their use of alcohol. This is a joint initiative between the Department's health promotion unit, the National Youth Council and the Department of Education.  The DAY programme is primarily for use in youth settings, and has been completed following its very successful piloting in various youth settings throughout the country.  The programme can also be used in schools.  A nationwide training programme for youth leaders is now under way.  DAY pack training courses will take place in Cork with Cork based youth groups early next month and early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>I also recently launched an alcohol education video titled <i>Handle with Care</i> which was produced by the health promotion unit, in conjunction with the Catholic Communications Institute and Veritas Video Productions.  The video is aimed at ten to 15 year olds and includes a comprehensive teacher's guide for use in schools.  This will be a very useful way of getting the message across to young people before they actually drink alcohol. It is not about not drinking alcohol; it is, as the title suggests, about handling alcohol with care.  Both of these alcohol education initiatives were made possible by generous financial assistance from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>A more broadly based community programme entitled &ldquo;Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers&rdquo; has also been developed by the health promotion unit to promote a community response to drug problems generally, including those relating to drinking and other drug use.  It brings <Col N="713" /> together health and educational professionals and interested voluntary workers, in their local communities, and places particular emphasis on problems posed by alcohol abuse.  To date approximately 450 persons have participated in the course throughout the country and the response to its contents has been very positive.</P>
    <P>Other materials on alcohol education are also available from the health promotion unit of my Department.  A series of booklets focus on the problem of under age drinking &mdash; one for young people, one for parents, and one for youth leaders.  Additional materials cover specific issues such as guidelines towards the assessment of an individual's drinking habits, and women and alcohol.</P>
    <P>The underlying philosophy of any of these programmes is that drug/alcohol education is not only about drugs and alcohol, but also about people.  Thus while young people need accurate information about alcohol, this alone is not sufficient to ensure responsible behaviour. Information must be backed up by assistance in the development of skills in relation to alcohol use, e.g., the enhancement of self-esteem and responsible decision making.  Young people need also to examine their own attitudes to alcohol and those of the community in which they live.  Such programmes on alcohol education can, however, only supplement the education which young people are receiving in their own homes, and it is important that parents should give them every support in this area.</P>
    <P>An important focus of my Department's strategy on under age drinking is in the educational setting, both in formal and informal settings.  However, a much broader focus is required to tackle the problem of alcohol use and abuse among young people and within the community generally.  Measures necessary to address the problem are multifactorial and are encompassed within the remit of a number of Government Departments and statutory and voluntary agencies.  In pursuance of a broadly based policy on alcohol, its use and abuse, the Government decided that the Advisory Council <Col N="714" /> on Health Promotion should develop such a policy which will address broader economic, social, cultural and health factors which impinge on alcohol use, including the problem of under-age drinking.  The council's preparation of such a policy is under way and I know that it will pursue its task in a balanced and professional manner.</P>

Mr. Yates asked the Minister for Health if he has satisfied himself with the development of physiotherapy facilities and services throughout the country; the number of qualified physiotherapists providing service through the health boards and hospitals nationally; if he has any plans to recruit more; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Physiotherapy facilities and services provided by health boards and hospitals are regarded as satisfactory.  Nevertheless, as in all circumstances where resources are finite, there is scope for development and improvement and my Department will give every consideration to this, as and when resources allow.  I would refer the Deputy to the report on services for the elderly; <i>The Years Ahead</i>&mdash;<i>A Policy for the Elderly</i>, which made certain recommendations regarding physiotherapy services for the elderly.  The report recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that my Department should review the manpower requirements in physiotherapy.  A discussion document prepared by my Department concerning the organisation of physiotherapy services and manpower issues in relation to the elderly has been circulated to health boards for their views.  My Department will give further consideration to the matter when the process of consultation with the boards has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding plans to recruit more physiotherapists, I should explain to the Deputy that in accordance with my Department's current personnel policy, health boards and hospitals have discretion to determine their own staffing <Col N="715" /> composition within their overall established staffing complement and financial allocation.  According to the most recent figures, the number of physiotherapists employed &mdash; on a permanent, temporary, part-time, sessional and locum basis &mdash; by health boards is 281 persons.  The corresponding number for non-health board hospitals, mental handicap homes and specialist agencies is 220 persons.</P>

      <P>The success of new surgical procedures, such as bypass coronary artery grafting, has resulted in ever increasing demand worldwide for these procedures.  As a result waiting lists are expanding despite <Col N="716" /> the increase in facilities available.  Hospital waiting lists are in fact a feature of all health care systems.</P>
      <P>Heart surgery for public patients is performed in three locations: Cork Regional Hospital, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and the Mater Misercordiae Hospital.</P>
      <P>There are special circumstances in relation to the recent build up of the waiting list at the Mater Hospital.  The decision of the cardiac surgeons to retain patients at that hospital for the full duration of the post-operative stay has resulted in a reduction in the number of bypasses being performed and a consequent increase in the number on the waiting list.  In order to restore activity to the previously agreed annual target figure of 750 I have provided special funds for the provision of ten additional cardiac beds.</P>
      <P>The total costs involved in the project are very considerable: £235,000 for renovation and upgrading, £186,000 for equipment and a £400,000 annual staffing costs.  The work is under way and it is hoped that it will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The cardiac surgery waiting list which includes patients from all health board areas, is reviewed by the cardiac consultants on a regular basis to assess each patient and to determine the priority attached to each case.  The admission of a patient to hospital for cardiac surgery is a clinical decision taken by the consultant concerned and is solely based on the patient's condition and not on the length of time spent on the waiting list.</P>
      <P>With regard to the longer term my Department's chief medical officer is examining the waiting list and other aspects of the service in consultation with the Irish Cardiac Society so that an overall strategy can be developed to meet the future demands for this type of service consistent with proper patient care.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to the right of entry of general practitioners to the General Medical Service.</P>
      <P>Essentially there are three modes of entry to the scheme.  (1) Vacancies which arise are filled by way of open competition following public advertisment. The required experience is: (i) six months' experience in fulll-time general practice.  The six months' experience need not be continuous but must be in full-time general practice.  Experience gained in short term locums, in a locum bureau or in employment otherwise than as a full-time general practitioner is not reckonable towards the aggregate of the six months, (ii) periods of six months' hospital experience in each of any three of the following specialities, or three months in the case of participants in a recognised vocational training scheme &mdash; accident and emergency medicine or general surgery, general medicine, geriatric medicine, obstetrics and/or gynaecology, paediatrics and psychiatry. All entrants should have at least six months in either general medicine or paediatrics. (2) The recruitment of assistants with a view to partnership following competition. (3) Doctors who had established themselves in whole-time general practice prior to 1 January 1989 are granted right of entry to the scheme on completion of five years' continuous service provided they satisfy certain conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These arrangements have been the subject of negotiations and agreement between successive Ministers for Health and the Irish Medical Organisation since the inception of the scheme.  I understand the reason the doctor in question was not granted entry to the scheme was because he did not satisfy the criteria for such entry.  In this regard Army medical practice is treated no differently from any <Col N="718" /> other forms of medical practice in the State.</P>
    <P>Ordinary Army service of a regiment type would not be recognised by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom for purposes of entry to their General Medical Services Scheme. Specialised training, for example in anaesthetics or surgery, might be accepted but this would have to be recognised beforehand by one of the royal colleges as a training programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland and its partners in the Twelve member states of the European Community have consistently raised the issue of human rights in China, both directly with the Chinese authorities and in the appropriate international fora.  Our concerns in this regard are based on the widespread repressive action taken against individuals, such as those adverted to by the Deputy, who wish to exercise their fundamental right to free speech.  Our appeals to the Chinese authorities covered all those detained and punished for their political beliefs and not just those whose names are known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Troika of the Twelve at ministerial level met with the Chinese Foreign Minister on 28 September.  This opportunity was fully utilised to convey again our deep anxieties regarding human rights in China.  The Chinese Foreign Minister <Col N="719" /> stressed China's commitment to human rights and recalled China's ratification of many UN conventions in this field.  He reiterated his country's commitment to reforms and a policy of openness and said that respect for human rights should be embedded in internal law and find adequate protection there.  I welcome this positive reaction from the Chinese Foreign Minister and I hope that it will lead to a genuine improvement in the human rights situation in China.</P>
    <P>Because the human rights situation in China is of serious concern to me, I will continue to urge the Chinese authorities to release those prisoners whose only crime has been to demand freedom of expression.</P>

      <P>The budget of the Ordnance Survey provides a sum to meet the motoring expenses of officers who are authorised to use their private cars in the performance of field survey duties.  A portion of this is allocated to the surveyor in charge of each field survey section and the control is based essentially on a monthly allocation.  In general, the section head must keep expenditure in line with the accumulated monthly profile and may not exceed his allocation without prior approval.  Members of the staff who are authorised to use their private cars on official duties are also aware of the limitations on motor travel expenses.</P>
      <P>Motor travel costs are controlled in a number of ways: work projects requiring the use of private cars are selected on the basis of proximity to the base point for calculation of mileage claims; where practical, field staff are deployed to work sites close to one another so that cars can be shared; and high mileage journeys are kept to the minimum.</P>
      <P>If in any month the accumulated monthly profile is expected to be significantly exceeded, the use of private cars is restricted.

I would point out that there is a number of investment options to which deposit interest retention tax does not apply: interest from credit unions, and interest and bonus on three savings schemes operated by An Post, national instalment savings, savings certificates and savings bonds.  By switching to one or a combination of these, persons in the circumstances mentioned by the Deputy can minimise the impact of retention tax in their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the making of refunds, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not aware of undue delays at present in processing claims for refunds of deposit interest retention tax.  They have introduced a series of measures to ensure that refunds of deposit interest retention tax are made as quickly as possible. First, a special simplified system was introduced in respect of such refunds in 1986-87.  Secondly, an advertising campaign was undertaken in the press and on radio last April in order to draw attention to the circumstances in which an individual is entitled to a refund.  This campaign was very successful and resulted in an appreciable increase in the number of claims for refunds received. Finally, the commissioners will, from this year onwards, be maintaining a computerised record of all taxpayers who qualify for a refund in the year so that those taxpayers will, in future, be issued automatically with a claim form in advance of the end of the tax year in <Col N="722" /> order to facilitiate the following year's claim.</P>

      <P>Proposals made by the European Commission for compulsory nutritional labelling of foodstuffs were recently considered by the EC Council but a majority of the member states was not satisfied as to the need for such a measure at this stage.</P>
      <P>However, the Council of the European Communities recently adopted a directive which makes nutritional labelling compulsory where a nutrition claim is made.  The directive also lays down detailed rules as to the information to be included where nutritional labelling is provided and must be implemented by 1995.</P>
      <P>The general feeling among member states is that it would be prudent to monitor the impact and effect of the directive when implemented before taking on board the major implications attaching to a scheme of compulsory nutritional labelling of all products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> The 1990 Report of the Food Advisory Committee on Nutritional Labelling and Claims recommended that nutritional labeling of foodstuffs should be encouraged but did not advocate compulsory nutritional labelling.  Consumers are becoming more conscious of the relationship between diet and health and are demanding additional information on product labels to enable them to make informed choices.  I welcome this move on the part of consumers and should add that the industry has been quick to respond to the demands by voluntarily providing nutritional labelling in many cases.  The application of the detailed rules laid down in the aforementioned directive will considerably enhance decision making on the part of the consumer by ensuring that information is given in a standardised format, thereby facilitating comparison between products.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the long delay in providing physiotherapy treatment in St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin due to lack of resources; and if he has any plans to provide the necessary funds to enable this service to be improved.</Quest>

      <P>The organisation of physiotherapy services at St. Michael's Hospital is a matter for the board of the hospital in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I understand that St. Michael's Hospital has a well equipped physiotherapy unit staffed at present by three physiotherapists. The demand for physiotherapy services at this unit is such that hospital policy is that priority is given to in-patients and those referred from casualty and the out-patient departments of the hospital.  This has meant that the physiotherapy department at St. Michael's has come under pressure from GP referrals.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of resources I would like to point out that this hospital received a revenue allocation of £3.57 million in 1990 compared with £3.18 million in 1989.  It is a matter for the hospital to decide on how best these funds are used taking into account service needs and competing demands for the resources available.</P>
