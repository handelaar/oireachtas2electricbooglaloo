      <P>I understand from Deputy Jim Higgins that at some stage today it is proposed to interrupt the proceedings to give the Government the opportunity of referring briefly to what is happening in the House of Commons, is this correct? Perhaps the Taoiseach could give me some details?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, with your permission may I seek clarification on the same matter?  My understanding is that the Taoiseach has sought time to make a statement to the House and that has been agreed.  Is that not the situation?  If it is the situation, may I ask the Taoiseach, as a matter of courtesy that he give us copies of the statement in advance so that we will have some time to consider it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Deputy, I will be happy to do that, but I intend to have a very brief statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Spring is referring to, and I concur with him, the statement being made in the House of Commons, and should it be available before we refer to it, I would like to see it.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>There are two items I wish to raise on the Order of <Col N="375" /> Business.  First I understand that the Constituency Boundaries Commission, which the Minister for the Environment established two months ago was to report to him within two months and, as this time limit was up yesterday, I wonder if the Commission has reported and, if so, when the report will be made available to Deputies?  Second, is it intended to make the Fair Trade Commission report on Restrictive Practices in the Legal Profession available to Members &mdash; I understand it is available to a former Member of the House who works for <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; and when is it intended to do so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this very important and voluminous report, may I ask the Taoiseach if it is intended to make any inquiries as to how it was available to a journalist, because its status has clearly been undermined by the way it has been leaked in this willy-nilly way.  It is not the <Col N="376" /> first time that this particular journalist has been able to find out what goes on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following: </P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the Lough Allen canal;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak on this amendment although Deputy Connor moved it. I put down this amendment because the Lough Allen canal is a natural and logical progression to this Bill.  The essence of the Bill provides for the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, thereby linking the great waters of the Erne with the Shannon.  Without the reopening of the Lough Allen canal, which I suggested in my amendment, Lough Allen would not be part of these great new waterways when the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell canal is linked.  The extent to which it should be part of it is probably best illustrated by the fact that when the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal was first opened for navigation in 1855 the boat used in the unofficial trial was hired from the Ulster canal; it started off in Lough Allen and moved on to the Shannon and joined the Ulster canal.  The boat concerned was carrying coal from Arigna &mdash; which we discussed last night &mdash; tiles and, although it was the first official trip, there was no Minister present as is the custom nowadays.  Maybe it was just as well because the trip took four weeks, possibly too long to be away from a Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State should consider these amendments.  Lough Allen is now cut off from the main navigation of the <Col N="386" /> Shannon.  However, a relatively short part is involved &mdash; about a half a mile in all &mdash; the Lough Allen canal which joins Acres Lake with Lough Allen and which, if reopened, would bring all Lough Allen back to the Shannon navigation area. This would not be a major undertaking, to put it at its most basic, it is a question of removing a dam and putting in a lock. This is very important because it would bring all Lough Allen, which is about ten miles long and three miles wide, 30 square miles of extra waterways &mdash; into the Shannon navigation which would be of great benefit to the whole area.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that this is in the general area of Arigna in regard to which a task force have been set up with a view to getting a replacement industry in case the power station and the mine are closed.  It would be a major boost to the area if the canal was re-opened. I compliment the Minister on the work he has done in this regard and I understand that a detailed investigation of the problems involved and the cost of re-opening the Lough Allen canal is under consideration at the moment.  I also understand that this requires a hydrographic survey of the lake and that discussions are taking place with the ESB.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Lough Allen Development Committee &mdash; an excellent body who have done very good work &mdash; that agreement has been reached with the ESB and that there will be no difficulties in that respect.  This is very important as the ESB control the waters, particularly the levels, as far as Lough Allen is concerned.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to accept these amendments because they would incorporate the opening of the Lough Allen canal in this Bill.  No doubt financial considerations will also be taken into account and if the Lough Allen canal was re-opened presumably it would be entitled to receive Structural Funds, I am sure there would be no objections as far as the EC is concerned as it would result in bringing 30 extra square miles of water <Col N="387" /> into the Shannon navigation, which is an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>I understand that a good lot of work has been done in regard to engineering and I am delighted with the efforts so far. Lough Allen canal should now be put on a par with the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  I strongly recommend these amendments to the Minister and I look forward to hearing his reactions to them. I am confident that they will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything my colleague, Deputy Nealon, said. The Minister is aware of the situation pertaining to Lough Allen and the canal. I know he visited the area a few weeks ago.  It would be a great pity to let this opportunity pass as it would mean that the entire Shannon would be navigable from Limerick to Lough Allen, including three major lakes.  It would not be very difficult to carry out the extra work on the Lough Allen canal which is a half a mile or one mile long, I am not sure.  We are aware that the Shannon is navigable as far as Acres Lake in Drumshanbo but to get access to Lough Allen would require work and monetary assistance.</P>
      <P>We discussed the problem of Arigna last night and the Lough Allen community council have tremendous plans for the area.  The main aim is to have the Lough Allen canal navigable.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the tourism potential in his area in Lough Derg and Lough Rea and an extension of that would be of tremendous benefit to tour area.  Now is the time to do it when the work has been commissioned for the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  I compliment the Minister on pushing this very worthwhile project.  It would be an opportunity lost if this extension to the Lough Allen canal was not made.  I request the Minister to give it very favourable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in requesting that this relatively small additional work be done in relation to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell project.  We <Col N="388" /> said on Second Stage how much we support that project which is needed for a very long time.  This is a very enlightened move on the part of this Government and we are delighted that it has been made what is called a flagship project by the International Fund for Ireland.  That fund is one of the very beneficial things that have flowed from the Anglo-Irish Agreement. There might be some threat to it from the US, a major benefactor of this fund, because some people there are querying some of the projects the money goes to.  Three-quarters of the money is spent in Northern Ireland and about one quarter is spent in about six or seven countries on our side of the Border. However, there is no greater or better project than the one we are talking about and we should give our American friends a little more information about it and let them know how beneficial it is in regard to cross-Border co-operation, which is the purpose of the fund.</P>
      <P>I agree I am wandering a little from the matter here, which is to extend the navigation by the improvement of the existing Lough Allen canal which was built, as Deputy Nealon said, in the middle of the 19th century but is deficient.  Probably it ran into engineering difficulties, and since these things were done by private enterprise at the time it also ran into financial difficulties, as did the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal to some extent, and therefore was never adequately dug or made wide enough or whatever.  I gather from people I have spoken to about this that the amount of work involved here is quite small.  Deputy Reynolds talked about half a mile, the stretch of the existing canal between Acres Lake and Lough Allen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers have said the Shannon is the longest navigable pleasure waterway in Europe.  That is a tremendous tourist asset, and because it is navigable it has also certain commercial value.  I was surprised to learn recently that quite an amount of commercial traffic still plies the River Shannon.  We should use it for all the good reasons it can be used for and particularly for tourist <Col N="389" /> purposes.  Lough Allen is one of the largest and loveliest lakes in Ireland.  It is surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges.  Viewed from a high point in the mountains the lake itself is beautiful. From the shore or from a boat the view of the lake and the surrounding area of mountain is breathtaking.  It is a marvellous tourist attraction but, as was said on Second Stage, about 1.5 per cent of all tourists who come to Ireland visit County Leitrim.  I have no accurate figures for County Roscommon, another county bordering Lough Allen, but a friend of mine from Castlerea and I did a survey on roughly how much tourism revenue County Roscommon gets and we calculated it at about 1 per cent.  I am using 1.5 per cent for Leitrim because a very excellent report by the ESB on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal states that about 1.5 per cent of all tourism revenue, whether from within the State or from external sources, goes to Leitrim. That is extraordinarily small for an area of such visual attraction with such marvellous facilities for fishing and boating, the tranquility of the place etc.</P>
    <P>The necessary work cannot be said to be finished unless Lough Allen is taken into the Shannon navigation system.  It is 30 miles long.  It is rich in fishing.  If you open it up to navigation you introduce a range of new anglers into it.  I cross the Shannon every day I come to Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not comment on that, but whether I cross it at Tarmonbarry or at Rooskey in summer or winter, particularly in summer, there is nearly always a cruiser-type craft going up or down the Shannon.  That indicates the incidence of tourism because most of the people who use these cabin cruisers or ordinary fishing boats are tourists. Therefore it is important that we open up Lough Allen and include it in Shannon navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me, Sir, talk, as Deputy Nealon and Deputy Reynolds did, about the economic significance this could have for <Col N="390" /> an area like Arigna which is located at Lough Allen.  The power station we talked about last night is on the shores of Lough Allen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the potential economic impact.  In case we lose the power station &mdash; which, alas, seems to be going to happen much as we want to resist it &mdash; the task force have been given the brief of identifying other economic activity for the Arigna area to replace jobs lost in power generation or mining.  It would be a total dereliction of the duty placed, upon us all as public representatives if we did not move in on this area of great potential for increasing tourism revenue in Arigna by the spin-off from guesthouse accommodation and other services that tourists demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot disagree with anything Deputy Nealon, Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Connor said.  On 8 June on my visit to open Parks Castle in Leitrim I travelled by helicopter.  My engineering and technical people were with us on that occasion and they were concerned with other issues as well as this.  Anybody would be impressed with the quality of the environment and with the possibilities of that very beautiful area.  The area around Lough Allen and Arigna over which we flew directly that afternoon and the Acres Lake area have enormous tourism potential, and there is a genuine fear there that, with the opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, business may be diverted slightly with the result that people could lose out in the overall development we expect to take place there in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the opportunity during my stay in that area to meet the local community leaders and with Fr.  Tymon, who is very concerned about the situation there. With Senator Mooney I had the opportunity to look at Acres Lake to see precisely the part of the canal system there <Col N="391" /> which has caused the area not to be fully developed.  The cartographic survey is under way there and I hope it will be completed in about two months' time. We need that survey to determine cost and what needs to be done to open up that area.  It is our intention to build into the overall development of the canal system, the development of the Lough Allen-Acres Lake in that area which is part of the natural resource of that area and which must make a contribution to the overall economic development and prosperity of the region.</P>
    <P>At the meeting on 8 June I met the county engineer and the community leaders and as a result we set up a working group of technical and engineering people from the Office of Public Works, the local authority and the ESB who have technical engineering people who can identify what needs to be done.  It is not as simple as it appears and we need the best possible engineering and technical advice.</P>
    <P>We have to distinguish between the power to extend the navigation and the resources that are necessary to enable that kind of work to be undertaken. When the problem is identified and a package put together, the resources can be found.  This has been demonstrated in other areas.  We should first try to get an overall natural resource package for that area with the involvement of State agencies and the local community.  There is a genuine community awareness of the opportunities and of the desirability of undertaking the work.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the positive approach adopted by Deputies to the development but I would point out that the amendments they put down are totally unnecessary because the Shannon navigation already includes Lough Allen canal and that whole area.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the Minister's assurance that there is no doubt as to the ownership of the Lough Allen canal and that it is firmly part of the Shannon navigation. I now assume that there will be no difficulty when the Minister proceeds further.</P>
      <P>I also like the assurance that it is the general intention that this will be developed.  There is need for urgent development because of the difficulties in that area, because of the difficulties of the west as a whole and because this is an automatic way of, to a great extent, transforming that area in relation to tourism and other activities.  The Minister said that it may turn out to be fairly complicated but basically the structure is there so I cannot see enormous problems.</P>
      <P>It might be of great value as far as the funding of the re-opening of the Lough Allen canal is concerned, if it became part and parcel of the operation being undertaken for Ballinamore and Ballyconnell. I would like the Minister to give some indication as to whether the Lough Allen canal could also be incorporated in the Structural Funds package now being put together for Ballinamore and Ballyconnell. I know that recently in the European Parliament the Commissioner responsible for regional affairs said that approval had been given for substantial funding for the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.</P>
      <P>I express my appreciation of the Minister's attitude towards this.  I believe that the discussion we have had here in the Dáil today will mean that this canal will be re-opened to the delight and benefit of everyone in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am gratified to hear that the Lough Allen canal is incorporated in the Shannon navigation. It is essential that this area is made navigable. This year alone, about 250 cruising <Col N="393" /> boats for hire have been booked out from St. Patrick's Day weekend until the October weekend of this year.  That shows the potential for craft on the Shannon. The more navigable the waterway the more craft can be used on it.</P>
      <P>Kennedy boat building is a project being set up in the Drumshanbo area which has been backed by the IDA and to some extent is being set up in the area to build pleasure cruisers for the Shannon waterway.  It would be a great coup for Drumshanbo if the first boat built by the Kennedy boat building company could be launched on the Lough Allen canal, from Acres Lake into Lough Allen.  As Deputy Nealon said, urgency is what we are more concerned about at the moment.  We are delighted that we got the essential backing from the Minister. We urgently need monetary assistance to make this part of the Shannon navigable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that this area is part of the Shannon navigation but the problem relates to its navigability.  It cannot be navigated by modern boats and that is why we were seeking the funding being provided now from the EC Structural Funds, or wherever, so that we can do the project now.  I understand that the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal project will take about two years to complete. That gives us a good amount of time to ensure that we get the funding.  I do not want to see the machines move away from the area without this project being completed because if they do move away the project will not be completed.  That has been our experience with these things in this country.  These things come within the principles of cohesion within the community, and what the Structural Funds are supposed to be about.  There should be a transfer of resources to areas stricken by economic decline and emigration. We have already highlighted the rate at which the population of this area emigrated during the past 50 to 60 years with reference to census figures.  One of the aims of the European Community, as expressed in the Single European Act, is economic and social cohesion and people living in deprived areas will have been <Col N="394" /> unfairly treated if they do not get a slice of the cake.</P>
      <P>As this is a truly deprived area a very good case can be made for seeking funds from the EC Structural Fund.  Needless to say social deprivation follows economic deprivation.  For this reason we suggest that funding should be sought from the EC.  The Minister indicated that he wants to put a package together but we appeal to him to put it together as quickly as possible so all this work can be carried out at the one time.  We urge the Minister to ensure that the dredging machines, the craftsmen and the rest of the people concerned will not leave the site on the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal until the work has been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it very clear that I might mislead people if I were to say that we will undertake this work immediately.  I might also mislead them if I were to say that this work will be carried out once the work on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal has been completed as there is a chance this work may be done first if things work out right, but the fact is the hydrographic survey has not been completed.  We could only hazard a guess at this stage as to what the cost of the project will be.  It would not be wise at this stage, in the absence of the detail needed, to consider the project in any reasonable way or give an undertaking that we will proceed with it.  I have asked the technical staff involved in the hydrographic survey and the other work being carried out there to come together as quickly as possible.  They have assured me that I will have that report within a couple of months.  I will certainly discuss that report with the Deputies, when I will give to the Deputies all the information available to me from our technical and engineering staff to ensure that Deputies fully understand what is involved.  In the final analysis, local interests and the State agencies working together will get the <Col N="395" /> project under way and have it completed as speedily as possible.</P>

Therefore this Bill presents us with an opportunity to make our views known and get this work done.  If my colleagues are happy that the Minister of State agrees with everything we have said and has promised to report back once the hydrographic survey has been completed, we will not press the amendment to a vote now.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, paragraph (h), line 14, after &ldquo;navigation&rdquo; where it secondly occurs, to insert &ldquo;and, in particular, to open the portion of the Boyle River, from Drum Bridge to the Bridge of Boyle, to navigation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are seeking with this amendment is the opening of a portion of the Boyle river, which is part of the Shannon system, to navigation.  People should realise the Shannon has a number of major tributaries, one of which is the Boyle river which passes through the countries of Sligo and Mayo but mainly through the north western part of County Roscommon.  The river proper stretches from Lough Gara, which is an excellent coarse fishing lake, on the south Sligowest Roscommon border to the town of Boyle and on through one of the most beautiful lakes in Ireland, Lough Key, which is surrounded by Lough Key Forest Park.  The river is navigable from a point near Carrick-on-Shannon to Lough Key and on to a point near the town of Boyle <Col N="396" /> called Drum Bridge.  It is not possible to go any further as the river to the town of Boyle is no longer navigable as the water is too shallow and flows rapidly.</P>
    <P>I do not want the House to think I am being parochial in putting forward this amendment.  Surveys have been done in regard to visitors to Lough Key, who boat through the Lough Key lake system and up the river stem that goes as far as Drum Bridge.  They have pointed out that they would like to take their boats as far as the town of Boyle to avail of the facilities on offer there, such as beverages and food.  However it is not possible, under the planning regulations, to provide facilities such as these at pier systems at Lough Key, Doon Bridge and so on.  That problem would be overcome if the navigation of the River Boyle was extended from Drum Bridge to the town of Boyle.</P>
    <P>There is one other good reason for carrying out this work now and that is the Office of Public Works are carrying out an arterial drainage scheme on the Boyle river.  Most of the channel work on the two major channels, the Breedogue system and the Lung system, has now been done.  It is hoped that next year the Office of Public Works will move in their plant and machinery and carry out excavation work on the Boyle river from Lough Gara to Lough Key.  Having regard to the fact that resources have been committed, part of which has been provided under the EC old western drainage scheme established in 1978 or 1979, we now have an ideal opportunity to carry out this work.  This work is necessary because as I said, visitors have pointed out that one of the shortcomings of the navigation is that it does not extend as far as the town of Boyle.  Tourism interests in the town of Boyle, the chamber of commerce and the local development committees, have long recognised this problem and have asked that something be done.</P>
    <P>Preliminary surveys show that this work can be done cheaply.  The local community have also indicated that they are willing to provide a contribution towards the cost, but having regard to the fact <Col N="397" /> that the skilled people will carry out excavation work on this stem from 1991 onwards, now is the time to ensure that this section, which stretches from between 400 and 500 metres, is open to navigation to the town of Boyle.  This work can be done quite economically when we consider arterial drainage work is to be carried out on the river.  Such an opportunity will not present itself again in the future.  When the men and the machines are on the site is the time to do the job.  This work would be of tremendous benefit to a small rural town like Boyle.  There is a complaint that while thousands of visitors come to Lough Key Forest Park &mdash; about four miles from the town &mdash; the town gets relatively little benefit from it because Carrick on Shannon is almost as close to the park and other smaller villages on the other side of the lake are even closer.  It is contended that this would bring the boating visitors to the town and it would be a way of introducing them to the town for the first time.  This would result in a major economic spin-off for this small town which has suffered because of factory closures and unemployment.</P>
    <P>Boyle is a rural town servicing a farming community where the population is gradually declining and where farm incomes have declined significantly in the past two years.  All these factors have an effect on the economic activity in a small rural town.  By doing this we would be taking an opportunity which presents itself by which we could get additional tourist business into a town such as Boyle which would have the spin-off effect of increased prosperity.  That is the invisible export business of tourism.</P>
    <P>Recent surveys have shown that there has been an ever-increasing number of continental, United States and even Japanese tourists, coming to Lough Key Forest Park and to Boyle.  The money spent on extending the navigation to the town from Lough Key would be money brought in from abroad by means of the invisible export business.  That is what it is all about.  We want to get increased tourism revenue into the country.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to consider <Col N="398" /> favourably the amendment which I have tabled.  I represent the Roscommon constituency and the area concerned here is in that constituency and is an essential part of the navigation.  I appeal to the Minister to take account of what I am saying, that the Office of Public Works are about to start arterial drainage works next year on this particular stem.  Basically what is needed to be done between Boyle Bridge and Drum Bridge is deepening and excavation and probably some lock control.  There is already a lock at Drum Bridge.  While the men and the machines are there that is the time to undertake the task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The present limit of the navigation is about half a mile from the town of Boyle and extends to Drum Bridge, with which the Deputy is more familiar than I.  I am informed by my engineering personnel that this would be a difficult task because the river is very shallow and probably would need lock excavation.  In view of the Deputy's interest in the matter we will certainly have it investigated. Some preliminary investigations have been carried out but we will have it investigated further as a result of the views put forward by the Deputy.  It would be appropriate to say at this stage that there are many similar areas where attention to some detail in some difficult areas which were neglected or abandoned in the past will need to be looked at as we develop a policy in this area over the next few years.  That is why we specifically made provision for it in section 3 (3) which reads:</P>
      <P>The Commissioner may, by by-laws under this section, exercise from time to time as occasion requires the powers conferred on them by section 39 of the Shannon Act to fix and determine the limits of the River Shannon, and the rivers flowing into it that are improved under the Shannon Act,...</P>
      <P>That subsection as well as subsection (2) gives the commissioners all the statutory powers we need to carry out those extensions if it is necessary or desirable that they be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> The Deputy will appreciate that in many instances the first consideration must be the feasibility of undertaking a project such as this because of the engineering costs involved and whether it is possible, in view of that consideration, to undertake the works envisaged.  The necessary power is in the legislation to undertake that work if there is a desire to do so.  We will undertake an investigation and some cost analysis of the extension referred to.  If there are community leaders and community chambers of commerce in Boyle who are interested in this project perhaps they would communicate either with the Deputies or with us and we will certainly meet them to discuss the matter and send our engineering personnel to the area to see whether it is possible &mdash; and whether it would be beneficial &mdash; to undertake the work proposed by the Deputy.  It is not necessary to take the amendment suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much. I am grateful for the very helpful and sympathetic tone of the Minister's reply. He did not refer &mdash; no doubt it was an oversight &mdash; to the fact that when an investigation has to be carried out in regard to the cost of the project it would be shared by what we are already committed to under the Arterial Drainage Act, which is to carry out arterial cleaning, clearance and deepening on that stem and other improvements to Boyle bridge.  I would reiterate that the costs will be shared by what is already being done.  The urgency in bringing forward this issue, as in the case of the Lough Allen canal and linking it in with the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore project, is that if we find that next year and the year after that the arterial drainage works are carried out on the river&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that on Committee Stage it is difficult enough to proceed by dealing with one item of legislation.  If we are to have the confluence of two items it would make it much more difficult apart from the fact <Col N="400" /> that it would not be in order.  We must confine ourselves to what is in the section, as proposed here, and what is in the amendment, as proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what I have proposed in this amendment the reference to the arterial drainage works is extremely germane because arterial drainage works are about to be carried out on this stem of river.  I am asking the Minister to bear that in mind as a major price factor when he is carrying out this survey.  He laid emphasis on the fact that there would have to be a cost benefit analysis, etc.  I agree with his anxiety about costs but I am asking him to bear in mind that much of the cost will already be covered by arterial drainage works which are committed on this river under the provisions of Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The Minister has been very helpful in his reply.  The point I am making before you questioned me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My fear &mdash; it is not a repeat of the same point &mdash; when I was speaking on the last section was that if the Lough Allen canal was not taken, as part of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore project, and you moved away from the maiden project, it would not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the arterial drainage work will be carried out and no account taken of the proposal contained in my amendment which is to undertake the two together for good economic reasons. We are in this House endeavouring to do the best economic job possible for the country.  I contend it would be a good piece of economic work to extend this portion of navigation.  It would make good economic sense to have it done in tandem with the arterial drainage works proposed for this particular stem of river <Col N="401" /> anyway.  I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle now fully understands the point I am making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Any investigation carried out will take into account the proximity of the drainage.  Certainly we will be undertaking some cleaning and maintenance. The advice I receive from my enginerring staff is to the effect that they would not feel that the type of cleaning and maintenance undertaken as part of a normal exercise would be sufficient for navigational purposes.  I would not have any credibility at all were I to jump up and down here in response to every suggestion proposed, saying: Yes, we will certainly undertake that.  We will effect the extension to Lough Allen, or wherever. The cost is the major factor in all of these extensions and developments.  We must always bear in mind whether the resultant benefit will be worthy of the cost involved.</P>
      <P>Certainly I would be willing to talk to the chamber of commerce people in Boyle ascertaining precisely what they have in mind, whether they might enter into some type of partnership arrangement with the Office of Public Works.  In the drainage involvement there we will certainly bear in mind the desirability of undertaking the navigational work on that half mile stretch.  I have not seen the place, I am not familiar with the terrain, but I am reliably advised that this would be fairly costly.  Therefore, in the absence of any cost-benefit analysis I could not give the Deputy any definite assurance other than to say we are willing to have it investigated in order to ascertain whether we can arrive at some satisfactory solution.</P>

Nonetheless we will have it investigated in order to ascertain whether it would be feasible.  If we can enlist the co-operation of the local chamber of commerce or other interests that probably would help to speed up the project and get it under way as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) (a) The powers vested in the Commissioners under subsection (1) shall only be exercised by the Commissioner after consultations have taken place with persons representative of tourism, agriculture, fisheries, industry, navigation, the ESB and Bord na Móna where the interests of such persons would be <Col N="403" /> affected by the exercise of such powers by the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(b) In the case of any objections being raised as regards a proposed exercise by the Commissioners of their powers under this section, any interested persons referred to in paragraph (a) shall have the right to seek the decision of the Minister and the power shall not be exercised until he has given a decision in the matter.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This amendment has to do with the establishment of a formal body to discuss navigational matters on the River Shannon since it affects several interests on the main stem of the Shannon itself.</P>
    <P>Over the years there has been much debate about the navigational operations on the River Shannon.  The Office of Public Works are the main players in terms of navigational control of the river. But since the passage of the Act setting up the Electricity Supply Board and the hydro-electricity station constructed at Ardnacrusha &mdash; because the control of the flow of water is so important to the ESB &mdash; they too were given statutory powers to control flows of water on the River Shannon.  I think that dates back to approximately 1926.  There has never been great co-ordination between the two bodies; nobody will diagree with me in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be advised that the position is not as bad as we portray.  Generally speaking everybody would agree that there has never been great co-ordination between the two main players in charge of navigation on the River Shannon itself, that is between the Office of Public Works and the ESB.  As a result many people, particularly farmers, have suffered.  The ESB may feel they need more water for their generating station at Ardnacrusha at certain periods throughout the summer, or that they may need less water, when they will close certain lock gates.  When one closes certain lock gates on a river such as the Shannon &mdash; especially in the region generally referred to as the Shannon Valley, <Col N="404" /> that stretch of river running from Lough Ree almost to Lough Derg, where all the riparial or adjoining lands are very low &mdash; the elevation of these lands in relation to the top water level in the river, the mean top water level in the river is very close.  When one raises the top water level even by a few inches one gets a huge lateral spread of water onto the adjoining lands or onto the adjoining systems that feed into the river itself, up the small drains, streams, culverts and so on.  This has resulted in a serious economic loss to thousands of farmers over the past 50 to 60 years.  It happens as a result of natural flooding when the channel can no longer absorb the amount of water dumped into it as a result of rainfall and so on, resulting in serious economic damage for many thousands of farmers.  Equally it happens as a result of the manipulation of the lock systems on the River Shannon.  The ESB may feel, for their own good reasons, they need to stem the flow of water. Equally, the Office of Public Works might feel that, for navigational purposes, to accommodate boats, they need to raise the level of the water in certain sections, let us say between Roosky and Termonbarry, or between Termonbarry and Athlone, when they manipulate the lock system and the waters rise resulting in the lateral spread of water onto the adjoining lands.</P>
    <P>Farmers, farming organisations and others have complained very bitterly over the years about the fact that they had no method by which they could be consulted; certainly there was no way in which they could be compensated since compensation did not enter in at all. Always they felt that, had the operation of the locks system been better co-ordinated, much of the damage done could have been avoided.  If I might draw an analogy, on the streets of Dublin, people contend that one week Dublin Corporation dig a hole in a street disrupting the traffic flow.  That hole is filled in and the following week Telecom Éireann or somebody else digs another hole a few inches beside the former, again disrupting the traffic, and so it goes on. <Col N="405" /> Everybody who has access to ducts, culverts or whatever in the street will do their own thing in their own time whereas a wise, co-ordinated policy would entail ascertaining or co-ordinating the plans of everybody with such access.  It would be much wiser to co-ordinate all of those policies leading to one of them, saying, &ldquo;You need to undertake an excavation here.  Let us do the whole lot together.&rdquo; If I may transfer that analogy to the Shannon, similarly, there should be consultation between the main players, the Office of Public Works and the ESB, each asking the other, &ldquo;Do you need to raise the levels today? For what reasons and for how long? Will your raising the level be in conflict with our lowering at another section?&rdquo; The Office of Public Works will stress that they are looking after their interests only, the navigational interests, whereas the ESB will be interested in the water flow for their electricity generation purposes.  Equally, in co-ordination, they might well ascertain what will be the effect of their actions on the riparial or adjoining landowners and overall drainage in the area.  It does very severe economic damage.  As a result of agitation by farmers and so on, a Shannon forum was set up last year, but it does not have statutory powers and is only an informal group of people representing farmers' interests, the Board of Works, the ESB, tourism and others.  If they fall out or do not come to any agreement there is nothing anybody can do.  The main players in the game can listen but they are not actually bound to do anything.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing in this amendment is a formal arrangement for management of the navigation of the river itself, particularly those areas that are adversely affected by the lowering and raising of water levels, and I have requested that certain bodies should become part of this formal regulatory body.  We are careful also to say that if they do not agree about questions of navigation of if there are disputes about water levels and so on, these problems would then be referred to the Minister for a final decision.  It would put the onus on the Board of Works and the ESB, to <Col N="406" /> have their own special interests, to be mindful of the interests of other people who are affected.</P>
    <P>It is only right to involve tourism interests as well because we are talking about management of the whole system. There is no proper pollution control on the river.  I do not know of any law that controls the discharge of sewage from boats into the river itself and there have been many complaints from visitors and anglers, etc., about the level of pollution, about raw sewage, etc., seen in the main river and in the lakes of the River Shannon system.</P>
    <P>The bordering local authorities also have a major interest in the area so it would be only right that they would be part of this body.  I know the Minister will say that last year the Shannon forum was a major step in the right direction.  I agree that it was.  I happened to attend a meeting of the Shannon forum in Athlone last February.  It was a crisis meeting of the forum after the serious flooding which took place at that time.  Management of average water levels could not be on the agenda that day; they were talking about the disastrous effects of the rainfall at that time.  Although it is amazing that everybody agreed about the act of God, or of nature being very unkind because of the way the water levels were raised, the member of the forum could not agree about what might be done to alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>Farmers will blame Bord na Móna for silting the river.  The Board of Works will say that they are responsible purely for navigation and keeping water levels at a certain level for navigation.  The ESB have their statutory powers and they cannot have either a shortfall or an over-supply of water to the hydroelectric station at Ardnacrusha because either would damage the plant.  In regard to the silting, it must be remembered that Bord na Móna's major operations in Lanesboro mountain, Longford and Roscommon all drain into the River Shannon.  As we said at an earlier stage, the cutting of the bogs has removed a vast sponge that used to soak up billions of gallons of water after rainfall and allow it slowly <Col N="407" /> back, by the forces of nature, into the Shannon system.  That sponge has been largely removed now &mdash; David Bellamy and people like him have been telling us this for a long time.  Now there is a huge rush of water into the system and into these areas of turbary.  There is also a huge wash in of peat silt which has raised the bed of the main channel of the river. This has the knock-on effect of raising the top water level, with the lateral spread of the water into the adjoining drainage system and lands.</P>
    <P>Something must be done, and I would be in favour of having Bord na Móna involved in this body or consultation because they have a major influence.  I will leave it at that for the time being and await with interest to hear what the Minister has to say.  This is something we are seriously interested in and if we are not satisfied with what the Minister has to say we will be asking the House for its opinion.</P>

      <P>The amendment to section 2 of the Bill put down by Deputy Connor provides that before exercising any of the powers granted to them under the Bill, the commissioners would be required to consult with a multiplicity of interested parties who would be entitled to object to the proposed exercise of the powers, and to appeal to the Minister for Finance for a decision in the matter.  I do not know if what the Deputy wants would be covered by what he is suggesting here. What is suggested here would totally paralyse the commissioners in undertaking their work in the area of navigation. This is a Shannon Navigation Bill. It is not legislation to establish some overall authority with responsibility for the management and control of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed this on Second Stage and reference was made to the fact that there was no overall scheme of administration in place to deal effectively with the problems that arise in the various areas. That is a totally separate matter and I do not think it can be dealt with by amendment to this legislation.  Setting up a body <Col N="408" /> to do that would be difficult and complicated because a number of State agencies have their own statutory responsibilities written in in legislation here.  Setting up some superstructure would not, as far as I can see, have the desired results, but would complicate matters further.  The amendment the Deputy is proposing would result in a totally unworkable arrangment.  It would mean the commissioners could not even undertake urgently required maintenance work without consultation, negotiation and agreement with a variety of interests.  If such interests prevented the work being undertaken, the commissioners would be in breach of their statutory obligations to carry out conservation work on the Shannon.  The inclusion of this provision could mean we would be in breach of our statutory obligations in this area.  A statutory requirement for consultation is not considered necessary as it is normal practice for the commissioners to consult with the various interests involved, where warranted, and to take their views into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the Shannon Forum.  That forum provides an opportunity for consultation but does not have overall statutory responsibility for the work, and it would not be practical to give overall responsibility to such a body. The Deputy might recall the difficulties we had in putting an overall statutory body in place to oversee the lower Shannon area.  There were three Bills before the House in the last 12 to 14 years dealing with this matter and each of them collapsed.  There is still no overall statutory body with responsibility in that area, but the work is carried out by individual bodies who have specific responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much the sentiments expressed by the Deputy.  I think there is consensus on all sides of the House on this matter but it would not be practical to put in place that type of legislation, and I would not even contemplate doing so.  However, we have given an undertaking that full and meaningful consultation will take place, as has always <Col N="409" /> been the case, not only with other statutory bodies but also with voluntary and community groups.  We indicated our willingness to do that when discussing amendments here in relation to Lough Allen.  At that time meetings took place with community leaders and politicians to try to find satisfactory solutions to the problems.  The amendment the Deputy is proposing would be detrimental to the overall objective, and I cannot accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has painted the worst scenario of what we are proposing. What we are doing is asking the Minister to provide a statutory basis for the forum that already exists, the Shannon Forum.  The members of that forum, who comprise farming interests, tourism interests, Bord na Móna and so on, have no statutory rights.  They feel the activities of the Office of Public Works are damaging their interests as the Office of Public Works are the final arbiters in all matters concerning them.  We are asking that a statutory basis be provided for such a forum, which would meet on a certain number of occasions.  There is no provision for that under the present arrangement.  The Office of Public Works and the ESB who already have statutory power in this area can literally tell the other interests involved to go to hell. If farmers come to them and say that thousands of acres of land have been destroyed because of the insensitive way <Col N="410" /> they have used the lock gate system, they can be given the same response.</P>
      <P>We have been careful to provide that if there is a dispute between the Office of Public Works and the other interests involved, the matter would be referred to the Minister for a decision.  We are asking that there be a formal legal basis for such a forum which would meet a number of times in any year or on any occasion that would warrant such a meeting. The people on this forum should have a statutory right to put their points of view.  They should not be dismissed out of hand simply because the bodies who have statutory powers in the management of the river do not like what they are saying.  These bodies should not have all the statutory power while the interests on this forum have no such power.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Forum is already in existence and we welcome that.  The Minister's predecessor was responsible for setting up that forum and that was a step forward, but the problem is that it is totally informal.  The interests on that forum have no statutory rights and are profoundly unhappy about that.  We are simply proposing in this amendment that there be a statutory basis for that forum and, as I have said, we have provided that if there is a dispute it would be up to the Minister or his successor to adjudicate at the end of the day on how any problem should be resolved.</P>

      <P>I find some of the points <Col N="413" /> raised by the outcome of the vote we have just had regrettable.  It should be noted that this is not the first time that the proposal for a separate Shannon authority was discussed in this House.  The Official Report of 4 June 1986, volume 367, columns 1143-1154, deals with the subject of Shannon navigation.  A number of the then Opposition speakers, but now Government speakers, including the present Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and the present Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Leyden, contributed to the debate.  It is interesting to see what they had to say.  They literally tripped over each other in support of the principle of a statutory Shannon navigation authority which would be representative of all the interest groups, whose point of view we tried to put across this morning.  I want to put it on the record of the House that it is a matter of great regret for me today to watch the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Leyden, walking through the lobbies and voting against the very thing they spoke so passionately about on 4 June 1986.  I ask myself what in God's name has happened to change their minds so utterly in the two or three years since then?</P>

      <P>I wish to put on the record that the Commissioners have done great work in the Ballinasloe area particularly making in the River Suck navigable almost as far as the town of Ballinasloe.  We had been looking for this for a long time and this should bring immense benefits to tourism in Ballinasloe if we can make the river navigable right into the town.</P>
      <P>Many people boat on the Shannon and the Suck but because the boats cannot get right into the town, Ballinasloe has suffered.  I hope the Commissioners will continue with their excellent work.  They have already found many artefacts will be the remains of our heritage in the Suck basin and I hope these artefacts will be put on display.  In fact we envisage work being carried out on a museum for Ballinasloe and we also envisage that work will be carried out on the Aughrim museum to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Battle of Aughrim.  I hope that the treasures from our past will be put on display.</P>
      <P>Now that we are so anxious to preserve our canals &mdash; indeed the Minister has done a great deal of good work himself in promoting the canal system in the eastern region &mdash; I hope the Minister will be favourably disposed to work being carried out on the old canal into Ballinasloe, which is a most historic part of the canal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister has not already visited Ballinasloe I invite him to do so and to see the ruins of that canal which hopefully <Col N="415" /> will be restored and developed by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to contribute to the debate but I came into the House for the vote.  Deputy Connor usually resorts to writing to the papers about many issues affecting his constituency and I want to avail of this unusual opportunity to clarify one or two points in the Dáil.  There was no vote on the setting up of a Shannon authority.  Deputy Connor's amendement &mdash; I believe most of his colleagues would agree with me was ill-conceived and it would have made it very difficult for the Office of Public Works to carry out their functions in relation to the river Shannon. They would end up having to consult everyone and would not be able to get on with their work.  Deputy Connor should have given more consideration to this matter before he put down his amendment. The inclusion of his amendment in the Bill would have a very damaging effect on its implementation.</P>

      <P>The Minister would be ill-advised to be drawn into an argument with me.  I was referring to what the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, said on 4 June 1986 on the establishment of a Shannon basis inter-agency group.  The Minister should read the Official Report of 4 June 1986, volume 367, columns 1143-54, in which he indicated his verbal support &mdash; I accept that there was not a vote &mdash; for the principle of the Shannon authority along the lines I suggested in my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment is not faulty and no arguments have been put forward to show that it is.  The Minister is in a very poor position in coming in here at this stage <Col N="416" /> and saying that the arguments I made were somehow faulty when he did not hear them in the first instance.  I am astounded that both the Minister of State Deputy Leyden, and the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke who literally tripped over each other in their support for that motion in 1986 should say the direct opposite today.  I ask the House and the wider public to judge all the evidence in the Official Report of 4 June 1986, my amendment, and what has been said here today.  The Official Report of the Dáil debates will show everything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 deals with the powers of the Commissioners in relation to Shannon navigation.  They will have the power to:</P>
      <P>dredge, widen, deepen, alter the course of or otherwise repair or improve the navigation channel or improve the supply of water for, or dispose of surplus water from, the navigation channel and for that purpose construct, alter, repair, improve, dredge, widen or deepen any stream, river, drain or channel carrying any water to or from the navigation channel and replace or repair any pipe carrying any such water or construct, repair or improve any pumping station required for such water.</P>
      <P>The section gives very wide powers to the Commissioners to carry out cleaning operations on the Shannon river but Meelick Weir and the section of the river from Athlone to Banagher are very badly affected by silt banks generated by peat silt and other silts carried downstream. The amount of soil lost to the sea every year is astounding.  We lose soil from the land into the rivers which in turn goes into the sea.  The amount of silting which takes place and the solid material lost through the rivers is astounding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The irony is that while the Minister has all these very wide powers he very seldom exercises them in terms of cleaning, clearing and deepening operations which are <Col N="417" /> very necessary.  We all know the old story about the draining of the River Shannon which was probably the longest lie in political history.  It went on for about 50 to 60 years and was trotted out in my part of the country during every general election.</P>
    <P>Much beneficial work could be carried out by the Office of Public Works if they regularly cleaned, deepened and removed silt from the main channel of the river during the summer months.  They could use a long armed machine which can reach far into the river beds to remove obstructions there.  As I said earlier, these obstructions which lie in the bed of the river raise the level of the water which then flows on to the adjoining land. Perhaps the Minister can explain why the Office of Public Works have been so reluctant to carry out this work.  Why have the powers conferred on the Minister under previous legislation been used so sparingly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to reply to the Deputy as he did not give precise details about where this silting occurs.  I am sure there have been problems with silting in various places from time to time.  We are dealing here with the navigation channel and the powers available to the Minister. The advice I have received from my engineering and professional staff is that silt levels do not affect navigation.  Even if this problem does arise, the Minister has powers under the legislation to deal with it and action can be taken very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kitt referred to the desirability of proceeding speedily with the completion of the extension of the navigational system to Ballinasloe.  As the Deputy is aware, considerable work has been carried out already on the lower section of the River Suck which is now navigable.  During my visit to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell area on 8 June I took the opportunity with my engineering staff to look at this work.  The powers contained in section 2 will give us the authority necessary to complete the work on that section of the river into Ballinasloe. I have no doubt that the <Col N="418" /> development and extension of the Shannon navigation into Ballinasloe will make a major contribution to the overall development of the economy of that area.  Our first priority will be to continue the work which is being undertaken at present and to use powers contained in the Bill to complete the extension.</P>
    <P>With regard to the display of artefacts and other valuable items found when the work was being carried out, this is a matter for the National Museum.  I will convey to the museum authorities the Deputy's wishes to have the items of historical and other interest displayed in the Ballinasloe area.  I am sure the museum authorities are aware that the anniversary of the Battle of Aughrim will take place shortly and if community groups in the area wish to make representations about the display of these valuable items in their area I will take the matter up with the museum authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply justifies my reason for putting down amendment No. 2.  He said that silt in the river does not interfere with navigation and his responsibility stops at navigation.  Does this mean that irrespective of the damage caused by silt &mdash; water flowing out on to adjoining land and pollution &mdash; the Minister has no responsibility in that area?  In other words, the only responsibility he and the Office of Public Works have is for navigation and the rest of us can go to hell.  Not alone can silt cause damage to the river bed but it can also damage fish life.  It has been agreed by all experts that peat silt is damaging to fish life.  It is a matter for the Office of Public Works, who are chiefly responsible for the management of the river, to ensure that this silt is removed for all the reasons we mentioned.  However, the Minister seems to be merely interested in ensuring that boats can navigate the canal.  Our amendment is lost and we cannot cry over spilt milk but it certainly highlighted the shortcomings which need to be addressed.</P>

We are not dealing with the overall responsibility for issues of fisheries and drainage, even though they have a bearing on the debate.  I am satisfied that under the statutory responsibility we are taking here, we will have the power to deal effectively with silting if it arises.  I am also satisfied, from my technical and engineering advice, that we do not have a problem in regard to silting in this navigation system.</P>

We are all aware of fish kills and the destruction of natural habitats which can very <Col N="420" /> easily take place.  This amendment reflects what I said in regard to the previous amendment.  The Minister is taking responsibility for fish life, etc., in the canal, but when I raised these points on section 2 he seemed to disclaim responsibility for fish life on the river Shannon or damage to fish by silting.  This amendment deals with matters which affect &mdash; or could affect &mdash; marine or fish life.  The Minister, clearly, has the power to ensure that the law is strong enough to deal with people who cause damage.  When I spoke about silting in the Shannon valley my concern was for fish life and to ensure that silting will not cause pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the amendment because concerns were expressed locally about fish life when the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal is navigable. Seemingly there were suggestions that canals in England &mdash; before they were navigable &mdash; had very good fish stocks and were identified as fishing areas for anglers.  However, when the canals became navigable the fishing stocks were depleted leading to a loss of revenue which was generated by enticing anglers to the canal.  It is very important to ensure that this does not happen in the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal because the area is a major tourism attraction for coarse fishing.  There are approximately 60 lakes within a ten mile radius in the area and the development of the canal is eagerly awaited.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister put down this amendment.  It would be sacrilege to disrupt the fishing stocks in the canal because that, in turn, would affect the stocks in the lakes.  I welcome and support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I did not speak on amendment No. 3 so I am in order now.  The amendment is very welcome and it obviously has the full support of all Members of the House.  However, I should like to ask the Minister whether the Shannon Fisheries Board will be responsible for the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal when it becomes part of the Shannon system or if it will still be the responsibility of the Northern Fisheries Board.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal that the Minister for the Marine should be consulted in regard to any works pertaining to the fish life in the river and fish stocks.  It is important, as part of the project is aimed at using a section of the canal for match fishing.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal flows through a number of lakes and some of them suffered as a result of fish kills.  Thank God, for the past three or four years there has not been a major fish kill in the area but it is important that there are sufficient powers in the legislation to ensure that people responsible for fish kills are hounded, pursued and dealt with by the courts.  This has not been the case in regard to fish kills in other parts of the country where people have been allowed to discharge effluent into rivers.  This has gone on unimpeded while other people in the same area had fishery officers and pollution experts on their doorstep regularly.  This happened in the Northern Fisheries Board area and I hope that the Minister and the Department of the Marine will take direct responsibility instead of handling it over to the various fisheries boards.</P>

      <P>My concern is similar to that of Deputy Ellis.  I welcome the Minister's amendment because fishing will be vitally important on this canal if we hope to attract people to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister taking on responsibility in this area and, if so, does he have the expertise to monitor fish life in the canal and to restock?  Will he delegate this matter to the Ireland Fisheries Board or the Northern Fishery Trust?  He should spell this out.  I do not think agricultural <Col N="422" /> pollution will be a problem in relation to fish life on the lake or canal but pollution from the boats that ply the canal could be a problem, apart altogether from people discarding waste, oil spillage and so on which must be monitored.  If there is a fish kill or fish life seems to be depleted in the canal, to whom do we make our representations?  Who will have ultimate responsibility?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for fisheries conservation and development rests with the regional fisheries boards. In the case of the Shannon the area of responsibility and jurisdiction of the Shannon board is the catchment area of the Shannon.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal is not part of the catchment area of the Shannon.  It would be part of the Erne system which is part of the responsibility of the Northern Fisheries Board.</P>
      <P>Deputies area aware of the demarcation lines in the area of responsibility of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board which is the catchment area of the River Shannon right up to its very source.  Responsibility, control and ownership of the fisheries in the Shannon itself are vested in the ESB who do some conservation work, some development work and some protection work.  They have their own protection staff.  The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board have their own protection staff, the statutory responsibility and responsibility in the overall management and conservation area, and they have their staff in the Northern area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell area we are seeking that we would have consultations with the Marine Minister and the Central Fisheries Authority. We have had very useful co-operation and consultation with the regional fisheries boards and with the Central Fisheries Authority who are the national agency involved in the overall servicing, stocking and management of the national fisheries.  As far as this legislation goes we are quite happy that the same level of goodwill and co-operation as we have always received from the regional fisheries boards in their respective areas &mdash;<Col N="423" /> the ESB have their own powers, authorities and responsibilities &mdash; and the Central Fisheries Authority can continue. Already in regard to the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and the Barrow navigation where in the Canals Act the same type of provision is written in as we are putting in here today, we have had very worthwhile co-operation from the fisheries authorities and we succeeded this year in getting an extra allocation of about £0.5 million to cover a restocking and development scheme.  We plan something similar in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this proposal to link the Shannon with the Erne and the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  For that reason I am opposing section 6 and I want to bring to the attention of the House here my reasons.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have goodwill and co-operation from the landowners in the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell region for this major development.  We must recognise the deep feeling and pride with which the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell drainage district is regarded in that area.  It is a historic drainage district, unique in the country in so far as it is the only drainage district with trustees carrying out the work.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell drainage district trustees exist for the Counties of Cavan, Fermanagh and Leitrim and in particular for an area of those counties bordered by certain rivers and lakes which are set out in an award of 6 March 1860 and later confirmed in the Drainage and Improvement of Land of Ireland Act, 1892 and the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The function and the duties of the trustees were to carry out certain work relating to drainage in the area under their jurisdiction and in return to collect rates or payments for that work from the occupiers of the land over which work was carried out.  This drainage district is unique in that it is a cross-Border drainage district.  When the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 was being drawn up, the legislator at that time saw fit to leave this drainage district intact, in place.  Section 57 of that Act reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  This section applies as on and from the day appointed under section 21 of this Act to every drainage district which would be an existing drainage district for the purposes of this Act but for the fact that it is situate partly within and partly outside the State. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drainage district is partly outside the State and for that reason it is unique. It would be wrong for us here today to do what the legislators in 1945 felt they could not do, that is give recognition to <Col N="425" /> an artificial border that divides our country.  I am advised outside this House that if we were to include section 6 it could be challenged in the courts and found to be unconstitutional under Article 2 of the Constitution.  Rather than give recognition to that Border &mdash; we should be seeking the co-operation of the Fermanagh District Council in operating this drainage district as it was originally set out in 1860.  Rather than give recognition to borders, we should seek to pull them down in the advent of 1992 and the general feeling of goodwill and the removing of borders and barriers right across Europe.  That would be a step in the right direction because this development is a cross-Border development in that we are linking the Shannon with the Erne and the Erne is a Cavan-Fermanagh river.  The development itself is a cross-Border development.  The drainage district was left intact after 1945 because of its unique situation in that it is a cross-Border drainage district, and we should seek the co-operation of the people of Fermanagh in working more closely with us.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the drainage works being carried out by the trustees here are important to the canal development in that many of the drains are feeder drains for the canal.  The Minister's proposal is that this work be handed over to the country councils.  Those of us who are members of local authorities know that the county councils, Cavan County Council and Leitrim County Council in this case, have not got the funds to do drainage works and have dropped them for the last number of years because any moneys they have got have been spent on road development.  That is with the agreement of the local councillors.  It is not something that they wish to do but they have no alternative because of the restriction on finance.  This drainage committee strike and collect a rate and do the work for the farmers and the Council are statutorily bound to reimburse the farmers for the money they have paid to the trustees.  More importantly the work is being carried out by the local people at half of what it would cost the local <Col N="426" /> authority.  The committee ask the farmers to tender for the cleaning of these drains and when work is slack the farmers take on this work which is done properly because farmers tender for work on the drains passing through their own land and they take pride in doing a good job.  This system is unique and the work has continued non-stop from 1860.</P>
    <P>When I became a Member of this House I sought a change in the cumbersome system which required the trustees to collect individually from farmers and hand in the demand notes to the county council.  I suggested that a block grant should be paid to the local authorities for these works.  On the advice of the legal people attached to both Cavan and Leitrim County Councils I was informed that because of the regulations setting up this drainage committee in 1860 and confirmed in 1892, they were statutorily bound to carry out the functions as they were carrying them out, even if they were cumbersome.  That system has remained but I would ask the Minister to favourably consider my amendment to this section.  This system has a cross-Border dimension which should be fostered.  If those works are handed over to the county councils, because of restricted finance they will not be able to do the work, the drains will become overgrown and the flow of water essential to the development of the canal will cease.  The local people will feel angry if the work in this drainage district is taken from them as this system has operated for over 130 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Boylan has said on section 6. During their time the drainage committee have done tremendous work.  The Minister must take into consideration that the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell project was established because of the linking of the Shannon and the Erne waterways.  This is a cross-Border project and the Taoiseach stated in the House on a number of occasions that it was a project dear to his heart and that would be one of the flagships of tourism in the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> It will be remiss of us in this Bill to take away a function which gives cross-Border employment and which involves Leitrim County Council, Fermanagh District Council and Cavan County Council. The more cross-Border co-operation in employment that one can get, the better. For cross-Border co-operation it is very important to leave the drainage committee in place.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister met a deputation of farmers about the Ballinamore canal and concern was expressed that if the land along the canal were not properly drained it would be flooded on a lot of occasions.  Deputy Boylan outlined how the drainage board worked. Because of the work done by the farmers a lot of land in Leitrim which would otherwise be under water for six or eight months of the year, is arable.  The Minister should remember that there are a lot of small farmholdings in that area, that 93 per cent of the land in Leitrim in marginal and that the better land is along the banks of the canal.  It is essential to have good drainage to save the land.</P>
    <P>It is known that in the last number of years the money made available in local authorities for drainage of any of the rivers within the counties has been very little.  The Rinn and Blackwater which are rivers in Leitrim &mdash; and Deputy Ellis can correct me on this &mdash; were allocated something like £5 in last year's estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If £5,000 were made available it would not fund the work needed.  Needless to say, £5,000 was not made available.  If this happens in the context of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal land will be flooded and a project backed by the community will run into difficulty.  The retention of this board will <Col N="428" /> ensure that the land is adequately drained.</P>
      <P>If the Minister agrees to leave the board in place he might take into account that at the moment the bureaucracy involved here is overbearing to say the least.  The money has to be collected and sent into the council and the council in turn have to reimburse farmers.  In these days of cost saving measures this is not a very cost effective way of doing things. As far as this section is concerned, I hope the Minister can understand and accept our reasons for putting down the amendment and that he will give it favourable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>We should ensure that the drainage work necessary to put the drains into a fit condition is carried out.  Both Deputies Boylan and Reynolds have admitted that the drainage board have had insufficient funds from their own resources and from the contribution of the local authorities in the past number of years for carrying out even routine maintenance.  Indeed, no work was carried out over a number of years as the local authorities were not in a position to finance such work.  Reference was made to the question of providing funding to local authorities.  It should be borne in mind that Leitrim County Council set aside a greater amount for drainage works than Cavan County Council.  I admit there is a much longer stretch of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal in County Leitrim than in County Cavan but, proportionately, County Leitrim provided the drainage board with a larger contribution than Cavan County Council. I see Deputy Boylan shaking his head but if he goes back over the records for the past ten years he will see that this was the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Office of Public Works will assess the implications of their proposals.  Having regard to the plans drawn up by the Office of Public Works, in consultation with the ESB, there is no reason we should encounter problems with flooding.  However they should ensure that these drains are in proper condition when they hand over to <Col N="429" /> the local authorities.  The local authorities will find it much cheaper to maintain the drains, if handed over in proper condition, than to continue to provide a subvention towards the cost of works of little or no benefit.  However, it may be necessary to dredge some of the major drains.</P>
    <P>It makes little or no sense to maintain a drainage board which is unable to fulfil its functions due to a lack of resources.  I hope the local authorities will be provided with sufficient funding to maintain these drains once they have been handed over following the completion of the works being carried out.  Indeed, by carrying out adequate drainage works on the canal system we could eliminate the need to pump water into the system at various times in an effort to ensure that the system remains navigable.  I ask the Minister to ensure that these drains are handed over in good condition to the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support my colleagues, Deputies Reynolds and Boylan. I am not very familiar with the position in relation to these drainage trustees. However, I can speak from experience as I was a member of a drainage board, the Lough Gara and Mantua Drainage Board, which became defunct two years ago.  That board were charged with the same responsibility of carrying out maintenance work.  With the passage of time, however, they became redundant not because they did not have enough work to do but rather because they were not given sufficient funds to carry out this work.  Nevertheless, the setting up of this board can be justified in the same way as the setting up of the board of which I was a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drainage board of which I was a member was made redundant when work on channels and rivers under the Boyle arterial drainage scheme was completed and the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, was extended to cover the work done by this drainage board, who were funded by Roscommon County Council.  While I am open to correction I think Roscommon County Council were compensated by the Office of Public Works.  The board <Col N="430" /> worked very efficiently and carried out maintenance work each year on several major channels, including the Breedougue river system.  While the Office of Public Works did some excellent arterial drainage work on the river itself and its tributaries, including deepening, clearing and realigning channels, we now find two years later that maintenance work is required but it seems they are not in a position to carry this work out due to a lack of funding.  If the drainage board had been allowed to continue in being this maintenance work might have been done and done cheaply.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works, given the nature of their work, have many large machines and trundle around the country like a great army moving these great machines to various sites.  Because of this they are not in a position to tackle ordinary jobs such as maintenance work when all that is needed is a shovel, spade or a small hydraulic machine.  Having been a member of a drainage board I can see the wisdom behind the proposal of Deputies Reynolds and Boylan.  The Minister should take on board their sensible suggestion.  While the Office of Public Works are well able to carry out drainage works and construct bridges and so on, they are not very good at responding to requests to carry out maintenance work, such as clearing which can be done using a small machine or by one or two men operating hand-held tools.  The drainage boards were very good at employing men and getting them on site very quickly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan has indicated that people from both sides of the Border, including the counties of Fermanagh and Leitrim, were nominated to the board.  I take it that many of these were ordinary citizens nominated to represent the interests of farmers and anglers.  Public representatives were also nominated by the county councils.  The board provided a very good forum for discussion.  People may well say that a group of county councillors or farmers from across the Border could not talk about anything important but I can assure them that they can.  These <Col N="431" /> ordinary men and women promoted co-operation between people on both sides of the Border on issues such as the economic welfare of the area in which they live which is very much bound up with agriculture.  I take it that many of the people sitting on these boards from counties Fermanagh and Leitrim were nominated to represent the interests of small farmers.  In their discussions they promoted increased understanding between people on both issues of the Border. Quite rightly, we have all referred to the need to promote reconciliation and understanding and have said that part of the problem is that there is a lack of understanding.  However we have done precious little during the years to promote this.  I suggest that much can be done at this level by way of discussion and co-operation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to allow this board continue in existence.  All he need do is allow the Office of Public Works or the people they appoint as agents, such as the ESB, to carry out the main dredging, digging and construction work on the canal with the maintenance work being left to those cross-Border trustees who would be funded by the Office of Public Works.  It should be fairly easy to straighten out this matter and if legislation is needed I am sure that we on this side of the House would facilitate him in putting it through.  I ask the Minister to take on board the suggestion made by my colleagues and allow the Office of Public Works to go ahead and do the work quickly with the maintenance work, such as clearing, being left to the trustees who would be held accountable for the way in which they have spent the money.  It is my experience that trustees spend money very efficiently and are well able to carry out such work speedily and well.  They can respond when the water levels are low and they can get on with the work quickly.  If there is one criticism I would have of the Office of Public Works it would be their trundling, slow manner of working.  I had a particular experience of them in my own constituency where arterial draining works were in progress <Col N="432" /> for a long time.  I notice that every year the water levels began to go down in May and the Office of Public Works like to respond at that time because it is better to be using their excavators and digging out pieces of solid material from the bed of a river rather than when it is in spate or in flood when all that can be done is take out buckets of water, because obstructions cannot be dealt with when rivers are in flood.  The Office of Public Works are fully geared up for their summer work in the month of October. From the month of May onwards they are thinking about it and getting the bits and pieces into place and so on.  On the Boyle drainage scheme extra men were needed this year for bridge building.  Dry, low water levels are needed for bridge building.  The ideal time to start this year was in April when the water levels were never lower following a dry spring.  There was not a hope that it could be organised because although the people in Ballaghaderreen were anxious that this work be got underway there was much to-ing and fro-ing.  They were referring to the officials in St. Stephen's Green who, in turn, were talking to officials in the Department of Finance.  Last week with more than half the summer gone, the weather broke, water levels have risen again and we find that the Office of Public Works are just about applying themselves to the task.  That is what I mean when I talk about this ponderous, slow way but they do excellent work.  This is where a greater level of efficiency could be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Reynolds said earlier, I had the opportunity some weeks ago to meet with some of the people involved, the trustees.  I take this opportunity to thank them for the work they have done there over the past number of years in very complicated and changed circumstances: rates have been abolished, the road system is changed, and much of the mechanism that was appropriate to deal with it at the time has now been overtaken by events.  I looked very carefully at this section because I value the importance of local community <Col N="433" /> involvement in this type of undertaking. I assure Deputy Ellis and the other Deputies who represent the area that we hope to see this work progress as speedily and as effectively as possible.  To a large extent the work which will be undertaken should not have a detrimental effect on the drainage in the area.  This is not a drainage issue but a navigational one. Nevertheless, views have been expressed to the contrary by the Deputies and by Deputy Ellis &mdash; who has spoken to me privately &mdash; and brought a number of people to see me.  We believe that the restoration should not disimprove the drainage.  I will be asking the personnel involved in the restoration project to ensure that as far as possible, to alleviate the drainage problem in the course of the construction, this kind of work might be undertaken.</P>
      <P>The cross-Border element to which Deputy Connor referred has to a large extent disappeared.  Many years ago the functions of the board in relation to Fermanagh were the subject of court proceedings. By and large the situation there is similar to what we are proposing here. The drainage authority for the area takes care of the maintenance and drainage. That system was operating in Counties Leitrim and Cavan.  The section proposes to abolish this complicated system and to directly transfer responsibility for maintenance from the trustees to the local authorities in the area.  They will also have to bear the ultimate cost.  This has always been the case.  I do not think we need all swings and roundabouts to arrive at the objective.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there may be &mdash; this is something which the local Deputies might examine &mdash; some method by which the local authority would avail of the goodwill and co-operation of the farmers in that area.  This would be a matter for the local authorities and the Department of the Environment.  The goodwill of the local people and the local farmers along the canal system is desirable.  Perhaps the local authority would make some voluntary arrangement to avail of the services of the farming community to continue that work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> Having looked at the situation very carefully, and in the light of the representations made and the fact that I met a deputation from the area and discussed it fully with them, I felt at the end of the meeting that they accepted that the neatest, cleanest and most efficient way to proceed was as proposed here, and I recommend that course of action.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is missing an opportunity in relation to the cross-Border dimension of this board to re-establish the contracts, which I accept have lain dormant over the years but which the legislators in 1945 said should be left in place.  Today, 45 years later we come into this House and say we will close that down, a Border divides our country and we must recognise it.  I am certainly not a party to that line of action. Regarding the points made by Deputy Ellis and the contributions from the county councils I should say there was never any problem with Cavan County Council.  I cannot speak for Leitrim County Council but there are representatives here from that area who could explain the position.  The standard of work carried out was second to none.</P>

I have no doubt, and the Minister will be well aware of this, that neither Cavan County Council nor Leitrim County Council will have one penny to spend on drainage.  Those drains will become overgrown.  They are important to the success of the canal so far as they are feeder drains for the people who are deriving their livelihood from the farms drained under the arterial drainage <Col N="435" /> works.  That is a side benefit.  They are concerned about their livelihood and their lands becoming flooded with water. As Deputy Reynolds said the land could be out of use for six to eight months of the year.  Now they can make full use of those holdings and are deriving a livelihood from them.  They would hope to develop their livelihood because of the benefits from the canal by way of tourism and other ideas which they may have. They are an energetic, dynamic, hard working people and should be encouraged. I am making a very strong plea here that this board, in view of the cross-Border dimension and the work which was carried out for the past 130 years, should not suddenly come to an end because the Minister is bringing in the Shannon Navigation Bill.  I plead with the Minister to leave this board intact at this stage of the development of our country.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Article 8 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, there have been discussions within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference on the question of possible harmonisation of areas of the criminal law applying in this State and in Northern Ireland, which might, with benefit, be harmonised.  Harmonisation of the criminal law, of course, raises complex questions requiring detailed consideration and can only be achieved over time.</P>
      <P>One area of the criminal law on which I expect to bring proposals before the House shortly is that relating to malicious damage to property.  A Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department which will reform the law in this area and replace the Malicious Damage Act, 1861.  One effect of the Bill will be that the law applying in the State and in Northern Ireland will be closely aligned and, in this regard account is being taken of discussions on the matter which have been held within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference pursuant to Article 8.</P>

      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that the only area discussed pursuant to Article 8 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is that of malicious damage relating to the Malicious Damage Act, 1861?  If I am not correct in that would the Minister outline for me the various areas that have been studied?  Furthermore would he tell me what further studies have been conducted &mdash; following the review of the workings of the conference in May 1989 &mdash; which indicated that such further studies of areas of criminal law applying in the two jurisdictions would take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not only in relation to the Malicious Damage Act, 1861 there have been discussions.  There have been exchanges within the Anglo-Irish Conference on other areas in which the law applying here and in the North might benefit from being harmonised.  Consideration of those matters is still very much at an early stage.  In the main they focus on areas of criminal law where the statute laws applying in both jurisdictions diverge, such as in relation to theft and other crimes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that that particular article of the Anglo-Irish Agreement be pursued more effectively, that the Minister might devote his time and energy to achieving what is intended under its provisions? Furthermore I might suggest to him that, in making progress in this area, he is limiting his scope for action by his continual refusal to establish a criminal law reform commission in our jurisdiction; that, until that is done, either from the point of view of updating our antiquated criminal laws or implementing the letter and spirit of that article of the agreement no progress of any consequence will be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's views in relation to the establishment of that commission.  That is a matter for another day.  Harmonisation of criminal law generally raises complex questions which will require detailed consideration <Col N="438" /> and will be achieved only over time.  It should also be remembered that here, and equally in Britain, priorities must be established for new legislation which take account of the urgency attaching to particular measures and the resources available to undertake such work.  There is no point in undertaking an ambitious programme of law reform directed exclusively to harmonisation of the criminal law applying here and in Northern Ireland if the only benefit to be obtained is harmonisation of the law itself.  This is particularly the case if such a programme is to mean, as it must, the postponement of the preparation of other legislation. Having said that I would also stress that the question of harmonisation of criminal laws here and in Northern Ireland, in areas where a real need for such harmonisation is identified, will continue to be examined.  In the context of a general law reform programme the Deputy should note that there have been 18 Justice Bills enacted since March 1987 and there are four other Justice Bills currently before the Oireachtas.  Therefore it will be seen that in the area of law reform generally, the Department have been very active, as have my predecessor and I, in relation to law reform generally.</P>

      <P>The Government have always accepted the need for effective procedures for dealing with fugitive offenders.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement, of course, provides a framework within which the continuing effectiveness of existing procedures for dealing with such offenders, whether by way of extradition or extra-territorial trial, can be monitored and kept under review.  The House will be aware that, at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London on 19 April, officials were instructed to undertake a review of the situation pertaining to arrangements for dealing with fugitive offenders, addressing both extradition and the possibilities afforded by the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976, and to report back to a future meeting of the conference. That review is now in progress.</P>

      <P>The courts have ruled in relation to some of these aspects.  I am not a lawyer.  I do not pretend to be a lawyer.  As far as I am concerned, my role <Col N="440" /> is to bring forward appropriate amending legislation &mdash; if that is so decided by court decision or as a result of reviews &mdash; and that is where the position stands.  It is not a question of my personal view; that is irrelevant in this matter.  It is a matter of whether the Government and the courts of the land decide or make judgments in relation to legislation already enacted by this House; whether they decide it is sufficient or insufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the evasive response of the Minister to that direct question which is central to the entire issue.  The Minister has stated that the Government fully agreed on the need for effective procedures for extradition.  He has no option but to accept that because it is included in the review of the workings of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  Would the Minister now accept that there are obvious gaping loopholes in our extradition laws arising from recent Supreme Court decisions?  If the Minister really believes the need for effective extradition arrangements will he confirm that he will introduce the necessary amending legislation to close those gaping loopholes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is legislation which has been enacted by this House which has never yet been tested in the courts. We will await the outcome of any such test case in the courts.  It is strange to suggest that one should introduce legislation and then, prior to it ever being tested in the courts, come into the House and suggest that it should be changed. There is a review going on in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The legislation in relation to extradition is on the Statute Book.  There are also the extra-territorial trial procedures in the 1976 Act.  There is a wide body of legislation available in relation to extradition.  In case there is any misunderstanding about the situation, and as the Deputy is trying to suggest that the Government are less than sincere on this issue, I would reiterate that we have always accepted the need for effective procedures when dealing with fugitive offenders.  That is the Government's view and it is my view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy, but in view of the financial circumstances in An Post and the historical importance of the GPO, the Government decided that this necessary restoration work should be funded partly from the national lottery.  Part of the building has been dangerous; there have been a number of incidents where portions of the stone fell although, thankfully, nobody was injured.  It is important that the building be restored as soon as possible. It was with that in mind that the Government decided to allocate the £1 million of lottery funds.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that, in view of the fact that the property is in direct ownership of the State, although on loan to An Post, the case can be made for the State to take on the full cost of the restoration, with An Post having no part in it?</P>

      <P>It is the legal responsibility of An Post to maintain their property. As I have outlined already on a number of occasions, in view of the historic importance of the building, the Government decided to allocate £1 million, but no decision has been made in relation to the balance of the required sum.  That is a matter for the future but let us undertake the work that has to be done at present.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the intervention took place at too late a stage entirely?  Would he consider reviewing the matter on the basis that An Post own many significant buildings not just in the city but provincially? Can the Minister confirm that the restoration of the portico section will involve opening up access to the building through the portico, which would substantially re-enhance that area of the building which at present does not seem to serve its purpose?</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to a similar question on 13 December 1989, columns 1319 to 1321, volume No. 394, No. 5 of the Official Report for that day.</P>
      <P>The total amount outstanding is now estimated to be £504, 735.  At this stage 17 licensees are in arrears.  Most of the money outstanding is the subject of agreements with the individual companies concerned and there is no reason to believe that this part of the arrears will not be paid over the next few years.</P>
      <P>Legal action has commenced recently against one licensee and my Department's experience in this case will determine tactics in the future against recalcitrant payers.  My Department will continue to collect outstanding amounts through routine follow-up of individual cases, legal action, refusal to consider applications for consent to increase charges unless outstanding licence fees are addressed in a satisfactory way, and refusal to consent to the transfer of licences unless my Department are also satisfied with regard to outstanding licences fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The law in relation to this matter was changed under the 1987 Act. I can assure the Deputy that as far as the general collection of fees is concerned, the future looks far brighter than the past.  Since April of this year we have collected about £150,000.  Arrangements and agreements have been reached with the companies around the country and the money is coming in.  Proposals have been made for amalgamations and buyouts of a number of the smaller companies who owed money and it is in that context that we are getting in some of the money that has been owed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister may not want to tread on very sensitive ground in terms of the whole area of funding but could he explain his suggestion that over the next few years he hopes to secure the arrears.  Given the transfer to MMDS, why will it take years rather than months to collect this badlyneeded revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the sums owed by a couple of the companies are quite large and it would mean closure for them if they had to pay up immediately.  There is nothing to be gained by that as far as <Col N="449" /> service to the consumers is concerned.  I would prefer a longer-term agreement and a guarantee that the money will be paid.  There has been a phased payment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that there are large sums due from particular companies.  Would he agree that that seems to suggest there is some laxity in the method of collection, and can he indicate whether that matter has been considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The position has been improved.  There were problems in relation to threatened court cases from some of the companies who felt that pirate stations who were operating within their licensed areas should be put off the air.  These threats of court cases against the Government were made in 1986 and early 1987.  I felt the best way forward was to arrange for long term agreement whereby there would be phased payments over a certain number of years, while at the same time guaranteeing continuity of service for the consumers which is most important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the recently appointed RTE Authority has been stacked with members and supporters of Fianna Fáil, sprinkled with one or two Progressive Democrats' supporters, and that the IRTC are equally well endowed with Fianna Fáil supporters, though the practice of appointing party hacks to these important bodies is not one that is confined to the present Government, would the Minister agree that the public have lost confidence in the political impartiality of these bodies and that the time has come to establish a more independent method of the appointment of members to the RTE Authority and the IRTC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally reject the phrase &ldquo;party hacks&rdquo;.  Because somebody happens to have a political viewpoint, whether they be supporters of Fine Gael, Labour or The Workers' Party, that should not debar them from membership of any organisation. It shows they are involved in their community and are prepared to work.  That is not to suggest that the recently appointed RTE Authority or the Independent Radio and Television Commission comprise people with strong political views.  On the contrary, I am very pleased with the warmth of the welcome outlined in the staff association magazine in RTE to the appointment of the chairman of the RTE Authority recently.  I do not want to give individual names.  I totally reject the suggestion that the RTE Authority and the IRTC have lost the confidence of the people.  It has been generally accepted that the IRTC, under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court Justice Henchy, have been totally transparent in the operation of their mandate at the public hearings into each of the applications for the national licence and the county licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> They have been seen to be doing an excellent job under the mandate given by these Houses.  As regards the remaining members of the RTE Authority, the Government very much appreciate that people are prepared to take on the onerous task of serving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that membership of or support for a political party does not debar one from serving on a public body or being employed by a public body.  Could the Minister explain the remarkable coincidence with regard to the composition of the most recently appointed RTE Authority?  It is made up of a close relative of two Fianna Fáil politicians, a Fianna Fáil councillor from Cork, a further member who says he has always been a supporter of Fianna Fáil and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appeal to Deputies to avoid references to persons outside the House, in such a manner that they may be identifiable.  It is a convention of this House that we do not do so, for the obvious reason that this is a privileged assembly and we ought not to reflect on persons outside the House who have no proper recourse to suitable action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to establish the criteria used by the Minister in deciding the membership of the RTE Authority, in view of the fact that seven of the nine recently appointed members of the Authority are either members of the Fianna Fáil Party or known supporters of the present Government.  Can the Minister explain what criteria he uses in deciding the membership of the Authority or of the IRTC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As they perform their tasks publicly, they are subject to examination in relation to such performance.  The Government appreciate that people are prepared to serve on such high profile authorities as the RTE Authority and the IRTC, in view of the fact that they <Col N="452" /> recognise that they will be subject to political sniping.  They are prepared to put their names forward and to serve on behalf of the nation.  I have no doubt that they are men and women of the highest integrity who will perform their duties in the best interests of the organisation they serve and the country generally.  That has been the tradition of the members of State boards and I see no reason why that system, which has served the country so well through the years, should be changed.  I should be interested to see a list of the industrial branch of some of the parties in this House and see if they are prepared to put their names in front of the public in the same way as the members of these authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a totally separate question.

      <P>I do not understand why the Minister should respond in this very curt fashion.  This is part and parcel <Col N="453" /> of the problem which the Minister has with the passage of the Broadcasting Bill. This type of reply which we have been getting for two years has not helped to create a proper atmosphere in which to discuss communications.  I regret that the Minister will not give consideration to the performance of the commission.  There is ample evidence of incompetence within the commission, since they have in their possession many applications which have been with them since 1988 from community broadcasting organisation, yet they have not addressed them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The day-to-day work of the commission is a matter for them and if the Deputy has any complaint about their approach to community radio he should contact the commission itself.

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's side swipe after my last supplementary it would appear that I struck a raw Ministerial nerve.  Would it not be a better way of appointing the RTE Authority to have the members drawn from nominating bodies whose political impartiality could not be questioned or at at minimum that the appointment of the members of the RTE Authority and the IRTC, in view of the central role in communications, should be brought before this House for approval?  Would he not consider that as a minimum measure to lift the cloud of public concern that exists over the political partiality of the appointments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion of lack of impartiality.  We have been served very well by members of the public <Col N="454" /> who have allowed their names to go forward to serve on State boards since the foundation of the State, and we have no reason to think that the present membership of the RTE Authority or IRTC will change that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question and that of Deputy Byrne is to establish from the Minister the basis on which these deductions are made and the reasons for them? We are motivated by our concern for the <Col N="457" /> way moneys are being deducted from the remit of RTE's licence fee.  Would the Minister indicate the general heads under which this money is spent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The general head is related to An Post, who are doing an excellent job in the collection of the licence fee. They have, for example, exceeded their television licence sales target for the past four years and have introduced computerisation of the collection system on an extensive basis.  They have compiled and keep up-to-date a complete country-wide householders' file on computer and they have increased the number of officials on detection work.  They have done such an excellent job that in my view they should be left with the collection system for which they receive commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>While An Post are doing an excellent job in installing equipment and employing the officials, will the Minister confirm that, in fact, the expansion in equipment and employment comes from the percentage take of the licence fee as collected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>An Post get a percentage of the licence fee, but they have done an excellent job.  In the past four years, and in the past three years, in particular, they have dramatically increased their collection system to the satisfaction of RTE. They have surpassed their targets in the past couple of years.  The computers are their own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two parts to my question.  First, in view of the hardship involved for those living on social welfare to pay the licence fee, can the Minister make any arrangements to have a licence for less than a year, for example, a quarterly licence fee?  Second, in view <Col N="458" /> of the new importance of the licence fee revenue for RTE, if the capping arrangements go ahead, have any other steps been put forward to enhance the collection of the licence fee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last part of the Deputy's question first.  An Post are continually striving to increase the amount of licence fees collected, and I have no doubt they will continue that in the future.  However, the first part of the Deputy's question seems to me to be a separate question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>I agree that this matter needs to be looked at.  It involves complex issues which need very careful and detailed study and I am having the matter examined in my Department to see what changes in the law should be made.  I can assure the House that as soon as this examination is completed I will seek Government approval to the introduction of whatever amending legislation seems necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as there are a number of cases still pending before the courts in this area I would prefer not to make any <Col N="459" /> detailed comments in the matter at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to be a little more specific?  He has said he realises there is serious concern about the difficulties with the law in this area. Will the Minister allay the fears of people in certain quarters regarding the uncertainty in the law and will he affirm that he will introduce legislation in this regard as quickly as possible?  Can I further ask the Minister to accept that the whole concept of a special verdict may be open to abuse in so far as it may be used as a device or a ploy by certain people charged with and perhaps convicted of offences and that there has been a considerable departure from the long standing tradition of the criminal defence of insanity since first formulated in the middle of the last century?  May I ask the Minister to accept that the strict rules of court, entitled the M'Naghten Rules, have long since been departed from by the courts and this is giving rise to some uncertainty? May I ask the Minister to commit himself to addressing that problem as well as addressing himself to the fundamental uncertainty arising from section 2 (2) of the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883, which states that a person convicted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Deputy not to put too many supplementary questions to the Minister. The Chair dissuades Members from putting supplementary questions in omnibus form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister outline his function as far as section 2 (2) of that Act is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concerns about the question of early releases etc. and I am having this matter examined.  However, I do not think I should comment on the matter beyond that while there are cases still pending before the courts.  The question of the issues to be addressed in legislation may <Col N="460" /> seem clearcut, but the drafting of legislation in this area is complex and it needs to be very carefully done.  I think the Deputy will accept that.</P>
      <P>In relation to the M'Naghten Rules, the rules governing the defence of insanity, may perhaps need to be reformulated and provision made for other possible defences such as diminished responsibility.  The Supreme Court have not yet decided whether the release of persons found guilty but insane should properly be a matter for the Government or the courts.  In the recent Ellis case, the Supreme Court made it clear that their decision in that case was based on the facts particular to it, was not of general application, and that this issue would have to be resolved before legislation was contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this issue was debated in the United Kingdom over 30 years ago, that the defence of criminal insanity was abolished and was replaced, under the UK Homicide Act, 1975, with the provision whereby a person could be found to be suffering from diminished responsibility? Does the Minister regard this as a suitable precedent which we should study from the point of view of implementing a similar provision in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The defence of diminished responsibility was provided for in England by the Homicide Act, 1957.  In so far as murder cases are concerned, it has led to the virtual demise of the insanity plea.  The possibility of introducing such a defence in this country is under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that whatever amending legislation is introduced &mdash; I hope amending legislation will be introduced &mdash; cannot in any way affect the cases which have already been dealt with by way of verdict from the Central Criminal Court and that those cases will be dealt with under existing laws?  Will the Minister confirm that <Col N="461" /> whatever amending legislation is introduced will have no retroactive effect in this area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not seeking in any way to comment on cases which are pending but I urge the Minister to amend the law on which, I think, Queen Victoria had a direct influence.  Inconsistencies have existed in this law since 1883.  I ask the Minister to look, in particular, at the potential danger these people can cause to themselves or the community whether they are found not to be insane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously such issues will have to be taken into account in any proposed changes to the legislation.  The Supreme Court made it clear that their decision in the case to which I have already referred was based on the facts particular to it and were not of general application and that this issue would have to be resolved before legislation was contemplated. We have got a particular but not a general ruling from the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if the defence of criminal insanity can apply to sentences imposed under the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1990, which is presently being debated in the Seanad? In other words, will the sentence of 40 years apply to a person who is insane for the murder of a garda or prison officer?</P>

      <Quest>if he has had or will initiate discussions with the Ministers of Justice or Foreign Affairs of other European countries in order to determine the help the Irish Government can give to bring to justice members of the IRA and to prevent that organisation from committing further atrocities such as the shooting of Australian civilians and members of the British Army and their families.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very close practical co-operation between the police forces of the member states of the European Community to counter international terrorism and the Garda play their full part in this co-operation.  For obvious reasons I cannot go into detail on this subject but I can inform the House that, whenever an IRA attack is made on the Continent, there is, almost invariably, contact between the Garda and their counterparts in the country concerned.</P>
      <P>Under the Chairmanship the TREVI Group of Ministers for Justice and of the Interior of the Community met in Dublin on 14 and 15 June and received an updated analysis of the threat posed by terrorism to the Community, which included an analysis of the threat posed by the Provisional IRA.  We also reviewed existing police co-operation among the Twelve to combat terrorism and organised crime, and approved a programme of action containing specific measures designed to reinforce and enhance that co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a much travelled question.  It started off life in the Department of the Taoiseach, was transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and has ended up in the Department of Justice.  Does the Minister think there is any other action the Government could take in this area in view of the fact that it is very much in our interests that these people who purport to act in our name are brought to justice and are not allowed to continue with atrocities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the people who commit these crimes in the name of the Irish people across Europe are brought to justice.  We are continually in contact through TREVI with various police forces and I can assure the Deputy that the Department and the Garda co-operate to the fullest extent with other member states of the Community and the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested after last week's Summit that consideration should <Col N="464" /> be given to the setting up of a trans-European FBI-type force to deal with such crimes.  May I ask the Minister if he would consider seconding units of the Garda Síochána which have a particular knowledge of the psychology and operation methods of the Provisional IRA to police forces in other European countries, for example, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the Deputy referred to the Netherlands because we had an immediate response from the Dutch police who expressed their appreciation of the co-operation they were getting from the Garda in relation to recent incidents which have taken place.  There is no proposal before us at present for the establishment of a European FBI-type force.  The TREVI group of Ministers of Justice and of the Interior of the Community are moving towards closer co-operation in all fields. This is an ongoing process.  Consideration is also being given to the establishment of a drugs intelligence unit and other intelligence units so that there will be closer co-operation between police forces throughout Europe.  There is always room for improvement but I can assure the Deputy that liaison is very strong and everything which can be done is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the reaction of the Netherlands police force is typical of the reaction of all police forces and that co-operation is being given in a very fulsome way by the Garda Síochána in trying to ensure that these people are brought to justice, but the Minister did not respond to my question Obviously he will have to get advice on whether it would be helpful to second garda who have a knowledge of the IRA and their psychology to other police forces so that further crimes can be prevented and those who commit them can be brought to justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of transnational co-operation and the role extradition plays in the matter, does the Minister not agree that the suggestion that other countries do not extradite their nationals on request is no argument for suggesting that this country should not engage in such practices considering that we have the most difficult problems of any European country.  This is a consideration which should not be brought into play in the discussion on co-operation.</P>

Although it is unlikely that anything like this number would actually apply for transfers to Irish prisons, were the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons to be ratified by this country, the consequences of even a relatively small increase in the level of the prison population here could be serious, given that there is already pressure on our existing prison accommodation. This is among the issues which must be addressed in considering the practical and legislative measures which may be necessary to enable ratification of the convention to take place.  As I stated in reply to a question on 27 June 1990, the matter is under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is designed to establish the extent to which this matter is under consideration.  To what extent has the Minister researched the background and implications of the convention which Ireland signed in 1986 but has been reluctant to ratify?  Does the Minister agree with the views of a group working in this area that, in the first instance, it might involve something in the order of &ldquo;20 prisoners in the first year&rdquo; and &ldquo;no more than a handful&rdquo;&mdash; to quote the organisation &mdash; in any year thereafter?  Will he comment in that regard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the group's report to which the Deputy refers but they do not give any background to the <Col N="467" /> assessment of the 20 prisoners or the handful in other years to whom they referred.  The Department are considering ratification of the convention and are trying to come to grips with the suggestion the Deputy made in relation to doing a survey of the prisoners who are anxious to come here to serve the remainder of their sentence.</P>

      <P>May I take it from the Minister's reply that he is actively surveying the numbers involved?  Perhaps they might be disposed to playing football for us but I doubt if they want to spend time in our prisons.  Is a survey being undertaken and how long will it be before the Minister can make a decision on this convention?</P>

I would prefer to leave it the way it is at present.  Perhaps if a prisoner, the prison authorities and ourselves were in agreement some prisoners could come home but such a course would be misleading. It would probably give credence to the group's suggestion of 20 prisoners or a handful but I would prefer not to do it that way.</P>

Will the Minister reassure the House that he is committed to major reform of the system to eliminate the manner in which the legal profession have run a coach-and-four through the provisions of the Courts Act, 1988, which set out to protect the consumer and to reduce costs?  Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that the festering sore in society regarding complaints against the legal profession &mdash; where they monitor their own performance and behaviour &mdash; will be firmly dealt with by him?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, are sufficient to enable the courts to provide <Col N="472" /> protection to spouses and their children from violence or threats of violence by the other spouse.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a number of suggestions for change in the law in this area, which were aired by the Law Reform Commission in a consultation paper on child sexual abuse published in August 1989. These include proposals that would permit a health board to apply for a barring order in protection of a child and that would permit a barring order to be made against any member of the child's household.  When the commission produce their final report, I will give careful consideration to any recommendations they may make involving changes in barring order law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the reply, having regard to the urgency of the problem.  As the courts over the past eight years have interpreted the circumstances under which a barring order could be granted, would the Minister accept that the rules as applied by the courts are a little stringent and that consideration might be given to the concept of a protection order, something I believe was abandoned by the present Government rather suddenly last year?  Would the Minister see any merit in having this concept?  Would he see further merit in broadening the category of those persons entitled to apply for a barring order, having regard to the fact that at present we are dealing with the spouses?  Would the Minister not consider allowing people apply for barring orders who may be cohabiting with each other?  Would he not regard as desirable the protection of children who may be under threat of physical violence from people other than their parents living on a premises at a given time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the powers of the courts generally, the courts have sufficient powers to provide protection for spouses and their children from violence and threats of violence.  It is a matter for the courts themselves to determine how these powers should be exercised in <Col N="473" /> each individual case that comes before them.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 1987 Bill published by the then Minister of State with responsibility for Women's Affairs, Deputy Fennell, this Bill when published was welcomed but opposition to it grew and a number of the agencies working in the area of family violence gradually formed a view that the Bill might leave victims worse rather than better protected. For example Womens Aid and the AIM group eventually came to the same view and I was swayed by their argument in relation to the reintroduction of that 1987 Bill.  That is why it is not back in the Government programme for legislation.</P>
      <P>I recognise that violence by a non-spouse is a problem and I accept the view expressed by the Deputy that there is a need for improvement in that area.  I am hoping for an early response from the Law Reform Commission so that we can proceed with legislation in this area.  I assure the Deputy it is not a delaying tactic.  I am anxious to proceed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In the context of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, having declared Ireland's Presidency of the EC to be a Green Presidency, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to bring before the House this Bill, the Sea Pollution Bill.</P>
      <P>The Environment Action Programme includes a commitment to terminate indiscriminate disposal of ships' waste in the marine environment; this Bill endorses that commitment by addressing the problems relating to protection of the marine environment from pollution by ships.  I look forward to constructive and thorough consideration of the Bill. Initially, I propose to give a short background to the Bill.  The Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956, gave effect to the first multilateral instrument on protection of the marine environment, namely the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954.  The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Act, 1965, gave effect to certain amendments to the 1954 convention. The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Act, 1977, gave effect to further amendments to the 1954 Convention and to the International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969.</P>
      <P>Ireland attended the Diplomatic Conference held by the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation &mdash; IMCO, subsequently re-named International Maritime Organisation, IMO &mdash; which adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 and signed the convention, subject to ratification, in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> The Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Marine Pollution by Substances other than Oil, 1973, was adopted at the same conference. Thereby, it was hoped that the objective of complete elimination of intentional pollution of the marine environment by oil and other harmful substances and the minimisation of accidental discharges of such substances would be achieved.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;MARPOL 73/78&rdquo; emerged following the adoption of a protocol of 1978 which made minor modifications to the 1973 Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Sea Pollution Bill, 1990, is to up-date existing legislation on the prevention of pollution from ships and on intervention with ships following upon a maritime casualty, as enshrined in our Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977.  These Acts govern pollution by oil but we all know that as the world becomes more industrialised more dangerous substances being transported by sea are polluting the marine environment.  Our legislation must also take cognisance of current trends in the shipping industry, namely, the dramatic increase in the size of ships, in particular of oil tankers; the &ldquo;lame ducks&rdquo; in an ageing world fleet; the emergence of offshore registries and Third World low-cost crews; the reduction in manning levels due to modern technology and performance pressures from shipowners or managers.  Ireland's geographical location on the periphery of Europe with the Atlantic Ocean lying to the west, south-west and south and at the apex of one of the busiest ocean-trading routes in the world leaves her vulnerable to maritime casualties.  We must also remember that it is our relatively unpolluted waters that attract foreign tourists to this country.  We must endeavour to avoid casualties occuring in our territorial waters; the resulting pollution of our waters and blight of our shore environment with wrecks must be avoided.</P>
    <P>In order to prevent or control pollution that may be caused by ships the State's powers need to be strengthened.  The international treaty, commonly known as <Col N="510" /> MARPOL 73/78, considered to be the most ambitious international treaty covering marine pollution ever adopted and the international treaties on intervention on the high seas give the scope to do so.  We are indebted to the International Maritime Organisation for the adoption of the treaties in question.  The IMO is a specialised agency of the United Nations, wholly dedicated to maritime affairs and with the twin goals of cleaner oceans and safer seas.</P>
    <P>The question Deputies may wish to ask is, &ldquo;Why the need to become party to further international treaties?&rdquo; The answers are simple.  The conventions, protocols and resolutions of the IMO reflect the concerns and interests of over 130 states; the IMO is the international body which has developed the &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo; as it were, for the high seas and commands the respect and recognition to press for universal acceptance of these rules.  Ireland needs the support of such an organisation in its endeavours to protect its marine environment from pollution from ships and the disposal of ships' wastes at sea.</P>
    <P>The main objective of MARPOL 73/78 is to reduce to a minimum, and in certain instances prohibit, the operational discharge of marine pollutants from ships, through the establishment of operational discharge criteria and procedures, and construction and equipment standards. Provision is made for a regime whereby violations of the international rules and standards are prohibited and punished with sufficient severity to discourage future violations.</P>
    <P>The convention itself comprises five annexes which are, effectively, the regulations laid down for the prevention of pollution by oil; by noxious liquid substances in bulk; by harmful substances carried by sea in packaged forms or in freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons; by sewage from ships and garbage from ships.</P>
    <P>Each annex deals exclusively with all aspects of its subject pollutant such as vessel construction and equipment, survey, certification, discharge control <Col N="511" /> and reception facilities to be provided at ports for disposal of waste.</P>
    <P>All countries which become party to MARPOL 73/78 must adopt Annexes 1 and 2 relating to oil and noxious liquid substances in bulk, respectively; Annexes 3, 4 and 5-relating to harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and garbage are optional.  Acceptance of Annexes 1 and 2 is obligatory because of the more deleterious effects of oil and noxious liquid substances.  Liability and compensation for pollution damage caused by discharges of persistent oil from a ship carrying oil in bulk as cargo, or discharges from its bunkers, are covered by the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988.  We are adopting all five.</P>
    <P>The Intervention treaties provide that, following a maritime casualty, contracting parties may take such measures on the high seas as may be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to their coastline or related interests from pollution, or threat of pollution, by oil and other substances which are liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities, or to interefere with other legitimate uses of the sea.</P>
    <P>MARPOL 73/78, its Annexes, 1 oil, 2 noxious liquid substances, and 5 garbage from ships, and the Intervention Convention and Protocol are in force internationally. Annexes, 3 harmful substances in packaged forms and 4 sewage from ships which are optional, will not come into force internationally until they have been ratified or acceded to by countries representing over 50 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant shipping fleet.  Current ratification or accession to these two instruments stands at approximately 48 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, for world shipping tonnage.</P>
    <P>The principal provisions of the Bill are as follows: section 10 enables the Minister to prohibit or regulate the operational discharge of oil, oily mixtures, <Col N="512" /> noxious liquid substances carried in bulk &mdash; for example hazardous chemicals &mdash; harmful substances carried in packaged forms, sewage or garbage from Irish-registered ships anywhere at sea and from other ships whilst in the territorial waters of the State.  The Minister may apply similar controls to other substances prescribed by him as being harmful, if introduced into the marine environment and he may require the owner or master of a ship to notify him of the intention to load or unload any of these substances in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 12 enables the Minister to require harbours in the State to have adequate facilities for the discharge or disposal of ships' waste.  Harbours may make reasonable charges and impose reasonable conditions for use of the facilities provided.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 and 15 enable the Minister to require an Irish registered ship to be constructed, fitted or operated in such a way as to prevent, control or reduce discharges into the sea and to keep such records of discharges of harmful substances as he prescribes.  Such records would relate to operations on board ship in respect of any substance, discharges made to secure the safety of the ship or to save life or discharges in excess of the quantity, if any, permitted.</P>
    <P>Section 17 enables the Minister to have surveyors of ships, or inspectors appointed by him under warrant, to carry out surveys, inspections and tests to ensure compliance with MARPOL standards laid down by him for ships, their equipment and fittings.  He may also cause to be issued in respect of a ship a certificate of compliance with requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 23 permits a harbour master to refuse entry into a harbour if he believes a ship not to be in compliance with certificate requirements or to be a serious threat to the environment, the harbour or other ships.  This section also enables the Minister to require the owners or masters of all ships, or any classes of ship, to give notice of entry or intended entry into Irish territorial waters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> Section 26 permits the Minister, following upon a maritime casualty, to take such measures as he considers necessary, to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to the coastline or related interests for example, fisheries activities or tourist attractions, from pollution or a threat of pollution.  The Minister is entitled to recover expenses incurred in such intervention from the owner of the ship.</P>
    <P>Section 29 lays down the penalties for breach of the requirements of the Bill, when enacted, or any regulations made thereunder.  Penalties range from a maximum of £1,000 or imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both, on summary conviction and a maximum of £10 million or imprisonment up to five years, or both, on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>Parts II and III of the Bill which deal with prevention of pollution and enforcement are fundamentally the framework within which regulations to give effect to the five MARPOL Annexes will be effected.</P>
    <P>Parts I and IV deal with the more standard provisions of a Bill.  Section 4 of Part I provides for the exemption of warships from the scope of the Act.  This is in keeping with both the MARPOL and Intervention Conventions and our own Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956.  Foreign naval vessels are entitled under international law to transit the territorial waters of another state in exercise of a right of innocent passage.  Specific authorisation to exercised this right or to give notification that it has been exercised is not necessary.  However, where a foreign naval vessel wishes to visit an Irish port the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is necessary before the visit can take place.  Permission is normally granted provided the visit does not form part of a naval exercise and nuclear weapons are not being carried.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous increase in environmental awareness and concern for the environment over the past few years, particularly among the yonger generation.  In the marine area attention is being focused on the threat to the <Col N="514" /> environment and to fish stocks and mammals of pollution from ships in the form of oil discharges and persistent forms of garbage, in particular plastics, including synthetic ropes and fishing nets and refuse bags.  These pollutants are offensive from an aesthetic point of view as they come ashore with the tide and spoil beaches and beauty spots on the coastline. They are also offensive from an economic point of view in that they affect local fishing and aquaculture industries as well as tourism, water-based leisure activities and public amenities generally.</P>
    <P>Marine environmental awareness was heightened this year with the launch of the Government's Environment Action Programme and the commitment to require harbour authorities to install facilities for receiving ships' waste and thus enable Ireland to become a party to the MARPOL Convention.  Facilities must be adequate to meet the needs of the ships using them without causing undue delay.  The issue of a poster by the Department of the Marine in conjunction with the Wildlife Service at the end of 1989 to schools as well as to shipping and fisheries interests and which illustrated the cruel, harmful and oftentimes fatal effects of plastics on fish and marine mammals further highlighted the hazards of ships' waste.</P>
    <P>I have a copy of that poster, which has proved very effective, with me and I will just show it to the House.  It is a good quality poster and contains four illustrations of the damage done by waste in the sea.  The picture in the top left hand corner is of a discarded net and the caption reads &ldquo;This discarded net has finished fishing, but it hasn't finished killing&rdquo;.  The picture in the top right hand corner of beach detritus also illustrates how noisome and filthy the kind of stuff being thrown on beaches is.  The picture in the bottom left hand corner &mdash; this is a common one &mdash; illustrates plastic strangling a fish.  In this instance it is the plastic rings which attach to six packs. We can see that it does damage in a way one would never suspect.  The picture in the bottom right hand corner illustrates plastic being eaten as it resembles natural <Col N="515" /> food in water.  Of course this kills the fish. The reaction we got was very good and indicates that it helped the campaign with regard to the control of waste and pollutants generally.  It is not surprising, therefore, that MARPOL has come to be associated with garbage from ships and that the younger generation speak quite knowledgeably of Annex 5 which relates to the prevention of pollution from garbage.</P>
    <P>MARPOL strictly prohibits the disposal of plastics at sea; they must be deposited in receptacled at port.  As the House is aware, plastics are non-biodegradable; once thrown into the sea they are extremely persistent and potentially harmful if ingested by seabirds and marine mammals.  They also cause fish to choke when they eat them.  In framing regulations under the Sea Pollution Bill, 1990 to cover Annex 5 the disposal of plastics at sea will be prohibited.  Stringent conditions will apply to the discharge and ultimate disposal of other wastes from ships, in particular food waste.  The ultimate disposal of discharged waste must be undertaken with regard to wider concerns.  In disposing of oily residues every effort will be made to ensure recycling and the disposal of food waste or &ldquo;swill&rdquo; must take place within the requirements of the animal diseases regulations of the Department of Agriculture. In compliance with the Environment Action Programme and in anticipation of the passage of the new legislation commercial and fishery harbours have been asked to provide, as I have mentioned, reception facilities to meet the demands of ship and fishing vessel operators coming into port.  Consultations with Irish shipping interests are also ongoing with a view to ascertaining their requirements.</P>
    <P>There are other very important benefits accruing from passage of the Sea Pollution Bill, 1990.  At the top of the list must be the State's enhanced powers to deal with offending foreign ships coming into its territorial waters.  Masters of ships which are not constructed, equipped or operated to MARPOL standards will not <Col N="516" /> be anxious to risk inspection, detention and penalty for unseaworthiness or deficiencies.  This could have the effect of reducing the number of damaged vessels seeking refuge in ports off our south-west and north-west coasts.</P>
    <P>I should at this stage make it clear that the Bill before the House does not cut across my Department's policy in search and rescue.  Safety of life at sea still remains paramount and it may be necessary at times to admit troubled ships into territorial waters or harbours for the purpose of saving life.  Section 11 of the Bill permits discharge into the sea of harmful substances where it is necessary for the purpose of saving life at sea.  However, a record must be kept of such a discharge. The House will recall the trouble with the <i>Tribulus</i> earlier this year and, if I may say so, my Department handled that matter very well as did Shell, who own the <i>Tribulus.</i></P>
    <P>Equally important will be the benefit to Irish shipowners.  By virtue of holding MARPOL certificates they will no longer be embarrassed by subjection to stringent inspection and delay while in MARPOL Convention countries; any such inspection will now be limited to verifying that there is on board a valid MARPOL certificate. Ireland is the only EC maritime member state and the only state party to the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control not to have ratified or acceded to MARPOL 73/78.  Under this memorandum of understanding each of the 14 member states undertakes to achieve an annual total of inspections of foreign-registered ships entering its ports corresponding to 25 per cent of individual merchant ships.  Inspection ensures compliance with the standards laid down in a number of international conventions including the MARPOL Convention.</P>
    <P>Ireland will also be assured of the co-operation of other parties to the MARPOL Convention and the International Maritime Organisation in the detection of violations, the enforcement of rules, environmental monitoring and accumulation of evidence against offenders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Amendment) Act, 1977, empowers the Minister to take such action as he considers necessary in relation to a ship or its cargo for the purpose of preventing, mitigating or eliminating the effects of oil pollution arising from a maritime casualty.  The Minister may only exercise these powers in respect of an Irish-registered ship anywhere at sea; any other ship while in the territorial waters of the State or, following a Government Order, any ship registered in a country which is party to the Intervention Convention, 1969, while outside the territorial waters of the State. The Minister must exercise his powers of intervention with discretion.  There must be grave and imminent danger of major harmful consequences through pollution by oil to the coastline or related interests. Where a stricken ship is not carrying oil as cargo there must be sufficient threat of danger from bunker or fuel oil to justify intervention.  Where it can be established in the case of an Irish-registered ship or any other ship while in the territorial waters of the State that intervention was unreasonable then compensation must be paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister used his powers of intervention early in 1989 when the 85,000 ton bulk carrier <i>Yarrawonga,</i> having lost 300 square metres of steel side plating in mid-Atlantic, was abandoned by its crew. Similarly &mdash; I mentioned this already &mdash; he intervened in February of this year with the holed 122,000 ton bulk carrier <i>Tribulus</i> which limped into Bantry Bay leaking heavy fuel oil.  Bantry Bay is now very much involved in mussel farming and that did constitute a grave danger.  It was a situation that was handled extremely well.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House strengthens the Minister's powers considerably.  The threat of pollution may be from any harmful substance, intervention may be made anywhere at sea and only in the case of Irish-registered and Intervention Convention country-registered ships while in the territorial waters of the State may a case of unreasonable intervention be entertained.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House takes <Col N="518" /> account of lessons learned from past disasters, namely, the need for legislation requiring the owner of a ship to compensate the Minister for expenses of/or incidental to any action taken by him to prevent, mitigate or eliminate danger from pollution or a threat of pollution from that ship and the need to have penalties for offences commensurate with damage done.  It is intended that clean-up costs would be recoverable by the Minister.  At first glance £10 million maximum penalty for conviction on indictment may seem unrealistic or excessive, but when one considers the extent of damage that may be caused by marine pollution it is justifiable.  I need hardly remind the House of the $1 billion plus bill which followed the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> 11 million gallon crude oil spill in Alaska last year.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill before the House is concerned with the strengthening of the powers of inspectors &mdash; section 21 &mdash; and harbour masters &mdash; section 25 &mdash; in the detection of unauthorised or alleged discharges, defective ships or equipment and standard provisions which are self-explanatory.  Section 5 provides that every regulation made under the proposed legislation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  There will be an opportunity, therefore, for all Deputies to consider the precise terms of the regulations to give effect to the five annexes to the MARPOL Convention.</P>
    <P>It has long been held that Ireland should have a compulsory vessel reporting or notification system for all ships entering Irish waters.  Such a system is currently in force in respect of fishing trawlers registered in Spain and Portugal, for a transitional period, and in non-EC countries when entering Community waters under Irish control.</P>
    <P>The system would be beneficial in protecting the marine environment and also in detecting undesirable ships or cargoes or on security grounds.  Section 23 of the Bill enables the Minister to set up such a system should he consider it necessary and enforceable.  Alternatively, a system whereby certain classes of ship which are <Col N="519" /> a potential threat to the marine environment &mdash; for example, oil tankers &mdash; might be required to give advance notification of entry into Irish territorial waters could be considered.</P>
    <P>I must say that the Bill before the House is one that will play a vital role in protecting the State's clean marine environmental heritage.</P>
    <P>Molaim go léifear an Bille don Dara Uair agus tá súil agam go rachaidh sé chun sochair don tír iomlán.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille seo and I compliment the Minister for bringing it before the House.  As the Minister has stated, this legislation brings into being the five annexes to the MARPOL Convention. Already over 40 states throughout the world have implemented this treaty known as MARPOL.  We are the last of the EC member states to do so. As an island state it is extremely important that this Bill gets a quick passage through the House.  As an island nation we are very vulnerable in the north west Atlantic where we are on route for major seagoing vessels.  Over the years and, indeed, in the recent past large oil tankers and other large carriers have got into difficulties off our coastline.  As a result we have been put under serious threat and in some instances damage has resulted to our coastline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to an aged fleet and vessels which are much larger than they were in the past.  In addition, as has recently been proven in the case of the <i>Tribulus</i> and the <i>Yarrowonga,</i> relatively young vessels constructed within the last decade have shown major features of flawed construction and have proved incapable of coping with the weather elements with which they were confronted during the course of storm difficulties in the North Atlantic.  I hope the Minister for the Marine would use his influence at EC, and at other levels in the United Nations, to ensure that a greater degree of examination is carried out to the international construction of ships and the durability <Col N="520" /> and quality of materials used in the large bulk carriers of all types.  In relation to the most recent difficulties that arose off our coasts it is true to say &mdash; I think the Minister said it at that time in the House &mdash; that there were difficulties regarding the materials used and the ability of the ships to withstand those difficulties.  That is a matter, over and above what is contained in this Bill, that must be under constant vigilance.  Because we are in a vulnerable position it is of particular interest to us.</P>
    <P>This is enabling legislation rather than a Bill giving statutory authority.  My main criticism is that the Bill merely enables the Minister to make regulations subsequently rather than giving him statutory powers.  When the Minister is considering the various regulations I hope he will take the opportunity of discussing the details with the Opposition spokespersons.  While appreciating the good intent on the part of the Minister and his Department we can all learn from consultation with others.</P>
    <P>The first Part of the Bill is fairly technical but there is one section within Part I, section 4, which exempts any warship or any ship for the time being used by the Government of any country for purposes other than commercial purposes.  I am concerned about that exemption.  It is well accepted that around our coasts there are a number of warships engaging in exercises many of which, if not all, are nuclear-powered.  I had hoped that the provisions of this Bill would give the Minister power to prevent nuclear-powered ships entering into or engaging in exercises in our territorial waters.  I am extremely disappointed that the general nuclear area has not been addressed by the provisions of this Bill:</P>
    <P>There are five annexes to the MARPOL Convention covering the prevention of pollution by oil, noxious liquid substances, sewage and garbage being disposed of by ships, but no provision at all in relation to the disposal of nuclear effluent in waters around our coast.  That is indeed unfortunate.  It would be my <Col N="521" /> hope that the Minister and his Department would address that matter before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the provisions of section 4 exempt any warship or any ship being used for purposes other than commercial ones.  We hear constantly reports of Russian nuclear-powered warships, of German submarines and others engaging in exercises around our coastline, some fitted with old reactors carrying the constant danger of their sinking or of the defective reactor not giving sufficient warning.  Of course, we know what would be the consequences of a major tragedy, which is indeed something against which we need protection.  While the other areas are extremely important the combined effect of all of the five annexes would be minimal in comparison with the overall effect of any accident involving a nuclear-powered ship.  This is a contingency we must address.  While we do not have the manpower, defence force or requisite monitoring equipment to detect exactly what is taking place in the waters around our coast, we need protection. There must be some means by which we can be afforded such protection, whether through the EC, the United Nations or whoever.  I would appeal to the Minister to have this aspect examined urgently.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill is the most important part dealing with the prevention of pollution at sea because it will give statutory effect to the provisions of the five annexes to the MARPOL Convention, specifying and clearly detailing the relevant regulations. In particular it deals with the regulations pertaining to ships generally or indeed to any class of ship.  I wondered whether, in the regulations the Minister intends bringing before the House, he will include all types of sea-going vessels; for example, whether there will be exemptions in respect of smaller, pleasure-type craft, or what categories of ship he intends including.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the overall use of the phrase &ldquo;the Minister may by regulations ...&rdquo; affording the Minister an option with regard to the making of any such regulations.  There are so many <Col N="522" /> opportunities being afforded the Minister to make such regulations under this Bill it would be my hope that, when responding, he would enlighten the House as to when he intends introducing such regulations.</P>
    <P>I note that the side note on section 11 reads: &ldquo;Saver for discharges in certain circumstances&rdquo;.  I fully appreciate the reason for the inclusion of this section, in particular with regard to the saving of life at sea, the safe passages of ships and so on.  Nonetheless I wonder what monitoring system will be devised by the Department to ensure that the provisions of this section and the relevant regulations are complied with?  What mechanism will be available to the Minister or his Department to assess the amount of any effluent or material discharged from any ship?  It appears to me that the Minister will be dependent solely on the honour and honesty of people on board any ship and on any report they may submit.  That is not entirely satisfactory from our point of view.  The problem is that the ocean is so large that it can conceal any number of offenders.  That is a fact we must face.  Unless one can be absolutely sure of the overall integrity of seagoing people one is dependent solely on goodwill, which is not satisfactory. There is a need on the part of our Government, and within the EC overall, to deploy the requisite manpower and sea-going vessels to assess that type of contingency and report thereon to the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>The sidenote to section 14 reads &ldquo;Equipment, etc., of ships to prevent pollution&rdquo;.  I wonder where are the technical or nautical experts within the Department of the Marine who can monitor shipping construction.  For example, under the provisions of section 14 will the Minister hire people from outside his Department to carry out such assessment, to draw up the necessary report in relation to changed equipment on a ship, or what does he propose doing in this respect?  I appreciate that the personnel within his Department are doing a very good job within the resources available but we must recognise that those <Col N="523" /> resources are extremely limited.  I am not aware of marine engineers being employed within the Department who would be competent to carry out the necessary assessments under the provisions of that section.  Such assessment is vital.</P>
    <P>Section 17 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister, in order to establish that any ship or class of ship complies with the requirements of regulations under section 14, may by regulations require that any ship of such class as may be specified in the regulations, its equipment and fittings be surveyed, inspected or tested in such manner and at such times as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>For that purpose will the Minister be employing staff, say, independent consultants outside his Department, or what does he envisage doing in regard to those provisions?</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the general good intent of the Bill I am concerned about the Department's ability to implement its various provisions.  When replying I would hope the Minister would explain what exactly he has in mind.</P>
    <P>Also in section 17 there is reference to change in structure, equipment and fittings being surveyed, inspected or tested in such manner and at such times as may be prescribed.  The five annexes to the MARPOL Convention clearly cover a total change of usage of any ship, or of any material or substantial change of usage.  The section does not outline specifically what type of change is envisaged or specify how major or minor such change must be before it must be recertified by the Department in order to comply with the MARPOL Convention.</P>
    <P>Section 26 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (6), the Minister or any person authorised by him (an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;) may for the purpose of preventing, mitigating or eliminating danger from pollution or threat of pollution by oil, or by any substance other than oil as defined in subsection (10), following upon a <Col N="524" /> maritime casualty or acts related to such a casualty, give such directions as seem to him to be appropriate to&mdash;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister envisage circumstances in which the system at present in place within the EC, involving the operation of a co-ordination unit, will obtain under the provisions of this section? Does the Minister propose using that?  What co-operation is in existence at the moment with the EC?  As a member state it is important that we make a co-ordinated efort with the EC on this matter.  The MARPOL Convention is put to very fine effect in the United States where there is a very effective coastguard operation with specific and definite powers under the MARPOL Convention to control the situation and bring ships to order in a very definite fashion.  Within the EC we do not have the same type of powers to put the MARPOL Convention into operation.  Is the Minister aware of any co-ordinated action to put in place a similar type of operation to enforce this Bill?  It is vitally important to have such powers because in the United States the major offenders in relation to marine pollution were the United States Navy itself.  Since the MARPOL Convention was put into operation the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of garbage that has been kept out of the ocean as a result has been quite significant, not just from the Navy but also from merchant and commercial shipping. We in Europe do not have that same type of implementation and that is unfortunate.  I hope the Minister will review this matter seriously.</P>
    <P>The fishing community are very appreciative of the marine resources around this country and have a respect for the sea and what is stands for.  There is an onus on the Minister, however, to outline to the fishing community the difficulties and dangers that can arise when some of the gear and equipment they use is lost at sea.  I speak particularly of derelict gill nets and other fishing gear made from plastic.  I would like to compliment the Department on the poster they circulated before Christmas because <Col N="525" /> it highlights the type of damage plastic can do to marine life.  Plastic is a threat not alone to marine life but to human life at sea, for instance, if it gets caught in propellers putting seacraft out of action and leading, in turn, to loss of life.  The difficulty of plastic is that it is such a strong, durable, buoyant and lightweight material immune to the natural process of decay.  It is particularly dangerous to marine life, including fish, sea birds and all types of sea mammals.  Birds or fish ingest it; it gets stuck in their stomachs and results in them not being able to eat. In some cases it has been proven that birds that have swallowed plastic pellets have subsequently become so buoyant that they were not able to dive for food and subsequently died from starvation. The amount of destruction that plastic can bring about is quite frightening; that is something that many people do not appreciate.  It is something that people on pleasure boats and on major passenger ships at sea should be made aware of.</P>
    <P>The deepening of the waters and the bringing of major passenger liners into Cork makes it important to heighten the awareness of people in relation to the disposal of all types of garbage, particularly plastic garbage, and the inherent difficulties that can arise from this.  We are talking about a danger to marine life and a danger to human life.  One is talking, in the long term, about a reduction in the numbers of people who will be able to make a livelihood from the sea if the very life at sea is reduced or seriously damaged.  This is something we all have a great interest in.</P>
    <P>In relation to the dumping of plastics at sea and the subsequent washing of this onto the shore the result is very unsightly scenes around the shorelines of Ireland and Europe.  This is extremely unfortunate, particularly in Ireland, where we claim to have a clean environment.  Tourism could be put in jeopardy by dirty beaches which have become dirty not because of the negligence of the natives but of people out at sea.  This could cause difficulties in relation to promoting a tourism product at a time when we are hoping to create more employment <Col N="526" /> within the tourism sector.  This is an area where we must be vigilant.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of plastics in relation to sewage disposal.  I wonder if the Department of the Marine are liaising with the Department of the Environment in relation to the disposal of these plastics. The sewage is being pumped out into the sea and automatically there is plastic going out into the sea and subsequently coming back to shore, and that is posing an aesthetic problem for coastal residents and visitors.  This must be addressed.  The Department of the Environment have particular responsibility for sewage disposal and must be notified of the difficulties that can arise for marine life because of this.  I hope the Minister for the Marine will take this matter up with his counterpart, the Minister for the Environment, because it can be quite an unsightly and unacceptable problem in some areas.</P>
    <P>We are hoping to have an environment protection agency in place here soon.  We are talking about a Bill that deals with sea pollution and within that area we are talking about the continental shelf.  The continental shelf is extremely important to us here.  Much exploration work is going on out on the continental shelf and the Department of Energy have particular responsibility for that.  It is important that the Minister for the Marine should liaise again with the Minister for Energy to ensure that the MARPOL convention is put into place by the Department of Energy, particularly when they are issuing exploration licences to the various companies for gas or oil exploration to ensure that the conditions laid down by MARPOL 5 are fully complied with.  The Minister did not mention this and it is not covered in the Bill.  I would appeal to the Minister to bring this matter to the notice of the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>The Department of Defence is not mentioned.  I particularly refer to this in relation to the implementation of the Bill and of the MARPOL Convention.  The Bill itself is good.  It provides the Minister with the power to introduce the regulations but, in the final analysis, how do <Col N="527" /> we actually implement all these regulations? I am concerned about that and particularly about the enforcement procedure that we as a nation will have. I am concerned that the Navy, which would have the sole responsibility for enforcement, might not have the manpower to enforce what is necessary.  Have the Government considered setting up a joint committee of the Departments of Energy, the Environment, Marine and Defence?  There is need for such a committee in relation to the implementation of this Bill.  In the final analysis, if we are going to implement the five Annexes to the MARPOL Convention we will have to depend on the expertise of the Department of Defence together with the Department of the Marine.  It is important that there is continuing contact between these Departments, otherwise the Bill will be like much of the legislation that has been put through this House in the past, legislation on the Statute Book but not implemented, and that would be highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with compensation and procedures to be adopted when taking legal action against the offending parties. I hope it will be possible to bring an offender before the courts.  I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that this legislation can be implemented.  The Bill is welcome and has been requested by many people for quite a long time.  It addresses many of the difficulties that arise in relation to marine pollution.  The most glaring omission relates to nuclear disposal into the sea, particularly in relation to Sellafield.  That matter, as well as the question of nuclear submarines and nuclear power vessels, should be addressed.  I hope the Minister will comment on that matter when replying to Second Stage.  We in Fine Gael welcome the Bill and hope it will have a quick passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Sea Pollution Bill which is before the House today.  It is a long overdue measure whose main purpose is to ratify the International <Col N="528" /> Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Shipping, 1973.  It also proposes to modify that convention, allowing Ireland as a nation to accede to the protocol relating to intervention on the high seas in cases of marine pollution by substances other than oil.</P>
      <P>When I was elected to this House, I asked the Minister for the Marine when would this country sign the MARPOL Agreement and he said in about 12 months time.  He lived up to that promise and brought the measure before the House, and I compliment him on that.  I felt this country did not take seriously the threat of pollution to our coastal waters and marine life and the serious damage that could be done to the environment for hundreds of years to come.  There is now a growing awareness among the public that the seas surrounding our coasts are vitally important to us as a nation.  If we wish to survive and prosper, it is very important that we prevent pollution of our coasts.</P>
      <P>At present our seas are relatively pollution free, particularly the coastal waters on the south, south-west and west coasts, but the Irish Sea is a completely different matter.  Even though this Bill does not deal with pollution from sources other than ships and so on, it would be remiss of us not to mention Sellafield and the damage being done to the Irish Sea as a result of emissions from that plant. Experts tell us the Irish sea is one of the most radioactive seas in the world.  There is a growing realisation that we should capitalise on the seas around our coasts. If our coastline is kept free from pollution it will have a beneficial effect not only as regards the fish we consume and the jobs accruing in that area but also as regards the jobs that would accrue from tourism which is vitally important to the country. It is important that our good, clean environment is safeguarded.  We should ensure that our seas and beaches are in prime condition for future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is aimed at preventing pollution of our seas by ships discharging oil, deliberately or otherwise, and also by toxic substances, obnoxious substances and harmful substances, including <Col N="529" /> sewage and garbage.  It excludes a number of measures including dumping within the meaning of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, a measure which is now the cause of grave reservations among politicians, environmentalists and all those concerned with one of the greatest resources of this planet, the seas and oceans.  For thousands of years man has been content to let nature take its course in replenishing what appears to be its never-ending stocks, but modern technology, while benefiting mankind with mind-boggling discoveries and scientific advances, has also created enormous problems.  Problems have been experienced with the creation of toxic wastes and the disposal of those wastes.  Governments, local authorities and private enterprise have found that the seas are a convenient dumping ground.  It is a classic case of out of sight, out of mind.</P>
    <P>We in this country have much ground to make up.  We are an island nation on the periphery of Europe, with rich fishing grounds and an abundance of marine life. Ireland should have been in the vanguard of marine protection but yet we seem to be trailing behind other nations.  While hopefully this Bill is a serious attempt to control pollution of our seas and estuaries, there are certain aspects which the Labour Party want to have teased out, clarified and, if necessary, amended.</P>
    <P>I accept there is an urgent need for this country to tackle the serious threat of oil pollution from giant tankers which travel through our waters.  In recent years we have seen some horrific examples, such as the <i>Amoco Cadiz,</i> the <i>Torrey Canyon,</i> the <i>World Glory</i> and the <i>Exxon Valdez.</i> These catastrophies spring readily to mind, with their massive spillages of millions of gallons of crude oil into seas around our coasts, to be washed up on our beaches.  We are told that crude oil is comprised of hundreds of different chemicals, the effects of which cannot be assessed in the short term.  It is now believed that these chemicals have a detrimental effect on sea life as long as they remain in the environment.  There is also the very real danger of those involved in the clean-up operation being <Col N="530" /> exposed to harmful effects of crude oil in this form, and of other toxic substances. These fears have been expressed by experts involved in this area of scientific analysis.  We have been told that benzene evaporates rapidly from a spillage.  There is now evidence from medical experts that skin cancer and other diseases are caused by contact with crude oil and this is a matter of grave concern to the people involved.</P>
    <P>Much nearer home we have experienced spillages in Bantry Bay, and in the case of the ill-fated <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> monetary compensation still has not been agreed.  This is another example of where we have been lax in our legislation.  The environmental damage from those incidents off our coasts has not been fully realised.  In future years we will realise that there has been damage for which we cannot be compensated.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility and an obligation on every nation which uses the seas for the purposes of increasing wealth, for transport and enjoyment, to pass on to future generations this resource intact.  The MARPOL Agreement is a welcome step in that direction. It seems incredible that in 1990 the seas are still open to abuse.  Raw, untreated sewage is pumped into the sea at a tremendous rate, garbage and plastics of all kinds are dumped into the sea and miles of abandoned fishing nets float for years ensnaring valuable fish life and doing serious damage to endangered species of marine life.</P>
    <P>Ruthless ship owners are playing their trade under flags of convenience and taking advantage of low freight charges. They have endangered lives and risked massive pollution in the pursuit of profit. We hope this Bill will be able to control and stamp out abuse in this area, but adequate resources must be provided for its implementation.  We must curb the get rich quick merchants who use the seas to flush out tanks and bilges and have no conscience in regard to the damage they do and are capable of doing with suspect tankers and freighters.</P>
    <P>One of the easiest methods of making money in shipping is by the fast turn <Col N="531" /> around at ports.  Frequently skippers and masters are under severe pressure from owners to meet a deadline.  As soon as a cargo is off-loaded, whatever the commodity, the ship is got underway and all cleaning is done during the voyage to sea. It will be tremendously difficult, if not impossible, to monitor such activity, particularly if there is an incentive for the skipper such as a financial reward at the end of the trip.</P>
    <P>I refer to the special features prescribed for ship design to minimise the outflow of oil in the event of an accident. Experts believe that such improvements to tanker design and structure would cost extra money at the petrol pump.  It would appear that the oil giants who use the sea routes and ports will not meet the cost of safeguarding the environment.  The Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Industry and Commerce might turn their attention to this point.  The oil companies are making billions in profits and they have a moral and a legal obligation to make sure that the ships which carry their products across the globe have ample protection.  That cost should not be passed on to the consumer.  The environment belongs to everyone, including the oil companies and the people at the petrol pumps.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to give effect to all five Annexes of the MARPOL Agreement. Perhaps the Minister will explain how pollution by sewage and garbage from ships will be prevented.  Is it intended to store sewage on board and bring it ashore for disposal?  If so, this sewage will be returned to the sea since the majority of local authorities pump raw sewage into the sea.  Cities like Dublin, Waterford, Limerick, Wexford and Cork have no sewage disposal units as such and it would be pointless to enforce that aspect of the agreement.  I presume some ships would not be equiped for that type of storage.  To bring sewage ashore for the sake of pumping it back to sea would be costly and counter-productive. The Minister might comment on this.  Many of the smaller ports around the coast would be in a far worse position <Col N="532" /> than the cities I have mentioned.  Even in Cork and Dublin the problem exists on a massive scale.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that this legislation shall not apply to any warship or to any ship used by the Government of any country for non-commercial purposes. This is alarming and extraordinary. Government-owned ships, particularly naval vessels, should serve as an example in preventing the pollution of the seas.  I suspect the Minister's explanation may have something to do with agreements between other countries, perhaps under the Single European Act.  The matter should be discussed further.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the excellent poster which has been produced, explaining very carefully and fully what the Bill is all about.  The caption at the top refers to all seafarers.  The naval vessels which visit our shores and our own naval vessels are all crewed by seafarers and such vessels should be obliged to abide by the regulations.  The Minister might explain the reasons for their exclusion.  I draw the Minister's attention to Article 3 of the MARPOL Agreement which governs the exemption of naval vessels and I would ask him to ensure the inclusion of the section which provides that Governments should adopt appropriate measures, not impairing the operations or operational capabilities of such ships owned or operated by them, to see that such ships act in a manner consistent, as far as is reasonably possible and practicable, with the agreement.  While I believe that all shipping should be treated equally, I shall be interested in the Minister's response on this important section.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the introduction of fees.  Is it the Minister's intention to charge fishing boats and pleasure craft which may be at sea for a couple of days for the disposal of garbage?  Apparently, there is no register of pleasure craft, such as yachts, cruisers or smaller boats.  I wonder if it is time we kept a register so that people who own these pleasure craft are registered.  If they go to sea and dump their garbage overboard, we have no method of following them up at present <Col N="533" /> because, although we may get the name of the cruiser, there is no way the owner can be traced to it.  Perhaps the Minister could examine the possibility of a register for smaller craft, in the same way as cars and motor bikes are registered.</P>
    <P>In section 9, the Minister is to require the master or owner of a ship to notify him of the intention to load or unload a proscribed substance.  I believe it is imperative that a ship travelling through Irish coastal waters would also be required to notify the Department of its route and cargo, in the same way that aircraft are obliged to notify air traffic control when they fly over this country. If ships are travelling on busy routes in our coastal waters whether from the United States of America, Britain or Europe, we should be notified of any cargo they are carrying, particularly if it is toxic.  We should have a way of contacting those ships.  We had trouble with ships in our waters during the winter and investigations were carried out into what they were transporting.  However, I think we should be notified well in advance of the cargo of ships that come into our waters.</P>
    <P>Section 12 states that harbours are to provide facilities for the disposal of oily residues and wastes.  Some authorities may be able to comply with these regulations, but I would like information from the Minister regarding the provision, if any, for funding these facilities.  In some coastal counties, which have a number of seaports and harbours, the cost could be substantial and the local authorities are already in a financial crisis.  They would have great difficulty in paying a substantial bill to provide these facilities.  We know that some companies who dispose of waste oil residues will only accept oil capable of being recycled and if the waste oil was unable to be recycled, this would create major problems for the local authorities. As far as I know there is no toxic waste disposal unit in this country and I know that local authorities would be reluctant to dispose of such waste in their land-fill sites.  People are now deeply concerned about what goes in to the land-fill sites and we have had problems in the Cork area with this.  I know this would <Col N="534" /> be a major problem for some local authorities unless the local authorities had the proper back-up facilities to provide for the disposal of waste from ships.  The enforcement of this section may present harbour boards and local authorities with a dilemma.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that the Minister for the Marine may by regulations require a ship registered in the State to be constructed, fitted or operated in such a way as to prevent, control or reduce discharges into the sea.  This is obviously going to reflect on costs and more than likely it is the consumer who will have to pay at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 provide for the appointment of inspectors by the Minister and sets out their powers.  While these powers are far-reaching, as they must be under the circumstances, I also notice that an inspector may be a surveyor of ships, an officer holding commissioned naval rank or a member of the Garda Síochána.  I would like to ask the Minister if a member of the Garda Síochána would have to have a specific rank or have seagoing experience or experience in dealing with noxious substances.  This seems a bit vague, and while I know a Garda member is the person to enforce the law, I feel that the rank and experience of that member would have to be defined.</P>
    <P>Section 21 (6) (b) provides &ldquo;that any person who refuses or neglects to make an answer ... shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  I think this is questionable under Irish law.  I will not get into a legal wrangle at this point but I would like the Minister to give an opinion on this.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that an inspector may direct the harbour master to permit a ship to enter port and it would appear that an inspector's power overrides that of the harbour master and this may cause doubt or confusion in operation.  I have read the Bill and it would appear that in the event of an argument between a harbour master and inspector on whether a ship should enter port, the inspector's power overrides that of the harbour master.  From what I know, the harbour master was the person in control of <Col N="535" /> ships within his jurisdiction up to now and I wonder whether this would lead to a clash.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us on this.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with fines, and it would appear that all ships, including boats of all sizes and description are liable to the same treatment under the law.  I am not being in any way flippant, but I wonder if the provisions of this section will also apply to the person who is out with his or her family on a Sunday afternoon in the punt or dinghy and may face a fine of up to £1,000 on summary conviction for tossing a bit of paper overboard.</P>

      <P>I presume that under the Bill the same conditions apply to the user of a small boat as apply to the huge shipping magnate.  I must stress that I am in no way taking the part of the polluter and we must make people aware that even the slighest bit of plastic thrown overboard can and does cause damage.  I would be the first to promote an awareness of pollution in our rivers and estuaries but I think it may be a bit overpowering for a harbour master or inspector to enforce the law rigidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get involved in a legal tangle on the provisions of section 35, but this section which presumes a person is guilty until proven innocent, is a change from the normal procedure which prevails in this country and while not in any way defending a polluter I would like to hear the Minister's observations on this section.  If a ship is found in close proximity to a discharge of waste, the ship would be presumed guilty of the discharge. However I am sure the Minister knows as much as anybody else that there are ruthless skippers who would go into a busy shipping lane and discharge their waste, taking the chance they would not be caught, and they would then leave the scene pretty quickly.  I think we would need extra staff such as naval protection <Col N="536" /> staff in fast launches to patrol our harbours because, generally speaking, discharges take place in busy shipping lanes. I think it is opportune for the Minister to get in touch with the Department of Defence to promote greater awareness and co-operation between the naval personnel so that fast craft can move in quickly where there is a suspected case of pollution.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a measure which attempts to regulate, control and eliminate pollution of our seas.  The extent of this pollution can easily be understood if we look at a recent article in the <i>Sherkin Comment,</i> an excellent newspaper which has highlighted pollution problems over the years.  It stated that six tons of debris were removed from the beaches of Beck Cove in the Hawaiian Archipelago, an uninhabited island, and within one year another three tons had gathered which included nets, plastics, bottles and other materials.  This gave an indication of the volume of pollution in our oceans.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that there is no reference whatsoever in the Bill to radioactive waste, one of the greatest pollutants of our times.  That is one of the reasons I have grave reservations about naval ships being exempt from the Bill.  I also feel that ships in the business of transporting radioactive material through our seas and oceans should come under the jurisdiction of the Irish Government.  These ships pose a major threat of pollution of our seas.  The Irish Sea is probably the busiest in the world with nuclear powered submarines travelling to and fro and if there is an accident involving such a vessel the pollution caused by the <i>Torry Canyon,</i> the <i>Amoco Cadiz,</i> etc. will pale into insignificance by comparison.  These submarines now pose the greatest threat of pollution of our waters.</P>
    <P>The exemption of such vessels in the Bill is of major concern.  This legislation does not legislate for nuclear stations which dispose of their waste into the sea. Legislation must be introduced to govern vessels which, if damaged or sunk, would pose the greatest pollution threat of all time.  At the same time as we are debating <Col N="537" /> this Bill, which will control the dumping of garbage, sewage and oil, big commercial concerns are dumping large volumes of toxic waste into the ocean.  One UK firm, which made a profit of £1.5 billion last year, have consistently dumped huge volumes of waste into the North Sea.  I am not saying that this is relevant to this Bill but in recent years there has been a great deal of dumping off our south coast. Until such time as the Government and the European Community come to grips with this problem and come up with a method for disposing of waste other than by dumping it into the sea, this Bill and other Bills will have no effect whatsoever. This Bill governs pollution by oil tankers, etc, but these are only in the halfpenny place in the debate on pollutants.</P>
    <P>Vessels which carry nuclear waste for reprocessing and disposal, even if they are non-commercial Government operated craft from other countries, should be governed by this legislation.  I believe mankind's greatest threat of pollution comes from this source.  The legislation before the House is long overdue and is to the credit of people like John de Courcy Ireland, Matt Murphy of Sherkin Island and Gabriel King of Dún Laoghaire, who have consistently and constantly at great cost to themselves persevered in highlighting the potential of our seas and the danger of pollution.  Those people have put their views on record and contacted the people involved in this area.  Great credit is due to them because they have highlighted these problems at great cost to themselves.</P>
    <P>The recent EC Summit held in Dublin had as one of its Presidential conclusions the objective of guaranteeing to the citizens of the Community the right to a clean and healthy environment, particularly in regard to our rivers, lakes, coastal and marine waters.  I hope that we as a Community can live up to those guarantees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with my colleagues in welcoming the Bill and congratulating the Minister and his Department on bringing it before the <Col N="538" /> House.  There is a number of aspects of the Bill with which The Workers' Party are not entirely happy &mdash; I will refer to these at a later stage &mdash; but we welcome the Bill in general terms.</P>
      <P>My first observation relates to the title, Sea Pollution Bill.  This is a slightly exaggerated claim for this Bill.  As I understand it, the Bill will enable Ireland to ratify MARPOL.  As such, it is welcome and long overdue but as we know MARPOL deals with pollution from ships.  We know also that the pollution of the sea is not confined to pollution from ships but comes from a number of sources &mdash; for example, pollution from landbased sources such as discharges of sewage from industrial and agricultural activity, pollution brought down by rivers, pollution from nuclear reprocessing plants and air pollution.  This Bill will not address those problems because it is confined to pollution from ships.  It would be unfortunate if the impression were given that the Dáil was dealing with a Bill on the totality of sea pollution rather than the more confined but certainly very important area of pollution from ships.</P>
      <P>I want to ask a number of questions. First, why has it taken so long, almost two decades, for Ireland to ratify MARPOL? Why are we the last member state of the European Community, although we are only one of two island states in the European Community, to ratify MARPOL? It also raises the question of how effective MARPOL is in the first place in addressing the problem of pollution from ships. In addressing those questions we have to look back at where MARPOL came from &mdash; it is a marriage of the growing concern for the environment on the one hand with the internationalisation of issues relating to the seas on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international environmental debate started in earnest at the end of the sixties when the negative effects of modern industrial society on the environment, natural resources and human health became apparent.  It was realised that the oceans and the seas had not functioned as large basins for the dilution <Col N="539" /> of pollution but instead nature had started to strike back.  A strong public opinion was created against the emission of pollutants into the environment, against oil spills and against the dumping of waste into the sea.  It was slowly realised that the emissions from land based sources, industries, urban areas, agriculture or through rivers were the predominant sources of pollution, although at first the main attraction and attention was given to the more spectacular incidents at sea.  Accidents in which oil tankers spill thousands of tonnes of oil into the sea do not happen every day, but the emissions of environmentally hazardous substances from ordinary non-dramatic activities in our society take place continuously day after day, year after year.  The dumping or incineration of waste at sea can be stopped virtually at a day's notice.  However, it is much more difficult to take fast and effective decisions to stop immediately the emission of nutrients or the deposition of air pollutants.</P>
    <P>Awareness of the magnitude of pollution of the marine environment and the scope of the problem was followed by an awareness that a single country could not solve the problems around its coasts purely through national action and measures.  It was clear that regional and international co-operation had to be initiated in order to deal effectively with the pollution of the seas.  Many of the efforts within the various marine conventions are of a regional nature. Countries sharing a sea area also try to share responsibility for the protection of the environment of that area.</P>
    <P>However, some issues are global in nature and must be dealt with on a global basis.  Maritime activities with an impact on the environment such as oil pollution from ships are global problems, because shipping is truly a global industry involving vessels from virtually all countries of the world.</P>
    <P>While various efforts were being made internationally to deal with the problem of pollution from ships and the marine environment, international efforts were <Col N="540" /> also being made to establish an international law of the sea.  It is interesting to note that, while 148 states participated in the 1973 Conference which initiated MARPOL, 17 years later only 49 of those countries have become participating states.  It suggests that the remaining states, including our own, did not, over those years, give sufficient priority to the protection of the marine environment despite the international concern and outrage at major oil spills.</P>
    <P>It also suggests that the international emphasis in relation to the sea over the past 20 years has leaned more towards the staking of territorial claims than to the protection of the marine environment. It also suggests that it was the more developed and industrialised countries, those with large fishing fleets, countries which had a military or naval interest in the sea, who saw the prospect of exploiting the sea for economic gain, who were the driving force in establishing the international law of the sea and that the concerns regarding the marine environment, and the global concerns, were pushed more and more into the background. National economic interests won over the need for international co-operation to deal with environmental problems. It is only in recent years, when there has been an increased awareness of the need to protect the sea, to see it not as a great big fish pond to be exploited or as a great dumping basin where whatever was thrown into it would be disposed of and dispersed, but as an integral part of the earth's life systems.</P>
    <P>MARPOL and the Bill specifically deal with pollution from ships, a very important area.  The old idea that whatever you threw overboard from a ship, whatever refuse you disposed of at sea, would be dispersed in the big wide oceans is no longer valid.  A number of examples have already been given here of the kind of problems arising from such activity.</P>
    <P>The National Academy of Science in the United States established that each year 6.5 million tonnes of litter are dumped overboard from ships.  That is a remarkably huge amount of litter <Col N="541" /> dumped in the sea.  A more recent estimate says that 5.5 million containers are thrown overboard from ships every day, including cups and various other containers and that, of these, 700,000 are plastic.  It is no wonder that plastic causes such havoc to marine life.  For example, of the 85 fin whales which were taken by the Icelanders for scientific whaling, 8 per cent had plastic in their guts.  That arose in whales found in Artic waters.  Over half of all sea turtles had plastic in their stomachs and a recent study showed that 11 out of 15 leathery turtles died from plastic blockages in the stomach.</P>
    <P>Monofilament net is another major problem.  In the north east Pacific it is estimated that 1,600 miles of monofilament nets per year are found and that 600 miles of those are from Japanese fishing vessels.  Therefore, we are dealing with a major international problem.  It is regrettable that Ireland, which has a distinguished maritime history, instead of leading the field in relation to marine pollution and pollution from ships, should be a late ratifier of the MARPOL Convention.  However, I suppose it is a case of better late than never.</P>
    <P>It is not enough, however, just to pass legislation here which would enable us to ratify MARPOL.  Steps must also be taken to give effect to it.  It has been found by other countries who ratified MARPOL that one of the difficulties is in policing the dumping and discharging of refuse from ships.  The Bill gives power to the Minister for the Marine to arrange for the inspection of vessels, but the question then arises as to whether there are sufficient staff and resources to do this effectively. Our tiny naval protection fleet will not be sufficient to deal with that task.  Indeed, the Scandinavian countries have found that the best way of policing MARPOL is not from ships, but from the air.  A ship is unlikely to be caught in the act discharging waste or litter if it believes that a naval protection vessel is nearby which can be quite easily established. It is much easier to be caught in the act by an aeroplane overhead.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before that there is a need <Col N="542" /> for a European coast watch.  The protection of the seas and waters is no longer simply a national issue.  Indeed, there is a case to be made that member states of the European Community, for example, may very well be duplicating their efforts in the policing of MARPOL and other conventions.  There is a strong case for an EC initiative to establish a European coast watch whereby the coasts all round the European Community can be protected and the arrangements provided for in MARPOL and in this Bill can be properly implemented.</P>
    <P>There is also a case for the introduction of a bounty system.  The United States, in dealing with the MARPOL Convention, have found it very effective to offer a bounty to fishermen to bring in nets they find in the course of their work.  They also, incidently, have a very interesting bounty system for fishermen or the masters of other vessels who inform on sea polluters, but I am not sure it would find much favour in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the main provisions in the Bill is the requirement that harbours will have to have waste reception facilities.  The Minister in his speech said that harbour authorities had been requested to provide such facilities.  However, the provision of such facilities will require considerable investment.  There are many problems in this area and Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned some of them.  From inquiries I made I learned that very few ships coming into Irish waters ever inquire about the possibility of waste reception facilities.  For example, in Waterford, Bell Shipping have their own waste reception facilities; but, apart from Bell Shipping, one agent said that he was asked once about ten years ago about waste reception facilities.  No other agent had been asked about such facilities.  In Dublin Port, Guinness have their own waste reception facilities; but over a two year period, apart from Guinness, 7,000 vessels came into Dublin Port and only 130 applied for waste reception facilities.</P>
    <P>What are ships doing with the waste they generate while they are on a voyage? The answer is quite simple &mdash; they are discharging it and dumping it into the <Col N="543" /> sea.  One of the reasons for that is the cost in relation to the disposal of waste when ships are in port.  I was informed that the cost of removing waste from even a small vessel in Dublin Port is in the region of £300 to £400, which seems extremely high, given that Dublin County Council charge £30 for the deep burial of the same waste in a county council tiphead.  There is the double problem of, on the one hand, waste reception facilities not being sought or indeed being available and, one the other, that the charges by private operators are so high as to discourage ships from seeking reception facilities for their waste.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of the efforts made over a period of six months by the British Secretary of State, Peter Brooke, to achieve political progress in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government have consistently supported the Secretary of State's initiative.  We have been as helpful and as positive as possible.  We have engaged in an intensive programme of discussions and at least eight meetings have been held at ministerial level with the British in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a large extent there has been a common approach by the two Governments. The key element of this common approach was that there should be three sets of talks within the same timeframe: (1) internal between the political parties in the North of Ireland; (2) North-South between the political parties in the North <Col N="544" /> and the Irish Government; and (3) East-West between the British and Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>It was generally acceptable on all sides that the ultimate outcome of the exercise might well be some new agreement or arrangement which would transcend the existing Anglo-Irish Agreement.  There was also a general acceptance that the three relationships, internal, North-South, East-West, would be the essential subject matter of the talks.</P>
    <P>Various formulate governing the operaction of the Intergovernmental Conference and the Secretariat have been proposed and discussed.  While substantial progress has been made on a number of important aspects &mdash; progress which we believe can be built on at an early date &mdash; a satisfactory basis which would avoid problems later and ensure success has not yet been fully established. Further consultations with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are necessary at this stage but we are confident that a satisfactory formula and basis for meaningful discussions can be found.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State has referred to the constitutional question even if only, to use his words, in the hope of putting it to one side.  In the same spirit, I will confine myself to saying that my view on this matter does not correspond with that of the Secretary of State.</P>
    <P>I have, through the courtesy of the Secretary of State, been able to secure for Deputies a copy of the relevant part of the Secretary of State's statement in the House of Commons today which I hope they have now in their hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Secretary of State through the Taoiseach, but it is unfortunate that I did not get a copy of the statement in sufficient time to make a detailed study of it.  I want to respond briefly because I think we are all conscious of the sensitive timing now.  In one sense the Secretary of State's speech today in the House of Commons is disappointing in as much as various Government leaks, not necessarily from this side, in the papers had led us to believe there would be a substantial statement from <Col N="545" /> the Secretary of State announcing the commencement of talks that would lead to some form of agreement between the parties in the North, the Irish Government and the British Government about the future in the North of Ireland.  Unfortunately, evidently he did not feel capable of making such a statement or thought it was not possible to do so at this stage.  I regret that.</P>
      <P>I hope the Secretary of State will continue in his commendable efforts.  I have watched with some admiration his nimble-footedness in trying to get the parties in the North to come to agreement in the last number of months.  It is not easy.  Progress has been extremely slow. Every bit of the structure must be put in place before he can move on another inch.  He has shown himself to be quite sure-footed in handling this.</P>
      <P>I say to the Government that they have adopted in the last few months an attitude of encouraging the Secretary of State in what he is trying to do while holding firm to the Anglo-Irish Agreement which means so much to the Nationalists in Northern Ireland.  If, over the summer, the prospect of talks and the work being done by the Secretary of State should continue, I recommend to the Government that they continue in that role as well, saying as little as possible, holding firm to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and giving the Secretary of State every opportunity available to him to bring together the people in the North so as to bring about what we all, whether in the House of Commons, the Dáil, the North or the South, Nationalists or Unionists want to see, that is, peace and reconciliation on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall indeed be brief. First let me express my disappointment in relation to what the Taoiseach has had to say regarding the statement made in the House of Commons by Secretary of State, Peter Brooke.  We have been led to believe for some months now that the Secretary of State would have been in a position to make a serious announcement to report progress on his efforts to get <Col N="546" /> talks going in Northern Ireland.  While I am disappointed at the failure to reach that stage, one has to admire the efforts being made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  He started out from a very difficult position but it would appear that he has made, as he himself described it in his contribution in the House of Commons, modest progress.  It is very difficult on this side of the House to assess the level of the progress or to quantify the progress that has been made because we have very little information available to us.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Taoiseach and I noted at the end he confined his remarks to saying that his view and that of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland do not coincide.  I trust that therein does not lie the problem of the conflict between the Government and the British Government. The Anglo-Irish Agreement has stood the test of time and it is important that it is not cast aside easily.  I have had some worries over the last number of months hearing various sides in Northern Ireland and the Taoiseach saying they are quite prepared to replace the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  I believe people are talking about totally opposite things and concepts when they talk about replacing the Anglo-Irish Agreement and that, &ldquo;ne'er the twain shall meet.&rdquo;  It is important in the context of these talks that the three-way relationship is kept to the forefront. Perhaps it is timely that the Provisional IRA stop the mayhem they are causing in Northern Ireland to allow these talks to take place in a better atmosphere.  I concur with the statements made by the Minister for Justice last night in the Seanad in relation to calling on the Provisional IRA to stop the mayhem in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>While we are disappointed, we can only hope that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will persist.  It is very important that the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland are brought to a position where they can, by way of dialogue, sit around the table and work out between themselves a solution for the political affairs of Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Taoiseach for circulating the copy of Mr. Brooke's statement.  I received it only a short while ago and, having leafed through it, I think what he has said should be welcomed.  Obviously we need to study it in more detail.  It runs to something like ten pages and obviously the points he makes have been considered and are clearly aimed at giving an assurance to all those involved in the talks with him at this time that they have nothing in particular to fear.  His statement goes some way towards clarifying the present position in regard to proposals for talks between the political parties in Northern Ireland.  It is regrettable to some extent that he has not been in a position to report more progress, but we have to be satisfied with what progress is being made.  For so long no progress at all has been reported.  We should pay tribute to Mr. Brooke and admit that in a very difficult situation he has achieved far more than most people thought possible when he was first appointed to his position as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is clear that the Brooke initiative and the whole potential for political progress in Northern Ireland is now very delicately balanced and the maximum of goodwill and flexibility is required on all sides if the whole process is not to founder.  There is a particular obligation on our own Government to show the maximum degree of political flexibility and not to place unnecessary obstacles in the way of dialogue between the parties in Northern Ireland.  The essential prerequisite for progress in Northern Ireland is the opening of dialogue between the democratic political parties there, and there is unlikely to be significant progress on other matters such as cross-Border co-operation or British-Irish relations until this dialogue has started.  While the Anglo-Irish Agreement recognises the interest of Government in political developments in Northern Ireland, I argue that there can be no justification for the Government of the Republic seeking to exercise a veto of any kind over progress towards a political <Col N="548" /> settlement in the North.  That the Dublin Government should become directly involved in the dialogue should not be considered to be a matter of such importance as to threaten the whole process.</P>
    <P>This question should be deferred and considered later in the context of what progress has been made between the political parties within Northern Ireland. Any Government or party who adopt an intransigent attitude will bear a heavy responsibility.  Should the fragile progress made so far be smashed, one risks condemning the people of Northern Ireland to many more years of violence and destruction with a consequent over-spill of violence and security costs in the Republic.</P>
    <P>It is not a reflection on those who negotiated the Anglo-Irish Agreement to say that the accord has not brought the progress that it was hoped it would bring. Progress has been made in some areas, but in others the very existence of the agreement has contributed to the political <i>impasse.</i> Sectarianism remains entrenched, the murderous campaign of the Provisional IRA continues to take an appalling toll in Northern Ireland, in Britain and, indeed, on the Continent. Most important of all, the Anglo-Irish Agreement created a situation which made political dialogue in Northern Ireland virtually impossible.  While we initially supported the Anglo-Irish Agreement, we never considered that it should be viewed as having been written on tablets of stone.  If the Anglo-Irish Agreement is not delivering it must be replaced by a new arrangement that will assist in the peace process.</P>
    <P>I conclude by welcoming to the House Deputy Currie from Northern Ireland. It is an important development that a former Northern Ireland politician is capable of sitting in this House and is happy to do so.  It would be helpful to the parties in this House if the Taoiseach would take an opportunity at an early date to brief the Leaders of the parties in Opposition as to what precisely is being discussed between himself and the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will enable the Minister to make regulations about the operation and construction of vessels but there is a matter which is omitted and which is an omission in the whole MARPOL process, and it has to do with the problem of ships flying flags of convenience using badly trained, badly paid crews.  The IMO have already expressed concern about many of the ships on the seas and about the problem of badly trained and badly paid crews.  This problem has already contributed to accidents on the seas and the indications are that the tragedy of the <i>Scandinavian Star,</i> for example, was caused because it was crewed by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but an element of conversation can be heard in the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The indications are that the tragedy on the <i>Scandinavian Star</i> was caused because the vessel's crew appeared to have difficulty in understanding the basic safety instructions and procedures on board that vessel.  The problem of ships flying flags of convenience and exploiting crews from Third World countries will have to be faced. What is now happening is that shipping magnates by using the flag of convenience and the badly trained crew, are avoiding the use of properly trained seamen who might be organised into trade unions and require proper conditions of employment. Ships operating under the flag of convenience can avoid their responsibilities under MARPOL.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that it is perhaps the more responsible states who have <Col N="550" /> ratified MARPOL and that the big difficulty in relation to shipping and the problem of pollution from ships is likely to arise from ships operating under flags of convenience whose crews are badly trained.  There must be an EC initiative on this.  There is a case for member states of the Community to come together to try to ensure that as far as possible vessels operating in the waters of the European Community are properly crewed by trained seamen so that the danger to our coastline from badly equipped, badly designed and badly crewed ships is reduced or eliminated.</P>
    <P>Nuclear waste has been mentioned and Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan and Deputy Taylor-Quinn mentioned vessels which will be carrying nuclear waste to Sellafield. The Minister would need to clarify this, because with the opening of the THORP plant at Sellafield in 1992 and the increasing volume of nuclear waste which is to be transported to sellafield, a lot of the waste, particularly that coming from Japan, will be transported by sea. The ships will travel through the Irish Sea.  The Minister should clarify what powers, if any, the ratification of MARPOL will give to the Irish Government to control that transportation. What would happen, for example, if one of these vessels got into trouble and had to come into our territorial waters? Would such a vessel be exempted under section 4 of this Bill?  We also need clarification about the position of nuclear submarines operating in the Irish Sea.  We now know that the Irish Sea is a highway for nuclear submarines.  A number of incidents have already occurred which have not been satisfactorily explained and there is a great threat to our safety from these vessels.  What is the position if one of those submarines, or any of the naval vessels which travel the Irish Sea, get into difficulties and want to come into Irish waters?</P>
    <P>That brings me to my main reservations about this Bill, my reservations about section 4.  I am alarmed by section 4 which states that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> This Act shall not apply to any warship or to any ship for the time being used by the government of any country for purposes other than commercial purposes.</P>
    <P>We must ask why such an exemption is being made.  Ireland does not have any warships so it is clear that this section is intended to exempt warships of other countries from the provisions of this Bill. As a result the Government will not be able to make inquiries about the cargoes being carried by naval vessels entering our waters.  Recently in reply to a question put by me the Taoiseach gave the House an assurance that the governments of visiting naval vessels were informed of Ireland's neutral, non-nuclear position and that these governments were then expected to honour this by ensuring that their naval vessels visiting our ports were not carrying nuclear weapons.  The Minister, in the course of his address this evening, repeated this assurance.</P>
    <P>In relation to the right of naval vessels to transit our territorial waters, the Minister stated that specific authorisation to exercise this right or to give notification that it has been exercised is not necessary, but where a foreign naval vessel wishes to visit an Irish port the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is necessary before the visit can take place. He also pointed out that section 23 permits a harbour master to refuse entry into a harbour if he believes a ship not to be in compliance with certificate requirements or to be a serious threat to the environment, the harbour or other ships.  The section also enables the Minister to require the owners or masters of all ships, or any classes of ship, to give notice of entry or intended entry into Irish territorial waters.</P>
    <P>Section 17 enables the Minister to have surveyors of ships or inspectors, appointed by him under warrant, to carry out surveys, inspections and tests to ensure compliance with MARPOL standards. The provisions of section 4 do not apply to warships.  Up to now the Minister <Col N="552" /> for Foreign Affairs contacted the government of a visiting naval vessel and expected to get some kind of gentleman's agreement whereby, for example, nuclear or chemical weapons would not be carried on board a vessel entering an Irish port.  However, the provisions of this legislation will not apply to any warship with the result that no such inquiries may be made.  Therefore it will not be possible under this Bill to exercise control over naval vessels entering our waters. Warships, perhaps carrying nuclear or chemical weapons, will be able to enter our territorial waters and ports without being the subject of an inquiry by the Government.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, MARPOL provides for an exemption of warships on the high seas but does not place an obligation on individual states to provide for an exemption in domestic legislation which is intended primarily to cover territorial waters.  The question which must be asked is, what would warships be doing inside our 12 mile limit in the first place. It seems the reason for providing for an exemption in what otherwise is excellent legislation is that following the enactment of the Single European Act the Government are determined to gradually dismantle our neutrality.  It would be too risky politically to formally abandon neutrality. Therefore, it appears to be their strategy to gradually legislate it away. This is the first legislative measure to be brought before this House aimed at the abandonment of Irish neutrality.  It is cynical&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reasons for providing for an exemption of warships.  Why is this Sea Pollution Bill providing for an exemption of warships in our territorial waters?  Given that we do not have any warships the Government are being cynical in using the Sea Pollution Bill, which is good legislation and has the support of this House, to camouflage what I consider to be the most serious legislative <Col N="553" /> threat to Irish neutrality during the past 40 years.  I do not think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is there in black and white in the Bill which provides for an exemption of warships entering our waters.  Many people and organisations during the years have expressed concern about naval vessels entering our ports and are wondering if they are carrying chemical or nuclear weapons.  Up to now at least we had the assurance, regardless of what credence could be attached to it, that the Government were exercising some control and were encouraging the governments of the vessels entering our ports to ensure that they were not carrying nuclear or chemical weapons.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for a blanket exemption of such vessels.  This is both dangerous and unacceptable.  Therefore I intend tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to have that section deleted from the Bill.  I regret that it has been included in what otherwise is good and non-controversial legislation.</P>
      <P>While on this occasion we are ratifying a global international convention on the sea, we should consider the position in relation to the Irish Sea.  It has been found that the existing agreements between individual states very often are effective in tackling the problems of sea pollution and other maritime problems but the time has come to consider whether an Irish Sea Conference should be established given the dangers posed by Sellafield, nuclear vessels and pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in welcoming the Bill.  As Deputy Gilmore said, the Bill has been widely welcomed.  It would be impossible for us to exaggerate the importance of the Bill to our tourism industry, mariculture and commercial fishing, all of which have been referred to, and in terms of the use of our beaches and the seas around us for recreational purposes by the people. Coming as I do from an area down south which can boast of a number of natural amenities, such as Cork Harbour which <Col N="554" /> we loosely describe as probably the best natural harbour in the world and Bantry Bay, the best deep water facility in Europe, I am acutely aware of the dangers we have faced in the past and the potential of these areas.</P>
      <P>This Bill is timely and I use the word deliberately, as Deputy Gilmore asked why it has taken so long to introduce the Bill.  It is fair to say we were not ready to introduce it.  We first had to await the announcement of the environment action programme, which is to be implemented during the next ten years.  Quite frankly, it would have amounted to hypocrisy to demand that shippers use facilities which were not available in ports.  The Bill is timely because these facilities will now be provided.  The Minister is to be congratulated in that regard.  There were many instances in the past of the horrors of major disasters such as the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and others.  We are all aware from these instances of what can happen on a specific occasion but we are less aware of the on-going damage that has been done, intentionally or otherwise, over the years involving small amounts of oil when emptying ballast tanks.  This Bill will enable us to look at this problem and to control it.  I am not suggesting that it will be the answer to all our problems but it will put in place controls which may be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the arguments advanced is that we are a small island race and are dependent on the sea around us.  We should welcome every piece of legislation that is geared towards protecting those seas.  I have given a few examples of places, Cork Harbour and Bantry Bay, but around the coast there are dozens of fishing harbours, inlets and areas which are used for commercial purposes related to the sea which have to be protected and we must have the means of protecting them.  How we do that is not totally up to ourselves because we are now in an international context and we have, under the MARPOL Convention, the method of dealing with this problem.  This convention will not just deal with our own situation; it will deal with foreign shipping and also our ships which are using <Col N="555" /> international ports.  For all those reasons I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>Questions have been asked about the Bill and obviously replies will be forthcoming from the Minister. Some people brought up the question of nuclear substances or radioactive substances.  Listening to the first Opposition speaker today it struck me that there was a question mark over the ability of inspectors to carry out normal monitoring of substances on board ship, the facilities on board ship and the standards on board ship.  We were also questioned as to whether these people would not be available. I suggest they will be available to do the normal run of the mill testing and checking but they would not be available for the highly technical testing in regard to nuclear or radioactive substances.  For highly technical testing one would be seeking out a physicist or the equivalent. When people asked me about this, that was the answer I gave because I felt it was a highly specialised section and it was correct that it should be under the aegis of the Nuclear Energy Board.  I agree with the Nuclear Energy Board being in charge of that area.  Having said that, obviously, other points were raised which are open to question and with which, I am sure, the Minister will deal.  We have all heard the arguments about warships etc., coming into Cork Harbour and elsewhere. I am sure the Minister will deal with that too and will probably outline for us the existing routine, the future position and the possible banning of these substances.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the threat from oil leakage, deliberate or otherwise.  There are many other areas referred to in the Bill.  Garbage &mdash; it is probable that most of us would not have used the term &mdash; is the greatest pollutant we come across nowadays.  For those of us who use harbour areas, especially in the south coast, it is frightening to walk those beaches because of garbage.  One of the new blights appears to be Spanish wine bottles.  I do not know whether that has anything to do with the fishing fleets <Col N="556" /> coming in or visitors returning from the World Cup, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will be included along with plastics and other garbage.  I do not know whether we should keep out the Spanish trawlers or the bottles.  The control of garbage has become very important.  It rivals the small discharge of oil and diesel oil which may be emitted from ships.  We have very efficient staff in most of the port areas but I am sure I will be forgiven for singling out Cork Harbour with which I am <i>au fait.</i> I pay tribute to the people involved in these areas, the harbour commissioners and the management in the harbours.  In the Cork area they have been seeking legislation such as this.  They have done a magnificent job over the past five years in revitalising Cork Harbour, but they need the back up legislation.  Likewise, in regard to the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> we saw how the staff were able to deal with a major accident of international significance. There was no panic and they dealt with it, but the legislation is needed to enable them to make the decisions and to enforce those decision.  In the legislation and in the Minister's thinking there is a difference between the international pollution of the marine environment and the accidental discharge, both of which must be dealt with differently. Accidents must be dealt with in a different way to the deliberate polluting of the area.  Deputy G. O'Sullivan referred to the person in the small vessel throwing a bag of garbage over the side. That is as much of a criminal act as throwing large amounts of garbage from a bigger ship.  A different approach is needed in these two areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is part of an overall programme.  One of the important aspects of our beaches and seas is that they would be available for recreational purposes for our own people.  We have to deal with sewage being dumped and pumped from the land into the seas.  Now that we have begun, it is appropriate that we would also do the opposite and take care of <Col N="557" /> the shipping side.  We need to control pollution from the land.  A massive amount of money is being set aside for that purpose.  This proves we are not only becoming aware of the hazards to the environment but we are acting on them. The people involved must be congratulated.</P>
    <P>During the term of the Irish Presidency we used the term &ldquo;A Green Presidency&rdquo;, and many people scoffed at us.  When we look at the legislation which is being debated and the massive financial commitment we can be happy that this programme is beginning to be put in place. The list of polluting materials is endless. There is a need to broaden the definition considerably.  The present legislation is drafted in such a way that it will help us in the future because it is sufficiently flexible to identify many more polluting materials and to include them.</P>
    <P>Countries that deviate from the various conventions or international agreements were mentioned by Deputy Gilmore. That is something over which we have no control.  I do not think the enactment of this Bill would mean that general legislation would be any less binding on any country.  We should do our own thing in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan mentioned the design of ships.  I have no doubt that the overall MARPOL Convention provisions will cover this aspect, that it will not be something which will be left to our Minister.  Generally, it is now common knowledge that short cuts were taken in the design of ships heretofore, probably through lack of knowledge.  For example bays or container sections of giant oil tankers were much too large.</P>
    <P>Many design changes could be effected without enormous costs being incurred. It is simply a matter of being aware of the hazards involved and acting thereon. In many cases it would involve simple buttressing or partitioning of areas into smaller sections, which would not be very costly.  I would not want to be party to a scare about oil companies being unwilling to incur such cost.  It is my belief that they will accept the requisite cost.  The consequences of any accident at sea are <Col N="558" /> so severe they would be involved in compensating for any damage caused in the event of leakage.</P>
    <P>Therefore it will be seen that one of the main factors of these standards is the design of vessels.  Obviously, mistakes were made in the design of ore and oil carriers which needed to be rectified.  Its rectification involved prudent thinking as much as incurring the cost involved.  This is all about guiding people down the right path.  I would not be too worried about it.  Nonetheless, it would be essential that we be party to ensuring that ships are properly designed for trading in our waters.  The two or three accidents which occurred worldwide &mdash; not in Irish waters &mdash; arose because the ships involved had not been properly designed, bad design features being the main cause.  Hopefully, that aspect will be rectified.</P>
    <P>There are five or six other issues involved and there is the danger of somebody with a little knowledge endeavouring to describe any one of them.  The MARPOL Convention deals with the prevention of pollution by harmful substances carried by sea in packaged forms or in freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons and so on.  Such pollution potential needed to be addressed. In the case of Cork Harbour, which is becoming one of the fastest movers of container traffic, it was important that this type of legislation be introduced. One hears reports of portable tanks being washed overboard vessels and so on.  If there is not legislation in existance to cover such contingency one is helpless to do anything about it; it will be contended that such contingency is not covered by legislation.  We can worry about the policing of the legislation later.  I welcome all of the five annexes to the MARPOL Convention; they are indeed timely.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this Bill the importance of tourism should be highlighted, because economically we will become more and more dependent on tourism.  Unfortunately, one isolated oil leakage can receive attention worldwide, as was the case in Alaska recently, and can do untold damage internationally.  It is <Col N="559" /> essential that we strengthen our legislative hand in this respect, which can only be to our mutual benefit.  We must strive to keep oil and garbage off our beaches not alone for our sake but for the benefit of tourists generally.  It is generally recognised now that our beaches are not as clean as heretofore.  One only has to walk along them at low tide when it is frightening to note the variety and extent of garbage strewn about.</P>
    <P>The questions of badly trained crews, ships flying flags of convenience and so on were mentioned earlier.  Perhaps the Minister would reply to the points raised in that connection.  I note that there is reference to the equipping of ships, but I wonder if the training of crews would be included.  Payment of any crew is a matter for an individual company or country but the standard of and facilities for their adequate training is a matter of international importance and should be covered, as also should safety equipment and so on.</P>
    <P>The question of the contamination of the Irish Sea was raised.  Nobody has a monopoly when it comes to worrying about that or in seeking solutions thereto. The Nuclear Energy Board would be the appropriate body to deal with that problem. People involved in mariculture and related industries have been worried about pollution caused by oil, particularly diesel oil, probably arising from cleaning of bilges and that type of thing.  I was asked to raise this issue because diesel oils in particular have a disastrous effect on mariculture.</P>
    <P>It was my understanding that there was a register of all vessels carrying passengers no matter how few.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm that I am correct in this assumption.  I understood they had to undergo an annual surveillance test and be registered to carry passengers.</P>
    <P>Gas and oil exploration at sea were raised also.  There is a number of service vessels involved in this exploration which I would presume would be covered by the provisions of this Bill.  I know they are registered in a somewhat different fashion from other vessels, I am thinking <Col N="560" /> of those that serve oil rigs and so on. Perhaps the Minister would confirm that they would be covered by the provisions of this Bill or, if not, whether they would fall within the ambit of legislation in the energy area.  There appears to be a difficulty in collecting the charges for the clean-up in relation to the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i> Will this be taken care of in the new legislation?  If it will be, I would welcome that also.</P>
    <P>Again I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  It is right that this should be brought forward when we are capable of implementing the requirements in it.  One of the annexes concerns the facilities for disposing of sewage and garbage in port.  It is high time this was introduced.  I welcome the fact that there is a clear distinction made between intentional pollution and accidental discharge, because there is a world of difference between these two happenings. I welcome the legislation and I appreciate that we will have more time to discuss it on Committee and remaining Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister for bringing it forward.  One of my memories of the quays of Cork in my younger days was the sight of the deckhands emptying the buckets of waste over the side of the ships.  Thankfully that is now a thing of the past.</P>
      <P>Employment creation and environmental protection are burning political issues at present and they are interlinked. Back in 1982 or 1983, if one attempted to raise the question of environmental pollution it was a non-event because it was not a political issue and very few took the growing problem seriously.  It is now a major political issue.  In fact we have a political party built around the whole environmental protection issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a reputation abroad as being environmentally clean.  We are on the western approaches to Europe and we are the envy of Europe because of our good record in relation to environmental protection.  The big challenge facing us is to maintain that reputation.  Our tourism <Col N="561" /> industry depends on it.  Our employment creation depends on it.  There is a huge potential, unfortunately not yet tapped, in our marine resources.  If we do not get our act together in relation to marine pollution we will be unable to develop that untapped potential in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The problem of pollution is not only a transnational one but, since Chernobyl, a trans-continental one, and must be treated as such.  I hope we as a nation will carry out our responsibilities under this enabling legislation and that the Minister will introduce the necessary regulations as quickly as possible so that we can protect the environment around our coast and ensure that others do likewise in regard to their coasts.  I wonder if we are capable of ensuring that people abide by the laws of this country?  Has our Navy the ability to protect our environment against the irresponsible acts that can take place in our territorial waters?  Our Navy has the onerous duty of protecting our fisheries and there is an ongoing battle between them and what I call the Spanish marauders on the south coast who are taking up most of the time and facilities that the Navy have.  I would, therefore, question the ability of the Navy and of our Air Corps to carry out the work that will be necessary to protect our coast.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, propose that this country should take things a step further within the European theatre.  The European Community has a number of landlocked nations that still have a responsibility to us as an island nation.  We should be putting forward a proposal for a European marine corps which would protect the resources around its island nations. What is an Irish resource is also a European resource, and the responsibility to protect it should not fall on us alone. That is why I suggest the concept of a European marine corps involving ships and aircraft.  Light spotter planes could go out and pinpoint the whereabouts of the culprits who are breaking the law just off our coast, in our territorial waters. There are factory ships off our coast at present, not alone chasing our fishing <Col N="562" /> stock but processing the fish off our coast and thousands of tons of offal are being dumped from these ships every year. Action should be taken on that because that is a major source of pollution.</P>
    <P>Since 1982 I have been raising the nuclear issue in this House.  Things have not got better but worse.  With the coming into commission in Britain of the new nuclear reprocessing plant, in 1992, the problem will be even more serious.  We will have the nuclear waste of Japan, West Germany, and other nations that have nuclear installations, shipping spent, out-of-date nuclear waste to the new reprocessing plant for regeneration and reprocessing.  The level of traffic coming through the Irish Sea will increase with a resulting increase in the risk and the danger.  I do not want to exaggerate the risk or make the kind of alarmist statements that were made in the past. There is, however, a risk which I do not think has been considered and I regret that there is no reference whatever in this Bill to the transportation of nuclear waste through the Irish Sea to the west coast of Britain.</P>
    <P>I have visited Sellafield on a number of occasions.  I raised this issue with British Nuclear Fuels and with senior officials in the Department of Energy in London who met a group of us in Sellafield just two-and-a-half years ago.  The assurances we got from these people at the time did not satisfy me.  I would ask that more consideration be given to this growing problem.</P>
    <P>Aside from the transportation of spent nuclear fuels to the west coast of Britain via the Irish Sea, there is the question of low level nuclear waste being dumped by Britain.  Just three years ago they proposed to dump low level nuclear waste off the south-west coast of Ireland.  Could the Minister tell us how he proposes to deal with that under legislation?  Nuclear discharges from land and the dumping of nuclear waste from ships are dealt with in the Paris and London Conventions, but these are only conventions which are not binding on the member states.  There should be some legislation to deal with this matter.  I would ask the Minister to <Col N="563" /> give us some of his thoughts on this serious problem.</P>
    <P>Britain has not disposed of this waste. It is storing it on land at present but that arrangement cannot last indefinitely.  In the foreseeable future they will either dig caverns under the Irish Sea or proceed to dump off the south-west coast.  I would ask the Minister to deal with this matter. We are very much confined in our stance against Britain and other nations because of our lack of success in bringing forward legislation to deal with the disposal of our waste substances.  We do not have legislation dealing with toxic waste or low-level nuclear waste that comes from our universities and health institutions. British Nuclear Fuels pointed out to me two years ago that we are quick to criticise their <i>modus operandi</i> but we have not got our own act together.  We must face up to our responsibilities before we can insist that other countries behave responsibly.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with matters that have been already mentioned but I would like to refer to the question of the incineration of toxic chemicals.  This is covered in the legislation but only where it occurs within our territorial waters.  I would like to know how the International Maritime Organisation deal with incineration by chemical incinerator ships in mid-Atlantic?  Ultimately the dioxons and other chemicals which are incinerated into the atmosphere will eventually fall into the sea by rainfall.  I would like to know what monitoring or surveillance is carried out of these incinerator ships in isolated locations such as the mid-Atlantic.  This is a matter that has not been addressed in the Bill &mdash; perhaps I am wrong &mdash; and I would like the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <P>The exemption of warships from the Bill is a serious flaw.  The Fine Gael spokesperson on the marine, Deputy Taylor-Quinn, has already referred to this matter, and I understand she will be putting down an amendment to this section.  We would like the Minister to say why he has excluded warships from the legislation.  Deputy Gilmore raised <Col N="564" /> the question of neutrality, which is a wider issue to be debated some other time, but it raises doubts about the Government's attitude to visiting warships and the guarantees from other Governments regarding nuclear weapons on board.  We deserve an explanation why this matter is excluded from the legislation.</P>
    <P>The registration of small craft was mentioned by a number of Deputies. Deputy Taylor-Quinn raised this matter during Question Time and in the Estimates debates last year, and the Minister said he would make a decision in the near future.  The time has come for the registration of small craft.  We need to know where they are operating and if they are breaking the law.  As regards the safety aspect, there should be a set of standards for these small craft.</P>
    <P>A disjointed effort has been made by all Governments in relation to environment protection.  On one occasion I counted ten State agencies dealing with this matter.  In some areas there is duplication while in others there are serious gaps, resulting in a very disjointed effort to protect our environment.  One arm of Government is introducing legislation to protect our marine environment while at the same time other arms of Government are involved in pumping sewage into our harbours, rivers and seas.  In other words, one arm of Government is in the act of prevention while another arm of Government is in the act of pollution.  I hope that in the months ahead the long-awaited Environment Protection Agency Bill will address that chaotic situation.  Each Government Department do their own thing, with very little evidence of co-operation and exchange of views. Despite the reservations I have expressed, I welcome the principle of the Bill.  It is another small step towards protecting our environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I would give a guarded welcome to this Bill.  What we are dealing with here is the ratification of the MARPOL Convention of 1973.  What has happened in the 17 years since that convention was signed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> All parties in Government since &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party &mdash; should examine their consciences and ask themselves why it has taken 17 years to bring this very urgent legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>It may not be generally known just how serious the problem of sea pollution is. There is nothing new about sea pollution. Marine craft of all sizes and nationalities have continuously dumped rubbish, fishing nets and other debris into the ocean since the beginning of time.  However, the biodegradable nature of rubbish in earlier times made it almost invisible. Fishing nets were once made of natural materials which would fall to the seabed and quickly decompose, but unfortunately today's rubbish does not usually sink when thrown overboard.  Most of these materials float.  They are buoyant materials and are not invisible.  Discarded plastic materials are beginning to fill the world's oceans, some of them remaining there for up to 400 years.</P>
    <P>No-one is without blame.  We cannot point our finger at the plastics industry. The real problem is that people use the oceans like bins.  Furthermore, plastic is not the only problem.  Marine debris also includes items such as tyres, rope, glass, cans, rubber and so on.  Marine plastic debris is classified according to its source and nature, land-based or ocean-sourced, industrial or domestic.  Land-based waste can be discarded by careless beach visitors or discharged from sewerage systems and manufacturing.  Ocean-sourced waste comes from recreational boats, offshore oil and gas rigs, merchant vessels, commercial fishing boats, cruise ships and military and research vessels.  Industrial plastics include fishing materials, large sheets of plastic, polypropylene strapping, hard hats from oil rigs and so on. Domestic plastic ranges from bottles, bags, cups, egg cartons, toys, utensils, syringes and balloons to six-pack wrappers. Polystyrene, which can be of domestic or industrial origin, is regarded as a major contributor to the plastic debris problem.  Some of this debris ends up in the sea by accident and some deliberately. Although almost impossible to <Col N="566" /> trace the exact source of a particular piece of floating rubbish, the general origin of certain types of debris, such as fishing material, is obvious.</P>
    <P>The effect of this waste is devastating to marine life and to our wellbeing.  A six-pack wrapper left on the beach attracts the attention of a scavenging seabird whose head gets stuck in one of the loops; it cannot feed, so it slowly starves to death.  In heavy seas large sheets of plastic are swept overboard which later get stuck in the propellers of a fishing trawler.  Due to heavy storms an urban sewerage system is unable to cope with its load and large quantities of untreated waste are delivered straight into coastal waters.  This is not something unusual for this country since that is the way we deal with most of our sewage anyway.  Nearby beaches become littered with plastic tampon applicators, disposable nappies, syringes and condoms &mdash; a bit like Dollymount Strand, really.</P>
    <P>It is discouraging that green hype has reached this House from the consumer shelves.  The Minister, fresh from a disappointing green Presidency, hallows the EC Council Declaration which is no more than waffle.  He also wishes to praise his own Government's Environmental Action Programme which merely treats every type of environmental ill with a different type of sticking plaster.  As a green representative it is hard to get excited about any of this hype and it is useful to have a chance to say so.</P>
    <P>The Bill is well-intentioned in seeking to formalise these international conventions on the sea.  In certain respects it should be possible for a country such as ours to improve on the conditions of such conventions in our legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on one disgraceful aspect of this Bill which is set out in section 4.  The Minister referred to this matter in his contribution and we find his attitude quite unacceptable.  The convention, which we must accept in full or not at all, allows military ships to come and go as they please while not being subject to these pollution laws.  Why should we, a neutral and peaceful nation, <Col N="567" /> accept such nonsense from these international terrorists with their weapons of destruction?  We should deny them access to our waters if they will not be bound by our pollution laws.  If this is not so, they should certainly be kept out of our ports. The Minister stated that permission for port visits is normally granted to foreign naval vessels, provided the visit does not form part of a naval exercise and that nuclear weapons are not being carried. We know this to be absolutely false.  The response to the visit to Cork last March by the nuclear-armed <i>Yorktown</i> was, &ldquo;ask no questions and you will be told no lies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this legislation which is disturbing is that it is full of references to legislation.  When it all boils down, is there anything in this legislation at all?  It will need teeth and I hope the Minister will get stuck into the regulations as soon as possible.  The matter is extremely urgent and certainly we will be pressing very strongly to see that he deals with these regulations.</P>
    <P>One very simple matter which still has not been dealt with, although the Minister stated some months ago that it could be dealt with without this legislation, is the provision of refuse skips in the main ports.  A very small number of ports here have refuse skips.  Even in that simple way the Minister could improve matters. Ships are coming into our ports looking for somewhere to dump rubbish and because of lack of facilities they are taking it out again and dumping it at sea. The crews of visiting ships are appalled when they come here for the first time to find that many of our ports do not have such skips.  They cannot believe it.  They have to dispose of this waste and most do so by dumping it into the sea as soon as they leave port.  The provision of skips is a simple and relatively cheap method of solving this problem and I would ask the Minister to cut through the red tape and get skips in place.  We will certainly put down amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my gratitude to Deputies for a long and detailed <Col N="568" /> analysis of the provisions of the Bill. Deputy Taylor-Quinn indicated that the Bill was worthwhile and I am grateful for her remarks.  She emphasised, as I did, that all five annexes are brought into action by this Bill.  We are not excluding, as we might have done, any of the five.  I take her point that even younger ships must be properly monitored. There have been some worries about the quality of steel in some ships and we have seen the huge gashes made by the waves in the Atlantic, the results of which we had to deal with when the ships reached our shores.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to warships and nuclear power.  The exemptions are simply in accordance with the MARPOL Convention.  I do not think Deputies listened very carefully to what I said in my speech.  Parts I and IV deal with the more standard provisions of a Bill.  Section 4 of Part I provides for the exemption of warships from the Act.  This is in keeping with the MARPOL Convention which we are bringing into effect. We are <i>en rapport</i> with the MARPOL provisions.  It is also in keeping with our Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956. Deputy Gilmore indicated that there had been some change in this regard.  I repeat that foreign naval vessels are entitled under international law to transit the territorial waters of another state in exercise of a right of innocent passage.  Specific authorisation is not needed to exercise this right, nor is it necessary even to give notification.  However, when a foreign naval vessel wishes to visit an Irish port the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is and will continue to be necessary, even after the enactment of this legislation.  Permission is normally granted provided the visit does not form part of a naval exercise and nuclear weapons are not being carried.  It is important to emphasise that point, lest there be any wrong interpretation of this Bill or any attempt to sensationalise it.</P>

      <P>We will never know because Governments like the Government of the United States will never disclose whether <Col N="569" /> they are carrying nuclear weapons anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>All Governments are more than jealous about giving information about submarines and so on, but surely for good international relations, if a Minister for Foreign Affairs in this country gets an assurance from another government we are entitled to expect that a conscientious government when so doing will be telling the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not get such an assurance because they refuse to disclose whether or not they are carrying nuclear weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of this Government not to grant permission to nuclear-powered vessels or to vessels carrying nuclear weapons to enter Irish ports.  That is Government policy.  When an application for a visit is received in the Department of Foreign Affairs, all necessary consultations take place with the appropriate authorities to ensure that the conditions I have just mentioned to the Deputy are complied with.  It is a matter of honour between governments and I accept that when the Department of Foreign Affairs are dealing with this situation, they get assurances and they satisfy themselves before they permit this to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now continue to reply to Deputy Taylor-Quinn's contribution.  The Deputy asked how many marine surveyors and engineers are employed and the answer is that there are 18 staff in all, between surveyors and engineers in my Department, who are highly qualified and very competent.  I have already mentioned the incident with the <i>Tribulus</i> in Bantry Bay.  Our surveyors and engineers handled a very difficult situation with great competence and firmness and therefore they also succeeded in getting great co-operation from the company concerned.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn among others made a point about the European Community during the course of the debate.  Naturally, I indicated to the House that all the member states, with <Col N="570" /> the exception of Luxembourg, which does not have a sea coast subscribe to the MARPOL Convention, which in itself imposes a certain uniformity of action on those member states.  I am grateful to Deputy Taylor-Quinn for her support with regard to the disposal of plastics and non-biodegradable detritus thrown into the sea.  The Deputy went into this point in some detail and I am grateful to her for making that point.  She asked that I take up with the Minister for the Environment the problem of plastics and sewage, and I will do that.  I think the Minister for the Environment is very much aware of the whole problem.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, among others, raised the question of implementation of the legislation and I might as well let the House know at this stage that a regulation was passed in the Council of Ministers last December indicating that further moneys would be available for surveillance.  We have made an application under that regulation for extra funding for surveillance. Another contributor mentioned &mdash; I think it was Deputy Gilmore &mdash; that air surveillance was very important in the circumstances, and perhaps Deputy Allen also mentioned that point, and this has not been neglected in the application.  I think that Members will find that the Departments of Defence, Marine, the Environment and Energy will co-operate in this regard.</P>
    <P>A Deputy expressed concern about the exploitation of energy resources in the seabed.  I draw Deputies' attention to section 36, where this point is covered, but on Committee Stage I intend to revamp and strengthen the provisions of section 36 in consultation with the Department of Energy.  The whole question of Sellafield is rightly exercising the minds of Deputies.  It is uppermost in the minds of many Deputies and I could run down through a list of Deputies who have applied themselves with special assiduity to this problem over a number of years. The problem is, in fact, being pursued by individual Deputies in this House, by Ministers of all Governments over a number of years, and by the Government. As the House knows this problem <Col N="571" /> has been brought to the attention of the European Community and we have been pushing for a European inspectorate.  If a strong European inspectorate were put in place, this would be a great help.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen mentioned British Nuclear Fuels.  They have a bad record and there is no doubt about that and any ordinary citizen who is observing the situation knows that their record is bad and that eternal vigilance is the price we have to pay.  People are worried about Sellafield but internally, and on a bilateral basis with members of the United Kingdom Government or in a bilateral arrangement with visitors, this issue has been pressed.  I would like the House to know that a group of scientists from Ireland and the United Kingdom are studying the Irish Sea on a bilateral basis. The report of this study group will be published and discussed at a conference scheduled for the Isle of Man next October.  I am referring to this because a number of Deputies mentioned how important it was to treat the Irish Sea as an individual subject, taken out of the global context and dealt with separately. That is precisely what these scientists are doing.  The future management of the Irish Sea will be the subject of discussion between the relevant authorities and this should be a very helpful study.  Deputy O'Sullivan made a long and detailed contribution and emphasised for us the importance of the seas while also emphasising Sellafield.  The Deputy thought that the Irish Sea was the most irradiated sea. I think I have already said what I want to say about Sellafield and the Irish Sea and it has to be dealt with at a different level and by different ministerial colleagues, as the House very well knows.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to dumping. So far as industrial waste is concerned only three large industries get permits to dump industrial waste.  All three companies are on notice about making provision for the discontinuance <Col N="572" /> of this dumping.  I think the three companies involved are John Wyeth and Brother Limited, the Pfizer Chemical Company and the Irish National Petroleum Company.  All three companies are seeing to it that they will be able to comply with the regulation to cease the dumping of industrial waste at sea.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also emphasised the dangers from big tankers, particularly the chemical dangers of crude oil.  He mentioned to his credit that apparently research has shown that those who clean up the crude oil and heavy oils are exposed to carcinogens.  This is something we should take cognisance of, particularly as the south and south west coasts are the areas where there is a danger from large ships and spillages.</P>
    <P>Both Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Gilmore referred to flags of convenience. These constitute a very difficult problem in the European Community and against the general background in the Community are a cause of much worry because the percentage of the world's fleet constituted by the fleets of the Community dropped disastrously between 1980 and 1990.  The Council of Ministers is pre-occupied with this issue at present and is putting in place what they can to see to it that the fleets are maintained in the Community and young people are trained properly for service at sea.  There is a proposal to have a EUROS register of ships of the Community.  Certain privileges and advantages will attach to ships which are registered in that way.  Such a register is in the process of discussion and debate as of now.</P>
    <P>The problems mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Gilmore about crews who are inadequately trained, have language difficulties, etc. are very much exercising the minds of the Council of Ministers at present, particularly in view of some recent disasters.  Various suggestions are being made with regard to the taxation of Euro crews being lowered and the abolition of contributions without abolishing the rights which attach to such contributions through the various social welfare systems.  This whole area is being studied from a number of angles and I <Col N="573" /> am sure that something firm by way of Council regulation will emerge from it.</P>
    <P>The quick turn-around syndrome is also important, although I would contend that one can develop the quick turn-around type ship without having inadequate ships, inadequate crews or inadequate attention to the environment. Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the design of ships and said large companies may be reluctant to pay for the extra strength needed for tankers.  I could not make any statement on that issue.  All I know is that I was rather shocked at the size of the gashes in the huge tankers, for example, the <i>Tribulus</i> which was the most recent one, as a result of being battered by the waves of the north Atlantic.  I have no scientific or technical evidence to show that this happened because of a weakness in the design but it is something which will come under what we are doing here and will have to be attended to.</P>
    <P>There is now a move to design ships which will be highly electronically equipped and controlled.  This will also reduce crewing but the crews employed will have to have a very high degree of sophistication and education in technology. There is a trend towards this already.  As the House knows, the shipping business goes up and down very quickly and a number of years ago was at a disastrously low level.  However, it has picked up now and is showing some evidence of levelling off or even declining.  The cost of crewing in Western Europe has caused our ships to be uncompetitive.  The solution seen by some people to this problem is to have ships specially designed for the use of electronics by a highly qualified and smaller crew.</P>
    <P>I have already read into the record of the House my response to the question of warships.</P>

      <P>I will speed up my remarks.  Licences are required for boats which carry 12 passengers or more.  I have already prepared legislation to cater for boats which carry 12 or fewer passengers. There is a law &mdash; strangely enough, a Health Act of the early part of the century &mdash; which can apply to boats which carry 12 or fewer passengers but it is hardly applied now so I am tightening up the law in that regard.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the provision of extra surveillance both at sea and on land.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to North Sea dumping.  This again is exercising very much the Council of Ministers because it has almost destroyed haddock fishing in the North Sea.  The pollution in the North Sea is the worst in this area and we have to cut down on our quotas for haddock there, otherwise all the haddock will be wiped out.  The stocks of cod are also being affected by the pollution. Deputy O'Sullivan paid tribute to the work done by Mr. John de Courcy Ireland, a friend of mine, and Mr. Murphy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore concentrated very heavily on the exemption under section 4 and read into it some kind of sinister move on the part of the Government.  It sounded like a thriller novel to abandon neutrality.  I can assure the House that there is no such intention, implication or insinuation and nobody could read that into the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I already dealt with Deputy Gilmore's suggestion that the Irish Sea is a special case.  He is right and I believe that the bilateral study to which I referred, in which scientists are engaged, and the forthcoming Isle of Man conference will address that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy made the important point that, from business, commerce, and <Col N="575" /> tourism points of view, and in relation to the recreational amenities for our citizens, we have a very serious obligation in regard to pollution at sea.  The port facilities which he and other Deputies mentioned will have to be provided under this law and the relevant harbour authorities will have to make that provision. They can do it whatever way they like &mdash; I cannot interfere with them &mdash; but the facilities must be provided.  I agree with Deputy Dennehy that Cork Harbour Commissioners have done a magnificent job although they are always nervous about what will happen on the south-western route, the route from the Atlantic which I mentioned in my opening speech.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy also mentioned the design of ships but I dealt with that in another context.  He said that the hatches were too large on some of the ships involved in this kind of trouble and those problems of design are exercising the minds of the people involved with large tankers.  He also referred to flags of convenience. I dealt with that and said how the Council of Ministers are trying to cope with the problem.</P>
    <P>Worries in relation to mariculture were very real, especially in the Bantry Bay area, when the <i>Tribulus</i> was in trouble but, luckily, we were able to confine the spillages, have the ship repaired and moved out of the harbour.  Deputy Allen said that our reputation as a clean country is a big boon to us.  We will have to be very strong to maintain that and to remove anything which, in any way, attacks that position.  I was in Europe with a group selling Atlantic salmon, the name &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; worked like a magic charm on the Continent.  On the other side of the Atlantic, in the New England states, &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; has the direct opposite meaning because of pollution in the area. There is a warning in that for us and I agree with Deputy Allen that it is important to maintain our position.  As he said, pollution is trans-continental and he wants me to introduce regulations as quickly as possible.  Deputy Garland also made that request and I assure the House <Col N="576" /> that the regulations will be introduced with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the matter of money for surveillance mentioned by Deputy Allen. I can assure him that it is not neglected. He also mentioned Sellafield and the problems associated with it.  Incinerator ships are covered by the Oslo Convention but I do not know if it stretches to the mid-Atlantic.  At any rate, I gather that these ships have abandoned the incinerator process in mid-Atlantic.  Each Department is fulfilling its international obligations in regard to MARPOL and we will not be at cross purposes when we ratify the international conventions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland gave a long list of offensive material on land and ar dhroim na mbóithre.  He is right in saying that stuff has been dumped in the sea throughout the centuries but it was biodegradable, which was the big difference. Much of the ordure now being dumped is not biodegradable which creates the problem.  I reject his contention that our Presidency was not a success.  Deputy Garland makes the mistake of thinking that his genuine and sincer concern for nature and the environment is exclusive to him.  It is not exclusive to him, it is not exclusive to any specific person or party, it is the concern of all thinking citizens and there are more of them now than ever before.  All Members expressed their appreciation of the poster and it proves that education and training are very important with regard to the maintenance of the quality of our environment.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the regulations. Refuse skips will have to be put in place in the ports and this legislation will ensure that this happens.  I am not sure that all the visiting ships are as saintly as Deputy Garland implied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring this Bill before the House on behalf of the Minister for Health.  The Bill was fully debated and passed by Seanad Éireann where it received wide support and was welcomed by all parties.  The purpose of this Bill is twofold.  First, it is to amend the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, to deal with difficulties which have arisen in the operation of that Act, particularly in so far as it relates to the responsibilities imposed on ethics committees by the Act.  Secondly, the Bill seeks to provide certain legal immunities for the National Drugs Advisory Board in relation to the functions imposed on them under Article 4 of the National Drugs Advisory Board (Establishment) Order, 1966.</P>
      <P>The Bill is necessary in order to overcome obstacles which have adversely affected the effective operation of the 1987 Act as a whole and which threatens to seriously limit clinical research in this country.  Because of the difficulties being experienced, the Minister for Health established a working party, which was representative of the pharmaceutical industry, clinicians and the Department of Health, to review the workings of the Act and in particular to see how the obstacles being experienced might best be overcome.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the working group have been taken fully into account in the preparation of the Bill now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular difficulties have arisen for ethics committees from the obligations <Col N="578" /> imposed on them by section 10 of the Act which obliges the committees to satisfy themselves in relation to the adequacy of the financial arrangements made to compensate those who may suffer injury or loss as a result of participating in a clinical trial.  Legal advice obtained by a number of hospital based ethics committees has highlighted the potential open-endedness of section 10 and suggests that the burden placed on ethics committee members in assessing the adequacy of compensation arrangements leaves such members open to being sued for negligence.  Most hospital based committees have accordingly either stepped down or are only giving consideration to trials on products which have licences and which are in current use, with the result that hospital based trials on new products have virtually ceased.</P>
    <P>I am therefore proposing the removal of this particular obligation from ethics committees by amending section 10 of the Act as provided for in section 3 of the Bill.  The amendment will require that a person shall not either arrange for the conducting of a clinical trial nor conduct a clinical trial unless that person has first established to the satisfaction of the Minister for Health the adequacy of the arrangements for security to compensate persons who may suffer injury or loss as a result of their participation in a clinical trial.  The amendment will, while removing the difficulties experienced by ethics committees, at the same time ensure that there will be adequate security to provide any compensation to participants that may become necessary.</P>
    <P>While dealing with the particular problems of ethics committees I have taken the opportunity to further amend the Act to deal with two other minor matters which require further definition or clarification.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (2) (a) (ii) provides for an exemption from the definition of a clinical trial and thereby from the controls set out in the Act of a trial where the principal purpose is the welfare of the patient.</P>
    <P>In the light of the operation of this subsection, it has transpired that, as worded, there is scope for a fairly broad <Col N="579" /> interpretation of what is intended.  Clinicians involved in clinical research sought clarification on the intention of the section and so I propose in section 2 of the Bill to amend section 6 of the Act so as to state clearly the aim of the section and specifically to exclude trials where the intention is to prevent disease in, or to save the life, to restore the health, alleviate the condition or to relieve the suffering of the patient.  The amendment, which will set out clearly and unambiguosly the intention of section 6, was prepared in full consultation with parties involved in this area of research.  It will also provide a useful tie in and ensure consistency with the provision of section 9 (7) of the Act which provides safeguards for patients who are participants in clinical trials.</P>
    <P>I also propose by section 4 of this Bill to amend section 13 of the Act which deals with offences and provides for defences in relation thereto.  There is a need to provide appropriate defences for unincorporated bodies such as ethics committees and the purpose of the proposed amendment is to bring this about.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to provide certain legal immunities for those parties involved in administering the Act, in particular the ethics committees in relation to their functions under the Act.  I am also proposing an immunity for the Minister for Health in relation to the Act and I am taking the opportunity to deal with the liability of the National Drugs Advisory Board under this Act and in relation to their functions under Article 4 of the National Drugs Advisory Board (Establishment) Order, 1966, and for committees established under Article 18 of the same order.  The provision of such immunity is a well established feature of legislation and there are many precedents for it.</P>
    <P>The members of the National Drugs Advisory Board, who are appointed by the Minister for Health, are leading specialists in the fields of medicine, pharmacology, toxicology and other related disciplines and provide their services free of charge.  Over the years concern has <Col N="580" /> been expressed by members of the National Drugs Advisory Board with regard to possible legal liabilities which may fall upon them as a consequence of their membership of the board and they have sought an appropriate indemnity. The matter was referred to the Attorney General for advice.  The Attorney recommended the provision of an immunity as set out in section 5 of the Bill.  Similar immunity has been granted to other State boards, including EOLAS, formerly the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, and the National Health and Safety Authority set up last year by the Minister for Labour.  In order to ensure the continued participation of specialists of the highest standing as members of the board and their specialist committees and thereby maintain their internationally recognised status the Government consider that it will be necessary to provide an immunity along the lines which I now propose.  The Attorney General considers the proposed Bill to be an appropriate vehicle in which to provide this immunity.</P>
    <P>The Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, was a prototype piece of technical and complex legislation.  In such circumstances initial teething problems were always a possibility.  At the same time the Government were committed to keeping the operation of the Act under review and to deal with any difficulties that arose.</P>
    <P>The amendments now proposed will overcome the difficulties being experienced and thus restore Ireland's position as a favourable location for clinical research, thereby ensuring the objectives of the Act to facilitate research and to protect participants in clinical trials are fully realised.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to this Second Stage debate on this very important legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I regret it has taken as long as it has to get to the floor of this House.  I think I am right in saying that the Minister for Health promised in December last that it would be introduced in a matter of weeks, but <Col N="581" /> I am pleased that we have had an opportunity before the Dáil goes into recess to try to enact this legislation &mdash; it has gone through the Seanad &mdash; because a great degree of urgency is involved in this Bill. For that reason we have agreed to the time constraints and my contribution will not be excessively long.  We hope to take in all Stages if possible this evening.  I am aware also that there were delays with the Attorney General's Office.</P>
      <P>We are amending the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987.  Fine Gael did not oppose that Act at that time.  However, amendments were tabled, and I have a copy of the speech made on 18 June 1987 by my party's spokesperson at that time, Deputy Mary Flaherty.  She said that the Bill as currently drafted was so seriously defective that it could have the opposite effect from that intended.  A provision in the Bill related to ethics committees and insurance would drive research out of the hospitals entirely and exclusively into the commercial private sector.  Research into some terminal illnesses and cancer would have to cease as insurance was simply not available here.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that section 10 set out the requirements for adequate insurance for compensation.  On the surface it was a straightforward and worthy requirement.  However, it was not possible to get insurance for research into certain sensitive areas such as work with the terminally ill or with cancer patients. Since the publication of the Bill, Irish doctors had made inquiries and found that cover would not be provided.  Therefore, the net effect of the Bill was that research in our hospitals in these areas would cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much to inform the House that this is exactly what happened, and I regret that the advice given at that time by the Opposition was not heeded. However, I accept that there should be a legal and statutory basis for clinical trials to protect the participants in those trials. Prior to the 1987 Act we had simply guidelines on a voluntary basis operated by the National Drugs Advisory Board. In this we must seek a balance between protecting those individuals and ensuring <Col N="582" /> that the bona fide legitimate testing of drugs that needs to take place prior to their marketing stage can be carried out to make them safe.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the tragic death of Niall Rush in 1984 which perhaps resulted in this legislation being introduced and of the thalidomide cases all of which highlight the potential dangers when there is not a proper safeguard in place on a premarketing basis for such drugs.</P>
    <P>However, the principal reason the Act failed was that section 10 of the Bill virtually halted research, not in commercial institutions, not in the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, not in the Elan Corporation, but in our teaching university based hospitals.  There is a number of cases in relation to the Mater, St. Vincent's and St. James's hospitals where the ethics committees were not prepared to take the responsibility for liability in respect of participants in trials that they were obliged to do under section 10 of the Act.  This led to a number of pharmaceutical companies, who were prepared to underwrite and pay for the research and the liabilities, relocating their research in the UK simply because ethics committees were not prepared to oversee and take responsibility for these research projects.</P>
    <P>There was also the difficulty that the administration of some drugs was not available because it would have involved participation in an open clinical trial.  I am referring to the most publicised case, to AIDS patients attending the GUM clinic at St. James's Hospital under the care of consultant Fiona Mulcahy.  As we know, there is no cure for AIDS and the development of treatment and cures for AIDS is an ongoing thing.  The most established treatment is AZT; but, as we know, some people have a very server reaction to AZT and cannot take it. Those people can only take DDI or DDC.  My understanding from patients is that they have had to travel to England surreptitiously in order to get this treatment because they would have to participate in a clinical trial here and the ethics committees do not oversee such clinical trials.  That is one reason why I <Col N="583" /> am glad that this Bill is now being dealt with.</P>
    <P>Commercial research was not affected but when replying on Second Stage I would like the Minister to make some comment on the collapse of the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology.  There is a public perception that the difficulties relating to the Clinical Trials Act are coincidental with the collapse of that institute.  As the House knows, it was a very spectacular collapse in that it was a world leader.  The Minister might give his reasons why they collapsed and he might tell us what steps he is taking to maintain a high level of research here.  If those carrying out research in our hospitals cease their programmes, they will very quickly lose contact with their international colleagues carrying our research and we will quickly become isolated from the latest developments in medicine, pharmacology and so on.  If we are to keep in touch and develop the most modern therapeutic procedures, research here must be on a par with what is available abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with shifting the liability to have security from the ethics committees.  The main purpose of this section is to scrap the original section 10 of the Act.  According to section 3, the Minister will have responsibility and he must be satisfied that everything is in order before a trial can be held.  The Bill does not state what circumstances will be necessary to satisfy the Minister.  Would a bond of £100,000 be satisfactory, or a bond of £1 million?  What are the exact requirements to satisfy the Minister?  Will the Minister give details of the guidelines he intends to introduce that will satisfy him in order that clinical trials can be carried out?</P>
    <P>In section 3 we have a new paragraph which says:</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section &lsquo;security&rsquo; includes a contract of insurance, a contract of indemnity, a guarantee, a surety, a warrant and a bond.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend that it will be insurance, a guarantee, or just a letter of <Col N="584" /> comfort, or will it be a bond that one would have to buy with a cash value?  It is unclear from section 3 exactly what is intended here.  I would prefer if we adopted the system which operates in the UK whereby the pharmaceutical company underwrites the research and is responsible for the insurance, with the clinical researcher carrying out the work; and, as the Department of Health and Social Security do in Britain, we should when things go wrong provide for an <i>ex gratia</i> system of payment, quite separate from compensation, for the people involved.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with immunities. I am not against what the Minister has said in relation to the long campaign for immunity in relation to the overall work of the National Drugs Advisory Board.  But in this Bill the original Act is being reformed in such a way that the Minister carries the can.  The Minister oversees the trials, the Minister gives the approval for the trials and he must be satisfied that the security is there.  But then we see in section 5 that &ldquo;No action or other proceeding shall lie or be maintainable&rdquo; against the Minister.  If there is a cock-up in the NDAB or in the Department or if the Minister makes a mistake and in error grants permission for a trial, what opportunity is open to the participant who is seeking redress to get that redress?  He cannot go to the Minister or to the NDAB.  What safeguards are there?  Does section 5 of the Bill undermine the original Act?  In what circumstances can an aggrieved participant pursue any claim?  If the cover was for £100,000 and it was found that the insurance policy had run out a week earlier or some small print had not been observed, what redress would apply if everybody is immune as outlined in section 5?  It is important to establish these matters in this House.  While we are all in favour of dealing with this matter expeditiously in this House we want to get it right this time, having done a bad job the last time.</P>
    <P>When reading through the debates of March 1987 a question in relation to insurance was raised but not answered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> As we know, every doctor and clinician has insurance cover under the Medical Defence Union or the Medical Protection Society.  It is very costly and can run up to several thousands of pounds.  Does the standard insurance cover cover clinical research?  If the person carrying out the research makes a mistake in administering the drug or carrying out the trial, where a claim arises, is insurance cover available and what, if so, would it cost? It is very important that the Minister initiates discussions with the medical profession, clinicians, their representatives, the Medical Protection Society and the Medical Defence Union to be absolutely sure that the clinician carrying out the work is covered.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other points I would like to make.  It is nonsensical that separate ratification procedures for each new drug are applied in each of the 12 member states of the EC.  Almost 13,000 drugs, comprising 300 basic products, derivatives and variations, are being administered in the world today.  It is absolutely incredible that each of the tests the Minister outlined is repeated in each country.  Surely the most sensible thing to do is for the countries to adopt a common approach whereby once an EC centre approves a drug it will be approved in each member state.  It should not be necessary to repeat the process in each country.  There should be just one clearing house situated somewhere in Europe, in Ireland perhaps, to carry out the tests on an agency basis for each of the countries. If this was done a saving would accrue and new drugs and treatments would be made available more quickly to the public.  As we are all aware, one of the difficulties encountered in relation to the patenting of generic drugs is that it can take up to six or seven years to get the drug on the market.  If a streamlined procedure was adopted the work done by the NDAB could be carried out at a central EC centre.  Some months ago I suggested in the House that we avail of the opportunity afforded by our Presidency of the Community to pursue that point.</P>
    <P>In different circumstances I would <Col N="586" /> table amendments to the Bill, but I will not do so on this occasion.  However, in relation to sections 4 and 8 of the Principal Act, I have been told that delays are being encountered.  Section 8 states that, where the Minister is satisfied that a proposed ethics committee for a clinical trial is competent to consider the justification for conducting the proposed trial and the circumstances under which it is to be conducted, he shall give his approval.  It gives no indication of what time limit applies.  For instance, it does not state that he must give his approval within 12 weeks, four months, six months or a year, with the result that delays are encountered.  Now that the Minister is being given a more central role in approving the security arrangements, we should insert a time limit.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Principal Act states that the National Drugs Advisory Board shall, not later than 12 weeks after the application has been made, grant permission or not as the case may be.  I feel that that is too long and they should give their decision within six weeks.</P>
    <P>Who is going to decide on who should be appointed to the ethics committees? Will it be the hospital, the Minister or the drugs companies?  I ask the Minister to reply to those questions.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 2 of the Bill, which deals with the definition of &ldquo;conduct for clinical trial&rdquo;, normal clinical practice is now being excluded.  What I would like to know is whether this means the administering of drugs such as new leukaemia, terminal cancer or AIDS drugs will be excluded, as I feel they should?  Surely this amounts to treatment rather than experimentation.  I am not clear from the table included in the Bill whether these are covered or not.</P>
    <P>The Minister has proposed in section 4 of the Bill that the words &ldquo;or by a person purporting to act on behalf of a body corporate&rdquo; be included in section 13 of the Principal Act.  I would like to know the Minister's reasons for including these words.  Is it his intention to try to close a loophole which people have found in the legislation to evade their responsibilities?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the Bill and <Col N="587" /> will do all I can to ensure it is enacted as speedily as possible.  I ask the Minister when replying to deal with the question of immunity and to outline what security requirements will have to be complied with in relation to bonding and insurance. I will scrutinise these on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that, as late as last night, the spokespersons on Health of the various parties did not expect to find themselves on the floor of the House this evening discussing this legislation.  Given the uniqueness of the legislation and the desire of all parties to have it enacted as speedily as possible, time was allocated to take the Bill.  As the Minister said, it is amending legislation aimed at resolving the difficulties which have arisen since the Principal Act was passed in 1987.  For this reason, and to facilitate the Minister in enacting the Bill, I will not try to obstruct him in any way.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives of the original Bill was to introduce regulations and controls into an area about which a great deal of concern was expressed at that time.  Any research involving people results in a certain unease among the general public.  The original Bill was introduced against the backdrop of events and, of necessity, was complex and innovative.  At that time people predicted that difficulties would arise.  A large number of amendments were tabled to the Bill, some of which were accepted, but few people believed when the Bill was passed that that would be the end of the story.  One of the points made on the Second and Final Stages was that the implementation of the Bill would have to be constantly monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties have arisen which are the source of disquiet among the medical profession and those of us interested in the proper conduct of medical research and innovative practice.  The Minister for Health confronted these difficulties when they became obvious and established a working party to review the workings of <Col N="588" /> the Act.  The findings of this representative group, which was comprised of distinguished specialists in various areas, led to publication of the Bill we are discussing tonight.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister of State dealt with the specific difficulties which have arisen.  Section 10 of the Principal Act imposes obligations on ethics committees. However, these obligations have led to such committees either standing down or abandoning clinical trials on new products.  There is a clear need to carry out research.  Therefore the problems which have arisen must be addressed and rectified.</P>
    <P>The whole area of drug research, particularly that involving people, is an emotive one.  The original debate was an emotive one.  More than anything else the single factor that led to the former Minister for Health, Barry Desmond, initiating the Clinical Trials Act was the sad death in 1984 of Niall Rush.  That caused a degree of public outrage and there was a debate among the obviously conflicting interests about advancing medical knowledge and the taking of risks with people.  Any such risks must be reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <P>It was clear that a legislative framework had to be established and put into place to protect all volunters for clinical trials.  It is clear also that that legislative framework could not be so restricted as to preclude the undertaking of further clinical trials.  While I, therefore, accept the need for the legislation before us tonight, in normal circumstances, I do not think I would have accepted the urgency with which it is being processed. I would like to have had a longer time to prepare for the debate and longer time allocated for speakers.</P>
    <P>The urgency has arisen by virtue of the fact that certain drugs, which were on offer from pharmaceutical companies, to certain categories of patients, particularly patients who have Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, most particularly DDI, are not available. AZT, which is the most common treatment currently used for AIDS patients, has not proven suitable to treat all cases. <Col N="589" /> While it is recognised that there is no cure for AIDS we must strive, as a matter of urgency, to seek whatever preparations are available to either arrest the development of AIDS and the debilitating side effects, or we must strive harder to seek a cure because, no doubt in the fullness of time, medical science will advance to the stage where we can have a cure for this terrible disease.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House, mindful of the difficulties that face patients such as those I have referred to, have a responsibility to respond in a speedy and effective way. Clearly drug treatment is not a total answer to AIDS or to any other condition. Frequently when we are dealing with debates such as this, we can arrive at a situation where we feel that the obtaining of new preparations, new drugs, new treatments, wonder drugs, will solve all our problems.  I would not like to convey that view because I am of the view that the answer to a healthy people and the treatment of many illnesses is often a matter of environment and ethos as much as any particular preparation that is administered.  In this country the ethos and tradition we have of caring for and supporting the sick and the handicapped is a very positive one.  It contributes very much to the whole notion of a productive and proper life. Probably we have a less stressful society than many others in the western world and that should not be lost sight of in the whole debate on health.  Notwithstanding that, there is a responsibility to address the fundamental issue of allowing medical research to continue in a controlled and responsible way but not to be so circumscribed as to be totally ineffective.</P>
    <P>In the past and, indeed, during the debate in the Seanad and also in the debate on the Principal Act, much comment was made about the morality of clinical trials on people.  The defence against the charge that such trials are immoral is often given as the element of choice: people have free will and they can present themselves for such trials or not; they can decline to undergo such trials.  The reality is that if you look at the profile of those who actually volunteer for <Col N="590" /> clinical trials, it must be acknowledged that they do not come from the average or the above-average income group.  We have to examine how much choice exists in reality for people who volunteer, because finance is certainly a major factor.  The financial inducements or support given may not be of a very high order, sometimes in the range of £25 per day or, perhaps, £200 or £300 for a total course of trials.  While that may not appear to be a great deal of money for many people, for people on marginal incomes it can mean a great deal in improving their quality of life.  Unfortunately, many people are still enticed into making an economic choice for themselves.  That is something that needs to be addressed and it is not something that rests lightly on me.</P>
    <P>It would be nice to think that there would be an element of civil duty or responsibility that would motivate people to volunteer as part of the national good. Sadly, economic necessity appears to be the prime if not the exclusive motive for many healthy people volunteering to undergo clinical trials.  Although it is an issue that is not directly addressed in this legislation it is very much a significant backdrop to the whole debate.  Therefore, testing can be carried out only where there is a real and clear need or clear and unambiguous choice on behalf of the volunteer.  This was certainly the motivating factor in the original Act. While we found that the original Act needs to be amended, it was innovative and one that was needed and demanded by the public at the time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the collapse of the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology. It is an interesting fact that that highly prosperous institution which was making very substantial profits did collapse. Many people attributed the difficulties of the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, to the demise of the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology.  It would be worthy of comment &mdash; I do not know whether the Minister would deem it appropriate &mdash; on Second Stage to make a clear statement on it so that the confusion on that issue would be lifted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> The specifies of the Bill are straightforward. Many of the point made by Deputy Yates are worthy of response, two of which I will focus in on.  The first is that section 3 of the Bill, which changes the old section 10, now gives the responsibility to the Minister for establishing to his satisfaction that there is available security to compensate persons, etc.  It would be useful if the Minister had drawn up regulations &mdash; I presume he has worked on them &mdash; to know exactly the criteria that would satisfy the Minister under this section, should it be enacted. It would be useful if we knew that in advance of proceeding to the Final Stages tonight.</P>
    <P>The other factor is in relation to the immunities proposed in the Bill.  The Minister suggested that broad immunities are proposed in section 5.  He said they are in accordance with immunities offered to various other semi-State and State organisations and are drafted in accordance with the criteria laid down by the Attorney General.  If the Minister is taking responsibility unto himself, who is left to carry the can ultimately, since the Minister and the National Drugs Advisory Board are given fairly broad immunity under section 5 should its provisions be invoked?  It should be made clear that somebody is responsible.  There should be no ambiguity about it.</P>
    <P>I have said that this Bill is necessary, but that it is an unusual procedure we are adopting this evening. There is one hour of scheduled time remaining in which to conclude this debate.  There are many others wishing to offer on Second Stage and the remaining Stages have to be passed before the night is out.  Therefore I will endeavour to encapsulate my thoughts in a few sentences.  First, let me say that I would not normally support this procedure.  It is not good procedure that Committee Stage should immediately follow the conclusion of Second Stage. But I suggested last evening, and for once my position as a party Whip enabled me to ensure, that time which is extremely scarce, be allocated to this important <Col N="592" /> Bill.  Hopefully it will be enacted before the end of this session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill recognising on the part of The Workers' Party the need for amendment of the 1987 Act. The Minister will be aware of the contribution of our colleagues in the Seanad. I do not want to repeat much of what they had to say; nonetheless it made interesting reading.  I might take up some of the points made in the Seanad and some made in the House this evening in an effort to seek some assurance from the Minister.</P>
      <P>It is worth casting our minds back to the reasons that rendered the control of clinical trials so important in 1987, leading to the introduction of the Control of Clinical Trials Bill of that year.  Indeed it is incredible that to date we have not devised appropriate legislation to control what takes place in the course of clinical trials.  Unfortunately, in 1984, it took a public outcry to raise the consciousness of politicians and others that these horrendous tests were being carried out in our city.  At that time it was probably news to many people that there were people subjecting themselves to the injection of all sorts of drugs being tested. That outcry arose as a result of the tragic death of Niall Rush, leading to the understandably hurried legislation introduced in 1987, now found to be faulty or deficient.  If my memory is correct Niall Rush's father said in the course of radio interviews that if anything could be learned from the unfortunate death of his son, then he could rest assured that the same circumstances would not recur, that people subjecting themselves to such clinical tests in the future would not be as vulnerable as was his unfortunate son.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of his remarks this evening the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments now proposed will overcome the difficulties being experienced and thus restore Ireland's position as a favourable location for clinical research, thereby ensuring the objectives of the Act to facilitate <Col N="593" /> research and to protect participants in clinical trials are fully realised.</P>
    <P>Similar words were used in the Seanad. Other Senators said it was important that Ireland be seen internationally as a favourable location for this kind of research.  I would advise some caution there.  Are we to be the forerunners of clinical research on human beings?  The notion that this should constitute a leading industry presents me with many personal problems.  My reason for having those reservations is that the raw material involved in such research is comprised of human beings.  Unfortunately it is also true to say that such people tend to be representative of a socio-economic sector, usually poor people.  There is a moral issue which must be addressed in all of this if we endeavour to boost ourselves as a nation having all of these facilities for clinical testing.  I contend this is not an image we should endeavour to portray by way of incentive to the location of other institutions here, institutions such as the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology.  We must question the whole moral issue of encouraging huge institutions specialising in recruiting human beings for such tests.  I contend it carries sinister undertones, poor people being attracted by rather meagre payments of say, £25 per day in order to subject their bodies to dangerous or, in some cases, fatal tests.  It is ironic that that sum of £25 is exactly similar to the amount we TDs receive by way of subsistence allowance.  When one compares that with other sections of the community so desperate for money to sustain themselves and/or their families that they will subject themselves to these dangerous tests, then there is an absolute responsibility on us to guarantee, in so far as such is possible, that safeguards are built into the relevant legislation, with financial safeguards in the event of unfortunate people becoming very ill, disabled or even dying as a result of such tests.</P>
    <P>How long should the health of somebody who has subjected themselves to such tests be monitored?  I would argue that the side effects of some of these tests <Col N="594" /> may not manifest themselves within a month, a year, even two or five years; such side effects might not manifest themselves for very much longer.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (5) reads:</P>
    <P>In this section &ldquo;security&rdquo; includes a contract of insurance a contract of indemnity, a guarantee, a surety, a warrant and a bond.</P>
    <P>That begs the question: how long will such insurance obtain?  Can the Minister say what would be the insurance liabilities in the case of somebody making a claim? What type of guarantee would obtain if somebody suffered some tremendous repercussions having engaged in this type of testing or research?  Also what type of security would obtain for that person and his or her family?  For example, such a person might have had no family responsibilities at the time of subjecting himself to such tests but ten, 15 or 20 years later his whole lifestyle might have changed dramatically, when he could then be a married man with considerable family responsibilities.  What type of insurance coverage is there that will safeguard him and his family?</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party, however, restate our objection to commercial drug testing with private companies making profits on the backs of these testers.  As has been pointed out, there are over 15,000 drugs which can be prescribed to patients already available, and the World Health Organisation estimates that all medical eventualities would be covered by 300 drugs.  They are startling facts and figures. However, one could not deny the fact that there is need for continuing research.  Most of us would agree that AIDS is a relatively new medical phenomenon and we must, therefore, seek new drugs to fight it.</P>
    <P>The moral question, however, is: who is to carry out such testing?  When one passes over the responsibility to multinational corporations who will either do the research themselves or have other big companies do it and produce drugs to be marketed by other companies, quite clearly what is being engaged in is private enterprise seeking a market for profit.  Is <Col N="595" /> it wrong?  One could hardly say it is totally wrong, but there is the question of whether institutions other than private enterprises should carry out the research.</P>
    <P>The whole area of drug testing requires the most careful controls with the emphasis on establishing whether it will prevent disease, save lives or relieve the suffering of patients.  There are however strong commercial links between those involved in running clinical drug trials and those that manufacture the drugs.  The clear emphasis in drug trials must be on the need to achieve greater medical understanding and advance rather than putting large sums of money into the pockets of already wealthy individuals and companies.</P>
    <P>In essence, our arguments are that stringent safeguards have to be established. The priority must be to give as much security as possible and lessen the temptation to attract the very poor, who seem, in the main, to be the people who subject their bodies to tests.  We might look very carefully at how we can break ourselves away from the exclusive subjection of the poor to tests and make testing more attractive to a broader section of the community.</P>
    <P>I will leave it at that for the moment. I will certainly be interested in getting some explanation in regard to insurance coverage, the duration of the coverage and the type of coverage available under these insurance policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make only a brief intervention because we all want to make progress.  It gives me no pleasure to say that we told the Minister so, but we did indeed tell the Minister that he would have a problem with this Bill when we were discussing it in the past.  The reason consultants have a reasonably generous time arrangement in their contract is that it is expected of them that they engage in research relating to their specialties for the benefit of their patients, for the benefit of medicine in Ireland and for the benefit of medicine worldwide.  While the Minister's legal advisers suggested to him that there would not be problems with <Col N="596" /> insurance, the advice to the consultants from their Medical Defence Union was that they would be inadequately protected.</P>
      <P>It has taken the crisis of AIDS patients requiring experimental drugs to bring this before the House in such an urgent fashion.  Since this Bill became operational the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> has heralded the decline of research here. There is a reluctance to engage in research, which we have lost to other countries.  While we are responding in a particular way, I am not satisfied that we have responded adequately.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion we urged the Minister to set up a no fault compensation fund which would give general cover, and I believe that is included in the provisions here and would be of great assistance. This is something we will have to continue to monitor.  We debated it adequately and we realised that this Bill had to be a question of checks and balances.  We were breaking new ground.  We are the only country that legislates for volunteers engaging in testing.  There are certain regulations in Britain within hospitals for tests on patients, but in the context of volunteers we were breaking new ground and there is always a problem when pioneering. There was the question of trying to get a balance between protecting those who were participating in trials and insuring that sufficient research was done.  We obviously have not got the balance quite right yet.  There is certainly a view that the changes here will improve the situation and therefore we will be supporting them.  I hope the Minister will undertake to keep a very close watch on this area and be responsive to further needs for intervening in this area again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to express my gratitude <Col N="597" /> to the House for taking this Bill at this time and particularly to the Deputies who have contributed &mdash; my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy; Deputies Yates, Howlin, Byrne and O'Flaherty. I welcome the broad support for the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I stated a number of times in this House, the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, was a prototype piece of complex legislation and in those circumstances teething problems such as those we are now dealing with are always a possibility. The Bill now before the House will, I believe, deal effectively with these problems which have arisen in the operation of the Act.  It will deal particularly with the difficulties caused for ethics committees. It will enable the committees to fulfil their roles effectively and with confidence.  I am confident that the measures contained in the Bill and supported by Deputies will restore confidence in Ireland's position as a favourable location for clinical research; and I am sure that the original twofold objectives of the Act, namely, to facilitate clinical research while at the same time affording protection to participants in clinical trials, are fully realised and implemented.  At the same time, the working of the Act, as amended, will continue to be closely monitored and kept under review; and I am prepared, should the need arise at some future date, to further amend the Act in the light of the ongoing experience of its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points were raised. Deputy Yates raised the time limit in the 1987 Act.  Section 2 of the 1987 Act lays down the time limits under which applications for clinical trials can be assessed by the National Drugs Advisory Board and approved by the Minister for Health. These limits were drawn up at the time on the basis of experience of clearing applications under the voluntary system that was in operation.  There is no indication that the time limits are proving a hindrance to the development of clinical research in this country.  Most applications are cleared well within the time allowed in the legislation.  Some problems <Col N="598" /> have been encountered by the Department of Health and the National Drugs Advisory Board in relation to applications made and the response to queries raised.  Inadequate responses seem to delay consideration of applications, but still the time limits were adhered to by the Department of Health and the National Drugs Advisory Board.  However, I am keeping the operation of the Bill, including the time limits, under review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates also referred to the criteria for security.  The assessment of security has been transferred under this Bill from the ethics committee to the Minister for Health.  The Deputy is correct when he says that the nature of clinical trials will require an assessment of the level of security on a trial by trial basis. The nature of the trial and the participants involved will have to be examined in this context.  It has been necessary to obtain the advice of actuaries and biostatisticians towards this end.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 (5) of the Bill I am simply suggesting some of the types of security that would be obtained.  It is not an exhaustive list but is designed to clarify that insurance is not the sole type of security required.  This needed to be clarified on the basis of questions posed by applicants.  In response to Deputy Yate's question, I would be happy with the type of arrangements which operate in the UK under which the pharmaceutical companies underwrite and indemnify clinical research and the clinical researchers are protected through insurance, bonding, warranties and so on.  This type of security applies in this country also.  I deliberately did not propose an exhaustive list; indeed, if other forms of security are proposed and considered acceptable, they will be approved.  In adopting this approach I was conscious that I would not put in place a legal provision which might create difficulties for researchers.</P>
    <P>As regards the Medical Defence and Medical Protection Society cover, I am satisfied these will cover the activities of doctors in relation to clinical research. My colleague, the Minister of State, dealt at some length in his opening remarks with the immunity proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> At the outset, I wish to make it absolutely clear that the immunities proposed would not apply in the case of negligence by any of the persons or bodies to which the proposed immunities would apply.  In this context participators in clinical trials would be in a position to seek redress in cases where wilful negligence is involved.</P>
    <P>I take the point that the 1987 Act was somewhat ambiguous in relation to the whole question of responsibility for accidents arising from clinical research.  This became clear in the operation of the Act. The Bill makes it absolutely clear that negligence in relation to clinical research will not be protected.  The proposal to provide immunity is designed to strike a balance between the rights of participants in clinical research and the role of the agencies and bodies such as ethics committees and the National Drugs Advisory Board, the members of which are acting in good faith and on the basis of information which is available to them during the trial.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne raised a number of points, including the duration of security and the length of the period during which participants would be monitored.  In broad terms, this would depend on the trial involved.  Participants would be monitored for a period considered appropriate by the investigator.  It would not be possible to state precisely what an appropriate period would be; it would depend on the individual participant in the trial.  I share the Deputy's concern that poor people can be exploited in clinical research.  If this is shown to be the case, I will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure it does not happen.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Flaherty that this is prototype legislation, the first of its kind, and it is not surprising there were teething troubles.  Before introducing this legislation we established a very small working group, some members of which are involved in research.  I am glad to say that in preparing this legislation, we have taken on board everything they recommended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the membership of ethics committees.  Members <Col N="600" /> are approved by the Minister under section 3 of the Bill on the basis of criteria set out in guidelines issued by the Department of Health.  There is a perception that the Act had an adverse bearing on the operation of the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology.  However, I can assure Deputies that the ICP have confirmed in writing to the Department of Health that they have experienced no difficulty with the Act.  This is borne out by the fact that applications for permission from the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology to conduct clinical trials have been turned around within eight weeks of receipt, some in less than six weeks.  This compares favourably with the turnaround time for the institute's applications under the former voluntary system for applications. Under the Bill the Minister has a period of 12 weeks available to him to deal with applications.</P>
    <P>As regards the general position of ICP, I am satisfied that the extremely competitive nature of clinical research, together with the cost structure of ICP, led to the position the institute found themselves in recently.  The new owners of the ICP will, of course, be subject to the requirements of the Bill and the Department of Health are in touch with them in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the question of the European Community approving medicines, we support the development of a central European Community medicines agency.  Certainly, we will be very happy to make a case for its location in Ireland.  We think it is very appropriate that it should be based here and the Department are actively involved in discussions at European Community level on this subject.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to thank Deputies for their valuable contributions to the debate on this highly technical legislation. I know my colleagues in Opposition are anxious that the Bill would be implemented as a matter of urgency, and I appreciate very much the positive attitude that has been taken in order to facilitate the taking of all Stages here this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The new part is section 2 (a) (ii) which states that the principal purpose of that administration is to prevent disease in, or to save the life, restore the health, alleviate the condition or relieve the suffering of the patient.</P>
      <P>Regarding the administration of drugs such as DDI to AIDS patients, or certain new drugs for leukaemia or terminal cancers, would that be considered exempt? Could the Minister give a practical example of something that was considered to be a clinical trial under the old Act which will now be considered normal clinical practice, not subject to the rigours of this legislation?  It is important to clarify this matter.  There must be a public assurance that unsafe drugs are not being used.  Consultants have told me about the amount of paperwork they would have to go through in order to get approval for the use of a drug whose efficacy is fairly well known in other countries.  In the context of new developments, this could be vital to individual patients.  I should like an assurance that such administration of drugs would be considered as normal clinical practice and therefore exempt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amending the section is to clarify the circumstances in which a drug would be exempt from the scope of the 1987 Act. It was not very clear in that Act and is much clearer now in section 2 of this Bill.  It refers to a person who would be terminally ill and the possibility that the use of a particular drug might be lifesaving. Obviously the drug would be used as a matter of urgency, as distinct from using the drug in the nature of a trial to see what its effect would be.  If a patient was terminally ill in a hospital in the <Col N="602" /> country and the clinician looking after the patient believed that the administration of DDI would be lifesaving, I would envisage that the clinician would not come within the scope of the Act. However, if somebody was trying the drug on HIV patients in the course of scientific research to establish the value of the drug in the treatment of a particular illness, it would certainly fall within the scope of the legislation.  Sometimes new drugs which have never been licensed are flown in from around the world in an attempt to save life.  One drug was flown in from Japan because it was thought it might be lifesaving.  It would be fairly clear to the clinician but if there is any doubt there are many resources which can be tapped for an opinion, such as the Minister and the Department of Health and the National Drugs Advisory Board.  I do not think it would cause a problem in practical terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption is to do with the condition of the patient rather than the drug itself.  It could be a clinical trial if administered to one person but the same drug administered in other circumstances might not constitute a clinical trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  There is some difficulty for the clinician, who would obviously be very conscious of what is already known about the drug. For instance, DDI has toxic side effects of which the clinician would be conscious. The decisions have to be left to the clinician looking after the patient.  The reason the drug is being used is of central importance.  If it is used as one last chance to save a life, that would fall outside the Act; if it is used to see how it will perform, it is very much within the scope of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important to tease out this point.  I welcome the Minister's clarification but there is a grey area here.  Ultimately the responsibility falls back on the doctors.  How does the Minister intend to clarify the matter for them?  In a litigious society people are afraid of legal action and if there is any ambiguity in this matter it is possible that <Col N="603" /> innovative procedures which, potentially, could be lifesaving might not be tried because the clinician involved feels there is a legislative bar or a procedure he has to go through.  How does the Minister intend to clarify this matter for the medical profession so that there is no ambiguity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be referred to in the guidelines.  It is important that there should be no ambiguity and the Deputy is correct in saying it is a grey area.  One physician might feel justified in using a drug in certain circumstances while another might have a reservation.  The National Drugs Advisory Board, the Medical Council and the Department of Health are important resources.  If a doctor were to take a short cut and go ahead and use the drug for a trial without going through the procedures outlined, that doctor could well be leaving himself in some difficulty.  Traditionally in medicine, doctors have used drugs which had not been fully tested as one last effort to save a life.  We would not want to interfere with that in any way or to place any restrictions.  Deputies will appreciate that there is a balance to be struck.  The legislation takes account of this balance and it is now clearer in this section that there are exemptions for a lifesaving purpose. We are not in any way diminishing the very necessary powers under the Act to deal with clinical research and clinical trials.</P>

      <P>Section 2 (b) applies to students who are undergoing a course of training and this would apply to students who might make something themselves in a laboratory and then taste it.  For example, a pharmaceutical student might make hydrochloric acid or vinegar and then taste it.  This gives them a perception of the taste of the substances they are working with and in that way they might be involved in a trial.  This subsection allows for that in very controlled circumstances and they would not need to go off and seek authority under the Bill from the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>We should run the whole gamut and perhaps the Minister would clarify the final exemptions covered in section 2 (c).  Perhaps the Minister would explain what is a normal dietary constituent. There are many health products coming on the market which are classified as a food rather than a preparation, and one such thing that springs to mind is &ldquo;Royal Jelly&rdquo; or a product of that nature. Would that be considered a normal dietary constituent?  What particular products had the Minister in mind in that subsection?</P>

I wonder if that global category entitles people to classify what may well be considered a drug as food and would the Minister be concerned that such a product would be exempted?</P>

      <P>Yes, I share Deputy Howlin's concern, and I have been concerned about products on the market. We have drawn up a list of products that have to be licensed because we believe they are medicines and drugs.  Indeed, we have had discussions with people <Col N="605" /> involved in promoting the sale of these products and we are monitoring this very carefully.  A great many of these products now have to have product authorisation from the National Drugs Advisory Board, so that if we have the slightest concern about a product we refer it to the board.  The Deputy is quite right that many products are coming on the market and it is very important that they are monitored closely and that if we have any doubt about them they should be referred to the National Drugs Advisory Board for product authorisation before they can be sold.</P>

We need to be assured that there will be an orderly legal framework for the conduct of clinical trials and that there will be ample protection and financial compensation in the event of a disaster.

      <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell me what written commitments or contracts are given to the volunteers as to the duration of monitoring and the extent of the insurance cover available to them. In other words, are the volunteers just walking in off the street, signing a form and then walking out, or is there an enforceable agreement established between the person being tested and the agency or hospital carrying out the test?</P>

      <P>I agree with the point raised by Deputy Yates, although obviously one cannot be specific in a Bill because all trials are different.  However, I agree with the Deputy that it is important that there is sufficient compensation to take account of the participant and the obligations to their dependants in the event of a mishap.</P>
      <P>On the question of the draft regulations, we do not have them available at present, but we will be working on them and I am taking account of this amendment to the 1987 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne raised the question of contracts and under section 9 of the principal Act each participant has to give his or her informed consent.  In fact, the whole purpose of the 1987 Act was to protect the participants in a trial while at the same time ensuring that we did not impede legitimate research.  Section 9 of that Act went to great lengths to ensure that the participant in the clinical trials gives his or her informed consent, and sets out the preliminary steps to be taken to ensure that the person is medically fit and has been examined by an independent medical practitioner.  There is good protection for the participant and somebody could not just walk in off the street and say: I would like to participate in a trial.  That is totally against the spirit of the Act and in fact it would be illegal for a clinician to take somebody off the <Col N="607" /> street because the Act is very specific in order to ensure that we deal with the very point that Deputy Byrne has raised, that is, to protect the interests of the participant. In addition, there is a six day cooling off period after the participant gives his or her consent, so there is no danger of somebody being walked into participating in a trial for whatever reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister cannot be specific but perhaps he could give us some idea of what is meant by &ldquo;insurance&rdquo;, &ldquo;indemnity&rdquo;, &ldquo;a guarantee&rdquo;, &ldquo;a surety&rdquo; and whether the figure involved is £10,000 or £1 million?  Would the Minister give us some idea of the type of bonds involved?  Second, the reason that section 10 of the principal Act failed is that insurance was not available to ethics committees and individuals, and will insurance be made available now? Has the Minister had discussions with the Medical Protection Society and the Medical Defence Union to see that both the clinicians and the participants are covered by insurance?</P>

      <P>The activities of the doctors are covered by the two professional organisations, the Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society.  With regard to the question of the exact amount, it is very difficult to be specific on this.  I will be taking actuarial advice on how we can, depending on the nature of the trial and the risk, ensure that the appropriate provision has been made.  This is the sort of issue on which I would take professional advice.  I would be doing an injustice to Deputy Yates and the House if I were to give a figure off the top of my head. I want to ensure that there is proper protection for the participant and, as I have said, I will be taking actuarial advice on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was absent when I spoke on Second Stage.  This is the section about which I am most concerned. While I am very anxious to let the ethics committees off the hook and allow the research to proceed, I am not anxious to let everybody off the hook so that when something goes wrong people will find it impossible to claim.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the question of negligence in his reply on Second Stage.  If, to give a hypothetical example, the Minister gives approval to St. James's Hospital to carry out a trial in which I am the participant and it suddenly transpires that something went wrong &mdash; the insurance was not in order because someone in the Department made a mistake in checking it &mdash; this would mean that approval could not be given to my claim for £1 million when it should have been given.  Section 5 (1) does not make any reference to negligence or an error; it just says &ldquo;... have been caused or contributed to by reason of or arising from the discharge of any of their functions... .&rdquo;.  This would include the Minister, the Department and the NDAB.  If something goes wrong, who will carry the can? In other words, who will the aggrieved participant sue?  This is such a global immunity for everybody, I wonder what form of redress there will be in the event of something going wrong.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; implies that it was done willingly.  In view of what the Minister has said it might be better to remove the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; from the section.  Wilful neglect is very hard to prove in court.  In the case referred to by Deputy Yates, there would be clear neglect, whereas wilful neglect means that there was a conspiracy almost to be neglectful and it was a matter of free will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the words &ldquo;wilful neglect&rdquo; were in the Bill alone I certainly <Col N="610" /> would be prepared to look at it, but as section 5 refers to &ldquo;wilful neglect or default&rdquo; I think that covers the point made by Deputy Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole situation will be changed <i>vis-á-vis</i> the 1987 Act, where the ethics committees were responsible. Under this Bill the Minister will be responsible for approving the claim, but it is very difficult to see how one could take a case against him under section 5. Will the Minister outline the circumstances where he would see any of the groups under paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) having any responsibility for their actions in overseeing clinical trials?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister is collecting his thoughts on that point, I want to pursue one step further the words &ldquo;wilful neglect or default&rdquo;.  Any court looking at this section could go with both categories.  This would weaken a case to the point of making it extraordinarily difficult for anybody to take action against the Minister or anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think both categories stand alone in section 5.  I have an open mind on this.  The only difficulty I would have in removing the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; from section 5 is that I would have to go back to the Seanad and possibly come back to this House.  I think it is clear that the two categories stand alone.  If it was intended to cover wilful default the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; would be included the second time.  I do not think it is necessary to remove the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo;.  As I have said, if the word &ldquo;default&rdquo; was not included in section 5 I would have the same reservations as the Deputies.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the damage to employment prospects in the building industry as a result of a work-to-rule in the planning department of Dublin Corporation due to the failure of the Minister for the Environment to provide adequate staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this important matter.  Since Monday of this week officials in the planning department of Dublin Corporation have commenced a work-to-rule which has resulted in their refusal to work on any environmental assessment study that comes into the planning department, nor will they work on files which were previously dealt with by colleagues who are now on holidays.  Indeed, other flexible measures have been terminated as they revert to a strict work-to-rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A meeting tomorrow will consider the response from management and, if it is <Col N="612" /> not sympathetic, it is likely that the work-to-rule will be escalated.  The reason for this untypical action by planning officials is the deterioration in working conditions and the morale of personnel in the planning department.  There has been a return to the level of planning applications which pertained three or five years ago, but now the back-up staff available to deal with those applications are far fewer in number than they should be.  There have also been changes in the way in which planners have to carry out their work.  With the introduction of planning fees in the early eighties, for which I was partly responsible, many prospective developers require their architectural consultants to enter into pre-planning discussions with planning officers prior to the submission of an application.  This, in effect, intensifies the workload of planners prior to the evaluation of an application.</P>
    <P>New legislation has increased the workload in a number of areas.  There should be 40 professional planners in the planning department of Dublin Corporation but at present there are only 31 permanent persons employed, according to the information I received from Dublin Corporation.  Many senior personnel opted for the voluntary redundancy scheme introduced by the previous minority Fianna Fáil Government and their positions within the ranks of the professional planners have not been filled. A number of temporary junior planning staff have been taken on recently, but the level of their experience and responsibility does not fill the needs of the planning department.</P>
    <P>Until recently there had been a major shortage of staff on the administrative side of the planning department resulting, for example, in the fact that it takes six to six and a half weeks for a planning application file to effectively land on the desk of the planning officer who would make the evaluation.  The real time, out of the eight weeks required within which, normally speaking, the planning department must make a decision, has shrunk to less than ten days in some cases.  I know from my direct experience that the <Col N="613" /> tensions and pressures on the staff have been intense in recent times.  There have been delays and, as the records will show, there have been frequent requests for an extension of time.  I could elaborate on the nature of the problem involved but I want to confine my remarks to what I am asking the Minister for the Environment to do.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to recognise that, particularly in the planning department of Dublin Corporation, there has been a massive collapse of morale, occasioned in part by pressures of work and unsatisfactory working conditions and because of poor promotional prospects in relation to some posts which have remained unfilled because of the rigidity occasioned by the interpretation of the embargo by the Department of the Environment and, more particularly, by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The most important reason for the collapse of morale is because of the cloud of suspicion which still hangs over the planning department and which has not been removed by the Garda inquiry which seems to be in limbo.  As you know, Sir, I have attempted to raise that matter in an orderly manner in this House but I have been frustrated on numerous occasions, not by any malevolence on your part, but simply by the law of the land.  It is the responsibility of either the Minister for Justice or the Minister for the Environment to bring the situation to finality.  The Minister for the Environment may shake his head, but he invited the Garda in and I now suggest that he terminates their inquiry as quickly as possible because their continued presence and the continuation of that inquiry is in part &mdash; I do not want to over-emphasise the point &mdash; contributing to a deterioration in morale.</P>
    <P>What is the impact of the work-to-rule on the rest of Dublin city?  There has been a very welcome upturn in construction activity in Dublin city.  Everybody in the industry welcomed it and it would be churlish not to.  However, the delays caused within the industry are not selfimposed; they have been caused by the Government by virtue of their failure to recognise that if you improve the general economic condition you must keep pace <Col N="614" /> with it.  Of course, the increase in interest rates has caused problems; but there has been an extension of the designated urban areas and the reintroduction of what is commonly known as the section 23 provision.  This has increased the volume of activity in terms of applications to the planning department at precisely the time when the resources of that department were not up to the task involved.  It has resulted in a logjam which is causing a crisis in the planning department in Dublin Corporation, where planners have taken this unprecedented action.</P>
    <P>I will not advert to the problems that have been compounded by the chaos in relation to building by-laws and the complete failure of the Minister for the Environment to implement the Building Control Act.  That is a matter for another occasion.  I suggest to the Minister that he request the city manager, the relevant officials in his Department and in the Department of Finance &mdash; in so far as they have a role &mdash; to have a meeting as a matter of urgency with representatives of the staff involved and their union, the Local Government Public Services Union.  If the Minister for the Environment wants to give effect to some of the other measures he has taken for stimulating the building industry, he must ensure that extra staff are made available for the planning department.  In that regard, I should like to point out to him that the substantial planning fees which the industry now have to pay in many cases were designed in part to ensure that the cost of processing planning applications would have been met by the industry, but now the industry feel that they are partly subsidising certain aspects of central taxation which it was never designed to do in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment should, as a matter of considerable urgency, open up direct lines of communication with the city manager and the assistant city manager who are responsible for administering the planning department and to remove other bottlenecks which, if taken together, slow down the process of planning evaluation and decision making and which, consequently, frustrate the measures the <Col N="615" /> Government have taken.  The work-to-rule will imperil prospects in the building industry at present in Dublin city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for his generous remarks in relation to the upsurge in building activity and in the construction industry generally.  It is good of him to recognise that, we are all pleased to see it and it is our intention to make sure that nothing impedes the progress for which we have been waiting so long and which is now coming to fruition.</P>
      <P>It is not my function to provide staff for the corporation and Deputy Quinn knows that.  The provision of staff is entirely a matter for the local authority themselves in the first instance and there are no proposals before my Department seeking sanction for the creation of additional planning posts.  The manager also has complete discretion in relation to the allocation of staffing to the various programme areas of the corporation.  It is entirely a matter for the manager to decide on the most effective manner to deploy staff, bearing in mind the needs and requirements of the various work programmes.  The resolution of any difficulties which have arisen in any area is a matter between the corporation and the union representing the staff involved. The corporation now have discretion to fill posts within their overall staffing levels at 31 December 1989 and the designating of such posts is entirely a matter for the manager.</P>
      <P>I fail to see that this work to rule will unduly damage the employment prospects in the building industry.  It seems this motion is extreme in that it relates the difficulties in the planning department of Dublin Corporation to damaging employment prospects in the building industry, because this is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Deputy mentioned the building industry because it gives me the opportunity to tell the House of progress made in the industry in the past few years. Employment in the building industry is estimated to have increased from 70,000 in April 1989 to 74,000 in April this year. A further increase of 4,000 is forecast for <Col N="616" /> the 12-month period up to April of next year.  Output in the industry is booming. We had an increase of about 8 per cent last year and we are forecasting a further increase of about 10 per cent this year.  Of course this did not happen in a vacuum.  It happened because the Government took specific action in 1987 to turn around the industry.  Between 1981 and 1988 output volume had fallen by nearly 40 per cent. We have now reversed the situation. Output will increase by almost 20 per cent in the two-year period 1989 and 1990.  In two years we will have recovered a large part of the losses incurred in the previous seven-year period.  This is no mean achievement.  It is one I am glad to put on the record of the House.  For the Deputy's information, I understand there are 62 professional posts in the planning department.</P>
    <P>The matter concerning morale which the Deputy mentioned is something he knows I cannot comment on at this time for the obvious reason that it is <i>sub judice,</i> but in accordance with his desires I would like the matter to be disposed of as quickly as possible.  I am satisfied that work is carrying on in a normal and satisfactory way.  Should there be any difficulties in the matter in the first instance &mdash; and in the last instance &mdash; it is for the corporation to deal with them.  I believe it is not interfering with the level of activity in the industry at this time and it is hoped the union will be able to withdraw their work to rule letter which they issued in the recent past.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of raising this very important issue.  I have always had an interest in the child care provisions we have in this State.  In particular, since January of this year when a critical situation emerged in parts of my constituency, in Ballymun in particular, with problems of accommodating large numbers of homeless young people who were turning up at the door of Fr. McVerry's hostel, I have been following it even more closely.  In that time &mdash; it is only a few months &mdash; I have built up quite a substantial file.</P>
      <P>Week after week we have had cases such as this of centres being forced to turn away homeless boys.  The Government knew they had to respond to the efforts of Justice Wine who refused to allow a young girl to disappear back into the woodwork to cope with her problems alone and waited until the Government responded before he would deal with her case.  We have had, as I said, the sad row over Fr. McVerry's hostel.  He will not turn away homeless young people and as a result his accommodation, which is intended to provide for only five children at any given time, provides for between 12 and 15.  There are two such hostels close to my constituency.</P>
      <P>While those two cases have attracted attention, I am concerned about many young people who are not coming to the attention of either the press or the Department and are forgotten about. Those young people, particularly the more disturbed children, have been turned away from other hostels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following my involvement with the Ballymun problem I visited Percy Place, where a health board funded hostel is intended to provide short term emergency care.  The pressure on that unit is so great and the provision of suitable longterm places is so inadequate that the emergency short term places are almost inevitably filled with long stay clients, as they are referred to.  There is nowhere for them to go, so much so that to deal <Col N="618" /> with the problem there has been a suggestion of sending one or two of the most difficult cases over to England.  This is an Irish solution to a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>What happens to these young people who cannot find a place?  They are lucky if they arrive at Fr. McVerry's hostel because he will not turn them away even if it means overcrowding or causes immense problems with the neighbourhood. But what of those who turn up at the other hostels to be told the hostels are full, and are turned away? They go back on the streets, or perhaps to homes they have left because of serious problems.  Quite often they move from relative to friend.  All too often they find shelter all right but at the price of being involved in criminal activity or being sexually abused, whether male or female. That is not overstating the problem; that is the experience of many homeless young people.  For them sexual favours or petty crimes are a small price to pay for having a roof over their head.  They have very little choice indeed.  Which of us might not make such a choice if they were the stark choices left to us at the age of 12, 14, 16 or 18, when there is no place to put down one's head?</P>
    <P>It is a growing problem.  All youth leaders and voluntary workers are aware it is on the increase.  In 1987 the Eastern Health Board alone estimated &mdash; and they are not known for their exaggerated assessment of problems &mdash; there were 406 people under 18 homeless.  In the last decade, when the problem was on the increase, the number of residential places reduced as many of the more old fashioned youth centres, homes and orphanges closed down.  There is an immediate need for the Minister, as junior Minister, to devote all his time to this problem.  I know he is working hard on the Child Care Bill, but it is working hard on the Child Care Bill, but it is clear that when that Bill goes through there will still be huge gaps in services, still huge areas needing to be legislated for, still a total lack of co-ordination between the Minister's Department and the Departments of Education and Justice.</P>
    <P>There has been total failure at Cabinet level to iron out the centralisation and unification of services for young children in one Department, the Department of <Col N="619" /> Health, who have long been accepted by all who study in the field as the appropriate Department to look after young people.  when that Bill goes through, after its long, tortuous and slow process through this House under a number of Governments, it will leave areas of juvenile justice totally undealt with and huge gaps in co-ordination of service.  It will also fail to deal with the adoption area adequately.  There will be need for more Bills in those areas.</P>
    <P>At the moment, in response to the recent case i referred to, which emerged in the courts, the Eastern Health Board and the Department of Education have committed themselves to the provision of a secure therapeutic unit in Finglas for girls, with some less intense services located there, and providing 20 places.  I think my colleague will indicate that the problem at the moment of the Eastern Health Board is not as intense elsewhere, or as localised.  However, it is increasing in all the cities and towns around the country, where the numbers, spread over the rest of the country, would be approximately equal to those of the Eastern Health Board.  In that area 20 new places were provided for girls as a result of that case.  It took constant embarrassment in the courts and publicity to get action on that.  Four places are currently being provided in a small hostel in my constituency. There are no provisions for new places for boys.  There is an urgent need for a secure therapeutic unit for boys, because even existing facilities are being undermined by having to accommodate very disturbed young men, who are not suitable and who need a very special regime. These are the young men whom the EHB are proposing to send off to Britain.  We often look to that society as being less Christian than ours but they provided facilities to try to make up to these young people for what has happened to them.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for an absolute concentration and devotion of the Minister's time to the child care problem. There is a need for increased impetus, increased resources for the provision of a secure therapeutic unit for boys and there must be a planned programme to provide adequate places.  This is not an <Col N="620" /> enormous problem but it is a very intense and immediate one for the children involved and for the society into which they will emerge damaged and destructive if we do not act.  All of those who have worked in voluntary organisations have said that they can have great success with those young people.  What they need is political support and an indication that there is the political will to solve the problem.  I want the Minister to make a commitment tonight to a greatly improved performance in meeting this serious and growing problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flaherty for sharing her time and I compliment her on what she has said.  As Deputy Flaherty said, research suggests that there are more than 700 young people who are homeless here, 300 to 400 being outside of Dublin.  It is not just a city phenomenon but an increasing problem throughout the country.  Because of the absence of emergency accommodation many children in Dublin have to sleep rough.  In January, 43 people under the age of 18 presented themselves to Focus Point seeking accommodation. Unfortunately they had to turn away 26 who presumably had to sleep rough.  Only four of the people who presented themselves at Focus Point in January were properly accommodated.  The problem is continuing.  In the month of May 38 people presented themselves to Focus Point, 17 male and 21 female and only a small proportion were adequately accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is becoming a major problem. These children risk becoming involved in anti-social behaviour including petty crime, prostitution, drug taking, alcoholism and other types of behavioural problems. They are exposed to all types of exploitation and it has been suggested that two weeks living rough can cause irreparable damage to the personality of a young person, which makes rehabilitation very difficult.  Lack of emergency accommodation is a major problem. There are two emergency hostels for girls in Dublin with ten emergency places and one hostel for boys with ten places. However, as some young people remain in these hostels for more than a night or <Col N="621" /> a week the emergency places are lost so that other people have no place to stay. The immediate solution is to provide additional emergency places.</P>
    <P>This problem is nationwide.  The report of the task force on child care services published in 1980 made a number of recommendations which were not implemented.  They recommended the setting up of a national council to advise on services for children, and a network of child care authorities throughout the country to provide services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of Deputies about the plight of homeless children and young persons and I would assure the House that the Government are fully aware of the problem and are taking a range of initiatives to deal with it.  I would like to briefly outline some of the main developments that have been set in train, by our Government.</P>
      <P>We have established a special fund of £4 million from the National Lottery for the development of services for disadvantaged young persons.  The overall objective is to develop a wide range of community youth projects, aimed at meeting the needs of those young people who are facing special problems.  In the allocation of this fund, priority consideration is given to the needs of the young homeless, young travellers and young substance abusers.  A sum of £1 million has been set aside for the development of new services and initiatives aimed specifically at these groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the young homeless are concerned, the main initiatives which are being assisted from this fund are in the Eastern Health Board area and include the following: a new community residential project for homeless boys is being <Col N="622" /> established in the Tallaght area.  This project will provide residential care for six boys aged between 12 and sixteen years; a similar residential project for homeless girls is to be located in the Ballymun area, and it is hoped that this will be operational later this year; a new residential unit for boys has been set up in Clontarf, which is providing longer-term accommodation for up to 10 boys in the 11-14 years age group; the Eastern Health Board have developed a new project called &ldquo;Carers for Young People&rdquo;. The aim of this scheme is to place up to 10 very difficult children aged 14-16 years, with suitable families, who are at present being specially selected and trained; and a shelter for homeless boys in Ballymun run by the Arrupe Society is also receiving financial assistance from the special fund.</P>
    <P>In addition the Eastern Health Board has set up a special team of social workers, to deal specifically with homeless children and young people.  They are based in the areas of greatest need, that is, Tallaght, Ballyfermot, Ballymun, the north inner city and the south inner city. They are supported by the board's homeless persons unit, in Charles Street, where a social worker is available to provide counselling, advisory and referral services, to homeless young people.</P>
    <P>Outside of the Dublin area, a number of other initiatives for the young homeless, young travellers and young substance abusers in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Tralee, Tullamore and Sligo, are also being supported from the special fund financed from the National Lottery.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives I might mention include a recent report prepared by the Mid-Western Health Board in co-operation with Limerick Social Services Council on the problem of youth homelessness in the mid-western area.  The Mid-Western Health Board are now preparing an action plan to deal with what has been described as the manageable problem of youth homelessness in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that funding has been made available by the Minister for the Environment for special projects for young homeless.  For example, the organisation &ldquo;Focus Point&rdquo; has received capital <Col N="623" /> funding of about £1 million from the Department of the Environment's Voluntary Housing Scheme towards the cost of a new flatlet project at Stanhope Street, Dublin, for vulnerable young homeless persons.  Already grants amounting to £1.4 million have been paid to them and expenditure of a further £600,000 has been sanctioned for them. In addition Focus Point have received funding of about £50,000 from the Department of the Environment towards a residential facility at Arran Quay in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to say that all legal and statutory responsibility for children should be in one Department.  There are many complex reasons why this is not so. The Department of Health have responsibility for the health of children, the Department of Education have responsibility for education and the Department of Justice are responsible in the justice and criminal area.  It is not possible to take the expertise based in these different areas into one Department.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware the lack of clear-cut statutory responsibility for homeless persons in the 16 to 18 years age group has caused some difficulties in developing an effective response to the problem.  I am glad to say that this is being rectified in the Child Care Bill, which has now completed its passage through the Special Committee which was set up to examine it.  An entirely new section has been inserted in the Bill which will impose a clear obligation on our health boards to provide accommodation <Col N="624" /> for homeless young people, up to the age of 18 years, who have no accommodation available to them which they can reasonably occupy and who are unable to arrange accommodation for themselves. In such a case, a health board will be required to take steps, to make available accommodation for the homeless young person concerned.  This is an important change in our legislative framework and I am confident that, taken in conjunction with the new powers being given to health boards to develop child care and family support services, it will go a long way towards relieving the problem of young homeless persons on the streets of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had the responsibility to deal with the Child Care Bill on behalf of the Government.  We have a very positive Child Care Committee and outstanding departmental staff involved in a very committed way.  I am confident that we will have an excellent Child Care legislative framework in position by the end of the year.  I trust that this new legislation, along with the other initiatives we have taken, will go a long way towards alleviating the problems of the young homeless.</P>

      <P>The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, requires An Post to provide a national postal service to meet the industrial, commercial, social and household needs of the State.  That Act also requires the company to ensure that its revenue are not less than sufficient to meet all charges properly chargeable to revenue account, to generate a reasonable proportion of capital needs and to remunerate capital and repay borrowing.  It is, therefore, a matter for An Post to tackle its financial problems and return to profitability.</P>
      <P>The operation of post offices and the postal arrangements relating to particular areas are operational matters coming within the day to day activities of An Post.  There is no requirement under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, for my approval for the closure of sub-post offices.  I am not aware that An Post has made any decision in relation to the closure of sub-post offices. However, I have no doubt that the company would, before arriving at a decision in the matter, give full consideration to all relevant factors, including the implications for its customers.</P>

      <P>In addition to the offences mentioned in that reply, it is an offence under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1988, to possess, work, use, or instal apparatus for wireless telegraphy unless it is in accordance with a licence issued under those Acts.  It is also an offence to sell or otherwise supply apparatus for wireless telegraphy to a person without a licence. In this regard the devices in question constitute wireless telegraphy apparatus.

      <P>The position generally in relation to the matters raised in these questions was outlined in my response to the question on 25 April, 1990 &mdash; Official Report, vol. 397, cols. 2167-2169 &mdash; and remains unchanged.  What I said was that the Supreme Court decision, which consists of four judgements, was under examination and I was not in a position to indicate the steps that might be appropriate for me to take in relation to the matters concerned.  I went on to say that in so far as new legislation might be involved I could not undertake to say, in the context of parliamentary questions, whether or not I might have proposals for legislative changes in particular areas. Any such proposals would be announced, in the ordinary way, only after Government approval.</P>
      <P>That examination of the Supreme Court judgments, which is not yet concluded, will extend to the possible implications, so far as I, as Minister for Justice, may be concerned, of decisions made in civil cases.  Pending the outcome of the examination I would not be prepared to speculate as to the effects on individual litigants.</P>
      <P>However, I cannot accept the Deputy's assertion that thousands of criminal convictions are involved and the implication that numbers of convicted criminals would be released.  That case is under appeal.  In that regard I am aware of the recent quashing by the High Court of a conviction involving a prision sentence. I understand that no similar cases have arisen since then and I am not aware of any applications pending.</P>

      <Quest>the reasons the money allocated in the Estimates in 1987, 1988 and 1989 for training, equipment and materials within the prison service, was substantially underused in each year; if he has satisfied himself that training facilities within the prison service are adequate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The allocation in the Prisons Vote for training equipment and materials is in respect of industrial training activities at the training unit, adjacent to Mountjoy Prison, and at the new place of detention at Wheatfield.  This training is as recommended by FÁS and CERT and is designed to prepare offenders for employment after imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The under-expenditure of the Estimates provision for 1987, 1988 and 1989 arose from the fact that provision was made each year to equip and supply the new place of detention at Wheatfield.  In the event financial expenditure of the extent envisaged did not become necessary here until 1989/1990.  Also, provision was made in 1987 and 1988 for the expansion of training programmes at the training unit but, on account of constraints on public service expenditure and staffing, this did not materialise.</P>
      <P>It should be noted however that total expenditure on industrial training programmes in the three years totalled £440,000 and a further £1.2 million was spent on equipment and materials for the wide range of occupational work which is available for offenders and which, of course, has a training content.  These figures are apart altogether from the staff costs involved.</P>
      <P>In addition to the industrial training and occupational work that I have mentioned, a wide range of other activities such as craft work, hobbies and physical training is provided for in the institutions generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am satisfied that a great deal of very useful training is provided, I am aware that it is not available to a significant number of prisoners in some <Col N="486" /> institutions.  My Department is considering means by which the position can be improved.</P>

      <P>This is clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs.  However, I am hopeful that it should be possible to improve the situation as a result of the Government's decision to increase the board's grant-in-aid for this year to its highest ever level at £2.163 million, which has enabled the board to keep open four law centres which otherwise would have had to close and to take on a substantial number of staff at solicitor and administrative levels. Following that decision a number of administrative and solicitor vacancies have been filled and the board is in the process of recruiting solicitors to fill other vacancies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the concern referred to. Because of the wide variety of factors taken into account by the Judiciary, it is inevitable that sentences will vary even in cases which appear to be similar. Judgment as to whether a sentence appears to be too harsh or too lenient <Col N="488" /> depends on the weight given to these factors individually.  In the circumstances, and bearing in mind the constitutional independence of the Judiciary, it is necessary to be careful about over-reacting to decisions in individual cases. I can accept, however, that, from time to time the decisions reached in certain cases can raise general issues about sentencing which ought to be addressed.  As it happens the topic of sentencing policy is one of a number of issues in the criminal Law area that has been referred to the Law Reform Commission for examination and report as part of their current programme and I except that the commission will address these general issues in the course of its work.  I am, therefore, deferring further consideration of the matter until the commission's report is available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment in the bakery sector has fallen from 7,339 in 1986 to 4,726 by mid 1989.  As many of the bakeries closed in that period had mixed bread and confectionery business it is not possible <Col N="494" /> to indicate how many jobs were solely bread-related.</P>
    <P>The number of bakeries operating in that period has declined from 275 to 253. Over half of these would be classified as small with less than 10 employees.</P>
    <P>Because of concern over employment in the bakery industry, I decided along with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ask the sectoral development committee to examine and make recommendations to the Government on the future of the bakery sector in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The committee's report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published shortly.</P>

    <P> * The term &ldquo;Non-General Courses&rdquo; is used to distinguish pupils enrolled in such courses from those pupils enrolled in Junior Cycle, Leaving Certifi cate and Transition Year Courses.  Data provided in the reply are, therefore, exclusive of pupils enrolled in the three types of course.  For the Secondary Vocational, Community and Comprehensive sectors, a break-down of pupils in non-general courses between &ldquo;Secretarial Courses&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other Courses&rdquo; is not available for the 1988-89 and 1989-90 Academic Years.  With regard to the question of certification, it should be noted that the vast majority of Secondary, Vocational, Community and Comprehensive pupils enrolled in Non-General Courses are enrolled under the Vocational Preparation and Training Scheme.  Under the terms of the V.P.T. scheme, certification of pupils is the responsibility of the school concerned and, consequently, data are not available concerning the exact details of certificates awarded to participants.  It may be assumed, however, given the broad-based nature of the V .P.T. scheme, that many students are provided with instruction in computers and related applications.  Data concerning certification of pupils in non-aided schools are not available.</P>
    <P>&dagger;Data in respect of non-aided schools refer only to those schools who made statistical returns to the Department.  For example, in relation to th he 1989-90 Academic Year, ten out of a total of thirty-three schools surveyed provided statistical data on their enrolments.</P>
    <P>&Dagger;Data in respect of the 1989-90 Academic Year are provisional. </P>
