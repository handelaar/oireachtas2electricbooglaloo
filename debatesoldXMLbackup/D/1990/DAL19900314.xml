      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30, I wish to give notice of my intention to move the Adjournment of the Dáil at the start of business to discuss a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely that this House is concerned at the implications for the Anglo-Irish Agreement and for Anglo-Irish relations generally arising from the <Col N="2" /> Supreme Court's extradition decision of yesterday's date and calls on the Government to state their intentions in relation to future extradition arrangements, having regard to the need for an efficient arrangement which continues to protect the basic rights of all citizens.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to increase from £100 million to £106 million the amount of additional share capital which the Minister for Finance may invest in the B &amp; I Line.  This enables the Minister for Finance to purchase sufficient additional shares in the company to give effect to a recent Government decision to provide the company with up to £6 million in Exchequer equity in 1990.</P>
      <P>In 1988, when the House had before it the B &amp; I Line Act, 1988, the company were going through a very difficult period.  Mounting financial losses required the implementation of a plan of action involving major restructuring which had across-the-board support from the company's workforce.  The major elements of the plan were implemented during the course of 1988.  They included a reduction in staff numbers by 565, from 1,464 to 899, a pay out of 5 per cent and a pay freeze until July 1989.  In addition, the Dublin-Liverpool car ferry service was terminated and the m.v. <i>Connacht</i> and some North Wall properties were sold.  Furthermore, a consolidated loan agreement was agreed with the banks on repayment of the B &amp; I's borrowings subject to a mortgage on the company's assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of these and other measures, the company's performance improved substantially during 1988 and this favourable trend continued during 1989.  B &amp; I's performance during 1989 included an upturn in both freight and passenger traffic, an improved financial <Col N="11" /> outturn, as well as a generally good industrial relations record.  A significant agreement was reached during 1989 with Sealink Harbours Limited following intervention by my predecessor, Deputy Wilson, under which B &amp; I obtained more suitable sailing schedules at Holyhead from January of this year together with a new formula for calculating port charges.  These new measures will assist the company's future operations.</P>
    <P>In 1989 we also saw the successful negotiation of a general pay agreement within B &amp; I, based on the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> covering the period up to the end of June 1991.</P>
    <P>Since the implementation of the plan of action, the company have operated four principal services.  The main route is the Dublin-Holyhead route, using the m.v. <i>Leinster</i> which accommodates passenger, car and roll-on/roll-off freight traffic.  The Rosslare-Pembroke route will be serviced this year by the recently chartered m.v. <i>Munster</i> carrying passenger, car and roll-on/roll-off freight traffic.  B &amp; I also operate roll-on/roll-off freight services on the Dublin-Liverpool route, in conjunction with Pandoro, with the m.v. <i>Bison</i> and m.v. <i>Buffalo.</i> Finally, the company operate a European container service from Dublin for lift-on/lift-off freight to Le Havre, Antwerp and Rotterdam using the m.v. <i>Tipperary</i> and m.v. <i>Kilkenny.</i> It is clear, therefore, that the services provided by B &amp; I play a very important role in Ireland's merchandise and tourism trading links with our EC partners.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear at this stage that, contrary to some recent media publicity, this current Bill is not part of a further &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; package for B &amp; I, born out of some new crisis in the company. In fact, as I have indicated, the company have performed well over the past years and continues to do so.  I would like to remind the House that the plan of action implemented in 1988 was a five year one. We are now in year three and the turn around in the company's fortunes have been encouraging.  At the same time, I do not wish to give the impression that <Col N="12" /> there is any room for complacency.  There is still a long way to go and further sustained effort from the management and workforce of this company continues to be a major imperative.  We cannot overlook the fact that the company are still very much dependent on the Exchequer for financial support.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I would like to acknowledge the sacrifices that have been made by all within the company to ensure the survival of B &amp; I.  That spirit of commitment must be maintained if progress is to continue.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report to the House that the B &amp; I plan of action has enabled B &amp; I to return operating profits of £1.8 million and £2.8 million in 1988 and 1989, respectively.  However, corporate interest charges exceeding £4 million in both years have meant that net losses of £2.9 million in 1988 and £1.5 million in 1989 were incurred.  I would emphasise in that regard that, were it not for the burden of interest charges on historic debt arising from losses accumulated by B &amp; I prior to 1988, the company would at this stage be recording net profits. However, the burden of debt is unfortunately, a commercial reality with which the company have to cope.  I also think it important at this point to recall that the financial results of the B &amp; I over the past two years have been better than those envisaged in 1988 when the affairs of B &amp; I were last debated comprehensively in this House.  It was envisaged at that time that the company would require some £17 million in equity over the two years 1988 and 1989.  In fact, the Exchequer was called on to invest only £1 million in the B &amp; I over that period, or £6 million less than originally envisaged. This outcome is due in no small measure to the joint efforts of management and staff in turning the company around.</P>
    <P>In tandem with these financial improvements, B &amp; I have gained increased business in their car, ro/ro and lo/lo activities.  In each case, B &amp; I business grew significantly between 1987 and 1989 and further increases are projected in 1990.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> While the company's financial and operational performance has been better than expected, it is nevertheless clear that the B &amp; I remain in a difficult commercial position.  Their trading environment remains highly competitive.  There remains too, for various reasons, the problem of a significant diversion of freight traffic from the Republic via Larne, notwithstanding the greater road distances involved in using this route. The financial performance of B &amp; I over the coming years will clearly depend, therefore, upon how well the company can cope with this difficult trading environment.</P>
    <P>I have already said that there is no room for complacency notwithstanding the improved results over the past two years.  The B &amp; I plan of action has been relatively successful to date.  However, it is important that the options for the company's future development be reassured.  In order to determine the future capability of the B &amp; I to survive commercially and to develop without the need for continued Exchequer support, I intend to carry out over the coming months a review of the company's prospects with a view to identifying the best options for their future development.  It is timely to carry out such a review at this stage, now that the B &amp; I plan of action has had two successful years of implementation, and also in view of the increasing importance with which the Government view our access transport services, having regard both to our trade and tourism needs and the development of the Single European Market. Looking at the wider market, it must be remembered that B &amp; I already contribute substantially to the development of trade and tourism in Ireland.  In volume terms, the dominant access mode is sea tansport, accounting for over 80 per cent of total merchandise trade and 50 per cent of passenger movements.  Our dependence on reliable and frequent shipping services is very high.  Notwithstanding greater competition from air services in recent years, shipping services continue to play a major role in servicing our growing tourism industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> While the importance of foot passenger traffic has declined by 34 per cent for all sea carriers on Irish Sea routes since 1985, car and coach passenger traffic has held up well and B &amp; I will again make a significant contribution to Ireland's tourism industry this year by carrying a projected 310,000 visitors and 70,000 foreign cars to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ireland's competitiveness has been adversely affected in recent years by a lack of resources for investment in shipping services and in associated infrastructural facilities.  This has caused problems for Irish industry in the areas of transit delays, poor delivery times and diseconomies of scale.  The <i>National Development Plan, 1989-93,</i> has already pointed out that transport costs for Irish exporters account for between 9 per cent and 10 per cent of export sales values, which is effectively double that borne by Community countries trading with one another on the European mainland.</P>
    <P>Clearly, therefore, the future performance of Irish trade and tourism, as well as Irish shipping services, will critically depend on existing infrastructural inadequacies being remedied.  This was recognised not only in the National Development Plan but also in the more recent decision of the European Commission to make available, through the Community Support Framework for Ireland, EC funding designed to offset the effects of Ireland's peripherality in the Community.  To the extent that they contribute to reducing the effects of peripherality, the Commission has indicated that investments in roads, ports, airports and railways will qualify for EC assistance. My Department, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, are preparing a number of investment proposals for consideration by the EC Commission in the context of the operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructure.  Negotiations on this integreted programme should be finalised before the summer.  The programme, when implemented, will significantly improve the overall transport network, including shipping services of this country, and thereby alleviate the cost <Col N="15" /> disadvantages we currently suffer in moving our goods to our main export markets.</P>
    <P>In so far as freight services specifically are concerned, the House will already be aware that I have commissioned a consultancy study from Stokes Kennedy Crowley, the object of which is to recommend an investment strategy appropriate to, <i>inter alia,</i> the development of more intensive sea freight services to our major Community trading partners.  A steering committee representative of the Departments of Tourism and Transport, Finance and the Marine, as well as the European Commission, are overseeing this study which should be available to me within two months.  Apart from recommending desirable future investments, the study will also examine organisational factors in the Irish transport sector which affect the competitive position of Irish exporters <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European trading partners.  It is hoped that, in the light of the consultants' study, appropriate EC funding will be made available to improve Ireland's freight links with our Community partners.</P>
    <P>The challenges and opportunities facing Ireland as we move into the nineties demand a fresh appraisal of how Ireland's locational disadvantages <i>vis-à-vis</i> other more central European States can be eliminated or at least alleviated. Clearly, this requires a coherent investment programme in transport infrastructure and services.  The Government's overall aim is to focus the State's and the Community's investment resources in a manner which will maximise the benefits to Ireland's trading and tourism industries and help the economy realise its full potential.</P>
    <P>While it is, of course, important to bear in mind the future environment within which shipping services will operate, the Bill before the House today has a much more short-term focus.  While B &amp; I's financial position has improved in recent years, it is nevertheless necessary to provide further Exchequer equity in the current year to assist the company in meeting their scheduled financial commitments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> While scheduled repayments totalling £5.2 million will require to be met by B &amp; I in 1990, it is worth mentioning that the company plan by 1995 to discharge almost all of their currently outstanding capital obligations.</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious that B &amp; I's reliance on Exchequer financial support should be ended at the earliest possible time.  This issue will continue to be a primary focus in examining the future options for the company.  Only when the B &amp; I are commercially self-sufficient can they truly realise their full development potential.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it attempts to strengthen the balance sheet of a troubled State company now, thankfully, recuperating from a long illness.  It is not ungenerous of me to put on the record that the treatment of that illness started long before 1988 but during 1982 to 1987 when the then Minister for Communications had responsibility for that sector.  However, I am concerned that the B &amp; I may be about to become yet another piece of State silver to be sold off.  I note that the Minister said in his speech that it was not a question of a rescue package but later he said that it was important that the options for the company's future development be reassessed.  In a later part of his contribution he said:</P>
      <P>I intend to carry out over the coming months a review of the company's prospects with a view to identifying the best options for their future development. </P>
      <P>It seems clear to me what the Minister has in mind is the privatisation of B &amp; I and that that is his ultimate objective but he will not speak out here today and say that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael are not opposed in principle to the sale of State assets but will judge each proposed transaction on its merits.  In the case of B &amp; I I would have serious reservations about selling the company <Col N="17" /> at this time.  The need for a multiple of carriers in the Irish Sea is self-evident.  In an island economy we must not put at risk the future availability of floating infrastructure which is a life-line to commerce. In addition, the State bought B &amp; I in 1965 for £3.5 million, this is about £35 million in today's money.  The State put into B &amp; I a total of about £181 million, including the £6 million provided for in this Bill, at today's values.</P>
    <P>Sealink, a much larger company, were privatised for £66 million sterling in 1984. The sale of B &amp; I would only make sense if the State's investment could be recovered. Trading profits and losses for the B &amp; I Line have been: 1987, losses of £3.6 million; 1988, profits of £1.8 million; 1989, profits of £2.8 million and for 1990 there are estimated trading profits of £2.1 million.  The trading profits of recent years have been turned into losses by interest charges &mdash; which will be of the order of £3.7 million in 1990 &mdash; and exceptional items.  Nonetheless, the company are trading profitably and should not be considered a lame duck in an open season for shipping entrepreneurs.  The company have a two year pay agreement, vessels now valued at £6 million more than book values, new operating slots at Holyhead since January and a multipurpose carry ferry on charter which is being refurbished and will be going into service on the Irish Sea in a couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>The turning point for B &amp; I came with the plan of action put in place by the Fine Gael-Labour Government of 1982-87. We did not turn this company around to dispose of it easily to some bargain hunter.  There are strategic and economic reasons for retaining B &amp; I within the public sector for the foreseeable future and I would ask the Minister and the House to bear this in mind.  I shall be returning to this question on Committee Stage.  I think it is fair to point out, particularly in view of the fact that <i>The Irish Times</i> reports this morning that the Irish Continental Line have approached the Government with a view to becoming a partner in the State-owned B &amp; I Line. It is timely to remind the House that <Col N="18" /> B &amp; I are a valuable asset, they are not a lame duck, they are not a company which the Minister has said are in need of rescue.  The rescue is well under way. The improvement which took place between 1987 and 1989 in trading profits of £6.4 million indicate clearly that this company are on the up and up.  They are not a lame duck which are there to be taken by some other company without adequate compensation to the State.  The State have invested an enormous amount of money in this company.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism and passenger cars, in 1989 B &amp; I carried 162,000 cars, an improvement of 36,500 over 1987, an increase of 29 per cent.  In the ro-ro area, they had 51,000 units, an increase of 59 per cent over 1987.  In the lo-lo continental freight units they had 43,000 units in 1989, an increase of 65 per cent on 1987.  Obviously that is not a company who are in need of rescue and I accept the assurance given by the Minister to the House this morning that this is not a rescue package.</P>
    <P>There are a number of concerns which I would like to express at this stage.  It is worth noting that B &amp; I have been turned around despite some of the most outrageous trade union practices not tolerated or encouraged by the official trade union movement, for which I have a very high regard.</P>
    <P>A specific control in this company was broken and which, combined with the weak management, left the taxpayer in a disgracefully weak position.  This company was a leader in the disturbing development of the national finances in the seventies and in the eighties.  All that cancer which was within the B &amp; I has been eliminated.  That is welcome. Having done that, I do not think we can easily hand over this State asset to anybody. I do not think anybody who is interested in getting involved either in joint ventures or otherwise with the State should think that this is a bargain which can be easily taken over.</P>
    <P>The company face a major cost disadvantage at Dublin port as the chamber of commerce have recently pointed out. I take this opportunity to say that the <Col N="19" /> port must be put on a sound financial footing either by incorporation as a semi-State company, as recommended in the Horgan report, or as a privatised company along the lines of associated British ports.  Retaining the operation of the country's major port as a quasi-local authority is an anachronism and unless the Minister grasps the nettle Dublin will continue to lose traffic to Larne, Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare.  At present, approximately 125,000 units are collected by Northern Ireland carrirs from as far south as Cork.  They cross the Border and they exit not only through Larne &mdash; as pointed out by the Minister &mdash; but also through Warrenpoint and Belfast dock and are carried as far south as London by the same Northern Ireland carriers. All of this can be done more efficiently and more economically than exporting through either the southern or the central corridor of Rosslare or Dublin at a loss of £56 million per year, on the most recent estimates, to the State.</P>
    <P>Dublin port is an anachronism and the Minister should replace the port authority with a more efficient semi-State body, or a private port authority, as a matter of urgency.  When B &amp; I were in dire straits, because of airline deregulation in 1986, their rescue strategy was largely based on the Slattery bus company.  CIE chose to use Sealink.  That is their decision and they are entitled to make that decision on their own assessment of the commercial situation.  Given that the Slattery bus company was crucial to the survival of B &amp; I one must ask why the shipping section of the Department do not tell that to the bus section.  Why do CIE use Sealink exclusively?  The Minister who has responsibility for both of these State companies should ask that question.  Surely B &amp; I are entitled to expect a certain slice of the CIE group's business.</P>
    <P>The policy of the bus section of harassment of the bus operator is ridiculous and the Minister should reform the outdated 1932 Act immediately.  He should use all the resources within his Department to ensure that the bus and train <Col N="20" /> transport companies within the CIE group give B &amp; I a fair crack of the whip and do not put all their business in the way of Sealink.  Sealink, as the harbour authority in Holyhead, have not done any favours for B &amp; I, yet Sealink get very favourable treatment at Dún Laoghaire. The Minister mentioned that since January 1990, B &amp; I have negotiated better times and a better deal for themselves at Holyhead.  That has been frustrated over a long number of years by Sealink &mdash; in the normal commercial sense they are entitled to attempt to frustrate a commercial opponent &mdash; but on the other side of the coin, on this side of the Irish sea, Sealink are treated quite well.  If B &amp; I are being treated unfairly by Sealink, as the port authority in Holyhead, then I do not see why the Minister should allow CIE to put all their business in the way of Sealink.  The Minister should ask CIE to look at the situation again, to see if they can be encouraged to give some of their business to B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>Access transport is crucial to doubling tourism by 1992.  The tourist with his car travels around the country and is most valuable to hotels and guesthouses.  The B &amp; I have a vital role to play there.  I would like the Minister to give consideration to how passengers with cars are treated when they arrive in Dublin. Something like 16 per cent of car owners coming back by B &amp; I and Sealink ferries carry petrol, and why not, having regard to the cost of petrol here.  The Minister should consider giving ports, particularly Dublin port, a facility to sell duty free petrol to cars coming off B &amp; I ferries, and perhaps they could do the same at Dún Laoghaire.  The Minister should talk to Aer Rianta about that as they have been good at bartering services for fuel with Aeroflot and they know something about the fuel supply business and port control, albeit airport control.  Aer Rianta might be the right vehicle to supply duty free petrol at our ports to visitors to make the country attractive to visitors coming from Britain with cars.</P>
    <P>We now have capacity problems between Ireland and the Continent during the summer.  The Minister should <Col N="21" /> seek a joint venture between B &amp; I and a North Sea ferry company, to give a high class cruise service from Germany or the Benelux countries to Ireland.  He might also look at Scandinavia.  Why do we just look at the Irish Sea, at Le Havre or Cherbourg?  I do not criticise Irish Continental Lines for seeking to advance the best interests of their company's shareholders, but that is not the only option open to the Minister.  He should look at the possibility of a North Sea ferry company giving a high class ferry service in a joint venture with the B &amp; I.  Not only would that give B &amp; I a new lease of life but it would give the tourism industry access to a market which it has not had heretofore.  Already there are enormously successful sea ferry operations from Germany, the Benelux countries and Scandinavia.  They probably have the leading sea ferry companies in the world. The options the Minister is looking at should not lead him to automatically consider selling off B &amp; I, because there are other options.</P>
    <P>There are strategic and economically important reasons we as an island economy should ensure that there are at least two carriers on the Irish Sea with no question of anyone being able to take over B &amp; I as a lame duck which will be closed down leaving no competition on the Irish Sea.  Leaving aside those reasons, B &amp; I has been turned around and can be developed into a successful company, and a strategically important company, for developing tourism from Germany, the Benelux countries and Scandinavia through a joint venture if B &amp; I do not have the capital base.  Will the Minister consider that option?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have no principled objection to selling State assets and we will examine such proposals on an individual basis.  In view of the strategic importance of B &amp; I, if there is any intention to sell the company I would ask the Minister to make sure that it will not be done before he comes back to get the consent of the House.  I will address that question again on Committee Stage.  So far as this Bill sets out to strengthen the balance sheet of B &amp; I and to improve their operation, <Col N="22" /> I will support it although I will attempt to amend and improve it as it goes through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the further investment of £6 million in B &amp; I whose performance over the last two years fully justifies that investment.  There has been a major turn around in that company from substantial losses to modest profits. The foundation stone of that success was laid in the three year plan on productivity in 1987 coupled with the pay agreement of July 1989.  There has been a major contribution by the workforce who were prepared to work to get the company into a profitable position.  In addition to their contribution a major improvement in industrial relations augurs well for the future of the company.</P>
      <P>Currently B &amp; I are taking 43 per cent of all Irish exports.  That indicates the tremendous confidence of Irish exporters in this shipping line.  With the continuing expansion in industrial and agricultural exports and the projected expansion in tourism along with the Channel Tunnel, there will be greater opportunities for the expansion of the B &amp; I services.  The Channel Tunnel, because of its historic innovation bringing car traffic to Great Britain, must benefit Ireland, which is the last bastion of isolation on the west of the Continent, with a new influx of people driving cars willing and anxious to travel to Ireland.  This would put pressure on shipping services between Britain and Ireland.  I hope the Minister, the Department and B &amp; I are conscious of the projected new demand which can be of such value to our economy.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not contemplate selling off B &amp; I.  Unlike Deputy Mitchell's party, my party have a principled position in relation to State and semi-State bodies, believing that the best development of our economy can be derived from a combination of private and semi-State bodies.  In this case, there is no fear of a sell off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that B &amp; I found it necessary to discontinue the ferry services to Cork causing substantial damage to the commercial and tourism interests <Col N="23" /> and earnings in that area.  Because of the interest both commercial and tourism organisations are demonstrating in the B &amp; I and the opportunity for major expansions which will arise in tourism from Britain and the Continent from the development of the Channel Tunnel I want to impress on the Minister the need for the review body to contemplate an expansion of the existing services of B &amp; I, which could include a return of the Cork service.  The Minister is well aware that there is no rush by private enterprise to take up the vacuum left by the withdrawal of B &amp; I from the Cork service.</P>
    <P>Over the years the voluntary energetic Cork-Swansea committee have tried with all the resources at their command to provide a shipping service to replace the service provided by B &amp; I.  As the Minister again knows a reduced service which will operate for only five or six months of the year can only be assured by way of substantial guarantees from the State &mdash; perhaps a grant of £500,000 and a loan of £500,000 &mdash; and the three local authorities involved.  This demonstrates the competitive nature of shipping services at present.  The main responsibility for this company must remain with the State. B &amp; I have the expertise and capacity to expand substantially to meet the requirements which I believe exist for an expansion of their services both within the existing ports at Dublin and Rosslare and a restoration of the service which made such a contribution to the economy of the south-west.</P>
    <P>In addition to the commercial element, tourism has a major part to play in the continued growth of this company.  I believe that tourists who have travelled by car to Ireland have had a major impact on traditional tourism earnings but, as Deputy Mitchell pointed out, our high petrol costs have acted as a disincentive to British and continental car owners who may otherwise have come here.  Having regard to the aspiration for a doubling of tourism and the capacity of B &amp; I to meet this increase I urge the Minister to provide some new incentive, perhaps by <Col N="24" /> way of a petrol voucher, to continental and British car owners to travel to Ireland.  This would increase returns to the Exchequer by increased sales while at the same time give a substantial boost to our tourism economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it is time to carry out a review of the company in view of the increasing importance with which the Government view our access transport services, having regard both to our trade and tourism needs and the development of the Single European Market.  I am sure the board and workers of B &amp; I are conscious of the challenging times ahead with increased competition from air transport and other shipping services. Because of the isolated position of Ireland, the volume of tourists who want to come here, the development of the Irish export business, the growth in industrial exports and the continuing high level of agricultural exports there is a bright future for this country.  As I have said, B &amp; I have the tradition, the expertise and the capacity to meet any additional tourism requirements.  I hope that in the future we will not have to consider what other service may have to be brought in as a substitute for this company.  Irish Shipping has gone under the waves and we must ensure that B &amp; I, as an Irish owned and Irish controlled company, continue to provide an efficient and excellent service and remain as a permanent feature of this country.  This company have served us well.  They have had their difficulties but they have now left those behind them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional money being provided to the B &amp; I.  I hope this company will be regarded as a permanent feature of the semi-State companies who are developing the Irish economy.  I believe they will get the best returns for our economy through their tradition, experience and expertise.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of my colleagues, my contribution will be brief. I am proud to have been prominently associated with the 1986-87 negotiations which led to the rescue plan for the <Col N="25" /> B &amp; I.  This plan was subsequently approved by the Government and forms the background to this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is important to put this Bill in the proper context in regard to the 1987 agreement.  The Minister has been fair in doing this in his review.  One might get the impression from some of the media coverage that this was a case of the B &amp; I again coming with the begging bowl to the Exchequer because of financial and trading difficulties, etc., but the contrary is the case.  Since the 1987 plan was put in place, as the Minister acknowledged in his contribution, the company have gone from strength to strength and have exceeded projections in all areas.  This is not to say that the company are not operating in a difficult competitive environment but we must put this in a positive frame rather than make any reference to a troubled semi-State company with a difficult industrial relations record or whatever.</P>
      <P>The 1987 plan which forms the background to this Bill was exceptionally painful for everybody concerned.  That agreement was unique in the history of Irish industrial relations because not only did it involve the second bite by way of a major redundancy programme in which almost 600 people lost their jobs but it also guaranteed industrial peace in the company for the duration of the plan.  In addition to all that &mdash; and there are many other elements of the agreement &mdash; there was a pay standstill for a period of three years operating from the date of the air fares deregulation which was in July 1986.  Then, unprecedentedly, the remaining employees accepted a 5 per cent pay reduction.</P>
      <P>One would have to know a little bit about the history and background of this company to appreciate how painful that was for the workforce.  There is no need to dredge over the history and background in this debate this morning because, happily, we are facing a much brighter future and the measures, although they were very unpalatable to many people at that time, have proved to be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to refer to the remarks <Col N="26" /> of my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, about outrageous trade union practices having contributed to the historical problems of the company.  In fact, up to the time of the air fares deregulation &mdash; immediately prior to and after that period &mdash; there was a very difficult period in the industrial life of this company.  In fact, one of the striking features of this company since it was taken into public ownership in 1965 was the extraordinary level of industrial peace enjoyed in the company.  Some nine industrial days were lost during that period.</P>
    <P>The problems in the B &amp; I that led to the plan of 1987 were due to factors, I would submit, other than fractures of industrial peace, and they are detailed at some length in the most recent edition of the third report from the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  That report took time out to go in some detail in to the background of the problems that led us into the situation we found ourselves in the mid-eighties. Very briefly and superficially I will put on the record what that committee said when summarising the factors that led to this overall state of decline.  They said it was over-expansion in the late seventies resulting in increased financial charges and over staffing; substantial fuel price increases from 1979 onwards which particularly affected operators on long cross-Channel sea routes; the general economic recession in the 1979-84 period; depressed market conditions up to 1985 and intensive competition and price cutting; service disruption because of industrial disputes mainly in the United Kingdom in the late seventies and early eighties; the introduction of air fares deregulation in 1986; substantial provisions for losses associated with extraordinary items and high finance charges associated with a high debt equity structure.</P>
    <P>I submit that that assessment and analysis still stands good and in so far as industrial peace or industrial relations problems are concerned, they relate to difficulties in the United Kingdom.  That is not to say that there was not a problem in terms of some operational practices in <Col N="27" /> the B &amp; I on the side of the trade unions, or that there were not some difficulties in terms of over-staffing which is touched on in this report; I respectfully suggest that the problems of over-staffing and so on were endemic to that era and had as much to do with the political culture obtaining in this country as it had with industrial relations.  I do not want to go over it or make any provocative remarks here, but politicans were engaged in securing employment in many of the leading State companies when probably there was not productive work to be done, and I do not think there is any point, in retrospect, in blaming the workforce for that.  That situation, however, has changed beyond recognition and the B &amp; I management would concede that a very slimmed back workforce have been performing exceptionally well with no regard to old demarcation disputes or who does what in this company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the background to the Bill the Minister is introducing this morning.  It is very important, because it may be thought that because people in the media have short memories if they start again to write stories about the B &amp; I looking to the Government for £6 million injection of equity, that implies that there are some new difficulties in the company. That is not so.  This is part of a plan that was negotiated in 1987 which envisaged a capital requirement of £35 million, if my memory serves me correctly, and the senior management and the board of B &amp; I argued at that time for an injection of capital of that order for a number of reasons, one being to avoid this situation <Col N="28" /> where year after year we are discussing this in this House as if it were a matter of great moment or as if it were another crisis.  That would have been avoided if we had taken that suggestion on board at that time.  The second reason is that the senior management of the B &amp; I recognised that, because of the debt equity ratio and this extraordinary burden of debt and interest repayments, we would have this situation for some years immediately following on the 1987 plan. In other words, no matter how well the company traded it was not possible to trade out because of the accumulated deficit and the very heavy schedule of loan repayments required to fund that accumulated deficit.</P>
      <P>Everybody in the company acknowledged that that would be the case, and the Minister referred to that this morning when he said: &ldquo;I would emphasise in that regard that were it not for the burden of interest charges on historic debts arising from losses accumulated by B &amp; I prior to 1988 the company would at this stage be recording net profits&rdquo;.  That is a fair comment and, in a nutshell, represents the present position.  We can go back over that if there is a desire to do so, but I think the reason the accumulated deficit of the order that was on the bottom line of the balance sheet was allowed to develop is history.  The fact is that it did develop and the costs of financing it were so crippling that at that time the company recognised there was a need to deal with it in the manner I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government did not take that approach.  At that time they required the management and the unions to agree a plan that would have the support of everybody in the company and, rather than making a major once off injection of equity at that stage, they decided to adopt a phased approach.  B &amp; I Line anticipated that £17 million would be required by the company during the first two years of the plan as well as a further £7 million in the current year.  Instead of £17 million &mdash; this should be put on the record because people get these things out of perspective&mdash;£11 million has been needed to date by the company and £11 <Col N="29" /> million has been the amount that has been invested because of the company's performance during 1988 and 1989 that being substantially ahead of all the targets set and, therefore, the company have revised their requirement of £7 million down to £6 million which is being provided in the present plan.</P>
    <P>The trading performance of the company has been consistently advised, I understand, to the Minister's Department, and if I were to be critical of the Minister it would relate to the best of my knowledge, the Minister will be able to inform me otherwise if I am wrong, to the fact that there have been very few, if any, direct discussions between the Minsiter and the B &amp; I board about the kind of thing one is reading in newspapers now.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday the Minister's colleague or, should I say, former colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, in the course of a broad ranging interview confirmed reports that had previously appeared in the same newspaper but which the Government apparently know nothing about, that is, that a large number of State companies are due to be privatised in whole or in part, made some extraordinary references to B &amp; I.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The Minister also expressed his disappointment about the need for the Government to make provision to inject a further £6 million into the B &amp; I group.  It was &ldquo;very unsatisfactory&rdquo; and a matter he had &ldquo;great misgivings about&rdquo;.  He added that he &ldquo;would love to see the end of it as a problem&rdquo;, with the ideal being that Irish Continental would take it over. But &ldquo;they have not displayed a strong interest&rdquo;, up to now. </P>
    <P>This is the real Taoiseach speaking again and I would like to hear the Minister refer to this.  Does this mean there is resistance in Cabinet to the provision of the money that is envisaged in this Bill or is it ignorance on the part of the Minister of the context in which the Bill is being brought forward?  I can hardly anticipate.  This is a Minister who wears <Col N="30" /> a halo when it comes to knowledge.  I cannot reasonably anticipate that it is lack of knowledge on his part that this is part of a plan and of a commitment entered into by the Government with the B &amp; I company, so he must know the context in which he is speaking.</P>
    <P>To make remarks as Minister for Industry and Commerce to the effect that he would love to see the end of the problem, he has deep misgivings and so on and holding out the spectre of privatisation is surprising, to put it mildly.  Then one reads instalment 2 in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning where there is a prominent front page story which effectively tells us that this £6 million injection is only to prepare the company, British style, for privatisation. According to <i>The Irish Times,</i> discussions have been under way secretly. I quote:</P>
    <P>Secret merger proposals between the State-owned B &amp; I Line and the privately-owned Irish Continental Group have been set aside while the latter seeks clarification from the Government of its plan to inject a further £6 million into the loss-making B &amp; I. </P>
    <P>I do not know about my colleagues, but I knew nothing about this development. I would like to ask the Minister if the board of B &amp; I knew about this development, if the board of B &amp; I have been consulted, if the management have been consulted.  I know, because I checked this morning, that the unions have not been consulted and, according to this, the managing director of Irish Continental said he had presented a proposal to the Government as long ago as the summer of 1989.  I find it surprising, to use the mildest word I can think of, that this should be so.  The board of B &amp; I have worker-directors and so on.  To the best of my knowledge the board have not been consulted about this prospect.  It is incumbent on the Minister to address this matter when he is replying.  It would appear that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his party are dictating the privatisation of a good number of our commercial State companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> Incidentally, I should remind the House that one does not often remember what politicians say at party conferences and so on, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce in his capacity as Leader of the Progressive Democrats a couple of years ago went out of his way at his annual conference to commend as an example to the rest of industry the agreement concluded in the B &amp; I, to refer to it as a unique plan and to commend the response of the trade unions at that time. I have not had the opportunity or time to look it up, but I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce is on record to that effect.  I remember it quite clearly because one does not often get praise from that quarter.  Now it would appear the Minister has made up his mind that this company should be effectively privatised.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks made by Deputy Moynihan and more ambiguously by Deputy Mitchell.  I do not think it is in the strategic interest of this country that B &amp; I should be privatised.  I do not know what the response of the B &amp; I management might be if they were consulted. They may consider that it could be a great opportunity to get this stran-glehold of historic debt from around their necks, but I know the response of the trade unions in B &amp; I.  As a result of the sacrifices they made a few short years ago they expected that this would be the end of the threat to the B &amp; I in this manner.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks made by Deputy Moynihan concerning the principled position as to whether the company should be privatised.  In terms of the strategic contribution which the B &amp; I make, having regard to the fact that we are an island nation and to what happened to Irish Shipping, I do not see how it is in the interests of this country that B &amp; I should be privatised.  The Minister should refer to that when replying.  In so far as the Minister referred to it he said:</P>
    <P>In order to determine the future capability of the B &amp; I to survive commercially and to develop without <Col N="32" /> the need for continued Exchequer support, I intend to carry out over the coming months a review of the company's prospects with a view to identifying the best options for their future development. </P>
    <P>The meaning of that sentence embraces what is presaged in <i>The Irish Times</i> today. The House is entitled to ask the Minister to be more explicit.  I do not see why the Minister should consider it is now timely to carry out a review of the B &amp; I as they were reviewed in most minute detail over the last few years.  They have also been reviewed in the new competitive environment, very specifically in relation to the impact of air fares deregulation for surface travel.</P>
    <P>One of the consultants, Mr. Alex Spain, whom the Minister might have brought in to carry out such a review was brought in almost full-time to have a &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; analysis and review of the company a few years ago.  The plan we are talking about is the result of that involvement; it had &mdash; and has &mdash; the full support of the trade unions and is being imaginatively implemented by the present leadership of the management team in B &amp; I.  I am not convinced that a review is now timely; I presume the Minister's words refer to the situation mentioned in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>My colleague will be dealing with tourism and other aspects of this and I do not want to go into that whole area.  I am very pleased that the company are performing ahead of their targets in all areas and that they have achieved very significant market shares in all areas of their operation. For example, they have 43 per cent of ro-ro freight, 32 per cent of tourism cars, 32 per cent of foot passengers and 21 per cent of European ro-ro freight.  I also understand that over the last trading years cars are up by some 30 per cent and freight by 40 per cent.  After a bleak, brief industrial period, when there were bad trade disputes, the B &amp; I have now recovered and are experiencing industrial calm.  The peace clause, which is virtually unprecedented has worked and secured the commitment of the unions and the <Col N="33" /> workforce to make it work.  It has made its contribution because the return of certainty to the company is critical.  A company like this cannot run the risk of having their schedules disrupted or threatened.  There was a brief period when that happened but, in the context of B &amp; I since 1965, it was a very brief period although it diminished the company's prospects and damaged business confidence in the company.  However, their performance over the last three years has shown that they have regained their former position of prestige in the marketplace.  They are performing ahead of target and are projected as being likely to continue to do so.  They would obviously be returning trading profits except for the burden of historic debt. The injection today is the minimum required in the present circumstances and my party will be supporting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I still feel some residual bitterness at the manner in which B &amp; I treated my city &mdash; Cork &mdash; when they pulled out of it and abandoned the whole south-west region, a major tourist area. They left us without a ferry link to Britain for the first time in over a century. However, even if this is not a rescue package it is still an investment of £6 million by the Government in B &amp; I.</P>
      <P>I congratulate B &amp; I on their climb back to recovery even though it was at a terrible cost to my city and to the workforce who were thrown on the unemployment heap.  The State has supported B &amp; I well, in sharp contrast with the way in which it supported ferry links out of Cork in the past.  I will deal with that briefly before I get back to the main thrust of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As Lord Mayor of Cork last year, I was a director of the Swansea-Cork car ferry.  Cork did not have a ferry link because the Government were reluctant to make any investment in the Swansea-Cork link.  The investment was finally made as a result of nudging, pushing and pressuring, but it was so late that the company found it impossible to charter a ship and they were without a link to Britain for a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> This year, in January, after much huffing and puffing and asking Irish Continental Ferries to come in, the Government eventually conceded to political pressure and gave a loan of £500,000 and a grant of £500,000.  I was in Nicaragua as a member of a parliamentary delegation but, in my absence, the Minister of State came into the House in a triumphalist way, lauded the Government's action and criticised Opposition Deputies very personally for their attitude to the Government because of their failure to deliver in relation to Cork.  I was at the centre of things as a director of Swansea-Cork and I saw the ineptitude of the Minister of State who had the political muscle of a political dwarf.  He did very little to deliver the goods for Cork last year in relation to a ferry.</P>
    <P>How does he expect Opposition Deputies to do anything other than criticise in relation to Cork and the whole south-west region and the tourism prospects there?  Thankfully, despite the indecisions this year, the Swansea-Cork ferry is operating and despite the delays, it is proving worth while.  On the morning the office opened there were queues outside the door.  This is a viable proposition and I am glad the local authorities in the south-west region have acted as a catalyst in putting up the financial guarantees and providing staff.  Now it is up to the tourism interests and the people of the south-west to support the ferry.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on the reference in the Minister's speech to the consultants' report by Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley on the development of the transport infrastructure.  As the only island nation, ferries are our lifeline and must not be looked at by the European Community as just ferry companies.  They are like bridges; they are a direct link to Britain and to the European mainland. We need a build-up of the infrastructure around our ports.  A case could and should be made to Europe that, ferries provide a social service for the people of this country who require access to Britain and Europe and should be looked upon as such.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> Reference was made in the media to the Stokes Kennedy Crowley report.  The Rosslare link to Dublin and the links along the east coast were mentioned. Whether it was by omission or a policy decision by the Minister, the south-west region was never mentioned.  No mention was made in press reports to the need for a build-up of the infrastructure around the Ringaskiddy ferry port and the need for the setting up of the downstream crossing to link the Dublin national route to Ringaskiddy.  I would ask the Minister, in reply to the Second Stage debate, to respond to these points.  Is Ringaskiddy included in the Stokes Kennedy Crowley report?  What views has the Minister in relation to this area?</P>
    <P>I welcome the investment of £6 million in B &amp; I.  That company are now coming out of their winter of discontent and trouble.  They are a national ferry line and I hope decisions made by the Minister will not jeopardise our autonomy and independence as regards access to Britain and Europe.  I would like the Minister to respond to some of the points I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start by thanking Deputies for their general welcome for the Bill and their comments on it.  They, like myself, want to see a bright future for the B &amp; I line and I am very pleased with the spirit with which they approached the matter this morning.  I will briefly take up some of the points raised and I do not propose to delay the House very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell had ideas in regard to Holyhead, northern European routes and Scandinavia.  I would welcome any ideas from the board of the company as to how they might wish to expand these routes.  Any such ideas will be very positively responded to by me.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell that competition on the Irish Sea is critical and very important. However we will have to keep that clearly in mind in our approach to the future of B &amp; I and the ferry services generally. The Deputy is right in his pragmatic view <Col N="36" /> of the future ownership of State companies, including this company.  That is a very practical approach rather than to lock yourself into a particular philosophy irrespective of the market trends of the time.  That is a sensible approach and I have no difficulty with it.</P>
    <P>I want to reject a comment the Deputy made either in his address to the Bill this morning or in the newspaper &mdash; I am not sure when he said it &mdash; that this injection of £6 million is &ldquo;preparing the company for sale&rdquo;.  You cannot have it both ways, as the Deputy often tries to do on the floor of the House.  If we did not invest the £6 million the Deputy would be on his feet this morning decrying the Government for their lack of investment and their failure to support the investment plan.  He would ask what I am going to do about the jobs in the company and the cashflow and if I am not aware that the banks are concerned.  He would have a long list of questions for me.</P>

      <P>Otherwise, I very much welcome the Deputy's support.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moynihan pointed out that he is opposed to a disposal of the company on principle.  I understand that is a principle of his party and I respect his philosophy in that regard.  He also talked about the Cork-Swansea ferry and I will deal with that when I am talking about Deputy Allen's comments.  I know of the Deputy's interest in tourism.  Many times he has been very helpful in this House with positive suggestions.  This morning he suggested petrol vouchers but he will appreciate that I will not respond to that off the top of my head.  It is an old idea and one that has run into many practical problems, but I appreciate the Deputy's determination to help us build tourism targets.  I can tell the Deputy we are meeting a very demanding target of doubling the number of tourists in the four year period between 1987 and 1991, and we are heading into the most difficult half of that period.  It will not be as easy to meet our tourism targets this year as it was last year.  The first two years are behind us and we have met the targets but we are getting into compound figures now and the going is getting very tough. It will take a massive effort by all of us, supported by Members of this House, to make sure we can meet those targets.  If Irish tourism does well, south-west tourism does well also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about my consultation with the board of B &amp; I.  I had a formal meeting with the board and management about six or eight weeks ago at which we had a general discussion about the future of the company.  I got a briefing from them as to where they stood and I told them the Government's views on the company generally.  I explained that I had on my desk an unsolicited expression of interest from a particular privately-owned ferry company.  In <Col N="38" /> response to a request from B &amp; I&mdash;a response I had no difficulty in giving because it was my intention to do so anyway &mdash; I left that expression of interest aside and asked B &amp; I, before the end of this month if that deadline suits them, to let me have their thoughts as to where they will go from here.</P>
    <P>I do not agree one should not continue to review the company.  I want to make one point strongly in the hope that I will not be misrepresented in any way.  The Deputy was right when he said there was a £35 million proposal from the company at the time of their major difficulties at the start of 1987.  It was estimated that it would take £35 million investment over a five year period to put the company back on their feet.  I want to make it clear that the Government did not, either at that time or now, give a commitment to invest £35 million over a five year period, but they gave a commitment to support the company and look at their performance on a year-to-year basis in the context of the plan and to see how they performed against the targets set as the year went on.</P>
    <P>It would not have been sensible for the Government at that time to commit £35 million over a five year period, irrespective of the company's results and their ability to meet their targets.  The fact that we are going ahead with the investment of £6 million is an indication of our approval of the company meeting their targets.  We salute their performance during the very difficult time they have had.  Our proposal to seek approval from the Dáil for this funding is a measure of our approval of the fact that the company have turned their position around. However, I want to make it clear again that the Government commitment is on a year-to-year basis and there is no commitment to invest £35 million over a five year period.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to comment, Deputy, on the remarks of my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the newspaper&mdash; which I have only been able to glance at superficially &mdash; other than to say, as it is clear from the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, that this is a <Col N="39" /> Government decision for which I am seeking Dáil approval.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and I are fully supportive of that decision.</P>

      <P>That is the position. I am looking at the best options for the future of the company.  It would be irresponsible of me not to do that.  Those options do not rule out the company no longer being a State company, from investment from outside, or being retained fully in State ownership.  I have an open mind about that.  I am listening very carefully to what the company say and I want the very best for the company and for the country.  I want to remind Deputies that we have had long debates on taxation and Deputies are to the forefront in seeking tax reform.  However, if we look back on the ten year period, 1980-90, taxpayers have invested £70 million in this company.  I am not sure how much this figure represents in the £ of income tax.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is right on this point, that the trade union movement and management in B &amp; I have shown great guts and great courage. I want to say that openly.  The employment level has been cut from 1,400 to 800.  The workforce took a 5 per cent pay cut, and a wages standstill for some time. They also disposed of some quite valuable property which perhaps they would have preferred to hold on to.  The workforce have had a very painful time and this is reflected in the Government's proposal to put additional funds into the company, because we wished to respond to the very generous sacrifice that has been made.</P>
      <P>I must also pay tribute to the management, to Mr. Alex Spain and to the managing director, Mr. Jim Kennedy, who have strongly led the company through very difficult times.  They have been extremely courageous and they have led the company to a position where they are improving by leaps and bounds. This is not a rescue plan but part of the ongoing funding of the company.  Having invested £70 million in the past ten years and a further £6 million, ongoing funding has to cease at some stage and it is our objective to get B &amp; I to the position where they will no longer require taxpayers' funds to be approved by the Dáil on a regular basis.  It would be irresponsible of me to rule out any future options for the company.  If we want to achieve that objective, we should not rule out any proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reply to the points Deputy Allen raised.  The Deputy is being a little ungracious in his remarks about the Cork-Swansea ferry service.  We are not looking for plaudits in that regard.  I want to tell the Deputy something which he may not have said to <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> With respect, the Deputy has said everything else to <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> Perhaps the Deputy will let them know that there has been no political pressure to reopen the Cork-Swansea ferry service.  In fact, I engaged consultants &mdash; and I will let the Deputy have a summary of their findings if he wishes &mdash; who advised me <Col N="41" /> against it.  I talked to another ferry company and suggested to them that there might be loans and grants of up to £1 million available to them if they were to manage the service commercially, but they told me they could not do that for that kind of money.  I had two indicators that suggested I should not go ahead on commercial grounds, but I decided to go ahead with this for one major reason, namely, I have a feeling that the people of Cork and the south-west are determined to make it work on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that the alternative to not delaying on the matter was not to go ahead with the service at all.  I know the Deputy would prefer that I would be a few weeks late rather than not do it at all.  I was faced with very strong evidence that it would not work, but I am saying this morning and I share the Deputy's view, that I have faith in the business and the tourist interests of the south-west, and leaving aside consultants' reports and the views of other ferry companies, I feel, from the level of investment, this will work. However, I call on the people of the <Col N="42" /> south-west to support the ferry service and make it work, because at the end of the day the future of the service will not be guaranteed by State funding but by the support they get from the people of the south-west.  I would like that message to go out very clearly, if there is support for the service the ferry service will continue but if there is not it will not continue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the regional study, the SKC study is a national study and will take into account all regions of the country.  I thank the Deputies for their very positive contributions this morning and I join with them in thanking the board of B &amp; I and the workforce of B &amp; I for having the courage to go through this very difficult time.  I invite all sides of the House to keep an open mind on what we can do to ensure their future is secure in a very competitive business.  Let us keep an open mind on how we can do that and not be steamrolled by newspaper comments or consultancy comments.  Let us keep a steady head and talk to the board and the workforce and together work out the best direction for the future of B &amp; I.  It is strategically important to us and it is important that we develop the company in the years ahead.</P>

    <Title>B &amp; I Line Bill, 1990: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Subsection (1) shall only have effect provided that the Company will not be sold, or otherwise disposed of, without the prior consent of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes the insertion of a new subsection in the Bill.  In my Second Stage contribution I highlighted the strategic importance of this State <Col N="43" /> asset.  I also pointed out that Fine Gael have no objections in principle to the sale of State assets and will judge each proposed transaction on its merits. Because of the strategic importance of this company to this island economy no attempt should be made to dispose of it without the prior consent of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte said that my contribution appeared to be somewhat more ambiguous than that of Deputy Moynihan. It was not in the slightest bit ambiguous.  I spelled out clearly the approach of Fine Gael which is that we have no objections in principle to the sale of State assets or the privatisation of State companies and that we shall judge each transaction on its merits.  What I am trying to ensure with this amendment is that because of the strategic importance of this company it will not be disposed of without the prior consent of Dáil Éireann.  This is the perfectly logical and reasonable approach to take.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the fact that I referred to some outrageous trade union practices.  I also pointed out that these were not approved of by the main trade union movement and that it was only a fringe group who engaged in very poor practices but I wish to take this opportunity to say that I strongly support the attitude adopted by the current management and unions who have been successful in turning around the company and who have entered into a two year agreement.  I wish to put that on the record lest the comments I made are taken out of context.</P>
    <P>I have tabled this amendment not only because of the exceptional importance of this asset to an island economy but also because I am concerned about what happened in the case of Tara Mines where contractual arrangements were entered into on behalf of the Minister of the day and the company who purchased that State company for $50 million which prohibited the Minister making public the details of the agreement and which in the opinion of the Attorney General precluded the Minister in making known the <Col N="44" /> details of the agreement to Members of this House.  That is a very undesirable practice.  It is unacceptable that very valuable State assets can be sold off without anyone being held accountable to this House.  I ask the House if this is a desirable practice.  It is not and not only is it an undemocratic practice it is one fraught with dangers as far as the State is concerned. I do not want to make any allegations as to what could happen but Members can use their imaginations.</P>
    <P>I am not only referring to the possible sale of B &amp; I but to the sale of any State asset.  This must be seen to be done at arms length and above all someone must be held accountable to Parliament as required by the Constitution when such assets are disposed of.  Therefore I have two reasons for putting down this amendment. In relation to the disposal of any State company, be it through the offer of shares or some other form, some one should be held accountable to Parliament and contractual arrangements should not be entered into between the person buying the asset and the Minister which would leave open the possibility of the Minister being sued for breach of contract if he divulges to this House the details of that agreement.  This practice is totally unacceptable and fraught with danger and it must be eliminated in any future sale of any State asset such as Irish Life but specifically in the sale of this important company.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to support this amendment to ensure that the company will not be sold or disposed of without the prior consent of Dáil Éireann.  This point is self explanatory.  I made it in my contribution on Second Stage and I do so again now. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem in supporting this amendment as it is my belief and that of my party that no semi-State body or State service should be disposed of without the prior consent of this House.  This is relevant at this time when there is so much talk about the sale of State bodies to private enterprise.  This amendment would make sure that before <Col N="45" /> the assets of B &amp; I are disposed of the elected representatives in this House who were unanimous in giving a £6 million injection would have an opportunity to express their views on any such proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I too, have no problem in supporting the amendment.  I seriously object to the secrecy surrounding the Irish Life deal at present which I hope will not be repeated in the case of B &amp; I. As the Minister said, £70 million of taxpayer's money has been invested in this company.  Therefore, the proposal to privatise the company must be made known to this House.  In relation to Irish Steel, where the workforce and the public have been left in a limbo, discussions are going on with a number of parties behind closed doors.  This is reprehensible.  Any proposal to sell off State assets must be made public and made known to the Members of this House.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to what the Minister said in his reply on Second Stage as it is still very relevant.  If the press, and thank God we have a free press, were not able to highlight the views of public representatives and if the Dáil was not able to highlight the views of the public we would be in a very sorry state.  I would say quite firmly that it was only through public pressure that the Minister changed his mind.  What I tried to do was to contrast what is being done here today with the trauma being experienced in the Cork region.  The Minister should be courageous enough to acknowledge this.  At the outset of any negotiations between the Government and private enterprise the Government should make known to the Dáil the details of those discussions. We cannot sell off the family silver to balance the books and make the foreign debt more acceptable, we must get the full facts.  Therefore I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In many ways it is a sad reflection on everybody that we have reached the stage when an amendment like this is necessary.  In my view the amendment is needed because there is <Col N="46" /> concern on the part of many Members that some of our leading State companies may be privatised, in whole or in part, without the matter being debated in the House.  It is extraordinary that we should find it necessary to table an amendment to the effect that before privatisation takes place the matter should be debated in the House.  I presume that the Minister in the course of his reply will tell us that that is his intention should the need arise. I sincerely hope that the need will not arise and that any such move will be debated in the House.  It is unthinkable that a company whose shares are vested in the Minister for Finance &mdash; they are the property of the people &mdash; should propose major changes in their ownership structure without that move being approved by the House.</P>
      <P>My party will support the amendment. I welcome the opportunity to underline the strong opposition from this side of the House to the Minister proceeding down the privatisation road with the B &amp; I.  I do not wish to repeat the arguments advanced on Second Stage but in the strategic interests of the country as an island nation it would be wrong, in the interest of any minimalist impact on our debt repayments schedule internationally, to hive off the only State shipping line we have.  The Minister should put a brake on that before it goes that far.  Members referred to the investment by taxpayers in the company and there is little point in repeating the arguments put forward.  The investment has been made and the only positive thing we can see at this stage is that there is an optimistic forecast for the future of the B &amp; I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister told us that while scheduled repayments totalling £5.2 million will require to be met by the B &amp; I in 1990 it was worth mentioning that the company planned by 1995 to discharge almost all of their currently outstanding capital obligations. Since the company put their five year plan in operation they have exceeded their targets and there is no reason to believe that that will not continue to be the case. The new competitive environment in which they are operating has been in <Col N="47" /> place for some time and the company's position is improving.  I agree with the remarks by the Minister about the management of the company and the allegiance they have with the workforce. I should like to avail of this opportunity to plead with the Minister not to go down the road of the people, through the Parliament, ultimately losing control of the only State shipping company that is left in the arsenal of an island nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Mitchell's amendment.  The Minister told us, in response to the Second Stage speeches, that we should keep our heads steady in deciding the future of B &amp; I.  It is difficult to do that when one reads that secret negotiations are taking place between the Minister and the Irish Continental Group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to remain steady when one takes into consideration that £70 million of taxpayers money is involved.  It is essential, if the Minister decides to sell the B &amp; I to private enterprise, that the matter be discussed in the House.  The chairman of the company, in the course of the review of operations of the company in 1988, states <Col N="48" /> that B &amp; I continue to seek more equitable operating slots and charges at Holyhead from Sealink and I should like to ask the Minister to inform the House if the company have made any headway in that regard.  The practice seems to be very restrictive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who read the budget speech of the Minister for Finance are well prepared for what seems to be the inevitable, according to certain sections of the Government, particularly the Progressive Democrats wing, that we are heading down the road of privatisation of many of our State assets and companies. I find that difficult to understand if the Minister is genuine in his expressed concern for the company and the workers. Can we take it that there is a real battle taking place at Cabinet level?  If such a battle is taking place I wonder who is winning it.  The workers of B &amp; I need to be reassured about the negotiations that are taking place.  What battles are taking place at the Cabinet table?  Is the Progressive Democratic philosophy suffocating what has been the Fianna Fáil pragmatic approach to State companies? Are they winning out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> the Progressive Democrats wing of the Coalition, in the guise of Deputy O'Malley, is clearly intent on winning out.  Presumably what appears in that newspaper today is an indication of what is taking place at the Cabinet table.  It appears that the Progressive Democrats are putting pressure on Fianna Fáil to dispose of, as quickly as possible, State involvement in the B &amp; I.  The Minister told us of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made by all concerned to save B &amp; I.  We should not under estimate the efforts of the workforce in B &amp; I.  In a unique move in Irish industrial relations the workforce took a 5 per cent reduction in salary in order to save their company. It would be unprincipled and unforgivable if, in the light of that decision, the agreement to drop almost 500 jobs and the acceptance of a wage freeze as the workers' contribution to the survival <Col N="49" /> of the company, that the Government took a decision to privatise it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has accepted that following the publication of the five year programme to rebuild the company in 1988 there has been good industrial relations there.  I can guarantee the Minister that if, after we have agreed to grant the £6 million, it will be the Government's strategy to put in another £6 million to soften up the privatisation process and make the company a more plump and attractive proposition for competitors of B &amp; I&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy prefer if we did not give the company the £6 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be honest and say if the money is being invested in the company to make it a more plump proposition for competitors of the B &amp; I? The workers are aware of what has happened since the Coalition took office. They have read the contradictory statements by members of Fianna Fáil and their Coalition partners, the Progressive Democrats.  They are aware that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad has suggested that aircraft should fly over Shannon and land at Knock Airport and that that has been questioned by the Taoiseach. I am not surprised that the workers of B &amp; I are asking the Minister to outline the real purpose for the injection of £6 million.  The Workers' Party do not have any problem in supporting the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to highlight yet again the strategic importance for the State of having a shipping line.  I congratulate B &amp; I on their tremendous performance over the last couple of years in so far as they achieved operating profits in 1988 of £1.8 million and of £2.8 million in 1989. This gives the lie completely to the alarmist scare headlines which one regularly reads in the national media that everything in which the State is involved is a dead duck, is costly to the taxpayer and is not profit making.  If the five year development programme can be allowed continue, there would be a very valuable <Col N="50" /> asset in the hands of the State at the end of the process.  Lest we all ignore the fact that, although we are putting taxpayers' money into the company, through the taxation system, it is also true to say that the Government apply a tax to people leaving the country.  It would not be unreasonable to argue that all we are doing in the case of B &amp; I is transferring some of this huge sum of money back to a company that is in need of assistance.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the figures that are represented, where it is envisaged that B &amp; I will take 310,000 tourists and 70,000 cars in the coming year.  That fact alone, that level of business on the sea routes, is of tremendous importance and we should give it full recognition.  Not everybody wishes to fly, there is great competition among the airlines and there is also competition on the seas so we have got to be there with a vibrant company, such as B &amp; I are likely to become, if given full political support.</P>
    <P>I conclude by suggesting after today's events and particularly <i>The Irish Times</i> report of what Deputy O'Malley had to say that the morale of the workforce, which is a crucial element in the building of the company as a viable concern, will not be enhanced by the clear divisions which appear to exist in Fianna Fáil at Cabinet level.  We will be supporting the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the amendment Fine Gael have indicated that they have no stand in principle against privatisation as such.  This is a reasonable amendment because it is a safeguard not alone for B &amp; I but for any other State firm who might be under the threat of privatisation.  I am sure that other parties in the House would support that stand also because ultimately we are talking about taxpayers' money.  While there will be no hesitation in supporting the expenditure of £6 million there would be grave reservations in relation to any hiving off of this State asset to private interests, having regard to the sacrifice that workers and management have made over a number of years to get the company back into profitability.  It is <Col N="51" /> necessary and urgent that a brake be put on Government, regardless of who may be in power.  That safeguard should be there to ensure that workers' interests are protected by this House.  I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Recent events have proven that in the case of Irish Life and other semi-State companies the whole picture can change dramatically overnight.  We have had the saga of Irish Shipping in the past number of years which bears no credit to anyone in this House.  Unfortunately they are no longer there and I would hate to see a situation arise whereby B &amp; I would go the same road despite the sacrifices that have been made and despite the amount of money that has been put into the company. I would ask the Minister to look carefully at this.  This Coalition Government will not always be in power.  We should legislate to ensure that ultimately this House would decide on whether a semi-State company should be sold off to private interests.  We must not leave it to ministerial regulation.  Let us be honest about it, coming from the city of Cork as I do, I would have no great love for B &amp; I knowing that they have reneged on the city in its darkest hour.  Even though I admit the £6 million should be put into B &amp; I I would also like to say that taxpayers deserve an equal playing field when it comes to national shipping and semi-State bodies.  I will have no hesitation in supporting the amendment, whatever about the principle involved I think it is a reasonable one.  There will probably be other times when that principle will come to the fore.  Having read the papers this morning I have no doubt that that will be in the very near future. On behalf of the Labour Party I have no hesitation in supporting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak very briefly on this section of the Bill and the amendment thereto.  The move is welcome.  The state of the company has improved considerably from the crises of the last decade.  The Minister was correct in saying that what accounts largely for the net loss position is the historic debt. <Col N="52" /> I am disappointed that this Bill does not provide for some writing off of that debt because the psychological benefits of the company getting into a profit-making position should not be lightly discarded. When I was Minister for Transport I tried to persuade the Department of Finance to adopt a formula that would isolate the historic debt which would then be written off by the Exchequer over a number of years so as to give the operating company a balance sheet that was viable and to allow them achieve profitability with all the attendant benefits of that for the management and the workforce.  My only regret about the present Bill is that it does not go that far.  The Department of Transport and I were very much in favour of such a move at the time but the Department of Finance would not buy it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to fall into the trap of attacking the Department of Finance &mdash; they are often blamed incorrectly &mdash; but I feel that in respect of semi-State companies they have been frequently shortsighted in the provisions they make. Sometimes the provisions made are so restrictive as to be self-defeating, nonetheless, the measure proposed is a welcome one.  It is great to see such an improvement in the affairs of B &amp; I.  A loss of £1.5 million for last year after taking into account the servicing of the historic debt is a very big advance compared with the state of the company seven, eight or nine years ago.  After all the air competition that has been introduced it is a very significant achievement and the management and the workforce ought to be congratulated.  I suppose the Minister, as the incumbent of the day, also deserves to get a certain amount of credit.  I am sure he will modestly accept the accolade.  It is good to see such an improvement in the affairs of the company, I hope the next time we have a B &amp; I Bill before us it will be a proposal to make some arrangement for isolating the enormous debt.  Indeed, it is a proposal and a formula that might well be applied to one or two other semi-State companies which are being crucified by historic debt which, if it were lifted, could <Col N="53" /> transform the performance and outlook for those companies.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Transport I persuaded the Department of Finance and the Government, after a very tough battle, to devise a new form of financing for Córas Iompair Éireann and that has worked very well.  The level of subvention to that company has gradually declined over the past six or seven years having escalated for almost two decades before that.  The same new reflective thinking in relation to the financing of B &amp; I and perhaps Bord na Móna, is now called for to give the State sector a chance to prove itself because, in the new environment that now exists in the State sector, it has every chance of improving itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clear up something.  I may have inadvertently misled Deputy Rabbitte.  I did not actually meet the board of the company as I said earlier.  I did have a formal meeting with the Chairman, the Chief Executive and senior management on 14 December which was probably more practical at the time.  Just to make sure the record of the House is correct, I wanted to correct that impression.  As far as I was concerned, however, that was the correct level of consultation at that time.</P>
      <P>Obviously Deputy Mitchell has to make his own decisions, but I have to ask him to consider withdrawing his amendment. I cannot accept it for a number of reasons.  Unfortunately for the B &amp; I this debate is taking place against the background of a lot of privatisation talk in the papers about the Government's proposals in regard to Irish Life and other articles that have arisen out of that.  It is purely coincidental that I am here this morning looking for £6 million from Dáil Éireann to continue with the company's plan.</P>

      <P>We are not discussing the privatisation or the State ownership of B &amp; I.  What we are discussing this morning is whether the House wishes to take further State-owned shares in this company, and from what I hear my colleagues say this morning, that is what they wish to do.</P>
      <P>I have to oppose this amendment for technical reasons.  I want to differentiate technical reasons from the privatisation and ownership debate because I see them as entirely separate things.  First, I think the amendment is superfluous.  There is no question that if such a major step were taken it would require full consultation with and a contribution by Dáil Éireann at the correct time.  Second, the wording of Deputy Gay Mitchell's amendment starts with the word &ldquo;subsection&rdquo;; that should read &ldquo;section&rdquo;.  That is a small technical reason I am having difficulty with.  The third reason I have difficulty with it, is that the wording is &ldquo;shall only have effect providing that the company will not be sold&rdquo;, when in fact it is seeking to amend a section which deals with 106 million ordinary shares, replacing that phrase &ldquo;100 million ordinary shares&rdquo;.  For the Deputy's amendment to be effective he would have to alter that completely and talk about the disposal of shares in the company.</P>

      <P>I am telling the Deputy that regardless of the advice he has, this amendment is technically not a sensible one from the Government's point of view.  It may be in order, but it is not technically correct.  I have initial legal advice from the Attorney General's Office.  I want to stress that it is initial advice because I only got this amendment <Col N="56" /> about two hours ago.  I want to stress carefully that that advice is not definitive. It is received rather quickly because the amendment had to be dealt with in that way, but initial legal advice indicates that this amendment is ambiguous and technically defective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very simple thing with which the Bills Office, if they could speak here, would agree.  The Deputy has the word &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; in the first word in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not put that in; the Bills Office did that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Deputy should admit that they are wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be easy to change that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the first point out of the way.  That word is incorrect. The second point is that it says &ldquo;company&rdquo; and it should say &ldquo;shares&rdquo;. Obviously if I sold 51 per cent of it the Deputy would still object, and the words &ldquo;company&rdquo; and &ldquo;shares&rdquo; are not totally interchangeable in this regard.  The third point is that the Deputy should be aware of section 4 of the 1965 Act, and the 1971 Act says that the Minister for Finance may hold, for so long as he thinks fit, the shares of the company acquired by him under this Act and after consultation with the Minister may, as and when he thinks fit, sell or otherwise dispose of all or any of such shares.  The Deputy's amendment, should, of course, if he wishes to change that situation, amend section 4 of the 1965 Act.  It does not mention section 4 of the 1965 Act and in my opinion <Col N="57" /> does not meet his requirement.  It would perhaps need to amend the 1971 Act, and it does not do that either.</P>
      <P>Those reasons are enough, not to accept this amendment.  There is, however, a much more important reason I cannot accept it, and I address this to The Workers' Party representatives because it may frustrate what we have to do here today.  If one looks carefully at the wording of this amendment and the section it proposes to amend, one will see there is a tiny difficulty here because the amendment says that subsection (1), which should be section 1, shall only have effect provided something happens.  We want section 1 to have effect today.  If it is passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann we want section 1 to go into effect immediately so that the State can pay out £6 million to B &amp; I.  Again I am speaking very tentatively because I do not have the benefit of the full advice of the Attorney General in the short time available to me, but it seems that the timing difference in the wording of that amendment could make it difficult to implement section 1 of the Bill under the present wording of the amendment.  That could mean I would have difficulty arranging payment of the money.  I want to be very clear about this.  I am not a lawyer.  I have not had an opportunity to get the advice of the Attorney General and in the absence of that advice I could not accept an amendment that seems to have a major timing difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>It could be overcome by the Minister giving an undertaking to the House that it would not so happen without the prior approval of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five good technical reasons why I cannot accept this amendment.  The initial legal advice I received is that it is not clear whether the legislation would be necessary if that day were to come about.  Section 54 of the 1965 Act, which the Deputy does not seek to amend, says quite clearly that the Minister may &ldquo;sell or otherwise dispose of any or all such shares...&rdquo; It does not bring the Dáil into it at that point.  It is <Col N="58" /> not clear whether legislation is necessary but I want to put it formally on the record that I believe it would be most appropriate and very wise for this Minister or any Minister to fully consult and seek the advice of Dáil Éireann in regard to the future of B &amp; I.  If that day arrives &mdash; I have no intentions in that regard as of now; I am looking at all the options &mdash; I want to assure the House that it would be my intention to consult Dáil Éireann about the future of B &amp; I.</P>
      <P>I have to refuse the Deputy's amendment for technical reasons and not because of the content of it. I want to be very clear on the content of the amendment. As I have said before, I am ruling out no options.  The option we will proceed with will guarantee the future of the company, staff and management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the intention of the Minister to muddy the waters, and try to waffle his way through this amendment so that the House will somehow be embarrassed into not supporting it.  It means nothing to me whether the Minister thinks it would be most wise and appropriate for the Dáil to be consulted. That is also the view of Deputy Gay Mitchell, but if I happen to be the Minister of the day I do not know what view the Cabinet of the day will take.  I am asking that the view of the House be incorporated in legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so that the Minister will be required to come back here to get the approval of the House before the sale of this asset takes place.  In the early part of his contribution the Minister <Col N="59" /> said that such a major move would require him to come before the Dáil but there is no requirement in the legislation for him to come before the Dáil to approve the sale of this asset.  He did not come before the Dáil with Tara Mines, he has not come before the Dáil with Irish Life and he has no intention of coming before the Dáil with B &amp; I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would not be before the House if it was not in order.  If the Minister wants to bring the Attorney General's viewpoint before the House I propose that we postpone taking Report Stage until later this evening, if necessary, in order for him to put that opinion before the House and to allow the proper amendment to be put down if there is any difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should stop being smarmy and smart and should stop this general nonsense.  It is right that this House should be accounted to and be told about and have to approve of the sale of a State asset.  Not only was Tara Mines sold without the approval of this House but the Minister of the day entered into a contractual arrangement which prohibited anybody, including Dáil Éireann and any committee of Dáil Éireann, other than the Minister and the <Col N="60" /> person signing the contract from having knowledge of what went on in the signing of that contract.  That is undemocratic and runs counter to the Constitution which requires the Government to answer to this House.  That is what is being done.  I want to prevent this being done in this case and in general.  I want to prevent it being done because of the strategic importance of B &amp; I.  Because we are an island economy it is important to put down this marker in regard to this very important asset which operates on the Irish Sea.  I will be pressing my amendment.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the company as against the shares.  How dare the Minister give this House a lecture on company law.  I am not necessarily talking about the sale of shares.  I used the words &ldquo;or otherwise disposed of&rdquo; in my amendment because there are more ways of disposing of a company than selling its shares.  A company could be put on the shelf and its assets sold very easily.  Has the Minister ever heard of asset stripping?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The assets are owned by the shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that any attempt to dispose of this company should be brought before this House. With regard to the issue of time, the Minister said that this shall only come into effect provided the company will not be sold and that this &ldquo;could&rdquo; make it difficult.  He did not say that this &ldquo;will&rdquo; or &ldquo;would&rdquo; make it difficult.  It is very clear that the House is saying, let the Bill go ahead on the basis that if there is any attempt to privatise the company or dispose of its assets the Minister will have to get the prior consent of Dáil Éireann. The Minister has not laid any Attorney General's opinion before the House.  He used words such as &ldquo;could&rdquo;, &ldquo;should&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  My amendment, which was drawn up with the assistance of the Bills Office, is in order and I intend pressing it.  If it is the Minister's intention that the House should have the opportunity of <Col N="61" /> approving the sale of the asset I am prepared, on an undertaking by him to introduce an amendment on Report Stage, to postpone taking Report Stage until later this evening so that he can draft such an amendment.  The Minister has no intention of letting this House know that his real intention is to sell B &amp; I.  A bidder is already seeking to buy it, and when an offer is made he will sell B &amp; I in the same way the Government sold Tara Mines, and Irish Life and this House will not be accounted to.  It is very sad that a member of the Government who is constitutionally bound to answer to this House has that attitude.  I will be pressing my amendment.</P>

I am trying to give £6 million to B &amp; I and the Deputy is trying to pin me to an amendment which provides that I shall not give £6 million to B &amp; I today unless I give all sorts of chapters, verses and legislative assurances as to the future option of the company.  I want the company to hear what is being said and to read in the Official Report what is being said by Members on the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is saying that unless the Government tell him today that they will spell out their future ownership options for the company the Government cannot give them £6 million today.  The company require this money now and we should give them this money now.  If there is to be another day out on the options for B &amp; I we can discuss such options when we come back to the House at that time.  The Deputy must be clear on what he is saying in his amendment.  The Deputy is saying that we cannot give £6 million to B &amp; I today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is not appropriate to do that today because I have told the House I am <Col N="62" /> looking at all the options; I will discuss them with it, and it is my intention to consult with it under the existing legislation to which I am bound.</P>
      <P>The company need this money today. If the Deputy is not prepared to support section 1 unless his amendment is attached to it, then he is saying we cannot give them this £6 million until he knows the future ownership of the company. That is not fair to B &amp; I.</P>

      <P>I have to follow existing legislation and procedures.  Within those parameters it is my intention to consult Dáil Éireann where I am required to do so under the Constitution, under the 1965 Act and various other pieces of legislation.  If I am advised by the Attorney General that I am required to come to the Dáil at any time for any matter I will come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am here today because advice from the Attorney General's Office is that to <Col N="64" /> inject this extra money, we need legislation. If there are any developments in relation to the ownership of the company I will take the Attorney General's advice on it.  We are not talking today about that and negotiations on the future ownership of the company are not going on at this point.  I am talking to the company about their own future and I am listening carefully to them.  Neither I nor the Government intend to avoid consulting Dáil Éireann under the legislation as it is.  In fairness, if the Deputy wishes to change the situation we must amend the relevant legislation, which is section 4 of the British and Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>The timing difficulties involved here could make things difficult.  The Deputy is trying to get me to be definitive but I cannot because I have not had the benefit of full legal advice in the matter.

That is a clean single issue which I am putting to the Dáil and I am asking the Dáil to support that issue so that I can get on with the job and get the cheques to the company.  If we have to look at options in relation to the future ownership of the company, we can do that on another day.  It is unfair of the Deputy to hold up the £6 million pending on agreement as to the long term future of the company.  The company need the money now and I would like to give it to them now.</P>

      <P>The Minister is grossly misrepresenting the case when he says that I am unfair.  It is simple for this House to provide £6 million and to have a caveat added that in future any attempt to dispose of the company would require the approval of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the only opportunity I have to make the point.  If any Opposition Deputy rises on the Order of Business to ask a question about the sale of B &amp; I, when it is sold, we will be told by the Taoiseach that it is not on the agenda and that we should put down a question, and when we put down a question we will be lucky if it is reached, and even then we will be confined in the questions we may ask, because we will <Col N="66" /> be told this is not provided for in the legislation.  This is our only opportunity to amend the legislation.  Nods or winks or anything else do not get into the legislation. I am pressing this amendment and I would ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to accept it.</P>

      <P>I bhFómhar na bliana 1988, iarradh ar Údarás na Gaeltachta moltaí a dhéanamh maidir le ceist na teilifíse trí Ghaeilge agus fuarthas tuarascáil faoin ábhar sin i mí Meán Fhómhair seo caite. go bhfuair sé cóip den tuarascáil mar urlabhraí a pháirtí, gur tuarascáil <Col N="72" /> chuimsitheach atá i gceist agus, mar a dúirt mé mar fhreagra ar cheisteanna eile roimhe seo, ní mór í a scrúdú go mion. Tá sé sin á dhéanamh faoi láthair mar chuid den staidéar atá ar bun ag mo Roinnse, i gcomhairle leis an Roinn Cumarsáide, agus RTÉ, faoi cheist na teilifíse trí Ghaeilge i gcoitinne.

Luaitear sa tuarascáil freisin gur beag an t-ioncam neamhspleách a bheadh ag seirbhís dá leithéid (measadh £0.5 mhilliún sa bhliain ach an tseirbhís a bheith faoi lánseol).</P>

B'fhearr liomsa bheith ag caint faoi TNG nó sheirbhís teilifíse do phobal na Gaeilge sa tír go léir.  Níl athrú ar bith ann.

Ón taobh teicneolaíochta de, tá ceist MMDS ann, bhí ceist ann faoi sin inné, agus an RBL.  Táimidne i bhfábhar an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil don tír go léir, ní do 80 faoin gcéad de mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus 50 faoin gcéad de mhuintir na tíre, agus tá mé ag tabhairt an Tuaiscirt isteach san áireamh chomh maith.

      <P>The need for secondary liquidity ratios is kept under constant review in my Department. Following the most recent review, earlier this year, my Department concluded that <Col N="75" /> the reduction or elimination of the secondary liquidity ratios would not be appropriate at present.</P>
      <P>Given the current level of uncertainty in the financial markets it would not be prudent to reduce or eliminate the secondary liquidity ratios, which operate as a stabilising influence on the bond market.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to thank the Minister for his very definitive reply.  Is the Minister aware of the imbalances between bank resources and bank credit which are now emerging and which need to be rectified?  Is he aware that if these imbalances continue, a 1 per cent rise in interest rates caused by domestic factors is inevitable?  Is he further aware that there is a reference to this problem in the statement on monetary policy issued by the Central Bank on 28 February 1990?  One of the major options alluded to is a reduction in the secondary liquidity requirement of the banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what the Deputy says.  An argument has been made from time to time by the Central Bank and by others &mdash; one was made by the Central Bank as recently as last month &mdash; that the secondary ratios distort the market and that reducing or eliminating them would reduce the level of the Central Bank's support to the market and provide needed liquidity.  Moreover, some commentators would argue that the stock sold by the banks would be available to foreign buyers, thus helping the reserves.  At present the level of Government stock held by the banks is in excess of what they are required to hold.  Therefore the argument made by the Deputy does not hold water at this time.  I am <Col N="76" /> sure he is well aware of all the uncertainty that exists in international financial markets at present and it would not be prudent to do anything of the kind at this time.</P>

The Central Bank in their statement on monetary policy on 28 February said the licensed banks now have limited scope to divest themselves of Irish Government securities, which is the exact opposite of what the Minister is now saying.  There is also the fact that the financial institutions in Dublin, other than the banks, are now quite liquid, that they would be anxious to buy Government paper and that foreign investors, particularly German investors, would also buy Government paper.  We are the only EC country that has a secondary liquidity requirement in these specific terms.  It seems that if interest rates rise in the next two weeks it will be as a result of the Minister's inaction to put liquidity into the market and this is a method of doing so.

      <P>I will give the Deputy a few facts that he is apparently not aware of.  As I have said, given the uncertainties in the bond market at present and the large refinancing operation facing the Department in 1990 on the domestic market, involving £1,378 million, this is not the time to relax the secondary liquidity ratio requirements.  Developments at EC level over a number of years may require that but I can tell the Deputy without fear of contradiction that his timing on this question is totally wrong and imprudent.  As I have said, the matter is kept under review by the Department and we have no plans to change it at the moment.  While recognising that the stockbrokers and the financial markets make money in times of instability rather than of stability, I know they would say in the paper every day that we should take away the secondary liquidity because they would make a fortune on it but I am in a different business here.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the widespread dissatisfaction among general practitioners arising from the operation of the withholding tax on professional fees; to the fact that (a) rebates are not made promptly where there is no liability (b) deductions are made in respect of payments of nurses, secretarial and locum fees and (c) young doctors who have to undergo the initial expense of setting up in practice are particularly affected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of widespread dissatisfaction among general practitioners about the operation of the withholding tax on professional fees. I would point out that the withholding tax involves no more than the withholding, on account, of an amount of tax due.  Full credit for the amount withheld is given in computing the final tax liability. The scheme accordingly confers no additional tax liability on any individual or company and contains safeguards to ensure that no undue adverse effects arise from its operation.  Principal among such safeguards is the provision for the payment of an interim refund.</P>
      <P>In relation to rebates, I assume that the Deputy is, in fact, referring to payments of interim refunds.  The Revenue Commissioners have assured me that they make every effort to ensure that delays in the interim refund procedures are kept to a minimum.  Claims for interim refunds of withholding tax are given priority in tax districts.  The Commissioners say they are satisfied that, generally speaking, the procedures are working satisfactorily and that there are no delays in making repayments where the conditions necessary for the payment of an interim refund are satisfied.</P>
      <P>The withholding tax applies to the full amount, including payments for expenses, paid to a practitioner in respect of the rendering of medical services. Practitioners are, however, granted full allowance for valid expenses when computing their tax liability.  This fact, along with the operation of the interim refund procedures, should ensure that hardship does not arise from the application of the tax to expenses.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that young doctors are particularly adversely affected by the withholding tax.  This is because most doctors will already have practised for some time before entry into the GMS scheme.  The fact that they are already in the tax net will qualify them for the interim refund system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> If the Deputy is aware of any specific instances of doctors, young or otherwise, suffering particular hardship as a result of the operation of the withholding tax, I would be glad to have such cases investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am surprised at the Minister's lack of awareness, he must be operating from a very deep bunker indeed.  The doctors and their representatives who have communicated with me have communicated the same information directly to the Minister.  The fact of the matter is &mdash; and I would ask the Minister if it has been brought to his attention even at his clinics &mdash; that the system of interim rebates is not operating effectively and there are long delays which are affecting the cash flow of doctors who may be deprived of funds even in circumstances when they have no tax liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a significant number of representations made on the issue in the first year of the operation of this tax and I would accept that the cash flow position of some doctors would have been adversely affected.  The system has settled down and this is indicated by the fact that the volume of representation to my Department has been greatly reduced.  In addition, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners have had meetings from time to time to discuss the withholding tax with representatives of the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also emphasise that the doctor in question will get full credit for his expenses when his normal tax liability is being assessed.  In addition, the doctor is generally entitled to an interim refund once the amount withheld in the current period exceeds his tax liability for the previous period.  The liability includes full allowance for valid expenses so, providing his tax affairs are otherwise in order, the doctor can limit the net amount withheld in the current period to his liability for the previous period.  There may well be cases &mdash; I am aware of one such case &mdash; where, for different reasons, such as if a doctor has most of his business <Col N="81" /> in the GMS scheme, the withholding tax can hit harder than it would hit a doctor who has a better balance in his practice. In general terms what we are saying is that the withholding tax is working much better than it was.  It has been in operation for a couple of years so the cash flow problems should not be as critical as they were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am glad the Minister is coming around to seeing some of the problems.  This system affects those in the GMS scheme, in effect it affects most those who are providing medical attention for the poor.  Finally, does the Minister not consider it totally unjustified and penal that cheques for expenses which the doctors in turn pay to nurses, secretaries or locums have 32 per cent deducted from them while the doctor has had to pay full employee and employer PRSI and deduct income tax as well?  Is that not totally penal and unjustified and will the Minister change that aspect of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is as aware as I am that withholding tax is very clear in what it applies to and it applies to some of the areas the Deputy has already mentioned.  In 1988 and 1989 the gross amount of the withholding tax paid by all taxapayers was £57.93 million and £63.2 million respectively.  This will give Members an idea of how effective the tax is.  There is no evidence to suggest to me that there is anything of the kind the Deputy is talking about or that there is need for further adjustment.  Many doctors have told me &mdash; I am not familiar with the exact details of every doctor's practice &mdash; that although they opposed it, it is a big help to them because their tax is being paid as they go along and they are not stuck with having to pay a big lump sum at the end of a period. There may be different views but there is no widespread area I know of that calls for adjustment.  If the Deputy has any specific case he wants me to look into in relation to hardship, I will certainly do so.  In answer to a question from Deputy Farrelly on 27 February I said the first <Col N="82" /> claim in the tax year can take longer than the seven days which it normally takes to process the tax return because it is necessary to verify the tax position for the previous year.  It currently takes up to four weeks to verify these initial claims in country districts and it could take up to two months in Dublin, but, as I have said, that is for the first return in the tax year.  After that it is reasonably plain sailing.  If they are over the amount the rebate procedure is triggered off.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to the statement made by me on 12 March 1990 which outlines the Government's intentions in relation to Irish Life.  The statement makes it clear that the changes being proposed are to enable the company to develop as a major Irish-based international financial institution.</P>
      <P>The Government considered all relevant options in relation to the company before a decision was made and, in particular, the comprehensive reports of the consultants employed to examine the restructuring of Irish Life and the options available to Government after restructuring. The consultants were firmly of the view that the State's shareholding should be substantially reduced in the interests of the development of the company.</P>
      <P>Deputies will understand that the reports of the consultants contain sensitive commercial data and it would not be advisable to publish the reports.  The House will, however, have a full opportunity to discuss the proposed restructuring when the necessary legislation is put before it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific queries raised by Deputy Rabbitte the position is as follows.</P>
      <P>The consultants were jointly led by National City Brokers and Goldman Sachs (UK) and included Arthur Andersen, accountants, A &amp; L Goodbody, solicitors, and Slaughter and May, UK solicitors.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept what the Deputy is saying.  Everything is out in the open.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that before one attempts to float any company on the market they would not be foolish enough to publish a sensitive and confidential financial report, especially when one considers the effect this could have on the market when one gets around to flotation.  We are a long way from this.  Legislation has first to be passed in this House and the matter has to go to the courts in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  There is no question of secrecy and I totally reject that assertion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what appears to be an <Col N="85" /> innuendo &mdash; that may be incorrect but that is what I take it to be &mdash; I would like to inform the Deputy that the consultants were appointed on foot of a public tender in accordance with normal procedure.  A total of 36 firms were invited to submit tenders.  Sixteen replied of which six were examined in detail and three were short-listed. This is the one that was accepted which includes all the different firms I have referred to.</P>

I also met the union concerned and had a very constructive and lengthy meeting with them on the future of Irish Life.  I asked them to outline what their priorities were in relation to the restructuring of Irish Life and they replied that their first priority was jobs. I could reassure them &mdash; and I wish to reiterate the assurance given to me by Irish Life &mdash; that this will lead to a fortification of jobs, will open the way for an increase in business and an expansion of the company and, consequently to more jobs in the future.

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 52 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The national lottery was set up under the National Lottery Act, 1986, and the licence to operate the lottery was granted to An Post National Lottery Company. Rehab Lotteries Limited is a non-profit making private limited company, specialising in the promotion of lottery games, which it operates on behalf of a number of charities which hold licences granted by the District Court under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  The legal status of the two organisations is therefore different.</P>
      <P>The following are the principal differences between the national lottery and lotteries operated under licence from the District Court.</P>
      <P>The prizes paid out by the national lottery are specified in the relevant rules and prize details for each game which are subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance.  Charitable lotteries are limited to a weekly prize payout of £10,000.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of its licence, the national lottery's operating expenses are limited to 19.75 per cent of its turnover; charitable lotteries may charge up to 40 per cent of turnover to expenses.</P>
      <P>The surplus of the national lottery is allocated by Government for the purposes set out in the National Lottery Act and the expenditure is voted by the Oireachtas.  The surplus of a charitable lottery is devoted to the charitable or philanthropic purposes set out in the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public accountability of the National Lottery Company is ensured by the publication each year of an annual report and audited accounts which are laid before the Oireachtas.  Charitable <Col N="89" /> lotteries are required to make returns to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Gaming and Lotteries Act is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  I have no plans to amend the National Lottery Act, 1986, for which I have responsibility.</P>
    <P>Because the national lottery and Rehab Lotteries Limited operate in completely different ways their taxation treatments and operational concessions are not comparable.  Rehab operate a series of lotteries under the Gaming and Lotteries Act on behalf of a number of charities who use their professional services to promote, market and manage the lotteries on their behalf.  A service of management, which is subject to VAT, is being provided, therefore, by Rehab to the various charities.</P>
    <P>Under the National Lottery Act, 1986, the licensee, An Post, is entitled to run a lottery and in doing so it comes within the VAT-exempt activity &ldquo;issue of tickets for the purpose of a lottery&rdquo;.  No VAT arises, therefore, on its activities as it does not provide management services to other bodies.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to change the existing position in the Finance Bill because of the implications any change might have for management services generally.</P>
    <P>Under section 34 of the Finance Act, 1987, the profits of An Post National Lottery Company, which is authorised to hold the national lottery on behalf of the Minister for Finance, are exempt from corporation tax.  Profits arising from other lotteries for charities which hold a licence under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, are exempt from income tax and corporation tax.  Rehab Lotteries is not itself a licensee, and thus this exemption does not apply to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that under the present system Rehab Lotteries and, more importantly, the charities for whom they act as agents, are at a serious disadvantage because of the way in which the system is now applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept what the Deputy is saying.  If the Deputy has <Col N="90" /> any further information I will certainly have a look at it but Rehab Lotteries are liable for VAT because of the management services they provide.  There is no question of granting them an exemption because of the implications this would have in the area of management services.  As I understand it, they pay a higher commission fee than An Post. Therefore, I do not see where they are at a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that if allowed to continue the present system will ultimately lead to the elimination from the market-place of Rahab Lotteries?  Would he regard this as helpful given the large number of worthwhile charities they act for?  Would he not, as a matter of urgency, have this matter examined, if necessary, by an independent body, and bring forward legislation which would allow all charitable organisations to compete on an equal footing?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider giving Rehab Lotteries similar concessions in regard to VAT, accountability and price structure as that enjoyed by the national lottery?  The Minister should take into consideration that they are being put through the hoop by pressure and bullyboy tactics by the national lottery. Is the Minister aware that the bullyboys of the national lottery make them account for every ticket and prize paid out?  Considering the perilous state of the services for the handicapped and the disabled the Minister should put Rehab Lotteries on an equal footing with the national lottery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>School books, in common with books generally, are in fact zero rated for VAT.  School equipment, much of which has an application outside the immediate educational sphere, is liable at the standard rate of 23 per cent which applies to the bulk of goods.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>Work on the various aspects of EMU is proceeding under the aegis of the ECOFIN and General Affairs Councils.</P>
      <P>On 12 March, the ECOFIN Council adopted two important decisions necessary to the success of stage I of Economic and Monetary Union which is to start on 1 July 1990.  These relate to the attainment of progressive convergence of economic policies and performance during stage I and to co-operation between the Central Banks of the member states.</P>
      <P>Ireland, as Presidency, is also ensuring that preparations for stages II and III of EMU proceed according to schedule. The European Council at Strasbourg in December 1989 decided that an intergovernmental conference should be convened before the end of 1990 with a view to the final stages of Economic and Monetary Union.  The Government have initiated the procedures required under Article 236 of the Treaty of Rome to have that conference convened.</P>
      <P>As there are no specific proposals on the later stages of EMU before Council at present, the question of a study of their implications does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a study of the implications of EMU generally for the Irish economy and business does not have to wait for specific proposals to be placed on the table?  It is in that context that I raised my question.  We need to know what impact economic and monetary union will have.  The Minister will have to address himself to the impact which German monetary union might have on the plans for European economic and monetary union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent NESC report on Ireland and the European Community focused on what our strategic approach should be to economic and monetary union.  Within the different institutions and fora of the European Community, especially under our Presidency, we are keeping in contact with what is happening.  The first real papers for discussion on the implications of economic and monetary union will be available in the next couple of weeks for discussion at the informal ECOFIN meeting in Ashford Castle in the last days of March.  That will be the first indepth study by the Commission of the implications of economic and monetary union. NESC have provided us with a strategic approach to it.</P>
      <P>Our approach can be described as one of welcoming it in principle on the basis that social and economic cohesion is a fundamental part of it and that as we move along we do so in parallel with social and economic cohesion.  The first study papers will be available to us after the end of March.  The Deputy asked me what effect German monetary union will have and the best I can do for him is to repeat what the German Finance Minister told us last Monday: that the Federal Government of West Germany are totally and absolutely committed to continue towards the achievement of economic and monetary union within the Community.  They are in no way less committed than they were.  They want to ensure that economic integration, apart from the political integration that is likely to take place between the two Germanys, reunification will be done with the least possible impact on the Community and its financial arrangements under the EMU.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is in a <Col N="96" /> position to speculate at this stage on what the results may or may not be.  We have to wait until the elections are out of the way and until there is a Government to negotiate on behalf of East Germany, whether they will accept the offer on the table from the West German Government and what changes may emanate from those discussions.  We will have to wait for a democratically elected Government to respond to those areas and it may be some time before anybody is in a position to speculate on what the impact may be in relation to it.  There is a large balance of payments surplus in the West German economy that can absorb a considerable amount of the funds required for the development of East Germany, remembering that East Germany representing less than 16 million people is even smaller than the land of Hesse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Government have finally pinpointed at least one part of the NESC report with which they agree.  Their statements to date have been that they agree with some but do not agree with other parts but they have never specified what they agree or disagree with.  The NESC strategy is based on the fact that the economic and monetary union would be expected to ensure a continued transfer of resources to the least developed countries, of which Ireland is one, and that German monetary union, the source of much of the resources which would be expected to be transferred, would have a bearing on that and, therefore, it is essential that there is a discussion of some kind in Ireland about the future of economic and monetary union as it will affect this country.  It is not enough simply to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Structural Funds, to which <Col N="97" /> Deputy De Rossa seems to refer, are legally in place by the Single European Act and are there until 1992 and whatever happens in East and West Germany will not take away one farthing from the amount of the Structural Funds which are in place.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I take it from the Minister's reply that the strategy advocated by the NESC report is now Government policy in so far as European monetary union is concerned.  Arising from that, when will the Minister be in a position to specify the pro-active approach advocated by NESC and the advice that we should propose rather than react on the European stage and that we should seek, by our proposals, to have an arrangement that would fulfil our needs rather than trying to modify the proposals of other people?  When will we hear that if NESC is now the policy of the Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that NESC pointed to the need for part and parcel of the economic and monetary union to take place and the need for social and economic cohesion to protect the less developed areas of the Community. That is part and parcel of the Delors report which is the basic document along with the proposals that emanated from the British Government.  The papers on that subject are down for discussion at the ECOFIN meeting in Ashford Castle at the end of the month.  The Taoiseach has called a special informal meeting of the heads of the members of the Community for April to discuss the implications of German monetary union <Col N="98" /> by which time the elections will be out of the way and some judgment can begin to be formed on the negotiations as they take place between the Governments of East and West Germany.</P>

      <P>The expenditure to be incurred by the Office of Public Works in the current year on developments at Portrunny will depend on weather conditions and water levels but is expected to be in the region of £20,000.  The developments which are being planned in consultation with Roscommon County Council consist of the construction of a projecting jetty suitable for mooring of large cruisers.  It is expected that the work will be completed in 1991.</P>

      <P>This raises questions with regard to banking supervision, the inadequacy of Garda resources and the fraud squad, and with regard to inadequate legislation to protect depositors.  Would the Minister agree that the Central Bank need additional powers to investigate individual accounts within banking groups and that a situation could not have arisen within the Gallagher Group, whereby 80 per cent of assets loaned by Merchant Banking Limited were lost, if we had effective legislation?  Is the Minister satisfied that the Central Bank executed their functions efficiently and effectively in this matter and can he say if they were satisfied with accuracy of information being furnished to them? Will the Minister ask the Central Bank to carry out a full investigation into the operations of Merchant Banking Limited and make the findings public?  It is only by doing that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is there in the possession of the Minister's Department a copy of the liquidator's report, and if there is, will he make it available to the spokespersons for Finance?  Further, would it not be entirely appropriate that the Central Bank who, on the Minister's admission, did not adequately monitor Merchant Banking Limited, would organise a rescue package for the small depositors who lost their moneys in the same way as they organised a rescue package for AIB in relation to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland?  Is it not appropriate for the Central Bank to do for these small investors what they did for AIB as this has arisen due to the Central Bank's own mistake?  Many unfortunate small investors lost their entire life savings.</P>

There has been a long and troubled <Col N="107" /> relationship with the Central Bank in relation to Merchant Banking Limited and, arising from the collapse, the Central Bank identified certain areas where the powers of the Bank might be strengthened, particularly in relation to investigations and the demanding of information from banks and their associated companies.

Could the Minister explain what an applicant who did not possess a typewriter might do in applying for one of these jobs or what an applicant who managed to get a typewriter but who did not have a means of transporting the machine to the examination hall might do?  Is the Minister suggesting that they should lug it along on <Col N="109" /> the train or the bus?  Surely it is possible to make some arrangements with schools or public service offices who would have a lot of typewriters available, to make them available for a test like this.</P>

If the Deputy is being sensible and practical about this issue I am sure he will agree that we cannot have a centre in every town and village.  Because of the numbers involved &mdash; 2,376 in 1990 and 4,000 in 1986, when the last examination was held &mdash; it would be totally impractical to do what the Deputy suggests.</P>

      <P>To help Deputy O'Shea, we were dealing with section 9, amendments Nos. 11 and 12, in the names of Deputies O'Shea and Quinn.  We agreed that we would take both together for discussion purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with both of these amendments together as Deputy O'Shea did. Neither of the amendments is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> The proposal to insert &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in subsection (2) of section 12 of the Principal Act appears to be intended to enable local authorities to put the onus on individuals to determine the measures necessary to prevent pollution and to facilitate the insertion of the new paragraph (d) of the amendment to that section.  It seems that where urgent measures are necessary to prevent pollution it is reasonable that the local authority should outline what should be done in the interests of an early action to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that works undertaken to comply with the terms of the notice under section 12 are exempted from the normal requirement to obtain planning permission and that such works may, as a consequence, be unsightly, poorly located or badly constructed.  This exemption arises under Statutory Instrument 348 of 1984, the Local Government Planning Development (Exempt Development) (Amendment) Regulations which obviously relate to planning matters.  It seems reasonable that a local authority should outline the works to be done where urgent measures are necessary to prevent pollution.</P>
    <P>Second, section 12 notices are most frequently used to address potential pollution risks from farms.  The work generally required to be carried out under these notices would be exempt development for the purposes of the Planning Acts.  The question of obtaining planning permission, as outlined by Deputy O'Shea, would not even arise should a farmer independently decide to carry out such works.</P>
    <P>Third, given the dual water pollution and planning roles of local authorities they are well placed to take account of any special aesthetic or other planning considerations in determining terms of section 12 notices.</P>
    <P>Finally, as these concerns relate to exemptions extended under planning legislation they should be considered and, as appropriate, amended in the context of planning rather than the present Bill.  The proposed new paragraph (d) is identical to section 17 (3) of the Bill <Col N="174" /> which amends section 23 of the Act and as a result is unnecessary.  Where time permits, having regard to the nature of the pollution risk to be dealt with, there is nothing to stop a local authority issuing a notice under section 23 so as to obtain relvant information from a farmer or details of the measures he proposes to take to prevent pollution and considering the responses before finalising the terms of the section 12 notice.  I cannot see that there is anything to be gained by an amendment which would duplicate the provisions of section 17 (3) of the Bill and, accordingly I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 seeks to amend subsection (4) of section 12 of the principal Act so as to provide a sanction for the provision of false or misleading information in response to a request for such information under section 12 of the Act as it would stand if amendment No. 11 were accepted.  However, as I have already stated, I cannot accept amendment No. 11 and this amendment, too, is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It seems that where urgent measures are necessary the delays involved in going down the route advocated by Deputy O'Shea would be totally wrong and would lead to local authorities not being in a position to dictate to a farmer the measures that require to be taken as a matter of urgency.  That is one of the main reasons we could not accept the amendment proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments were formulated following discussions with people in the field who operate the Act. These are the people at the coalface, the people who have to work the Act at local level.  The amendments do not prevent the local authority dealing with an urgent problem under section 12.  The substitution of &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not change that situation.  If the local authority feel they have to act speedily and urgently, it is quite open to them to do that under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major problem here is the potential polluter.  There is no provision under section 12 whereby information can be <Col N="175" /> obtained urgently from a potential polluter and this is the concern I would have. For instance, a section 12 notice served in the absence of full information from a polluter or potential polluter makes it very difficult for a local authority to formulate exactly what is necessary.</P>
    <P>Statutory Instrument 384 of 1984 exempting works caried out under section 12 of the Act from planning permission was brought in for a very good reason. The directions given by a local authority under section 12 deal with capacity and technical aspects but will not deal with the actual construction of the added dimension to the effluent disposal operation of the person involved.  I am not coming here with an amendment which just came off the top of my head.  I am talking in terms of the people who are very dedicated to the operation of the Act and these are the problems that are frustrating them.  I believe that if this amendment were accepted it would greatly strengthen what is an Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very impressed with the presentation which Deputy O'Shea gave on this amendment on the last occasion.  He has highlighted an issue of some concern particularly to the people who have to work the legislation. I cannot understand why the Minister cannot accept Deputy O'Shea's amendments. Is there a reason for not accepting them on technical grounds?  Perhaps the Minister could identify that and we could debate the principle.  It would seem that what Deputy O'Shea is proposing is very much in harmony with section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a long debate here on the last occasion about the kind of defence a person could put forward if a charge were brought against him for committing an offence under the Bill, and the terms which were introduced by the Minister were that the person would have to prove they had taken reasonable care to prevent the entry to waters to which the charge relates by providing, maintaining, using, operating and supervising facilities or by <Col N="176" /> employing practices or methods of operation that, having regard to all the circumstances, were suitable for the purpose of such prevention.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea's amendment is very much in harmony with that position.  For example, he is requiring the submission of maps, plans, drawings, etc. showing the location, nature, extent and condition of facilities for the collection, storage, treatment and disposal of the effluent and other polluting matter and so on.  In other words he is putting an onus on the person on whom a notice would be served to present the evidence that sufficient care is being taken.  It seems to be consistent with the other provisions in the Bill.  It would greatly weaken the provision in the Bill requiring a potential polluter to take all reasonable care if there was not an explicit provision in the Bill requiring the person concerned to produce the evidence of it.  Deputy O'Shea on the previous occasion spelled out the kind of difficulties that the absence of this provision in the Bill would have for people who would have to operate it.  I think the Minister is taking a particularly negative position on it and I ask her to reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As we see it, the insertion of this amendment would very seriously weaken the Bill.  Deputy O'Shea seems to want a position whereby the farmer with his advisers would come in with suggestions as to what he wants to do and then they would be adopted before the section 12 notice would go out. That can and does happen where there is no urgency but very often the matter is so urgent that it is necessary for the local authority to detail very specifically what needs to be done and to impose an obligation on the farmer in question to carry out the very specific works which the local authority believe need to be carried out. To take that obligation away would, in our view, very seriously weaken this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy O'Shea asked for is covered in section 17 (1) (c) and section <Col N="177" /> 23 of the Bill.  Section 17 seeks to strengthen the powers of local authorities to get information.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Gilmore's point of getting maps and so on, that can happen where there is time and it does happen, and there is no problem about that.  This section does not interfere with that at all, but we wish to strengthen the legislation to ensure that there is an obligation on a local authority through a section 12 notice to detail very specifically the measures that need to be taken to combat a pollution problem or a potential pollution problem.  For that reason we cannot accept &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; which would weaken that position, give too much discretion and leave the decision the other way round rather than putting the compulsion on the local authority to specify the nature of the works to be carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems we are at cross purposes here.  I cannot accept that deleting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and inserting &ldquo;may&rdquo; weakens the Bill in terms of the local authority dealing with an urgent problem.  They still have discretion under the Bill to move urgently if so desired.  On that point I ask the Minister to clarify further how she sees that substituting &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo; weakens the powers of local authorities to deal urgently with a problem.  We are seeking to put in here further powers if they choose to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if one substitutes &ldquo;may&rdquo; for &ldquo;shall&rdquo; one leaves the <Col N="178" /> discretion with the local authority as to whether the provision is adhered to.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; puts a compulsion on a local authority.</P>
      <P>In relation to a section 12 notice it is possible, subsequent to response to the notice, to have negotiations and discussions. If that is the point the Deputy wishes to cover that is covered.  Subsequent to a section 12 notice representations and discussions can and do take place.  Removing the compulsion by inserting &ldquo;may&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and giving local authorities the discretion that they may issue section 12 notices in cases like this I believe would be wrong and would weaken the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree there.  Is the Minister suggesting that her local authority officials will act in a less than urgent way if we change the Bill?  These amendments are down to strengthen the position of local authorities.  The Minister has not convinced me that deleting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;may&rdquo; makes any difference other than to strengthen the hands of local authorities.  If she chooses to comment on whether local authorities would act responsibly, I believe that is inappropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose in page 12, line 44, before &ldquo;incurred&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.  The printed matter refers to line 45 but as Deputy O'Shea has pointed out to me privately it should be line 44.  Section 10 of the Bill allows local authorities to intervene directly where it appears to  them to be necessary to do so in order to prevent, mitigate or remedy pollution. The section also entitles the authorities to recover the cost they so incur from the person whose actions or failure to act necessitated the intervention.  The proposed amendment will make it clear that the costs to be recovered by local authorities are those reasonably incurred in dealing with the situation.  The amendment may give some reassurance to polluters that they will not be faced with unreasonable bills for local authority actions, although the propects of this arising in the first place are extremely unlikely given the role of the courts in the settlement of the debt due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's justification for this amendment. We are dealing with a section of the Bill which would enable the local authority to seek through the courts by simple contract debt the recovery of the expenditure incurred by the local authority in carrying out certain works to prevent water pollution, to remove polluting matter from waters or to mitigate or remedy the effects of any polluting matter in waters, drains or sewers.  First of all one has to assume that the local authority would be reasonable in seeking the recovery of the expenditure they had incurred.  Even if the local authority were to be unreasonable in seeking the recovery of the expenditure incurred, it is reasonable to assume that the court would arrive at a reasonable conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is assumed in the section that what is intended is reasonable expenditure. Therefore the question arises as to why the Minister has felt it necessary to introduce an amendment to insert the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.  One has to try to contemplate what the insertion of that word is likely to give rise to.  As the section stands it is quite clear; it is that expenditure incurred by the authority in relation to measures may be recovered by the authority.  That is something the court will have to calculate but what will happen if the court has to adjudicate on what is reasonably incurred?  Will there be a situation whereby every action taken by the authority is challenged in the courts by the defendant on the grounds <Col N="182" /> of reasonableness?  This is one of those phrases with which the courts will have enormous play, one of those phrases which will probably leave the legal profession much better off as it teases its way through what was intended by reasonableness.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, when the courts are faced with trying to define a term such as &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; they very often take into account what was in the mind of the Legislature when it was being put into the Bill.  I am very concerned that the courts would draw certain conclusions from the fact that in the original version of this Bill and in the version which was passed by the Seanad it simply stated &ldquo;expenditure incurred&rdquo; but here in the Dáil it was amended at the behest of the Government to include the term &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;. The conclusion a court would draw from that is that what was intended by the Dáil was that the expenditure incurred which may be reclaimed by a local authority was to be reduced.  That certainly appears to be what was intended by the IFA when they asked the Government to amend this section.</P>
    <P>I must apologise to the Minister for not having supplied her with a copy of this document, which I undertook to do on the last occasion, but I had not expected that we would reach the Bill so rapidly today.  However, I will undertake to supply her with a copy of it.  That document circulated by the IFA states, regarding section 10:</P>
    <P>In this section of the Bill it states that expenditure incurred by the authority in relation to measures may be recovered by the authority from the person as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdication.  We have been successful in getting an amendment to this clause.  This clause now reads &ldquo;expenditure reasonably incurred&rdquo;.  It is viewed that this amendment will safeguard the farmer from incurring excessive and unnecessary costs claimed by the local authority. </P>
    <P>The original version of the Bill would not have involved anybody being faced with excessive and unnecessary costs.  Quite <Col N="183" /> clearly, the Bill as originally drafted, referred to expenditure incurred and in any event that would be a matter for the courts.  This section and this amendment was clearly seen by the IFA as a way of reducing the amount which could be reclaimed by a local authority.</P>
    <P>The environmental issue which arises here is the principle that the polluter pays.  We have heard a lot about this in the House of late.  It is one of those phrases that everybody seems to have adopted and everybody is all in favour of it.  &ldquo;The polluter pays&rdquo; principle, as I understand it, certainly involves the polluter paying for the damage that the polluter causes, paying to the public authority the cost of any remedial works which would be required in order to limit pollution, to stop it or to deal with the effects of it.  Either we will have that principle applied in the Bill or we will not. It seems that as a result of the Minister's amendment the courts will be likely to interpret what was in the minds of the legislators in this section of the Bill as reducing the amount to be reclaimed by the local authorities.  I do not understand the necessity for the amendment in the first place.  I would have thought that reasonableness was quite clear from the wording of the Bill as originally drafted. It seems to me that the only purpose for introducing the amendment is to reduce the amount which can be reclaimed by a local authority, and that is something I would be opposed to.</P>

      <P>If these debates are to be meaningful, people have to be reasonable and that being the case, I do not intend to press my amendment.  I do not think it would have made a huge difference either way but I take on board some of the points raised by Deputy Gilmore.  It is extremely unlikely that any court is going to expect anybody to pay costs incurred unreasonably.  The amendment would not in any way weaken the position of local authorities because as section 10 (2) of the Bill makes clear:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the extent (if any) that any <Col N="184" /> measures taken by a local authority or a sanitary authority under this section were necessitated by the acts or omissions of a person (being acts or omissions that the person ought reasonably to have foreseen would or might necessitate the taking of the measures by the authority), the expenditure incurred by the authority in relation to the measures may be recovered by the authority from the person as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction. </P>
    <P>Obviously it would not be desirable to enter into litigation on whether the costs incurred by the local authority were reasonable, and that being the case and wishing to be reasonable and have meaningful debates, I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>11.&mdash;Section 15 of the Principal Act is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  by the substitution of the following subsections for subsection (3):</P>
      <P>`(3)  Two or more local authorities may jointly make a water quality management plan in relation to waters part of which are in or adjoin the functional area of each local authority. </P>
      <P>(3A)  A water quality management plan may be revised or replaced by the local authority or local authorities that made it.', and</P>
      <P>(b)  by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (6): </P>
      <P>`(6)  As soon as practicable after the making, revision or replacement of a plan under this section, a copy of the plan as so made or revised or of the replacement plan shall be given by the local authority concerned to the Minister and the Minister for the Marine and to any local authority, sanitary authority or regional board whose functional area either adjoins the waters to which the plan relates or the performance of whose functions would be affected by or would affect the implementation of the plan.'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of amendment No. 14 is to provide an additional amendment to section 15 of the 1977 Act relating to subsection (6) which concerns the circulation of water quality management plans.  For purposes of drafting and presentation it is preferable to delete section 11 of the Bill and replace it with a comprehensive amendment section.  Subsections (3) and (3A) of section 11 are being repeated, subject to minor drafting changes to the latter subsection, so as to ensure consistency in the use of terms concerning the revision or replacement <Col N="186" /> of management plans throughout section 15 of the 1977 Act.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (6) will ensure that all local and sanitary authorities and regional fisheries boards whose functional areas may directly or indirectly affect the water quality management plan or which may be affected by the provisions of the plan are given copies of the plan and so are made aware of its contents.  The present requirements in this regard may, in certain circumstances, involve an inadequate level of circulation of such plans.  This is possible as the local authority making a plan are required only to circulate it to other local authorities adjoining their functional area and to sanitary authorities and fisheries boards within their own administrative boundaries. However, there may well be other authorities, particularly sanitary authorities, whose activities may indirectly affect the section of a river which is the subject of the management plan.</P>
    <P>There may also be cases where adjoining local authorities are far removed from the waters covered in the plan and who will have no interest in or influence on the waters concerned.  The present section 15 of the 1977 Act, which requires circulation of copies of the plan to such authorities, is clearly inappropriate for such situations.</P>
    <P>This amendment is concerned with fine tuning in the light of experience of operating the 1977 Act and is intended to rectify the inadequacies indicated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  On amendments Nos. 15 and 16, section 15 of the 1977 Act states that a local authority may and, if so directed by the Minister, shall make a water quality management plan for any waters situated in their functional area or <Col N="189" /> which adjoin that area.  There are two possibilities, the first is that a local authority may, if they so wish, make a water quality management plan and the second, if so directed by the Minister, they will have to make a water quality management plan.  To my knowledge no Minister in the 13 years since that Act was passed has directed a local authority to make a water quality management plan and only two local authorities out of a total of 98 in that time have made water quality management plans.  Therefore, it is quite clear that section 15 of the 1977 Act has not been implemented by local authorities.  There is a good explanation for this.  Unless a function is mandatory it is generally not carried out by local authorities who have a wide range of functions to carry out.  Generally speaking, unless these functions are mandatory they are not carried out by the local authorities and that is the case in this instance.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that section 15 of the 1977 Act has been a failure.  Apart from two exceptions, no water quality management plans have been made.  What I am seeking to ensure with amendment No. 15 is that each local authority shall make a water quality management plan for any waters situated in their functional area or which adjoin that area and that that water quality management plan is revised or replaced at intervals of no longer than five years, in other words, an obligation similar to the one on local authorities to make a development plan would be imposed on local authorities to make water quality management plans and review them at intervals of no longer than five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are critical reasons that this amendment should be taken on board at this time.  There is increasing public concern about the quality of our water, in particular our drinking water.  In recent weeks concern has been expressed about the effects of fish farming at Poulaphouca on drinking water in Dublin.  As well as this, in a report, in <i>Consumer Choice</i> magazine concern was expressed about the levels of aluminium in drinking water in Dublin.  In my own constituency the residents living in a small estate had a <Col N="190" /> study carried out by the Eastern Health Board, the results of which clearly show that there are excessive levels of lead, ecoli and aluminium in the water and that it is unsuitable for use.  The report pointed out to the residents that the water should not be used as drinking water or for culinary or even laundry purposes. The residents have produced samples of the water and I have seen little objects floating around in it.  Certainly I would not use it.  On the other hand, the local authority concerned have told the residents that the water is suitable for use, that they are satisfied it is potable.</P>
    <P>We have two conflicting reports, the first of which from the Eastern Health Board states that the residents should not use the water to wash their clothes and the second from the local authorities stating that the water is perfectly safe to drink.  Local doctors have advised the residents that they should not use the water unless they boil it first.  In most cases they are buying their drinking water.  I could give many other examples from all over the country to show that the water supply may be contaminated in one way or another.  Here I am just talking about the quality of drinking water but there is also the question of the quality of water in rivers and the extent to which fish life can survive in waters which are polluted.</P>
    <P>The intention behind section 15 of the 1977 Act was that local authorities would adopt a planned approach to water quality within their functional areas.  It has not worked.  It may be said that local authorities have been remiss in not doing so.  However, the fact is that they have not done so and we should not let the opportunity this Bill presents pass without making it mandatory on them to draw up water quality management plans and ensure that those plans are reviewed every five years.</P>

      <P>I will not go over the ground covered by Deputy Gilmore who dealt with the variable standards of water available, particularly in the Dublin area. The Deputy expressed his views very fully and correctly.  However, one matter has <Col N="191" /> not been adverted to in the Bill or the Minister's amendments, the question of time limits.  For that reason I have tabled amendment No. 17.  It is essential that the Bill contain a time limit to avoid the dragging on of preparations of plans.  I suggest that the end of 1990 would be an appropriate time limit to place on local authorities who have been preparing plans for some time.  We cannot afford to drag our feet on this issue.  It is essential that plans are put in place as soon as possible.  The health of our people is at stake.  We are not dealing with an academic issue.  May I move my amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate what Deputy Gilmore said with regard to the quality of water, in particular drinking water.  The difficulty that most people have now is that there are different agencies producing different reports.  The general public do not know what information is reliable, they do not know whether drinking water in Dublin or in a wide variety of areas such as those referred to in the <i>Consumer Choice</i> magazine, is a danger to health or not.  It seems that when an agency other than a local authority sound warning bells local authorities automatically adopt a defensive posture and protest that everything is in order.  There is a growing cynicism with that defensive posture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for reassurance.  I am a little concerned at the idea that amendments Nos. 14, 15 and 16 may be mutually exclusive; we may have to look further at that.  There is a valid point in saying that each local authority should within a reasonable period of time have in place a water management plan.  That could happen under existing legislation and it is open to the Minister to instruct each local authority to prepare a plan.  As I understand that legislation, taking into account the Minister's amendment, local <Col N="192" /> authorities have discretion whether to prepare such plans or not, but if they are instructed by the Minister to prepare them they must do so.  In my view the Department have been remiss in not issuing the necessary instructions.  The need to issue instructions is very clear in the light of a whole series of recent incidents such as that at Poulaphouca, the concerns about aluminium in the water supply and the concerns about other matters in water supplies, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Department have deliberately not issued instructions so as to avoid having to provide local authorities with the additional resources that may be required for them to put in place a water management plan.  It is worth putting that question to the Minister. If we are talking about all the waters which are the responsibility of local authorities the most recent statistics we have, for 1989, show that there were 112 serious incidents of water pollution resulting in the death of approximately 35,000 fish.  That statistic was issued by the Department of the Marine, it was not invented by the Opposition and is sufficient to give rise to a great deal of concern with regard to our rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>I would be happy if the Minister would tell us that she is prepared to issue the necessary instructions to local authorities to provide such management plans and to update them on a regular basis.  Deputy Gilmore and I share membership of Dublin County Council and we are aware that the five year county development plan seems to extend to 11 or 12 years. The Minister of State is still a member of Dublin County Council and it appears that she is constrained to be a member of that body by the Fianna Fáil group on the council, or so we are told.  We are aware that the development plan process does not work.  The renewal of a water management plan would not require the same input from elected representatives or impose the same burden on them.  It may impose a burden on local authority officials but if the local authority are to be the main body policing water pollution legislation and ensuring that our rivers <Col N="193" /> and lakes are unpolluted and that our water supplies are drinkable as tap water when it comes into our homes, then they should be doing this work.  If they are not doing it it is because the Department have not required them to do it or they lack the resources to undertake it.</P>
    <P>It is my view that existing legislation should have been adequate to ensure that the job was done properly but that is not the case.  Deputy Gilmore made a persuasive case for imposing a general obligation on all local authorities, in the absence of the Minister being willing to take action under existing law, requiring them to put in place such management plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some confusion in Deputies' minds about the quality of drinking water and the necessity for water quality management plans.  I share the many concerns expressed by Deputies in relation to the quality of drinking water resulting from the lack of treatment processes rather than the lack of water management plans.  There are excessive levels of aluminium and nitrates in the water.  They are not at the levels outlined recently in the <i>Consumer Choice</i> magazine. Those figures were based on outdated monitoring results.  Nonetheless, there are problems but they occur in the minority of the one thousand or so water treatment schemes we have throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government allocated recently £1 billion essentially for water treatment in different forms.  A sum of £300 million will go to upgrading the quality of drinking water.  In addition £14 million is being spent on the Ballymore Eustace works which supply the bulk of the drinking water for the Dublin area.  That scheme will be completed some time next year. The £300 million will be spent during the next decade upgrading our public water supply to ensure that it meets the highest possible international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past we got our standards from the World Health Organisation and in more recent times the standards have come from the European Community. <Col N="194" /> Standards are uniform thoughout member states and we have adopted the most stringent European standards.  For example, the drinking water regulations cover 55 different parameters that the quality of the water must meet.  We have had some problems but they have been exaggerated in many cases.  The £300 million will be spent over the next decade to ensure that our public water supply is of the highest possible quality. Obviously, we must be concerned about the quality of the water particularly given the link in medical research between Alzheimer's disease and aluminium levels in drinking water.</P>
    <P>In addition £230 million will be spent on sewage treatment facilities and preventing the pollution of our inland waterways by upgrading sewage treatment facilities for our inland towns.  A sum of £400 million will be spent in our major coastal towns to prevent the discharge of raw sewage into our marine waters.  That will apply to coastal towns with a population of 10,000 people or more.  These are major commitments by the Government, they are necessary and they are important.  It is the first time that a commitment of that kind has been given.  Deputy Gilmore is wrong in relation to water quality management plans, seven have been completed and those seven have involved many more than seven local authorities.  For example, in regard to the Slaney where there is a water quality management plan there are at least three local authorities involved.  We have water control management plans for the Barrow, the Nore, the Suir and Bantry Bay.  In addition there are 12 water quality management plans underway at present, many of which are near completion.  While it is true that no formal direction has been given by the Minister under the powers conferred on him under the 1977 Act that direction would probably be given only where a refusal came from a local authority to conduct a water quality management plan.  Informal directions have been given and I have been involved in <Col N="195" /> speaking with and writing to local authorities for the lower Shannon area in relation to Lough Derg asking them to complete the water quality management plan which is underway and which will be completed shortly.  The same applies in relation to Dublin Bay.  The Minister did not give a direction but certainly it was the Minister and the Department of the Environment who co-ordinated that management plan which is underway and which will be completed towards the middle of 1991.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second last amendment, Deputies O'Shea and Gilmore were anxious to give some flexibility or discretion to local authorities and to change the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  In this situation there seems to be an anxiety to have a compulsion and it does not seem to make much sense.  It is not necessary to have a water quality management plan for all waters.  Local authority resources have got to be used in the most efficient way possible.  In respect of waters that are not likely to be polluted, where there is unlikely to be any development in the foreseeable future, it is not necessary to have a water quality management plan.  We have got to ensure that the resources of local authorities are used to the maximum effect as far as the environment is concerned.  It is fair to reiterate here, because this is often misrepresented, that only 2 per cent of our rivers are seriously polluted, that is according to the last water quality report of 1987.  It is a very low figure and we often exaggerate the state of our waters.</P>
    <P>For many reasons I cannot accept the amendments as put forward but since they may or may not be taken separately there seems to be some confusion.  In fairness there is a difference between my amendment No. 14 and amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 17.  Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 appear to seek to put a compulsion on local authorities to carry out water management plans for all waters in their functional areas.  Amendment No. 17 seeks to put a time limit on the local authorities to complete water quality management plans.  These plans are <Col N="196" /> extremely difficult to carry out.  They are expensive, cumbersome and very technical so it is not a simple matter of looking at the water and devising a plan.  Scientific surveys and analyses have to be carried out.  The Dublin plan will take a minimum of 18 months after which the draft plan goes on public display and the public have a right to make representations.  It will not be possible to accede to Deputy Garland's request that all the plans be completed by the end of this year.  Equally, in relation to the desire of Deputy Gilmore to review the plans every five years, to make it compulsory, that may not be necessary; review is different from revise &mdash; one must always review plans of all kinds but to revise implies change and that may not be necessary.  To put a compulsion there that would be that inflexible or rigid would not be desirable.  For those reasons it will not be possible to accept the amendments proposed by the Deputies.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  I accept that the end of 1990 might be too soon to expect completion of the plans but I am disappointed that the Minister did not suggest some other date.  Perhaps she would consider, say, the date, 30 June 1991, by way of amendment for Report Stage as these matters tend to drag on.  I appreciate that much work has to be done but it is essential that it be carried out with reasonable speed.  The Minister has given the figure of 2 per cent of rivers as being seriously polluted.  She has made this statement outside the Dáil as well.  Can she state the source of this information because it seems to me to be an absolutely ludicrous figure?  I hope she has the source of the information.</P>

      <P>I stand corrected by the Minister in relation to the number of water quality management plans which have been made and which are in the pipeline.  Nevertheless, the main thrust <Col N="197" /> of my argument still holds, that 13 years after the enactment of the 1977 Act only a tiny minority of waters in the country are covered by water quality management plans or are intended to be covered by them.  The Minister made the statement that it is not necessary to have a water quality management plan in respect of all waters.  That is where we fundamentally disagree because I think we have to look at water as a valuable and, indeed, often a scarce resource. Like any resource its management has to be approached in a planned way. The day is long gone when we can regard water as something that simply falls from the sky, that has always been there and that will always be with us.  We have to look at water and treat it with the kind of care that since 1963, at least ostensibly, we have been required to treat the use of land.  She makes a point that it would not be a good use of the scarce resources of a local authority to have to make a water quality management plan in every case.  It is a case of being penny wise and pound foolish.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and the Minister, in the past couple of months have made great play of the millions of pounds that apparently will be spent on the improvement of sewage treatment and water supply generally.  I will not get into the argument this evening about the fact that really all they have been talking about is continuing the public capital programme for sewage and water treatment at much the same level as at present and, indeed, at considerably less than what it was over the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us talk for a moment about the spending of millions of pounds on sewage treatment and water supplies.  Is the Minister seriously saying that the Government are talking about spending all of this money and all of this European money on sewage treatment and on water supply and not requiring local authorities to adopt water quality management plans to ensure that that expenditure is properly deployed, properly maintained and properly managed over the years to come? Let me give her an example.  The constituency I represent has a water supply <Col N="198" /> system which is a 19th century clapped out system of pipes, something like one would find in a Tom Sharpe novel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is very little to laugh about in it.  There are frequent bursts, poor water pressure in some areas and dirty water in other areas.  We have 20th century housing developments built on top of this clapped-out system of water supply.  It has been like that for years.  The local authority can be criticised for the poor way in which they have maintained that system of water supply down through the years but in terms of maintenance the local authority has spent a lot of money repairing leaks, digging up roads and reinstating them to simply make sure that the water is going through that clapped out system.  Recently the corporation did a study and prepared a scheme for the renewal of that water supply system.  The total cost of that will be £44 million, the work to be carried out over a 12 year period.  I sincerely hope that that scheme will be included in the largesse which is apparently to be spent on water supply.  I am sure there are other areas where the system of water supply needs to be approached in a planned way.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a water quality management plan.  It is not simply a question of saying that there is a lake, a river or a bay, and let us adopt a water quality management plan for them.  We are talking about local authorities looking at all the water resources in their areas and approaching them in a planned way, knowing where the water is coming from, what is in it as it goes through the functional area of the local authority, what goes into it, what is being discharged, how the water is supplied and how that in turn affects the quality of water as it ends up on the table for drinking and for other uses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not confusing the question of the quality of drinking water with the making of water quality management plans but the two are inter-related because the quality of the water that ends up on the table is very much related to the pollution <Col N="199" /> of water in the first place and to the whole system of water distribution.  That is very much an integral part of what we are talking about.  We have long passed the day when local authorities and public authorities generally can simply treat water as something that is there believing that all local authorities have to do is respond to cases of obvious pollution, to illegal discharges into water and so on. There must be a planned approach to the care of water.  That is obviously what was intended in the 1977 Act, but it has not happened except in limited cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter mentioned that it was open to the Minister to direct local authorities to make water quality management plans.  That is so, but it would not be fair to leave that Minister totally responsible for directing local authorities to make water quality management plans.  The only occasions when that power might be realistically used is when a crisis occurs, when a river or lake suffers excessive pollution resulting in a public outcry and the Minister, as a political response, would use his power under section 15 of the 1977 Act to direct the local authority to make a water quality management plan.  Only in that sort of situation will one get a Minister to act under section 15 of the Act.  It would be much simpler to require local authorities to draw up the water quality management plans in the first place.</P>
    <P>I take the point about reviewing the plan every five years.  I expressed the amendment in the terms in which I did to avoid the kind of situation Deputy Shatter talked about where development plans, even though the review process starts at five year intervals, can be dragged on for several years afterwards. I specifically built in that the intervals should not be longer than five years, although I am not hung up on a five year interval.  The principle of a review is more important and there should be some time limit within which local authorities review the water quality management plans.</P>
    <P>The quality of water will become increasingly an issue for public debate <Col N="200" /> as there is increasing concern about the quality of water and about water pollution. As Deputy Shatter said, a number of agencies are now involved in this area &mdash; the local authorities, the Department of the Marine, regional fisheries boards and perhaps the environment protection agency, if ever it sees the light of day. A number of pieces of legislation also impact on the quality of water, for instance, the 1977 Act, the Fisheries Acts and the 1988 regulations on drinking water quality.  There is a question relating to the availability of information arising from legislation and regulations.  For example, under the 1988 regulations on drinking water quality, local authorities are required to test the drinking water quality.  It is not clear that all local authorities are carrying out that duty &mdash; perhaps the Minister could clarify that they are all fulfilling that obligation &mdash; but those who are simply take the tests, have them analysed and submit the report to the Department.  The information is not made available to the public or even to the members of the local authority concerned. It is treated very much as a matter of scientific evidence which is passed between one local authority and another.</P>
    <P>Along with the Minister, I am a member of a local authority where recently I asked some questions about tests carried out on the quality of the water in Dublin county and I was told that in 92.5 per cent of the samples taken, the quality was all right as far as the mandatory EC levels were concerned. What concerns me is the 7.5 per cent of samples that were not all right.  The same kind of global answer could have been given at any time about the quality of the air.  Taking the air pollution figures over a number of years, I am sure it would be possible to say that in 92 per cent or 93 per cent of cases the air quality was fine, yet we know that Dublin has had a serious smog problem.  The fact that 7.5 per cent of the samples breached the EC limits in Dublin county is quite serious.  Similarly I was told that in 62.5 per cent of the cases the water quality was better than the guideline level in the regulations.  The corollary of that is that in 37.5 per cent <Col N="201" /> of cases the water quality was not better than the level in the regulations.</P>
    <P>That kind of information should be made available to the public.  I believe the public are going to demand information about the quality of water.  Whether or not we like it I believe local authorities are going to have to address the question of water quality in a much more planned and sophisticated way than is now the case.  I do not think they can do this by carrying out their individual functions separately, doing X under the drinking water regulations, Y under the Water Pollution Act and pursuing the odd polluter here and there.  There will have to be a planned approach to this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal in her reply with the question of why local authorities should not be required to adopt water quality management plans.  That is the fundamental issue we are debating here. She spoke about resources.  If we do not have a planned approach to water quality it leads to a waste of local authority resources.  Only this morning one of my constituents rang me about a smell of diesel which is coming from a particular stream.  There have been fairly constant complaints about this problem.  Local authorities investigate such complaints but say that they cannot find anything. It would be a much better use of local authority resources to have a planned approach to the management of water than to have this kind of <i>ad hoc</i> response when local authorities send out an inspector or engineer to investigate whether something is being discharged into water about which a member of the public or a public representative has complained. Water is too valuable a resource with which to deal in this <i>ad hoc</i> way.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the arguments I have made.  I am not hung up about the five year review period about which I have spoken but I am very much hung up on the concept that there should be a mandatory obligation on local authorities to have water quality management plans carried out.</P>
    <P>I agree with the principle of Deputy Garland's amendment.  It embodies my idea that local authorities should be <Col N="202" /> required to have water quality management plans.  I agree with the principle of the amendment but it may be unrealistic to expect the first plans to be adopted within a period of one year.  The adoption of the first water quality management plan will be a complicated matter because of the procedure involved, which is fairly analogous to the adoption of a development plan.  The one year time limit is unrealistic but the principle of requiring a local authority to have such a plan is the important matter which we must tease out here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In an ideal world perhaps it would be desirable to have water quality management plans for all water but, given the commitments of local authorities, the resources involved, etc., it would not be practical to have water quality management plans for the 12,000 kilo-metres of rivers, streams and so on in this country.  I do not think such water quality management plans would be necessary for waters which are not polluted, unlikely to be polluted, and not the subject of any development in their catchment area and so on.</P>
      <P>I accept fully the points made by Deputies Gilmore and Shatter in regard to water used for drinking purposes. That water is subject to very stringent controls.  Not alone have we adopted and implemented the European Community directives dealing with the quality of drinking water but we have also adopted the directives dealing with surface water, water which it is intended to use for drinking purposes.  There are regulations dealing with surface water before the drinking water is abstracted and the drinking water when it has gone through the treatment process.  Those waters are subject to very strict controls at all stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that there have been problems and that is why such considerable expenditure is envisaged over the next decade.  It is not true to say that the expenditure over the next decade is simply the capital sum which would have been spent anyway.  We spent about £700 <Col N="203" /> million over the last decade between sanitary services and public water and in many cases simply providing a public water supply in the first instance.  The £1 billion being provided is in 1990 figures and will work out well in excess of that by the end of the decade.  Much of that money will be spent on upgrading the supply system and improving the pipelines to which Deputy Gilmore referred. Many of these pipelines are corroded and outdated and much money will be spent on upgrading them.  We want to get to the stage where all water used for drinking purposes comes within the very strict guidelines.  Our priority will be to spend the moneys in the area of greatest need. A sum of £14 million is being spent on the Ballymore Eustace scheme which I think will be completed some time next year.  This will ensure that the problems which existed in relation to the Dublin water supply system will be rectified.</P>
    <P>We have to be realistic and practical when we are dealing with the expenditure of public moneys and the activities of local authorities.  When the remaining 12 water quality management plans which are now under way &mdash; many of them are near completion &mdash; are completed, the water for which it is desirable to have water quality management plans will be taken care of.  I have been so advised and I have no reason not to accept the advice that the water in respect of which it is desirable and necessary to have a water quality management plan is well under way or will be completed very soon.  If it is the case that there is an area where a water quality management plan is desirable, then I would envisage using the powers under the 1977 Act to give such a direction.  Very often it is not necessary to give the direction formally; it can be done by way of consultation and discussion with the local authority concerned. I would envisage using the direction only when a local authority refuse to involve themselves in the preparation of a water quality management plan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore said he is not hung up on the five year review period.  It is <Col N="204" /> desirable, and should be the case, that water quality management plans, like any other plans of local authorities, for example, development plans, should be under constant review.  The development plan has to be reviewed every five years. I am not certain if there is a need to be so specific in regard to water quality management plans but the Deputy expressed his willingness to be flexible about that matter.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for me to accept the amendments.  If the Deputies insist on pressing their amendments we will have to have a vote.</P>

        <b>:</b> I wanted to get in before the Minister finished. Obviously I am a member of a very enlightened local authority because when I asked two years ago at council level for a copy of the readings from the Barrow and Slaney Rivers they were willingly given and are supplied on a two monthly basis.  Luckily the report is very favourable and the quality of water is good. However, that does not mean the people who live near the Barrow River are not concerned at the growth on the river bed. The quality of water is one matter but the quality of water in which fish can live is another.  One of the industries involved is prepared to spend almost £1 million this year to try to stop warm water which causes growth on the river bed entering the Barrow River.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister does not mind me asking what effect the water management plan will have on, say, the Barrow and Slaney Rivers in my constituency.  I do not mind if the Minister wants to take some time to answer that question but I want to know what changes there will be in the present system of carrying out tests and having a certain amount of control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The main advantages of water quality plans are that first they indicate to the local authority where there might be a need to upgrade a sewage treatment works or matters of that kind; it gives them information on the river flow and so on, which would <Col N="205" /> allow them to set appropriate conditions when granting water licences.  That is an important element of water quality management, although it is not necessarily involved with planning.  Anybody who is going to discharge waste or effluent into water is required to have a licence and that is a good safety valve for the local authority to ensure that they have control over the conditions under which such a discharge could enter waters.</P>
      <P>Basically a water quality management plan allows the local authorities in the catchment area of a particular watercourse to have a planned and co-ordinated approach to the water in question and to have scientific and detailed information on the nature of the water, the flow of the water and so on.  If any problems have been identified it will allow the local authority to make plans to rectify them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the case.  It allows the local authorities in question to have an integrated approach to water quality management in their area.  It would allow them, for example, to set quality objectives and to set perhaps the highest objective which would <Col N="206" /> be the designation of the waters as being salmonoid.  Such a direction might not be necessary short of a water quality management plan given the kind of detailed information of a scientific nature which would be necessary.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Garland's request, I will give him an assurance that I will make contact with the local authorities in question to ask them to bring forward as quickly as possible the completion of those water quality management plans that are under way.  I do not know if that will satisfy the Deputy but that is the best I can do because they take such a considerable length of time that it is not possible for me to give a direction that they should all be completed by the end of this year.  For example, the quality management plan in relation to Dublin Bay will not be completed before the middle of next year, despite the considerable allocation of resources.</P>

The problem I am trying to address here is where a local authority, in the interests of attracting industry to that local authority area, might drop their payments as against those of another local authority.  What I am seeking is that regulations would be brought in as soon as is practicable by the Minister after the passing of this Bill by both Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure consistency between authorities lest some authorities choose to act against the spirit of the legislation and drop payments to attract industry, as this certainly would be defeating the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Given the wide variety of the nature of discharges to sewers and the degree of treatment undertaken by sanitary authorities, it would not be feasible to make regulations which would provide for the determination of payments in respect of all the discharges of the country or which would impose uniform charges for such discharges.  Sanitary authorities already have powers to impose charges for effluent discharges to their sewers and these will not be restricted in any way by the provisions of the Bill.  Regulations are not, accordingly, a prerequisite for the imposition of these charges.  It should be remembered that any payment specified by a sanitary authority will form a condition of the licence issued under section 16 of the Principal Act and, accordingly, may be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  It would be my intention, however, to issue guidelines very shortly to local authorities on the manner in which such payments should be calculated taking into account the variations involved.</P>

    <P>This is an amendment to cover drafting points.  Section 16 (1) substitutes a new section for section 21 of the 1977 Act. Section 21 (1) as proposed to be inserted by section 16 of the Bill as drafted is superfluous as provision is already made in both sections 8 and 20, as substituted by this Bill, for appeals to be made to and determined by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>Section 21 (2) and (3) as proposed to be inserted by section 16 of the Bill are effectively restated in subsection (1) of the proposed amendment.  Section 21 (4) of the Bill is covered by section 21 (2) of the amendment &mdash; the references to sections 8 and 20 are deleted as superfluous. As these sections are being substituted by the Bill, they no longer contain references to &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 16 (2) of the amendment is identical to the provision in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands. The section does not interfere with the local authority's right to either issue a section 12 notice or to take enforcement proceedings against somebody who is conducting a pollution offence.  This section refers to the soliciting of information by the local authority and 14 days is given to the person from whom the information is sought to respond.  If somebody is involved in a pollution incident the local authority can initiate a prosecution and not delay the matter 14 days, or can give a direction that the pollution would stop.</P>

      <P>It seems that this section is substituting section 23 of the principal Act and I presume will be invoked where a local authority are concerned about substances going into the waters but are not sure what the substances are.  If so, the point Deputy Browne makes, a very valid point, is presumably if a local authority have a concern that discharges going into the water are of a polluting nature, a prompter response than 14 days should be required.  The section provides &ldquo;not less than 14 days&rdquo;.  It could be 21 or 25 days or whatever.  There may be circumstances where a local authority deem it necessary to hand deliver a letter to an industrial operation, an agricultural operation or a fish farming operation saying to them; &ldquo;Within 24 hours we want to know what you are putting into the waterways.&rdquo;  The local authority, well equipped, should be able to analyse what is going in anyway, but their concern is that if there is an urgent need to know what is going on the 14-day requirement here seems to constrain the local authority unnecesarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem that you could have a requirement which says that the local authority can require such information within 24 hours where necessary, or <Col N="213" /> longer.  &ldquo;Longer&rdquo; can mean one, two or three weeks.  There may not be a great concern but there may be a curiosity to find out what is happening.  The local authority might have carried out tests and discovered nothing particularly detrimental but, where a local authority is urgently seeking information, 14 days seems a rather odd restraint on the obtaining of that information and, where someone is polluting, gives them unnecessary leeway.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister's point that other sections deal with enforcement and that this is an information seeking section. Nevertheless, in seeking that information a local authority may need to get that information very rapidly to carry out remedial works or to put in place an operation to delimit the impact of a pollution incident.  We are concerned about the 14 days which, apparently, is the minimum period within which somebody can be required to respond.  They can be given longer but 14 days is a minimum. It seems a rather odd requirement in the type of circumstances that could arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a local authority know that a pollution incident has occurred or where there is a potential pollution problem they can invoke section 8 of the amending Bill which will allow them, if necessary, to get a High Court injunction to stop the pollution. The purpose of this section is simply to get information in relation to licences, the reviewing of licences or matters of that kind, or simply as a way of soliciting information in relation to discharges or whatever.  It is not intended to deal with a pollution incident.  That might satisfy Deputy Browne.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  the standards will incorporate as a minimum those specified in &ldquo;European Communities (Quality of Salmonid Waters) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. 293)&rdquo; and subsequent implementations of the standards set out in the EC Council Directive 78/659 &ldquo;On the quality of fresh waters needing protection or improvement in order to support fish <Col N="215" /> life' and the standards proposed in other EC directives relating to the quality of inland and marine waters.&rdquo;.  </P>
    <P>This is an amendment to section 26 of the principal Act which refers to the quality standards and the EC Directive of 1978 specifying standards for Salmonid and cyprinid waters.  Part of this directive was belatedly implemented in 1988.  We assume that these are the standards to be used for the purpose of the principal Act. The Bill before us, however, does not clarify this matter.  The remainder of the standards in the directive should be added to the statutory instrument by amendment as soon as possible, at least not later than six weeks.  We particularly feel that the biochemical oxygen demand standards should be properly implemented specifying that the limit is three milligrams per litre for salmonoid and six milligrams per litre for cyprinid.</P>
    <P>Ireland has managed to keep its environment much cleaner than other EC countries The directive specifies in Article 8 that the standards should not be used to allow an increase in pollution. This article in particular should immediately be incorporated into Irish law before it is too late.  This is a problem to which I will probably be referring many times in the House, that in many cases we are well below EC standards simply because of the lack of development of heavy industry.  There is a tendency to sit back and say that as long as we are below EC standards everything is all right.  It is not all right; if our standards are already well below those of the EC we should keep them that way.</P>
    <P>Such a statutory instrument, combined with Statutory Instrument 293 of 1988, should be specifically referred to in this Bill as the standards for the purposes of section 26 of the Principal Act.  We, therefore, demand that the Minister incorporate this extremely important subsection into section (18) of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite certain of the meaning of this amendment, nor its <Col N="216" /> purpose as it is not very clear.  Section 26 of the 1977 Act, which section 18 of the Bill seeks to amend, is a general enabling provision allowing the Minister to make regulations setting quality standards for waters, trade and sewage effluents and standards in relation to methods of treatment of such effluents.</P>
      <P>The relevance of the amendment proposed to standards of this range is not clear.  In any event, I would be opposed to anything which might restrict the existing powers to make high quality standards. If the Deputy is particularly concerned about adopting standards which have been set under EC Directives his concerns are unfounded.  Such directives usually incorporate as a standard feature a requirement obliging member states to transpose the provisions of the directive into national law.  Therefore, a specific requirement of this nature in relation to transposition is not needed in the Water Pollution Act.  Salmon can be found in almost every river in the country whereas in many other countries you cannot even find fish.  Our aim is to have all our waters designated as salmonid waters to try to reach the highest possible standards. That is the intention and the aim as far as possible.  Given the different standards necessary for waters, trade and sewage effluents and so on, the purpose of the Deputy's amendment is not clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister is not too clear on the purpose of my amendment.  I think the wording is clear. However, I accept that she is trying to ensure that as many rivers as possible will comply with the salmonid standards rather than the cyprinid standards as this is very important.  Perhaps the Minister will have another look at this amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 19, subsection (1) (a), line 17, after &ldquo;matter&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;first&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>Where trade effluent, sewage effluent or other polluting matter enters waters and causes injury, loss or damage to a person or to the property of a person, the person may, without prejudice to any other cause of action that he may have in respect of the injury, loss or damage, recover damages in any court of competent jurisdiction in respect of such injury, loss or damage&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  from the occupier of the premises from which the effluent or matter entered the waters unless the entry to the waters was caused by an act of God or an act or omission of a third party over whose conduct such occupier had no control being an act or omission that such occupier could not reasonably have foreseen and guarded against, or</P>
      <P>(b)  if the entry to the waters was occasioned by an act or omission of any person that, in the opinion of the court, constitutes a contravention by the person of a provision of the Principal Act or this Act, from that person.   </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment I am seeking to insert is in line 17 of the section and is to insert &ldquo;first&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;matter&rdquo; so that it will read &ldquo;from the occupier of the premises from which the effluent or matter first entered the waters&rdquo;.  The <Col N="218" /> Minister's amendment is to delete the words &ldquo;entered the waters&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;originated&rdquo;.  The concern here is basically to ensure that somebody could not be the subject of prosecution for polluting matter travelling through waters on their land when they are not responsible for the polluting matter being in the waters.  In other words, to take it in the agricultural context, if a river runs through the land of two farmers and if farmer A is engaging in bad farming practices and as a result seriously pollutes a river and farmer B is not at fault because the river simply flows through his land and carries the polluting matter through the land we want to make sure that farmer B could not be held responsible.  The fault lies with farmer A.  There is only a semantic difference between the amendment tabled by me and that tabled by the Minister.  They would both achieve exactly the same result.  They are both designed to ensure that the person who is responsible for allowing polluting matter to enter the waters is the person who can be held to be civilly liable under this section.  I assume, political life being as it is, the Minister will wish us to accept her amendment rather than her accepting my amendment.  I do not care which of the two amendments are accepted because they both achieve the same objective using different wording.</P>

      <P>I propose in amendment No. 28, in page 19, subsection (1) (a) line 17, to delete &ldquo;entered the waters&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;originated.&rdquo;  What Deputy Shatter has said is correct.  The purpose of my amendment is to clarify that only a party from whose premises or lands the cause of the pollution originated will be liable for damages under section 20.  On a literal interpretation of the Bill, as worded at present, a person who is not in any way responsible for pollution could be held liable for it simply because the pollution, though coming from another person's property or premises, managed to reach waters via that person's premises or property.  Clearly this was never the intention and the amendment is intended <Col N="219" /> to rule out the possibility of an innocent party being held liable for damages caused.  It is clear that Deputy Shatter is also concerned about the possibility of a miscarriage of justice.  However, we are advised that our amendment, from a drafting and legal point of view, is preferable and I would ask Deputy Shatter, given that he indicated his willingness to accept either amendment, to be agreeable to accept the wording &ldquo;originated&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;first.&rdquo;</P>

Deputy Shatter's amendment mentions the word &ldquo;first&rdquo;.  It is possible that a septic tank or a slurry pit could burst, the polluting material could flow over land and could first enter water on an innocent person's farm.  It is on that basis that the word &ldquo;originated&rdquo; was suggested.  Where the actual incident originated is where the offender is and <Col N="220" /> that is where the law should apply.  We are keen on the word &ldquo;originated&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;first&rdquo; because the pollution could enter the water first on an innocent person's farm even though the accident occurred elsewhere.</P>

      <P>In page 19, lines 26 to 30, to delete subsection (2). </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) of this section provides for an exclusion in respect of the bringing of proceedings to seek damages for pollution. It provides that subsection (1) does not apply to the entry of trade effluent, sewage effluent or other polluting matter to waters by virtue of anything specified in section 3 (5) or 4 (2), as may be appropriate, of the Principal Act or under and in accordance with a licence under section 4 of the Principal Act or section 171 of the Act of 1959.  I propose the deletion of this section.  I generally wanted to make a point on this subsection in that I take the view that if damage results from pollution, no matter where the pollution comes from, it should be possible to seek compensation for the loss suffered.  As I understand this subsection, <Col N="221" /> it means that if you pollute under licence you can never be liable for damages.</P>
    <P>It is the local authority who make the decision to issue a licence but in doing so they may be wrong.  The people who operate under licence still have a responsibility to ensure that what they do does not cause damage and the local authority also have such a responsibility. If a local authority wrongly issue a licence which allows pollution of a damaging nature to take place &mdash; of its nature pollution is damaging but a very small amount of pollution may have no great impact on waters or rivers &mdash; I do not believe the person who is licensed or the local authority should necessarily be immune from civil liability.  I tabled this amendment to delete the section, to give us an opportunity to tease out this issue, to get the Minister's response and to have on the record of the House an explanation as to the detailed thinking behind subsection (2).</P>

The effect of this amendment would be to extend the civil liability provision to situations and effluent discharges which are already outside the scope of the 1977 Act and of the Bill.  These situations and discharges are identified in section 3 (5) of the 1977 Act, as amended by the Bill, and in section 4 (2) of that Act.  They cater, for example, for discharges from vessels and marine structures to tidal waters, which are of course addressed under legislation which is the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine.  It would be wrong to interfere with this separate legal code through a provision of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed that only the farmer will be made civilly liable for pollution damage, However, subsection (2) will not have this effect.  The exclusions which are being provided for <Col N="222" /> are severely limited.  In the case of trade effluent discharges the industrialist will be required under section 3 (5) to have a discharge licence and to comply with its conditions.  Failure on either count will render him civilly liable for any damages or losses due to pollution caused.</P>
    <P>The procedure for granting licences to discharge effluent provides full opportunity for public participation in the process of determining conditions so that waters and their uses are protected.  The public may inspect licence applications and comment on them to the local authority concerned.  Should the local authority's decision on conditions be regarded as unsatisfactory any member of the public may appeal to An Bord Pleanála, which may grant an oral hearing of the issues involved before finally determining the conditions of the licence.  The outcome of this process may entail significant expenditure by the industrialist in providing treatment works to satisfy the conditions of the licence.  In these circumstances, I believe it would be unreasonable to impose a civil liability for any pollution caused while the effluent discharged complies with the licence conditions. The industrialist can hardly be blamed for any pollution in such cases.</P>
    <P>Should such cases arise the proper course to adopt would be for local authorities to avail of their powers, which are being extended by the Bill, to review the licence and impose more stringent conditions.  Failure to observe these would render the industrialist liable for pollution damage.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to local authority sewage discharges is very similar. Authorities will be civilly liable once standards for sewage effluent are set under section 26 of the 1977 Act should they fail to comply with them.  I consider that the amendment is seriously flawed for the reasons I have given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would pursue this matter further with the Minister.  Let us assume that a local authority impose stringent conditions for the issuing of a licence but the person seeking the licence appeals to An Bord Pleanála and they water down <Col N="223" /> the conditions.  In that case a licensee is operating and complying with conditions but nevertheless despite that fact they may be seriously polluting because the conditions are not stringent enough.  Perhaps An Bord Pleanála did not understand the technical information made available to them or perhaps they lacked the expertise to assess what conditions were necessary.  In recent years we have seen on occasions appalling decisions by An Bord Pleanála, appalling errors with regard to decisions made to affect the built environment.  Some of those decisions have resulted in compensation claims being lodged successfully against local authorities in two cases; some have resulted in appalling structures being put in place which offend the eye and probably despoil the built environment, but at least beyond that, they do not cause damage.  If An Bord Pleanála get it wrong here, a serious pollution incident could result and serious damage could be done.  If, for example, a farmer finds that his whole operation is rendered unviable because of the manner in which waters adjacent to his land have been polluted due to a failure in the licensing process, are we saying that because the person who caused that pollution incident complied with the requirements of the licence, albeit defective, he cannot be held civilly liable for the damage that has resulted?  Are we saying he is immune by virtue of the bad decision making perhaps by a local authority or An Bord Pleanála?  Are we saying that the person who has suffered loss will receive no compensation?  That is a serious question.  We are now giving An Bord Pleanála a new power.  As I said earlier, I welcome the idea of An Bord Pleanála dealing with this rather than the Minister, but that is subject to the proviso that An Bord Pleanála will have the necessary internal expertise to deal with these matters, and they may need additional staff and technical help in that context. I am sure the Minister will explain to us what additional resources will be provided to An Bord Pleanála so that <Col N="224" /> they can deal properly with these matters.</P>
      <P>The Minister is providing a blanket immunity from civil liability and I think that is a matter of concern.  I know the farming organisations have put it in a simpler way: they say the farmer can be prosecuted but the industrialist cannot. The issue is not as simple as that, but it is a serious issue.  I can see the possibility in two or three years time of myself, Deputy Gilmore, Deputy O'Shea, Deputy Garland or Deputy Browne rising in this House and yelling blue murder because some serious pollution incident has resulted from a failure of An Bord Pleanála to make the right decision and to impose the correct conditions, and the person who has been detrimentally affected &mdash; whether in agriculture, fish farming operations or in an industrial development that requires clear water &mdash; finds that he has no one he can turn to for compensation.  This is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>I am not saying the amendment I have tabled is necessarily right; it is a complicated issue and the simple deletion of the subsection may not resolve the problem, but it is an issue we need to think about and to address.  I do not think we have considered the problem in regard to the Bill in detail yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The way Deputy Shatter puts it it would be very serious if the licence conditions were such that they would lead to widespread pollution or that the conditions were being watered down by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the points the Deputy made are more relevant to the section dealing with the licence, the method of issue and the conditions attached.  In the context of the proposed environmental protection agency, it is the intention to give the agency powers in relation to the matter because there is a need to have uniform standards for water licences and air pollution licences.  The terms and conditions of many licences that never get near An Bord Pleanála can vary from one local authority to another.  If there is a problem in relation to the conditions of the licence <Col N="225" />&mdash; and I have no doubt that can happen &mdash; we must deal with it at the stage setting conditions for the licence rather than in the context of civil liability.  I think it would be unfair to a person who complied with the conditions imposed to make him civilly liable for a pollution incident.  The local authorities, under the power being given to them in this amending legislation will be able to review the licence and if there is a pollution incident to immediately carry out a review of the licence and impose additional conditions if necessary. The whole question of licensing, under this legislatin and the waste and air pollution legislation needs to be co-ordinated, standardised and updated by a body that is capable of imposing the kind of conditions that are necessary in the different circumstances,.  That function will be given to the proposed new environmental protection agency.  Perhaps we could tease the matter out more appropriately at that stage.  I do not think it would be fair in the context of the Bill to make somebody who has met all the conditions set by the legitimate licensing authority of the State, to make them civilly liable for damages.  I think the problems the Deputy is dealing with are of a different and much more fundamental nature and can more appropriately be dealt with in a different context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to those points.  We have a large number of local authorities who still do not have any great expertise in these areas.  At present an applicant applies for a licence and it may not occur to someone who is adjacent to the place to which the licence will relate to raise any objections.  The local authority may get their standards wrong or later on An Bord Pleanála may get their conditions wrong.  I do not accept what the Minister is telling us that if and when we have an environmental protection agency all this will be sorted out.  Less than a month ago we had a Bill before this House to establish such an agency which the Government voted against.  We keep hearing about the environmental protection agency Bill, which the Government will produce but no such <Col N="226" /> Bill is before the House as of yet.  I do not believe the Government will have such a Bill passed by the Oireachtas this side of the summer recess.  The Minister might surprise me by publishing the Bill this side of the summer recess but I certainly do not think it will be passed this side of the summer recess.</P>
      <P>If the Fine Gael Bill pushed the Government into dealing with this matter more quickly than they otherwise would have done, that is fine and I do not object to that.  What we have before us is the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill and we do not have an environmental protection agency.  I do not know when that legislation will go through.  We do not have the uniformity throughout the country the Minister is talking about, but even if we had I am not sure how the environmental protection agency would interact with the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála.  Certainly that is not particularly clear from the Government statements to date.  The role of the agency seems to be a moveable feast and the agency appears to have different functions depending on what day of the week and which Minister is talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that if someone who has complied with the terms of the licence causes a pollution incident they should not be liable for damages, because they had complied with the terms of the licence.  But the local authority should be able to change the terms of the licence, and of course, the legislation provides for a review of the licence, but that will not solve the problem of the person who suffered serious loss or damage.  Someone will have to pick up the bill for that in the area of civil liability.  If it is recognised under subsection (1) that it is reasonable that we have civil liability in certain instances, then the exclusions in subsection (2) are far too wide.  There are three people who could be held liable. The first of these is the person who causes the pollution regardless of whether they have complied with the terms of the licence.  If the pollution resulted because <Col N="227" /> the licensing conditions were not sufficiently secure and detailed it would be my view that civil liability should attach to the local authority as it is they who are ultimately responsible for issuing the licence.  This would ensure that the local authorities would take care and take into account expert advice in the issuing of licences.</P>
    <P>If An Bord Pleanála vary the original conditions imposed by the local authority so as, to use the phrase I used earlier, water them down or make them less stringent, which is the more correct phrase to use, should it not be An Bord Pleanála who should be held liable?  It would be unfair to attach liability to the polluter who was licensed to happily pollute away by An Bord Pleanála if his activities result in loss or damage.  If the polluter is not to be held liable it is the board or the local authority who should be held liable. Why should the innocent party who was not involved in the first place and who suffers a loss as a result of a pollution incident be left with no one to turn to for compensation with blanket immunity attaching to the polluter, the local authority and An Bord Pleanála?</P>
    <P>This would not make sense and I suspect it would be unconstitutional because the view that the State is immune from civil liability was overturned about 25 years ago by the courts.  In relation to this blanket immunity, I suspect that no matter what the section says An Bord Pleanála or the local authority might end up being properly sued by the person who suffers a loss because of their failure to impose stringent conditions.  If there is a residual right to seek compensation against the local authority or An Bord Pleanála we should deal with it in this legislation and not leave it to the judges to make a declaration following some appalling incident in the future when the local authority or An Bord Pleanála get it wrong.</P>
    <P>This is a serious issue.  If subsection (1) is required, as I believe it is, that blanket immunity should not apply.  It would mean of course there would be an incentive for those who seek licences not to <Col N="228" /> minimise the precautions they put in place to avoid pollution.  If they could ultimately be held liable if something serious occurs this would act as an incentive for them to take into account the precautionary principle of taking all reasonable action.  It may also delimit appeals.  Where local authorities impose stringent conditions there would be less of an incentive on the part of a person seeking a licence to appeal to An Bord Pleanála to have the stringency of those conditions reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this amendment has centred around cases which could arise following the issuing of a licence.  The intention behind subsection (2) is that the option of civil liability would not apply in a number of cases specified in the subsection.  It might be worthwhile going through these cases to see the extent to which civil liability is being limited.  The first section specified is section 3 (5) of the principal Act which I sought to delete on an earlier amendment. During the course of the debate on that amendment the Minister of State gave an undertaking that she would examine the amendment.  The House will recall that I made the point at that time that a number of activities are exempt from the general prohibition on entry of polluting matter to waters.  The ESB in carrying out certain works under the 1925 Act are exempt as are Bord na Móna, local authorities, harbour authorities under the Harbours Act or somebody operating under a licence made under the Foreshore Act or the Harbours Act.  I drew the attention of the Minister of State to my concern that under the legislation enacted in 1925, 1936, 1945, 1946 and 1949 those bodies are allowed to do literally what they like.  Obviously that legislation was drafted at a time when there was less public concern or information available about the danger of water pollution but nevertheless they empower those bodies to carry out very extensive works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is being proposed in section 20 (2) is that nobody would be entitled to take a civil action against any of those <Col N="229" /> bodies and nobody would be able to take an action against a person who pollutes water while doing a harbour infill under the Foreshore Act or the Harbours Act. Similarly a local authority, Bord na Móna and so on are all exempt.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) of the principal Act deals with exemptions in the licensing of trade and sewage effluents.  That subsection does not apply to discharges to tidal waters from vessels or marine structures, from a sewer or the subject of regulations under subsection (10).  Some concern has been expressed in the House about the possibility of pollution being caused as a result of the discharge of matter from ships.  If they cause pollution no civil action may be taken against them under this Bill.  As I understand it, section 171 of the 1959 Act is the section the fisheries boards have had most difficulty getting around when trying to pursue a local authority.  Therefore what is being proposed is not just the granting of exemptions to bodies who hold licences but the exempting of a range of activity which could result and which we know does result in the pollution of waters.  It is proposed that a third party would not be able to take a civil action.</P>
    <P>Farmers and farmer organisations, and Deputy Shatter referred to this, have expressed some concern that this legislation seems to be pointed at the farming community more than at any other section of the community.  If subsection (2) is left in the Bill farmers will have some grounds for complaint that they are being targeted more than those in any other area of economic, industrial or marine activity.  I sought the deletion of section 3 (5) of the principal Act in an earlier amendment for the same reasons that Deputy Shatter has advanced to seek the deletion of subsection (2).  For much the same reasons that he advanced, I had mixed feelings about whether that was the correct way to go about it but, in fairness, the Minister undertook to have a look at those exemptions between now and Report Stage.  This is a serious matter and the Minister should consider the exemptions.  If she does not do so and <Col N="230" /> Deputy Shatter presses his amendment, it is my intention to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to remember when talking about licences that the licence is a licence to discharge and not a licence to pollute.  I believe strongly that it is at the licence conditions stage that we must deal with the problems.  The review procedure which will follow the passing of the Bill will allow for that.  It would be unfair to make people who fulfil the conditions imposed on them by the statutory licensing authorities liable for anything that might occur.  The discharges that are licensed, particularly the toxic or dangerous discharges, are covered by the standards which are in place.  There are not that many dangerous or toxic substances discharged into our waters that could cause pollution.</P>
      <P>Let us take a different example.  If a person was given planning permission to construct a building and, following the completion of the work in accordance with the permission, it was considered that the building was ugly and did not comply with the conditions from an aesthetic or environmental point of view, would it be reasonable to ask that person to knock the building down?  Would it not be the fault of the planning authority that did not impose certain conditions in the first place?</P>
      <P>I do not think we can put unreasonable demands on people who are fulfilling the legitimate conditions imposed on them by a licensing authority.  Deputy Gilmore raised a point about exemptions generally and I should like to tell him that I agree there is a need to review them.  That will take some time.  I do not see any point in giving the list but it is important to bear in mind that the Minister has power under the Bill to review them.  The only circumstances where the exemptions should be continued are where they are absolutely necessary for the supply of a particular public utility that could not be provided without such exemptions.  Generally, the exemptions are given in the licences but there is a need to review them.  It is my view that that review should take place as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> I cannot accept the suggestion that we could make a person liable under civil law for an incident that occurred on foot of a legitimate licence held by an industrialist and so on.  However, I should like to give the point raised by Deputy Shatter some further thought.  He was concerned about the innocent victim and he asked from whom such a person could seek damages.  The House will recall the Hanrahan case where considerable damages were given to a farmer by the Supreme Court.  I am not advocating that people should have to go to the Supreme Court in order to obtain damages and for that reason there may be a need to consider that possibility.  I do not want, off the top of my head, to give a response to the point raised by Deputy Shatter but I consider it to be a valid one.  If it is the case that an innocent person was adversely affected or their livelihood put at risk as a result of an incident that might occur on foot of a legitimate licence we will have to give some thought to it between now and Report Stage.  The principle of simply making a person liable for a pollution incident that would occur on foot of a licence is rare.  I am not sure if it has happened.  It would be intolerable if licence conditions were so lax as to allow that to happen because the purpose of the licence is to allow a discharge but not to allow pollution.  The purpose of having a licensing system is to avoid pollution and to control discharges to waters by legitimate authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now headed into something that I was about to suggest to her as an illustration of the problem we are facing.  Let us take the Hanrahan case as an example.  In that case the family alleged that air emissions resulting from a particular operation in the Merck Sharp and Dohme plant were having a serious impact on their farm, their cattle and their health.  Various State bodies, the local authority, the Department of Agriculture and others carried out assessments and reported back that none of this was the fault of <Col N="232" /> Merck Sharp and Dohme.  The Hanrahans litigated through the courts and eventually the Supreme Court found that what was happening to them on their farm was the fault of Merck Sharp and Dohme and they were entitled to compensation.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the assessments carried out by the different State bodies let us assume that Merck Sharp and Dohme had been operating under a licence issued under the Air Pollution Act and the State bodies said that there was no problem, that this was a figment of the Hanrahans' imagination.  Let us assume that we have a plant like that the Merck Sharp and Dohme which is operating a process which requires the issuing of a licence to discharge into waters.  Let us assume that the State body, be it the local authority or An Bord Pleanála issue the licence and attaches whatever conditions they regard as appropriate for the discharge in the light of what they know of the process being carried out by the concern.  Again, let us assume that that process is not one that people worldwide are very familiar with, that it is a new chemical or a new pharmaceutical process and that it is believed that the licence conditions attached will ensure that the discharges do not result in pollution.  Let us assume that downstream a farmer complains that his cattle are dying because they have been drinking water out of that stream and the State body, as in the Hanrahan case, carry out a check and are of the view that the complaint is a figment of the farmer's imagination and that the operation has not caused the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the difference between the position of that farmer, following the coming into force of the provisions of this Bill, and the Hanrahans' is that that farmer cannot litigate through the courts and establish that the cattle on this farm died as a result of discharges into the waters.  If the Hanrahan v. Merck Sharp and Dohme case had arisen in the context of Merck Sharp and Dohme having been issued with an air pollution licence which gave them an immunity from civil liability, the Hanrahans would not have succeeded in their claim.  I welcome the <Col N="233" /> Minister's response to my earlier remarks, that she wishes to have a look at the problem between now and Report Stage.  There is a serious problem involved.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have in analysing legislation is that one can come up with all sorts of potential scenarios that are more in the realm of fiction than reality.  On occasions there is a temptation for those on the Opposition benches to do that in an effort to make life more difficult for the Minister of the day.  I do not believe in that approach. The Minister hit home base on the problem when she referred to the Hanrahan case because that was a classical example of all State bodies getting it wrong but, fortunately, that family were eventually able to prove their case through the courts and, as a result, will ultimately get damages.  I do not believe we can be certain that in issuing licences through local authorities, through An Bord Pleanála or through the fictitious environment protection agency that no doubt one day will see the light of day, we will always get it right.  If that sort of incident does result someone must be liable to pay compensation.  If we retain subsection (2) in the Bill as it is and enact this legislation there will be a blanket immunity, an immunity, incidentally, that may be constitutionally unsound &mdash; I only say &ldquo;may&rdquo; because there is always the possibility that the courts could uphold it.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that if the Minister is willing to look at this amendment again in the context of our coming back on Report Stage I will not press the proposal to delete subsection (2) at this stage.  I hope the Minister will take the view that the discussion we have had on this section is a serious discussion designed to improve the Bill and deal with the problem that arises under it.  I would say to the Minister, because of the nature of that problem, that unless she comes forward with an appropriate amendment to deal with it on Report Stage we will be pressing the issue on this side of the House to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be as <Col N="234" /> helpful as I can and I want the legislation to be as reasonable as possible.  I want to ensure that if there is a situation, albeit very rare, where somebody's livelihood could be put at risk, obviously one would have to look at this issue.  If natural justice cannot deal with the problem there may be a need to do something else.  Without making any particular promise I will have the matter examined, I will take advice in relation to it and I will, if possible, come back on Report State.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (2) (a), line 47, to delete &ldquo;make&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;prepare draft&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The amendments tabled here are designed to tackle a problem which arises under section 21 as originally drafted. This section lays down extensive provisions for local authorities to make by-laws that could directly impinge, in a dramatic way, on the ordinary running of a farm.  By-laws can become legally binding under this section and render a person liable to criminal prosecution and conviction without any consultative process having to be engaged in as regards the content of the by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments I propose to this section provide for the making of draft by-laws which would first have to be published for public comment and, 60 days after their publication, could be approved by the Minister for the Environment, subject to amendments, following his <Col N="235" /> considering representations made to him by any person or body who wishes to make representations &mdash; and also in the context of any comments made by the water pollution advisory council, though that looks as if it will not have a very long life because the Government intend to abolish it.  That is in section 30.  Following the approval of the draft by-laws the amendment proposes that they then be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that they do not become operative unless approved by each House.  This would radically change the provisions in the present Bill and provide protections in the area of agriculture that are not contained in the Bill as published while also enabling by-laws to be made to provide protection against water pollution.</P>
    <P>One of the curiosities about this section is that following the by-laws being made a person who contravenes them can be guilty of an offence.  However, after they are made they have to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, notice of their making, the area to which they apply and the place where copies may be purchased or inspected has to be published in newspapers. The procedure appears to be that the local authority send draft by-laws to the Minister and he approves them.  If anybody is in breach of the by-laws they commit a criminal offence but having made them they can be advertised in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Persons aggrieved can then complain to the Minister and try to have the by-laws amended.  That struck me as being a very peculiar process.  It struck me that a better approach was one whereby the local authority initially engaged in a consultative process and that thereafter the by-laws would go to the Minister and he would consider representations made and then the by-laws could be made.  It is only after the consultative process and after the by-laws had been made that one could be liable for a criminal offence.  It seemed to be putting the cart before the horse to suggest that the by-laws could be secretly made between a local authority and the Minister and brought into being to create criminal offences, only at that stage <Col N="236" /> would they be circulated in the area and people notified and that after that they could be amended.</P>
    <P>The purpose of having the by-laws laid before the Oireachtas, which is an unusual procedure, in relation to by-laws was to allow this House, because of the importance of these by-laws and the manner in which they may affect the agricultural community and because of the danger that the by-laws would be based on a lack of understanding of ordinary farming practices, to at least review initially the by-laws before they would become law.  It is far too simple to lay down in by-laws that in particular months, particular practices are allowed in a particular area and in other months they are not allowed.  The reason it cannot be laid down in that way is that particular practices that are likely to cause pollution or create problems may depend on one very simple thing, over which none of us has any control, the weather.  In wet periods, for instance, it may not be environmentally sound to engage in certain farming activities while in dry periods that may pose no danger. The weather has become so variable that I am not sure that by-laws of the nature the Minister envisages may be made under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The amendments I propose to this section are to provide a more logical legislative framework, to provide initially for the consultative process and, in effect, the making of by-laws and to provide for the bringing into being then of the criminal offence.  I circulated those amendments around this time last year in the hope that the Department would have a look at them in advance and then, if not to take on board exactly what I was proposing, to come back with a more logical and a more sensible framework than that contained in the section as originally published.  In fairness to the Minister she has done that.  The Minister's amendments would operate in a slightly different way from mine in the sense that the by-laws would not have to be brought into this House to be approved.  There is now the consultative process in the context of the Minister's amendments in <Col N="237" /> advance of the by-laws and that is a far more logical approach.  In that context, and subject to what the Minister has to say about the amendments she is tabling to deal with this section, we on this side may be prepared to withdraw our amendments and to accept those tabled by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment proposes to empower the local authority to prepare draft by-laws on their own initiative or at the Minister's direction and establish related procedural arrangements.  The by-laws could not be made until the Minister had given his approval and the by-laws were approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  This procedure is totally necessary for the making of by-laws intended to be used by local authorities to control specified agricultural activities in their own functional areas.  It is similar to having every licence issued by a local authority under the Water Pollution Act made subject to a positive resolution by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  These amendments are unacceptable and if adopted would give rise to unnecessary formality, inflexibility and possible delays in the making of by-laws.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat astonished at the amendments from both Deputy Shatter and the Minister.  In many ways the Minister's amendments are all the more remarkable in that they almost negative the entire thrust of section 21 which is one of the best features of the Bill.  The section enables a local authority, where it sees a pollution threat in or near a river or lake, to make by-laws to prohibit or restrict such activity or to ensure that certain types of works are carried out.  The section would mean that a local authority could make by-laws prohibiting or limiting the use of certain pesticides, fertiliser, manures, animal slurry, silage effluent and so on.  We have been told of the extent to which silage effluent, slurry and so on have caused pollution and of the dangers of them for rivers and lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think from Deputy Shatter <Col N="238" /> that the local authority in making by-laws acted like a secret society and that the first the unfortunate farmer would hear of them would be when they were published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> I do not know what circulation <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> has but I do not imagine that too many farmers are regular readers of it.  It is far more likely that a proposal by a local authority to make by-laws for the control of any activity in any area liable to pollution would be widely publicised in local newspapers, or on local radio and so on.  It is very likely that members of the local authority who would represent the area would be aware of the by-laws and would make their constituents aware of them.  It is also likely that many members of the local authority might well be the people who would be affected by the by-laws.  I have never come across a case where a local authority made by-laws and the first the public became aware of them was when they read about them in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> That is nonsense.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 21 enable the local authority to take action in order to protect watercourses from pollution.  The by-laws proposed by the local authorities would have to have the approval of the Minister.  After they are made there is provision for appeal against them.  What both Deputy Shatter and the Minister are proposing is to turn that around and allow an appeal against the by-laws before the by-laws are made.  Have we not already had one example of that type of thing under the Air Pollution Act in relation to the making of smoke control areas orders?  In that case, effectively the legislation has been frustrated by people appealing to the Minister.  What is intended here is precisely the same thing.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that this was one of the sections of the Bill that drew the attention of the IFA.  I am interested to note that the amendments proposed by Deputy Shatter are virtually word for word as drafted by the IFA.</P>

      <P>Whoever drafted them, the thinking is coincidental.  They are the same as the amendments which have been circulated by the IFA to their members.</P>
      <P>I am curious about amendment No. 38 where Deputy Shatter is saying that not only will we have this process of appeal but that the by-laws will have to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for their approval.  Can one imagine a set of by-laws proposing to prohibit farmers in an area from using a certain kind of pesticide or fertiliser having any chance of getting through this House?  It is not a runner.  The net effect of the amendments being proposed by Deputy Shatter and the Minister is to frustrate the operation of section 21 of the Bill so that it will not be possible for local authorities to make by-laws to restrict certain types of agricultural activity.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk in this House in relation to legislation dealing with local government.  We repeatedly hear of the desirability of giving local authorities more power.  This legislation would give local authorities the power to make by-laws which would respond to the democratic wishes of the local authorities concerned.  That is what the general thrust of the section provides for.  Effectively the Minister's amendments and Deputy Shatter's amendments undermine that.  One might as well not have in the section an enabling power for local authorities to make by-laws.  One might as well give the power to the Minister in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowing what Deputy Shatter describes as a consultative process, is opening up the whole question of the making of by-laws to political influence.  It is remarkable to listen to Deputy Shatter making a case for the Minister to have the final say in the making of by-laws.  On an earlier section in this Bill to which Deputy Garland had an amendment which would allow for a certain process <Col N="240" /> of appeal to the Minister, Deputy Shatter made the point that that would lead to the politicisation of the legislation, and I agreed with him.  If that was the case in relation to particular kinds of appeal, surely it is also the case in relation to this issue.  In effect what we have here is a core piece of the legislation which enables local authorities to make by-laws to protect the waters in their areas.  There is now virtual competition between the Minister and Deputy Shatter to see which of them will most effectively articulate the position required by the IFA.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing, albeit very briefly, to this motion on the housing crisis.  I must say I do not do so with any great degree of optimism having read the Minister for the Environment's statement in this morning's papers.  Unfortunately this statement would seem to indicate that anything which has been said by the Opposition parties in this House during the course of the debate on this Private Members' motion will be to no avail whatsoever.  The Minister for the Environment seems to be turning a deaf ear to the concerns and suggestions which are being made by Members on this side of the House in regard to the very serious problem in the area of local authority public housing.</P>
      <P>It never fails to amaze me how the Minister for the Environment has stood over the neglect in regard to the public capital programme and local authority starts and completions since he became Minister.  The Minister for the Environment seemed to take pride in the fact that perhaps 1,250 houses will be completed this year.  The Minister does not seem to realise that this will go nowhere near satisfying the crisis which exists in every local authority area.  The waiting lists are growing on a daily basis yet the Minister seems happy to gallivant around the country without taking any notice of the urgency of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 12 months ago the Minister requested all the local authorities to make out new housing lists.  The local authorities were instructed to go into new and serious detail in these lists which they had not been asked for before in order to ensure that the housing lists available <Col N="242" /> were genuine and nobody was on them who might be capable of housing themselves. To the best of my knowledge each local authority compiled with the request from the Minister for the Environment and the staff in the local authorities went about their work in the hope that what they were doing would be of assistance to the Department of the Environment and, in particular, to the Minister for the Environment when he was making the case at Cabinet to satisfy the demand which exists at present.  Unfortunately it seems the Minister for the Environment either did not carry the brief to the Cabinet table or did not have the interest to carry the brief to the Cabinet table because yet again he has provided a miserable amount of money to build houses in 1990.  As Minister for the Environment he is overseeing the most deplorable effort &mdash; if one could call it an effort &mdash; to satisfy the requirements of people who are not capable of housing themselves.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was said that there were empty apartments and houses in various parts of Dublin city.  It would appear that this situation has now changed and the waiting lists in the Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire Corporation areas are building up.  The lists are building up daily throughout the country.  It is not good enough to say that these lists are artificial because of the work that has been done in the past 12 months.  I know from my experience as a member of Kerry County Council that their lists were prepared with great diligence. The staff took pride in going through the lists and interviewing every applicant to ensure that the housing lists now drawn up consist only of people who are in need of housing and who require the Department of the Environment and the local authorities to provide housing for them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the pleas from the local authorities are falling on deaf ears.  The Minister for the Environment would want to come to his senses very quickly and realise he is now sowing the seeds of a crisis in relation to housing.  If he continues with what he is doing at present it will be too late to do anything in three <Col N="243" /> years time because the problem will be so grave that it will be impossible to catch up with it within a four to five year period. If the Minister takes action now there is some possibility that he will be able to deal with the situation.  I urge the Minister for the Environment to listen to what is being said by reasonable people on this side of the House and to take note that he will be faced with a serious housing crisis.  Now is the time for him to take action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleague for allowing me a few minutes to put two points in relation to this most important subject on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>I regard it as the prime responsibility of a Minister for the Environment to shelter the people of the country.  I think that has been the view of successive Ministers for the Environment since the foundation of the State.  A roof over one's head has always been an important part of the Irish psyche and an important need.  This Minister has failed in his obligation to meet that responsibility placed on him.  Local authority members have always felt that their prime and first duty was to act as a housing committee.  They have been robbed of the opportunity to properly serve the people who put them into local authorities because of a lack of resources in the past three years.</P>
      <P>I want to focus in on one list.  The dire situation which exists throughout the country was spelt out in detail by other Members last night and will be spelt out again in further contributions tonight.  I want to focus on one element of the housing crisis which exists, that is, the crisis which exists for those who applied for non-family type accommodation.  It is primarily the elderly who have sought such accommodation and who are now waiting on housing lists.  I want to concentrate on the situation in my town of Wexford which is very well known to the Minister of State who has visited it many times in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the requirement of his Department Wexford Corporation submitted <Col N="244" /> the housing list for non-family type applications to the Minister.  One hundred and fourteen people on that list are seeking non-family type housing in the town of Wexford.  These include elderly people who have no prospect whatsoever of being housed because the Government have not built enough family-type houses or flats for the past three years.  Nobody has been housed or even put on a priority list since 1987 and the people on the 1987 list present themselves at politicians clinics asking for any news about the prospect of alleviating their dire situation.  I want to say to the Minister that nothing is more harrowing, so frustrating and hurtful for elderly people who have served this State all their lives than to have to present themselves at clinics begging for shelter.  It is very hurtful to see them looking at the obituary lists to see if an elderly person in a housing estate or local authority housing has died.  They then come to me and my colleagues on Wexford Corporation asking if there is any prospect, now that so-and-so is dead, that they might have moved up a notch or two on the housing list.  Many on that list have gone to their reward year after year.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does nothing else as a result of this debate I plead with him to look at the housing lists of people who are seeking non-family type accommodation and at the requirements of the elderly. Even if the Minister ignores those people whose situation has been described as dire and who have no prospect of purchasing their own houses because mortgage rates, interest rates and house prices are too high he should at least provide relief for the elderly.  Younger people will live for many years and may overcome their difficulties but the aged in their twilight years need redress now.</P>
    <P>I make this one plea to the Minister in the couple of minutes I have been given and hope it will not fall on deaf ears.  Let me conclude by saying one thing &mdash; and it is not a quotation from me but from an independent member of Wexford Corporation who has written the definitive history of Wexford Corporation: &ldquo;The present Minister for the Environment is <Col N="245" /> the worst in the history of the State because of his record on housing&rdquo;.  He has an opportunity now to redress that appalling record of neglect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion and to refute a few allegations that have been thrown around by Opposition spokesmen.  In particular I would like to talk about the progress we have made in recent years in local authority housing, in voluntary housing and generally in providing decent housing for the poorer sectors of our community.</P>
      <P>Deputies are by now well aware of the changed circumstances of the local authority housing programme.  By September 1989 waiting lists were down over one third to 19,400 with waiting periods almost halved compared to the position at the start of the decade.  Indeed, if we were comparing like with like in regard to waiting lists the decline in the numbers would have been even greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the decline in the overall level of needs, the housing prospects of all applicants have improved in recent years and applicants who previously had little or no prospect of obtaining local authority accommodation are now being housed.  Many applicants still on waiting lists have declined reasonable offers of accommodation and are waiting for accommodation in a particular location. Against this background of falling waiting lists it would have been wrong to maintain the local authority housing programme at the level of previous years.  Building local authority houses that were not needed at the time would have been a total waste of taxpayers' money.  As I said, at 30 September last some 19,400 approved applicants were seeking local authority housing.  This represented a small increase on the 1988 figures but one <Col N="246" /> cannot make a direct comparison because of the 1989 figures were compiled on a much more comprehensive basis as required by the Housing Act, 1988, and categories of need such as homeless persons must be included on the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The total capital available to local authorities this year for their housing programmes is £51 million and this is an increase of almost £13 million or 34 per cent on expenditure on the programme last year.  Of this amount, £33 million will be available for the provision of additional houses.  This represents an increase of over 50 per cent on last year's expenditure of £21.7 million and reverses the trend of previous years where the capital allocation provided to the programme was reduced each year since 1984.</P>
    <P>This year the local authority housing programme will be financed from local authority capital receipts of £45 million &mdash; plus Exchequer grants amounting to £6 million.  These internal capital receipts are largely made up from the sale of local authority housing because the first claim on these capital receipts should be the provision or improvement of local authority accommodation and not as in the past the provision of house purchase loans.  There is a ready source of funding for these loans in the Housing Finance Agency.  The new arrangements will not, of course, affect the low income house purchasers who must rely on local authority loans.  Adequate funding for these loans will be available in 1990 and will be financed through the Housing Finance Agency instead of through the capital receipts of the housing authorities.</P>
    <P>The great advantage of the new arrangements introduced in 1990 is that it has made it possible to increase the capital for the local authority housing programme by over one third without increasing Exchequer borrowing or taxation. This increase would have been very difficult to achieve if the entire burden was falling on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In distributing the overall allocation of £51 million for local authority housing in 1990 it was necessary to ensure that the allocations to individual authorities reflected the actual identified needs. <Col N="247" /> Since the capital receipts of local authorities did not correspond with these allocations it was necessary to redistribute some capital from those authorities that were in surplus to those that were short. The Exchequer road grants were used as the most convenient way by which these transfers could be effected.  It will not affect actual expenditure on either roads or the local authority housing programme. Overall the sum involved in this swap is £3.8 million.  I want to stress that this arrangement does not, as Deputy Shatter alleged last night, mean directing housing money to expenditure on roads.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford referred to the need for individual rural cottages in many areas.  In 1990 there has been an important change in the procedures governing the local authority housing programme. This year local authorities can decide themselves what houses to build within their overall allocation.  If the local authority wish to concentrate on the provision of rural cottages I or my Department will not object.  In any event, the Department's policy in recent years has been to discourage the provision of large scale estates and I know that Deputies and local authorities support this idea.</P>
    <P>The rehousing of the tenants of Sheriff Street flats by Dublin Corporation was raised in this debate.  Last May the corporation were asked to prepare an outline plan to provide for the rehousing of the tenants in the locality, and to the greatest extent possible within the parish of St. Laurence O'Toole, with the long-term and elderly tenants getting special consideration in this regard.</P>
    <P>The plan is still awaited by the Department. The delays which have occurred in Dublin Corporation since the decision last May to rehouse the tenants are difficult to understand.  When the matter came before the housing committee their decision was to set up another committee which is still considering the matter with little evidence of progress.  I also understand that the housing committee decided that special funding should be provided exclusively for the rehousing of the Sheriff Street residents.  This, in fact, is what <Col N="248" /> the Minister has done in the 1990 allocation.</P>
    <P>This year's housing capital allocation to the corporation set aside £1 million to enable the construction, and/or purchase, of 60 houses for rehousing the Sheriff Street tenants to commence.  On the basis of performance to date, I am satisfied that the allocation will be sufficient to meet expenditure on the programme this year.  It is not intended to meet the full cost of 60 houses as was suggested by Deputy Doyle.  On a positive note, I understand that outline proposals for an initial development, in the parish of St. Laurence O' Toole, of 22 houses for senior citizens living in the flats complex will be submitted shortly.  There will be no delay in considering any such proposal.</P>
    <P>The first response of a housing authority to the needs of a homeless person is to provide accommodation directly. However, housing authorities now have power to arrange voluntary or private accommodation for homeless persons. My Department meet 80 per cent of the costs incurred by authorities in providing accommodation for homeless persons other than in the authorities own rented housing stock and the provision for these payments has been increased to £600,000 in 1990.  As already indicated by the Minister in this debate, the operation of the arrangements to deal with the problem of homelessness will be reviewed this year.  We have had the benefit of the experience gained to date by all concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to remedial and improvement works for local authority housing, the Deputies are no doubt aware of the many major schemes which are being undertaken by local authorities countrywide. Under the terms of the remedial works scheme, altogether to date some £47 million has been made available to local authorities.  In 1989 £13.5 million was spent and a provision of £15 million has been made for this year.  These allocations have allowed authorities to undertake a significant programme of work and the good effects are very obvious in the estates that are benefiting <Col N="249" /> under the scheme.  In 1990 local authorities will undertake remedial work in some 75 estates.</P>
    <P>I notice that one of the Opposition amendments calls for the immediate sanction of all housing schemes in the Department.  This is simply not on.  It would lead to chaos and waste of funds as the entire programme would go out of control.  It is necessary that regard be had to the relative priorities and the available resources in order that properly managed, cost-effective programmes are implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government have greatly expanded their provision of voluntary housing particularly for categories such as elderly persons and the homeless.  In 1987 only 150 units of accommodation were provided by voluntary housing organisations.  Last year an additional 385 units of accommodation were provided by these organisations under the scheme of assistance operated by my Department. This year I expect some 500 more units of accommodation will be provided under this scheme.  This is an enormous programme in a few short years and it has been possible only because this Government have been making generous capital assistance available to the voluntary organisations who provide housing mainly for homeless and elderly persons.  In fact, the capital provided by the Government for the voluntary housing scheme has increased from £2 million in 1986 to over £9 million this year.  That is a very big improvement and I think nobody can deny that.</P>
    <P>In 1982 I set up the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly.  The task force include representatives of St. Vincent de Paul, ALONE, local authorities, the Departments of the Environment, Health and Social Welfare, and FÁS, and provide an emergency programme to improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit accommodation.  A provision of £2 million has been made for the scheme this year.  Under the scheme assistance is available for necessary repairs to make dwellings habitable for the lifetime of the occupant, repairs to chimneys and <Col N="250" /> fireplaces, provision of water and sanitary facilities, provision of food storage facilities, etc., and all at no cost to the occupant of the dwelling.  Since 1982 it is estimated that about 14,000 cases have been helped under this very worthwhile and effective scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear at the outset that the administration of the 1989 tenant purchase scheme for the sale of flats is a matter for the individual local authorities and solely for them.  Do not blame the Department of the Environment.  They gave the scheme over to the local authorities, and Deputies should know that. Let them not blame the Minister or the Department of the Environment for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to add a few sentences to what has been said.  There has been a change in the housing situation in the past three years in that new emphasis has been placed on clearing up some of the existing problems that were there mainly in the area of refurbishment.  I was disappointed last night to hear somebody here claiming this was purely for system-built houses and houses with felt roofs.  It was not confined to these areas.  I say to Deputy Howlin it is grand to come in here and make an emotive plea for the elderly and say how badly off they are and that a small number of them need housing.  I tell him we have 548 houses in Cork City alone between 80 and 100 years old, all designated for the elderly and nearly all in atrocious condition because they were ignored by successive administrations up to two years ago.</P>
      <P>We were told last night by Deputy Quinn not to hurl figures across the Chamber but this has happened again tonight.  The money that has been used in just Cork city last year and this year would have built 240 new houses at a cost of £30,000 apiece.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very deliberate and careful choice to diversify into refurbishment.  As in Dublin, hundreds of flats and houses in Cork were locked up because people would not go into them.  More important, there were people living in accommodation that could not be described as anything better than hovels in many cases.  I thought the day of water and the toilet out in the yard for 70 year old and <Col N="252" /> 80 year old people was gone, but it was not gone.</P>

We were told not to hurl figures, but I was one of those who stood up in the City Council Chamber in Cork in 1986 to congratulate the then Minister of State, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, because we had been given £60,000 for refurbishment. That was 1986-87.  I had the decency to stand up and congratulate him because it was a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>Compare that with £3 million this year for refurbishing.  I emphasise again the 548 houses for the elderly.  We should not have waited until this year or last year to start work on them.  All the other areas have been covered, but the important thing is the document referred to last night, the 1988 Housing Act.  For the first time an honest approach has been taken to counting the persons who need housing.  Section 9 of that Act allows local authorities to count people locked up in institutions because they could not get a house.  That has been happening for the last 30 or 40 years and now people are counted and are on the list and we are no longer hiding from the real figure.  We are now saying that we will count these people and we will also include the homeless who were not counted previously because they did not have a permanent address.  We are now getting a proper figure on which we are willing to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a short contribution to this very important debate which focuses on the whole question of local authority housing.  We will continue to try to reduce the waiting lists which have been in existence for a very long time. Indeed, people have been on housing lists for eight, ten or 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night Deputy Shatter said that people had been on housing lists for 12 to 15 months and that is an improvement on the situation which pertained even eight years ago.  It would be easy to deal with these lists if we were to go back <Col N="254" /> to the housing policy which pertained during the years of the Coalition Government of 1982-87.  It would be very easy to fund a local authority housing policy if we were to throw money at tenants in local authority houses to encourage them to leave those houses and to move into the private sector.  That is what occurred in the years referred to by Deputy Shatter and it was not a genuine local authority housing policy because we are now picking up the casualties &mdash; and have been &mdash; for the last number of years.  People were enticed from their local authority homes into the private sector, they took on substantial loans and mortgages and found it impossible to keep up the repayments. Those same people, in increasing numbers over the past couple of years, are coming back on local authority housing lists.  It is not an answer or a way in which we can in future deal with waiting lists in so far as local authority housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>A debate like this should challenge the reasons for elderly people coming on our housing list.  Society should spell out the reasons for elderly people being, to some extent, driven from their own homes because of social conditions, not because of overcrowding or bad housing.  They are being driven on to local authority housing lists in some cases because the old way in which families supported their elderly mother or father or relative in their own homes seems to have vanished. We should challenge that area and we should also challenge why very young single mothers are coming on the housing list.  I take the view that those people should be given an opportunity to be accommodated within their own family and perhaps the local authority could provide some funding to enable an additional room to be built.</P>
    <P>We should not expand our housing lists by having our senior citizens driven to it because of social conditions; the young unmarried mothers should not be driven to the list either by their own families because of some strange reason I do not understand.  We must debate the issue in this House fully and rationally so that we can get down to the basis of what a <Col N="255" /> genuine local authority housing list should be concerned with.  The days of building huge local authority housing estates are over.  The community which I represent do not want such developments any more.  Certain parts of Dublin county were used by other local authorities to solve their housing problems by coming into the county, taking a huge tract of land, building substantial local authority housing estates but then failing to deliver on the infrastructural requirements needed in those developments.  We have had experience of that in Dublin and I am sure the same situation applies round the country.  None of us is suggesting that we should build those kind of estates any more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the housing policy of this Government.  I wish to remind him that in 1989 the local authority, of which he is a member, had the option from the Minister to go into the marketplace and purchase houses.  All the moneys available from the Minister for that purpose were not taken up during 1989 and the current report from the Minister refers to this fact.  Dublin County Council failed to utilise all the moneys made available to them in 1989 for the purchase of houses in the private sector.  That is a reflection on the local authority and I must remind Deputy Shatter that that is the case.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see a return to a situation where applicants are driven into areas in which they do not want to reside. This is a very important &mdash; indeed crucial &mdash; part of housing policy.  We can no longer build local authority houses in areas which are unacceptable to applicants. This issue caused a serious problem in Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation.  We had a large number of houses lying empty while, at the same time, there were reasonably substantial waiting lists because applicants expressed an opinion as to where they wished to live and refused to accept an offer of a house in a different area within the same local authority.  That puts into perspective the genuineness of the so-called waiting lists.  We must challenge all these <Col N="256" /> issues in determining what our local authority housing policy will be in the years ahead.  Unless we resolve these difficulties then we will not plan the provision of local authority accommodation properly.</P>
    <P>We cannot reduce waiting lists by encouraging people to own their own homes by moving into the private sector, as happened in the past.  That is not an option because it has extremely destructive consequences for local authority areas.  One need travel no further than my constituency of Dublin south-west to see where communities, comprised entirely of local authority housing, were completely and totally wrecked by a failed policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>During the divorce referendum the present Minister for the Environment was very vocal about the <Col N="257" /> need to protect the family.  The family, we are told, is the basic unit of society. The rights of the family are guaranteed in the Constitution.  The Minister has sincerely held strong views on the protection of the family.  The Government's housing policy, over which the Minister is presiding, is doing far more damage to the fabric of family life in this country than the Minister's worst fears for divorce could have done.  In my constituency young families cannot buy their own homes because houses are too dear; they cannot get local authority loans to buy houses because of the new restrictions brought in by the Government and they cannot rent local authority houses because they are not available.  Good rented accommodation in the private sector is too expensive and even bad accommodation is often closed to families with children.</P>
      <P>In a debate like this there is a tendency to talk in numbers of house starts and of the millions of pounds in the housing capital programme.  I would like to talk about the human dimension of the problem and to tell the Minister of the young married couples to whom I spoke six and 12 months ago and who are now coming back to tell me they have separated because they could no longer take the strain of living in grossly over-crowded conditions with their in-laws.  I want to tell the Minister about the young couple from Shankill with two children, living in a rented flat in Bray which has no hot water and in which they share a toilet on the landing with other tenants.  The husband works in Shankill and the wife moves back to her mother during the day with their two young children.  They are about 30th on the south county housing list in Dublin which was drawn up last August and from which only six people have been housed to date.  They were, however, made an offer of housing and this perhaps gets back to the point made earlier by the Minister, but it was in Tallaght. I do not know how well the Minister knows the geography of Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I would like him to explain how somebody who works in Shankill, without their own means of transport, would be able to travel from Tallaght.  The last family to be housed in Dún Laoghaire Borough had 59 points.  I would like the Minister to consider the case of another family &mdash; a husband, wife and two children &mdash; with 34 points.  Over the past two years they have paid over £50 a week for a damp, mouldy basement flat which was rat infested and depressing. They have just left that flat and moved back in with the wife's family.  The wife shares a room with her sister and the two children and the husband sleeps on a couch downstairs.  What is the Minister's prognosis for the married life of this young family?  What message does he have for the woman who suffers from osteoporosis, a condition which involves brittleness of the bones and internal bleeding, and whose five year old daughter suffers from the same ailment?  They do not appear at all on the Minister's statistics.  They are not even on the list of 20,000 who are waiting for houses because they have a flat from the corporation. This five year old child can never go out to play because if she falls on the concrete environment of the flat complex her bones could break and she could suffer internal bleeding.  Her parents want a transfer to a house with a garden so that on sunny summer days their little girl does not have to stay inside, looking out the window at her friends at play.  I know Dún Laoghaire Corporation consider this to be a priority but they have no house to give these people.</P>
      <P>There is also the single parent who works in Loughlinstown Hospital and needs a place nearby because she has to start work at 7 a.m. There is the family who live in a 12 ft. by 5 ft. partitioned-off section of their parents' kitchen.  I do not single out these cases to suggest that they are more important than others: they are only samples from Dún Laoghaire Corporation's list of 420 applicants and several hundred transfer applicants and Dublin County Council's 300 applicants from my constituency alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> The Minister said there will be 1,200 house starts this year.  There are 20,000 people on the waiting list.  Last year he said there would be 900 starts but there were only 300.  At that rate it would take 20 years to clear the present list.  I do not accept that the housing crisis began with the election of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 but it has certainly got worse since then.  The climate was set by the previous Coalition Government who, towards the end of their term of office, told us the housing crisis was over.  It was the last Coalition Government who first trumpeted that there was no further need to continue house building.  Could they not see, as we told them at the time, that the short respite in housing demand in 1986 and 1987 was due to the immediate effect of vacancies resulting from the £5,000 grant scheme and that demand would increase again as new families formed?</P>
    <P>That is why I am proposing an amendment to delete the words &ldquo;over the last three years&rdquo;, to state accurately that the cause of the crisis is shared not just by this Government but by their predecessor as well.  There is no doubt that the housing crisis has worsened since 1987.  I would like to give a few examples from Dún Laoghaire Corporation's housing programme.  In February 1987 Dún Laoghaire Corporation asked the Government to approve a tender for a contract to build 50 houses in Loughlinstown but we are still waiting for a reply.  In 1987 Dún Laoghaire Corporation asked for approval for £400,000 worth of development works to commence a further housing scheme but we are still waiting for a reply.  In May 1988 we sought approval for a small housing scheme of 14 houses, in July 1988 we sought approval for 11 houses and approval was also sought for small infill schemes but we are still waiting for replies to all of these.</P>
    <P>What have we got in the 1990 capital allocation?  We have got enough money to build 25 houses, half the number we originally sought in 1987.  In 1987 we sought permission for the building of 50 <Col N="260" /> houses and three years later we get permission to build half that number.  That situation is repeated around the country. The capital allocations which have been made by the Government are simply an exercise in buying time, of trying to tell every local authority and people on every housing list around the country that a certain amount of money is being provided to the local authority in order that there is some perceptible activity on the housing scene.</P>
    <P>There is a need to increase considerably the housing allocation for this year but the problem is not confined to house building; there is also a problem of housing conditions.  The Government have finally got around to ordering a housing conditions survey but it is five years after it was due.  The last survey showed that 10 per cent of households are living without one or more basic sanitary facilities.  I believe the new survey will show up even more the scandalous neglect of the housing stock.  In reply to a Dáil question from me a couple of weeks ago it was shown that, taking all the local authorities together, there are over 8,000 local authority houses in this country without a bathroom or shower and there are over 3,000 local authority houses without indoor toilet facilities.  In my constituency alone there are over 600 local authority houses without a bathroom or shower and 260 without an indoor toilet.  There has been a lot of talk about refurbishment and we are indeed getting some resources for refurbishment but at the rate we are getting them it will take over 30 years to complete the refurbishment of the housing stock that is substandard.</P>
    <P>Many people on local authority waiting lists are now beginning to inquire about the possibility of buying their own home but they run into difficulties.  The first difficulty is the price &mdash; the prices of houses in my constituency has doubled in the past year and a half &mdash; and the second difficulty is getting a loan.  People are now told they will have to have two refusals before they can even apply for a local authority loan.  If they get a refusal from a bank they are told by the local authority <Col N="261" /> that they are not a sound bet for a loan and they will not get it from the local authority either.  Therefore they are driven back into the private rented sector.  It is now becoming open season for Rachman landlords.  Threshold have pointed out that four out of every five tenants do not receive receipts for their rent or do not have rent books.</P>
    <P>Even the rent allowances which were being made available by the health boards are being limited.  I have come across cases recently where the health board are restricting the issue of rent allowances and are telling people there is cheaper accommodation available even though it is patently obvious that that is not the case.  People on low incomes are being squeezed into a state of homelessness. We know that the Housing Acts dealing with homelessness have not dealt effectively with the problem and have failed to solve it.  At the same time, however, there is no shortage of expensive housing.  In my constituency which has almost 800 people on the housing waiting list we currently have in excess of 800 or 900 planning applications for houses in the expensive bracket which will retail at £250,000 to £300,000.</P>
    <P>When the Minister asks the question where he will get the money to fund local authority housing, perhaps he should look at the Government's taxation policy and ask himself how there are approximately 20,000 people who are virtually homeless while there are others who can pay eight times the price of an ordinary house for their homes?  Is it any wonder that the NESC report concluded that housing policy favours the rich?  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to that report's basic argument that tenants in local authority housing and private flats are being discriminated against in favour of those buying their own homes and that low income home buyers are being discriminated against in favour of the high earners.</P>
    <P>I believe if the Minister does not respond to this debate and recognise there is a housing crisis and does not make more resources available to increase the allocations available to local <Col N="262" /> authorities for house building, and refurbishment and ease the restrictions for making local authority loans available to people to buy houses, the housing situation will get worse; families will be put under severe strain and many will break up.  If the Minister does not respond positively to the debate on this issue there will be no option left to the people who are now on the housing waiting lists but to take to the streets, as they did in the sixties when there was a housing crisis, and force the Government to take action rather than allow the Government to leave them in the state of homelessness or in substandard housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, has referred to the price of houses in his constituency doubling in the past year and a half.  He could have also referred to the down side of that picture, that interest rates have increased on four occasions since the Government took office.  The impact of that on people with mortgages has meant an escalating rate of repossessions during that year.  Indeed, it is now embarrassing to the local authority, which has been adverted to by a number of speakers, that every meeting is taken up with a long list of homes that have been repossessed and the human misery and desolation that is involved in that type of decision.  More and more the limits of the ingenuity of local authority officials is being tested in being able to rehouse these people.  The inflexibility of the HFA scheme is also a factor fuelling the rate of repossessions.  I agree with the remarks made by Deputy Flood when he referred to the impact of the grants scheme introduced by the previous Coalition Government that enabled people to buy out of the local authority estates and move into the private sector.  It has had deplorable consequences, which I am sure were not envisaged by those who devised the scheme.  It has devastated large areas of County Dublin, in particular, and I am sure it is no different elsewhere where, by definition, the people who left the estates had to be employed, and in the case of Dublin County Council they have been replaced <Col N="263" /> by people 77 per cent of whom are unemployed. The result is there are large schemes of homogeneous public sector housing where up to 80 per cent of the people are unemployed with all of the implications of that situation.</P>
      <P>The repossession of homes is the most startling evidence that we have a housing crisis at present.  It is time the Government looked at the question of the old poor law mentality which informs the legislation in this area, that is that local authorities are there to house people who are incapable of housing themselves.  I believe that is an anchronism in the nineties and that the Department of the Environment ought to look at the possibility of more imaginative legislation to allow local authorities &mdash; and there is absolutely no reason they should not be permitted &mdash; to build houses for sale, for part sale and part rent or for other options, like what obtains in parts of Britain, that would use up some of the possibilities for tastefully designed infill housing schemes in the city.  Deputy Flood referred to the fact that he does not want to see any more largescale public housing programmes.  He may not need it but there are many who do need it.</P>
      <P>The reason for those enormous schemes which were built in the sixties and seventies was the housing crisis; and many builders did very well out of it and did nothing else except contruct housing units.  Making a home is more than simply putting a roof over one's head.  It involves a network of social and community supports and a sense of permanence and stability.  Housing policy must be seen to be more than merely providing housing units.  It should be about identifiying housing and related needs right across the spectrum and not only about catering for groups who have traditionally been assisted with housing.  It should be about matching housing resources to housing needs and should involve issues such as environmental quality, the location of housing, community facilities, public transport and the link between deprived neighbourhoods and the perpetuation of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> The facility is there to loosen up the legislation and to do away with this poor law mentality that dictates our housing policy.  I would have liked to say a great deal more but my colleagues want to get in at this stage.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to understand how the Minister and the members of his Government can defend the indefensible because that is exactly what they are doing at this time.  There is not doubt there is a housing crisis in this country. There are two electoral areas namely the Mallow and Kanturk electoral areas in my constituency which have an approximate population of about 70,000 people, and excluding the Fermoy and Mallow Urban District Council areas there are 12 family-type houses and four small units under construction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>That relates to Mallow Urban District Council.  In 1986 Kanturk submitted a housing scheme for 12 houses.  Charleville also submitted a scheme for 12 houses on 12 September 1986.  Newmarket submitted a scheme for eight houses in September 1986.  Buttevant Churchtown, Dromahane and Gooldshill, Mallow, submitted schemes in 1987.  We are told there is a devolved housing policy in the Department.  Kildorrery submitted a scheme in February 1988.  Kilworth submitted a scheme in November 1988 and there has not been a house built in that area by the local authority for 20 years.  There is still no prospect of building houses in that area. The Minister has said they were allocating £51 million for housing this year but what he did not say was that £46 million of that will come out of the local authorities' capital resources.  This will result in the local authorities having to transfer the proceeds from the sale of houses and not having finance to buy land for housing or to make grants available to physically and mentally handicapped <Col N="265" /> persons.  I can already see the effects of this decision in my own area.</P>

      <P>What cannot be denied is that the survey carried out in that area, which is broken down into two electoral divisions, under the 1988 Housing Act shows that there is an urgent need to provide 300 houses.  The manager has said that 150 to 160 houses should be provided as a matter of urgency to cater for those referred to by my colleague, Deputy Gilmore earlier.  What does the future hold for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But for the work done by the Share organisation and other voluntary organisations there would have been a revolution in Cork city because it is they who provided housing for the elderly in the city.  Reference was made to the need to provide an essential repairs grant to enable people carry out essential works to keep out the wind, to repair doors and windows and replace slates.  The most that the local authorities can provide is between £200 and £300, but no contractor would be prepared to listen to anybody with that amount of money to spend.  This <Col N="266" /> grant should be withdrawn as the amount of money available is an insult.</P>
    <P>The 1986 census of population indicated that there are 700 homes in north Cork without piped water.  Along with this repairs to doors and windows cannot be carried out as the scheme of housing aid for the elderly is being strictly implemented.  Those in ill-health cannot afford to do these repairs and the local authority can do nothing for them.</P>
    <P>During the past five to six years there has been great co-operation between the public and private sectors.  The availability of SDA and HFA loans helped to ease the problems facing local authorities as people found themselves in a position to purchase or build their own homes under those schemes.  During the last 12 months to two years we have witnessed one of the greatest con tricks ever perpetrated. In my own constituency people who had obtained SDA loans at a fixed interest rate of 12 per cent were encouraged to go to the banks and building societies to take out loans to repay the local authority what they owed.  A sum of £3 million was paid back.  This would appear to indicate that a large number of people borrowed from the banks and building societies at a rate of about 9.5 per cent.  That rate now stands at 11 per cent, and soon it is expected to be well over 12 per cent.  These people are also obliged to take out expensive mortgage redemption policies.  Those people were conned into doing this.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Minister should take note of what Deputy Rabbitte has to say about the repossession of homes by local authorities.  Simple legislation could be passed in this House which would enable the local authorities to have the people concerned reappointed as tenants at a reasonable rent they could afford.  They have been pushed out of their homes which have been repossessed by the local authorities and forced to live in over-crowded and unfit conditions, despite the fact that some of them have to rear small children.  This is a terrible indictment of the Government housing policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I would like <Col N="267" /> to pose is when is a crisis not a crisis?  The only time it seems the Government are prepared to accept that there is a crisis is when they have to go knocking on doors at election time and discover what we in The Workers' Party have been saying is correct.  There is an almighty housing crisis in the Dublin area.  The quality and quantity of the existing housing stock is inadequate.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the report of the environmental research unit on the housing stock in Dublin Corporation's area, the famous Minogue report.  I wish to quote part of a letter sent from the housing maintenance branch to the assistant city manager on that report:</P>
      <P>... stock built since 1981 and assumed not to have a backlog of maintenance and the remaining stock (currently 23,289 units) which were the subject of the sample condition survey undertaken as part of the preparation of the report.  It is a stated objective to bring the condition of the latter category of stock up to a certain minimum standard.  The cost of eliminating this backlog is estimated at £44 million. This estimate does not include major necessary work to the external elements of flats and these items would have to be covered by a separate programme of repair and replacement.  A total backlog of work valued at £147 million has been identified, including refurbishment works of £90 million. </P>
      <P>That gives one an inkling of the quality of the existing housing stock in Dublin Corporation's area.  A miserly sum of £51 million is to be spent on the provision of housing this year nationally despite the fact that Minogue identified work valued at £147 million on maintaining and upgrading the existing housing stock in the Dublin area alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should take a look at the position in Dublin city.  As there is such a shortage of suitable flats and houses Dublin Corporation would agree that there is a housing crisis.  At present there are 3,970 persons on the Dublin Corporation waiting list, 1,647 one parent families looking <Col N="268" /> for accommodation, 682 homeless cases, 6,972 people living in unsatisfactory accommodation and seeking transfers, 358 families being detenanted from Sheriff Street flats &mdash; God only knows where they will live &mdash; and 9,000 houses being sold to tenants under the 1988 tenant purchase scheme.  When one removes 9,000 units there is only one direction in which one can go and that is towards a crisis.  The sickening aspect is that the Minister for the Environment provided funds to have more houses built in his own constituency of Mayo last year than in Dublin city.  What are the Government doing about this?</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation pride themselves on having rebuilt parts of the inner city with excellent infill housing.  They are lovely houses but the corporation have been instructed in the last 18 months to sell off those valuable sites.  While the population of the inner city dwindles people are being forced more and more to the outer suburbs.  That is not doing any good for Dublin's inner city.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to income limits. We have heard a lot of talk about the creation of social mixes.  Once upon a time a garda sergeant or a tradesman could qualify for a local authority house but now the ceiling has been raised to a combined income limit of £12,000.  In this day and age that means that an unskilled health board worker and his wife, who is working part-time in one of the Dublin hospitals as a chambermaid, are not eligible because their combined income is in excess of £12,000 per annum.  That income limit will have to go.  We need more affordable private houses in the inner city.  We should discriminate positively in favour of inner city housing stock which in the main is old and expensive to refurbish.  Such buildings do not quality for home improvement grants and I should like to suggest that we should discriminate in favour of them by the abolition of stamp duty on second hand houses in Dublin inner city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in an unique situation in my constituency in that we have up to 17,000 local authority housing sites <Col N="269" /> lying dormant.  Millons of pounds were spent on the development of those sites. The Minister should send his senior housing officials to Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council to prepare an intelligent working plan to release that major asset.  He should insist on those bodies directing their energies towards tackling what is a serious problem for all members who are approached to young couples anxious to be housed by local authorities.  Deputies Rabbitte, Gilmore and myself at a meeting of Dublin County Council that was considering the Clondalkin-Lucan satellite town were made aware of the huge amount of land owned by the local authority.  It is because of this empire building at official level that we have not had a dynamic approach to resolving this problem and making use of the great asset that is available.</P>
      <P>The Minister, and his staff, should ascertain from the Department of Finance the amount that accrues to the Exchequer from housing programmes. There is no doubt that a tremendous amount of money returns to the Exchequer from housing.  Materials used in building construction are subject to VAT and the workers employed pay income tax.  It is unfortunate that the cash that finds its way back to the Exchequer as a result of house building is not taken into consideration and that instead we have people adopting a pigeon-hole mentality in regard to that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter will have to admit that part of the problem in regard to the lack of housing arose from the decision of his Government to pay a £5,000 grant to first time home buyers.  That was the chief economic solution to the housing crisis by his party.  Rather than build £30,000 local authority houses they paid couples £5,000 to vacate their homes.  Tragically we are repossessing the homes of many of those people.  It is heartbreaking at meetings of Dublin County Council to have to consider lists for repossession. Deputy Sherlock was correct in calling for greater flexibility in regard to repossessions. We are evicting those who have advances from the Housing Finance <Col N="270" /> Agency and other agencies and endeavouring to accommodate them in local authority houses.  That is not commonsense.</P>
    <P>The couples who are making the effort to meet their repayments feel aggrieved that their neighbours who fall on hard times receive preferential treatment from the local authority and are being relieved of the the burden of having to pay for their home.  Another problem is that when we repossess such houses we sell them at a figure which is less than what was paid for them.  There is a need to adopt a new policy in regard to housing in the greater Dublin area.  The corporation are disposing of local authority houses in my constituency at high prices.  Why is it that they do not produce a scheme, in co-operation with the house building industry, under which they barter their surplus sites for new houses?</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne told us that there are 6,900 on Dublin Corporation's housing list.  I understand that that authority, of which he is a member, have up to 20,000 sites in County Dublin lying fallow and overgrown.  The services provided to those sites cost millions of pounds.  We have many housing maintenance depots and the corporation own many houses in the county.  We have a lot of bureaucratic nonsense taking place and it is fuelled by the Department of the Environment.  The Minister should tackle the housing problem in Dublin city and county and insist on the dormant asset being developed.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil started the sub-letting last July.  I intend to share my time with Deputies McGinley, Creed and Allen.  The Minister for the Evnironment and the Minister of State at that Department have told us that there is no housing crisis.  The Minister reminds me of the person who is jack of all trades and master of none.  His record in regard to house building in the last two years has been disgraceful.  He should not take credit for the number of houses built by the private sector in that time.  He should concern himself with the number of applicants on local authority housing lists. Those lists are increasing faster than the water seeped into the <i>Titanic.</i> That was a sad occasion and what we are debating is sad because we are facing a crisis as far as housing is concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the Minister that in 1984, 148 houses were built in my county, in 1985, 168 were built and in 1986, 136 were built.  The Minister took office in 1987 and in that year we built 61 houses in my county.  In 1988 &mdash; it is fortunate that the Minister of State is sitting down to hear this information &mdash; we built one house.  I proposed that the Minister, the famous star in the car from Castlebar, should be invited to formally hand over the keys of that new house to the new tenant but he did not take up my offer. In 1989 we built 47 houses and so far this year we have built 20 houses.  It is important to stress tha we have not received an allocation from the Minister this year.  We were permitted to spend £799,000 of our money and £146,000 of that must go towards providing proper chimneys in poor quality houses that were built under the Fianna Fáil Government of 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell the Minister that £80,000 of that allocation must go towards the provision of a halting site. We were given to understand that the Department of the Environment would refund that money to the county council but that has not happened.  The county council had to make the funds available from housing sales last year.  With the balance of £441,000 we can start 31 houses and seven isolated cottages.  I <Col N="272" /> should like to tell the Minister that there were 385 genuine cases on our waiting list last year and they had been vetted under the scheme introduced by the Minister. That number has risen to 450.</P>

      <P>Last evening, my colleague, Deputy Shatter, dealt with the situation on a national level.  I would like to take the limited time available to me to let the House know of the serious situation in Donegal.  I wish to avail of this time to put on the record of the House what we told the Minister and, indeed, the Minister of State, last November when the entire Donegal County Council took the day off and came to Dublin to outline the seriousness of the situation.</P>
      <P>In Donegal at present there are 1,600 applicants waiting for local authority housing.  There are almost 1,300 approved applicants and along with that there are 570 demountable dwellings, many of which are falling apart.  A survey was carried out in Donegal by An Foras Forbartha some time ago where it was found that there were 5,350 dwellings in Donegal that were incapable of economic repair.  It was so serious that the entire county council met the Minister the Minister of State was also present &mdash; and everyone of the county council members who spoke let the Minister know the seriousness of the situation but what did we get?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a graph here showing the figures: in 1983 £5.5 million was made available to Donegal for housing, in 1984 it was £5.4 million; in 1985, <Col N="273" /> £5.3 million was made available but last year we got £1.3 million.  Two years ago 60 houses were advertised and put to tender but only 22 were built.  There are 28 families for whom houses were advertised before an election some time ago but who are still waiting.  I hope that the miserable £1.9 million that was made available to Donegal this year will be enough to at least build the houses that were advertised two years ago.  We left the meeting with the Ministers that day and we had high hopes that something would be done for our county.  At the present rate it will be 50 years before our present demand will be satisfied, not to mention the new applicants coming on stream every year, every month and, indeed, every week.  It is a disastrous situation, especially when we have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The time available to me is <Col N="274" /> very brief.  I want to place some startling statistics on the record with regard to the crisis that exists in Cork.  The local authority housing crisis can fall into three categories, those people on the waiting list, those people living in substandard local authority housing and, most importantly, &mdash; the trend to growing at an alarming rate &mdash; those people likely to come on to local authority housing lists because of rising interest rates and the rate of repossession of private housing. In search of some solace I sought out the Progressive Democrat Fianna Fáil <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and, as I expected, the contributions from across the Floor waxed lyrical about houses being built.  The document in its brevity, bears testimony to the commitment of the Government.  It states that the Government will give special priority to areas were acute housing lists have been identified.</P>
      <P>In Cork county there are 614 approved applicants for housing, 200 of which are acute cases.  The Minister may argue about providing £51 million in 1990 but the reality is that there has been an 85 per cent cut in the capital allocation from the Department of the Environment.  The Minister said funds are available from the proceeds of the tenant purchase scheme but that scheme is over a ten year period and the full benefits will not be available to local authorities in 1990.  Therefore, the number of houses the Minister claims will be built will not be built.</P>

      <P>Last year one local authority house was built in Cork city, an area with a population of 150,000 people and where many of the existing houses are totally inadequate.  Because of high interest rates and with over 1,000 people on the waiting list the situation is at crisis point.  I asked the Minister some time ago about the whole question of repossession <Col N="275" />&mdash; a polite name for evictions &mdash; and the Minister in a shameful hand washing exercise said it was a matter for the local authorities, that he would not have the information.  There is a national mortgage misery at present which the Minister seems unable to deal with and which is making the situation even worse.  The most recent development is the disgraceful and shameful letter of 22 February from the Minister's office instructing local authority managers, despite the crisis, to divert to the roads programme funds which should be going to housing.  I call on the Minister to withdraw that letter.</P>

      <P>I want to deal briefly with the amendments which have been tabled. The Workers' Party amendment is a shameful amendment.  It is part of the internecine warfare which The Workers' Party are conducting with the Labour Party.  It is this Government who should be targeted for the housing crisis.  We, in Government, built the houses.  The Labour-Fine Gael Coalition Government went out of office in 1987 at a time when the problems had been resolved and it is this Government, who substantially cut back on finance and who have created the problem we have today. In no circumstances can we accept The Workers' Party amendment which is seeking to take the blame off the shoulders of the Government which is where it should rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the record, we are told by The Workers' Party that it was the last Coalition Government of 1982-87 who contributed to the problem.  We have the Minister telling us about the great increase in finance he has made available for the house building programmes.  In <Col N="276" /> the last year of that Government £147 million was made available for the local authority house building programme. This year £33 million is being made available. This is the great increase the Minister is lauding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the Minister has told local authorities to divert housing finance into the building of roads.  Last night we took the example of Dublin city and county and I will repeat it; not a single new house was completed in Dublin city in 1989.  In Dublin city there are 4,000 families on the housing waiting list.  Dublin Corporation have been told to divert £500,000 of housing moneys into the building of roads and their sister authority, Dublin County Council&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He did not even refer to it.  Both he and the Minister of State want to deny that that is what is happening. The reality is that moneys that should be used for the building of houses, to deal with the growing housing lists, has been diverted to roads &mdash; an extraordinary development.  The Minister comes in and pats himself on the back for having passed the Housing Act to address the issue of homelessness.  What is the purpose of the Minister getting the statistics of the homeless if no houses are being built to accommodate them?  Are we simply building a department of statistics in the Department of the Environment?  What homeless people need is real houses. What the local authorities need are the finances and the capital to build them. By the end of this year there will be 25,000 people on the local authority housing waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Deputies in this House who <Col N="278" /> have criticised the £5,000 scheme of house grants, if not for that scheme, and the large number of houses built in the lifetime of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, there would be 35,000 to 40,000 people currently on the waiting lists.  We provided the houses and the capital and we brought the waiting lists down.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Opposition parties can give unanimous support to the motion that the Fine Gael Party have tabled.  In the context of the Labour Party's amendment, we cannot accept that, because it appears in that amendment that the Labour Party want to bring to an end the tenant purchase scheme which is a popular and good scheme which many people have availed of.  I hope that the Opposition parties in this House will unanimously support the Fine Gael motion, the Fine Gael initiative to force this Government to face up to the reality of the housing crisis now confronting us nationally which this Government have created.</P>

      <P>Last evening I laid emphasis on the constitutional doubt that hangs over section 6 of the Bill.  I do not want to reiterate those arguments, but I want to repeat my request to the Minister or the Minister of State to answer the points I made in relation to the inhibitions that have been placed in the way not only of military personnel but of ordinary citizens.</P>
      <P>I will summarise the arguments I made last evening.  It would be extraordinary were a Minister for Defence to initiate legislation in this House which sought to circumscribe not only the rights of the enlisted men and women for whom the Minister of the day had responsibility but also sought to extend that proscription on free comment to ordinary citizens. Thus I find it quite outrageous that any Minister appointed under the system of powers we have would seek to limit a citizen's right to advocate trade union membership in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point I did not make which I have <Col N="284" /> some questions about is in relation to section 2 (4) which provides that a member shall not join any trade union or any other body &mdash; those three words are the most important &mdash; which seeks to influence the remuneration or other conditions of service of members of the Defence Forces.  That exclusion in itself is so general as to be entirely unsatisfactory. It is providing that a body, which it has been decided will be the one to which people shall be organised for representative and consultative purposes, shall be the only body which one should join.  One is in an interesting position here.  If somebody through, let us say, membership of some social welfare body or other such body was addressing the issue of low pay in the armed forces and produced a report which commented upon the inequity of people being on low pay, to avoid sanctions, one would be required automatically to leave that body.  The sweeping generalisation of this exclusion is outrageous.  I warn that the tests of this provision on legal grounds will not only be in relation to the Constitution, but they will be in relation to the other charters which preserve, quite correctly, the right of speech, assembly, and so forth.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell on these points in the few minutes I have left because they have been made extensively. However, I want to stress a few other points in the Minister's speech.  Reading it one would get the impression that what is being proposed in the legislation is the outcome of a long and satisfactory consultative process.  From meeting people involved directly it is very clear &mdash; unless the Minister demonstrates otherwise that this is far from so.  The Minister might like to tell us about the difference between what the Gleeson Committee would have liked to do, and sought to do, and what they were allowed to do.  I understand that the view presented to the Gleeson Committee was that after pay the structures of representatives were the most important issue in the Army.  In relation to the Gleeson Committee's remit being extended to enable them to consult with those who <Col N="285" /> were organising themselves at that stage, there was a Government refusal.  Nevertheless, some of the groups who now find themselves threatened in a sense in terms of their freedom by the proposed legislation met with the Gleeson Committee and I understand they found that committee anxious to deal comprehensively with the remit they have been given in the medium term rather than the short-term. It is very important to relate to the question of the study group.  I understand the briefing notes which Opposition Members spoke about last night were distributed on 5 January.  The study group met with one of the groups who were very interested in this legislation, the NCO group, on 8 January.  They were told that the sole topic for discussion would be the briefing notes.  Here one is uncovering the whole authoritarian ethos of discussions that took place with people not being able to sit down together in a reasonable fashion with an open agenda that would have as its purpose the evolution of democratic and consultative structures. Consider a study group meeting with a group who are affected by the sets of draft regulations you have distributed a few days earlier and then say, &ldquo;We cannot discuss what might be in your minds; we can only discuss what we have circulated&rdquo;.  To people involved in organised trade union activity, or any other forms of democratic activity, that smacks of the authoritarian ethos that has led up to this draft legislation.</P>
    <P>Many people have come to me at different times to discuss what might emerge in relation to the structures.  People wanted an association and they said so. They expressed themselves as being disappointed. At this stage I appeal to the Minister again to try to save something from the position.  The one way to do this is to amend this legislation comprehensively but, above all, to create an atmosphere of openness.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons the Labour Party put down an amendment.  We find the legislation constitutionally flawed, it emerged out of a consultation process that was inadequate and it is in the interests of nobody &mdash; the Army, the <Col N="286" /> Oireachtas or the public.  We strongly appeal to the Minister to move back from an entirely wrong structure.</P>

      <P>Over the past 18 months in particular there has been much debate on the working conditions of the members of our Defence Forces.  We are all aware that this was one of the main issues in the general election of June last year.  Undoubtedly, the conditions which pertained in the past, for members of the Army in particular, were far from satisfactory and in the negotiations between my party and Fianna Fáil on the formation of the present Government in July this issue received particular attention.</P>
      <P>The agreed programme deals specifically with the issue of pay for the Defence Forces and part of the agreed programme for Government states that the long-term objective is that Army pay should be restructured with the aim of substantially improving basic pay and reducing the over-dependence of soldiers on special Army duty allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Soon after the Government came to office, the new Minister for Defence, Deputy Lenihan, established the independent pay committee who are still sitting.  This was a vitally important step forward in resolving the many problems affecting the working conditions of members of the Defence Forces.  Today's debate concerns a second major initiative by the Government and the Minister for Defence relating to working conditions of members of the Defence Forces, the putting in place of arrangements for the holding of elections for people to represent the associations on behalf of the members of the armed forces.  Both those initiatives, the independent pay commission and the proposed establishment of representative associations are vitally important measures and I am confident that they will satisfactorily resolve the <Col N="287" /> many issues legitimately bothering those people who have voluntarily taken on the difficult and onerous duty of defending this country and its citizens.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the debate relating to the proposed establishment of the representative associations has been the subject of misrepresentation and confusion. The Progressive Democrats have consistently supported the right of the members of the Defence Forces to have representative bodies.  The legislation now before the Dáil is a satisfactory basis for bringing this about.  My party colleague, Deputy Molloy, a former Minister for Defence, has been involved in discussing this matter with the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, and I and my party colleagues are satisfied that the proposals now before the Dáil provide an acceptable basis for the formation of such bodies.  The most important point to bear in mind is that this is enabling legislation to provide a mechanism for the holding of elections and to give members of the Defence Forces a mandate to speak on behalf of the forces as a whole.  It is only when these elections have been held that detailed discussions can take place on the regulations which will govern the associations. In that process the elected representatives of the Defence Forces will have their say.</P>
    <P>The legislation prescribes a set of carefully chosen stages in the process leading to the formation of the representative associations and the establishment of the regulations governing their operation.  It is important that every Member of the House and members of the Defence Forces and their families should take careful note of the various Stages of the Bill.  If this is done it will be seen that the mechanism proposed is fair and equitable and will work satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>As the Minister informed the Dáil yesterday, he will be appointing an independent offical from the Department of the Environment to supervise the holding of the elections.  That person will be available to receive submissions from all interested groupings, including PDFORRA, on the system of election to <Col N="288" /> be held so that it will have a broad-based acceptance.  The elections will be held on the basis of a secret ballot with a single transferable vote, similar to the system used in a general election.  When the Defence Forces have elected people to speak on their behalf they will sit down with the Minister for Defence and his officials to discuss the structures and the proposed regulations governing the way the association will operate.  Nothing could be more open and democratic.  The people who will have been given a mandate by every member of the Defence Forces will be parties to the formulation of the regulations to govern the conduct of the association in direct talks with the Minister and his officials.  There has been no pre-empting of this situation and the regulations have not been drawn up.  This will be a task for the elected representatives in consultation and negotiation with the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>I understand that another matter of concern to members of the Defence Forces is also open to full democratic discussion.  I am referring to the number of associations which will be set up; in other words if it is decided that there should be a single association for privates and NCOs, that can be the way forward. However, if there is a democratic decision that there should be two separate associations that will be accepted.</P>
    <P>Another important matter which can be resolved in the discussions between the elected members of the Defence Forces and the Minister and his staff is the question of how the representative associations should be organised geographically. Will they be based on Army commands or units or in different barracks around the country?  This simply underlines the extent to which nothing has been pre-empted at this stage.  All the key issues affecting the establishment of the associations will be agreed between the soldiers' elected representatives and the Minister.</P>
    <P>When all these facts are conveyed to the various members of the Defence Forces they will come to realise that the proposed system is fair and reasonable. The elected representatives will have a <Col N="289" /> full say in all the pertinent matters relating to the proposed associations, the regulations governing them and the matters which the associations can deal with, including pay, allowances, grants and pensions.  It is also worth pointing out that there will be a gap between Second Stage and Committee Stage which will allow for the fullest consideration by all interested parties in the legislation before the Dáil.</P>

The Minister for Defence, Deputy Lenihan, should be warmly commended for the way he approached the task of establishing representative associations for the Army and for facilitating the fullest consultation possible.</P>
      <P>Having considered the proposals in detail and having been sensitive and sympathetic to the legitimate grievances of members of the Defence Forces, the Progressive Democrats are quite satisfied that the mechanism put in place for the holding of elections and providing a basis for negotiation and discussion on the role and functions of the proposed associations are reasonable and satisfactory. We owe the members of the Defence Forces a great deal as they are ultimately our last line of defence against terrorism and anarchy.  As a former member of the Defence Forces I have a special regard for every person who dons the uniform of our Army.  My party and I are determined that legitimate grievances, which they have had for many years, will be fully and comprehensively addressed by the Government.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to see this Bill before the House.  The question of pay and allied matters were thorny issues in recent years and I am sure these problems can now be solved.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of associations for the purpose of representing members of the Defence Forces on remuneration and related matters. The new structure will give members a representative say on pay, allowances, grants, pensions and numerous other matters, as well as access to conciliation and, most importantly, arbitration.</P>
      <P>Coming from County Kildare, I think it would be only fitting if I was to pay tribute to the Army for their service to our country and their willingness to answer any call and come up trumps every time.  They provide armed military escorts for the movement of money and prisoners.  In those operations not as much as one penny or one prisoner has been lost.  There must be a lesson to be learned there in regard to armed escorts and using armed men as a deterrent for robbers and wrongdoers.  We can see that the Army have played a major role in combating the number of robberies. Their record speaks for itself and I hope they will continue to provide the same type of service for many years to come.</P>
      <P>The respect for our Defence Forces is acknowledged right around the world. They have been wonderful ambassadors of our country while they served overseas. No matter what the country, let it be Cyprus, Namibia or Lebanon, the reaction has always been the same.  While listening to the speakers here last night I was very surprised to hear some of them refer to the low morale in the Army.  I would like to make one very important point.  I was pleased to learn of the decision of the Department of Defence to enlist 1,000 new recruits this year. There were 6,920 applications for these posts.  This fact can only be seen as an indication of the attraction of Army life for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we speak of the Defence Forces <Col N="291" /> in the context of this motion, we need to make two facts very clear.  The first is that the Defence Forces have been completely loyal to the existing Government of the State ever since its foundation. This loyalty has been displayed and proved beyond doubt in numerous crises, emergencies and difficulties, not only in this country but abroad in every strifetorn land, where we were asked to help as a peace-keeping force.  I have no doubt that our present Defence Forces are as loyal today as ever they were and these civvies who try to stir up trouble and sow doubts in the ranks are doing a distinct disservice to the forces and the country.</P>
    <P>The second fact that I want to make clear to this House is that our party, Fianna Fáil, have always been loyal to the Defence Forces.  In their heart of hearts, the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps know that.  I can say that the Army demonstrated their appreciation of our party in the only way that was open to them, and their appreciation was quantified and measured each time the postal vote was counted.  I must acknowledge that there was a change at the last election when a number of Army candidates ran but nevertheless I am confident that we will once again enjoy their tremendous support.</P>
    <P>Probably the greatest mistake was made at the foundation of the State when we accepted fully the imperial inheritance of the British Army structure and embraced it <i>in toto.</i> In hindsight a slimmed down Defence Force that would have evolved to suit particular Irish needs would have been better, but the winds of change are blowing through the ranks now and the frank forward thinking, modern thinking, as is evident in this Bill is an indication of this much needed change.</P>
    <P>Our Army are small, perhaps too small for the various duties expected of them. They are really like a family or a team and there cannot be any place for factions or divisions.  I am not aware of any tug-of-war between the administration and the ranks.  Nor am I aware of any rift between the NCOs and men or between <Col N="292" /> the officers and NCOs.  Naturally enough, there will always be a degree of cribbing in every army but this is quickly submerged when discipline demands. Discipline cannot be over-emphasised. Over 200 years ago, George Washington wrote in Letters of Instructions to the Captains of the Virginia Regiment: &ldquo;Discipline is the soul of the army.  It makes small numbers formidable, procures success to the weak, and esteem to all&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the Defence Forces need this legislation.  They have the right to protect themselves and to look for a higher and better life.  In other European countries troops have the right of association granted to them without their military efficiency being impaired in any way.  I heard a Dutchman being interviewed on the radio yesterday and he confirmed this.  He expressed an opinion that the Bill gives to the Defence Forces all that any normal soldier would need.</P>
    <P>Through the setting up of this group, members of our Permanent Defence Force will have a say on matters such as remuneration and conditions of service. They will have available for the first time, a process of conciliation and arbitration, a privilege which up to now, has only been afforded to their colleagues in the public service, but surely, it should not be a privilege; surely it is the basic right of every working man and woman to negotiate with his or her employer, conditions of pay, service and allied matters. Through this new structure, the Government are providing this fundamental right to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan, in his contribution last night, stated that the problems in the Defence Forces were not created over the last two years, they have been ongoing for a number of years, and I must agree with the Deputy.  However, it is unfortunate that when a serious attempt is being made to solve the problem, a number of Opposition Deputies continue to make a political football out of the issue.  If one was to ask what are the main grievances the Defence Forces had, and eventually led to the Army wives taking to the streets and the setting up of <Col N="293" /> PDFORRA, the answer would be pay, an independent organisation and a right to talk to the media.  This Bill will help to establish an independent organisation and when the associations are set up, the representatives will be free to talk to the media.</P>
    <P>An independent pay commission has already been set up and I am confident that it can bring forward acceptable proposals in the near future.  We must accept that those who have fought a battle over that last couple of years for a better deal for the Defence Forces will find it difficult to accept these proposals.  However, I am sure that in time, they will accept this Bill as not just meeting what was proposed by PDFORRA but much more.</P>
    <P>I has been suggested that members of PDFORRA will be reluctant to take part in the elections.  I would say to them: take part, this is your chance, this is your election.  While most of the members of PDFORRA will be happy with their new organisation and with what they have helped to achieve, it has to be admitted that the officials are self-appointed and that while they may be happy now, there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.  In setting up any organisation or structure, is it not obvious that the fairest, most honest and most democratic way to go about it is to hold an election, one man, one vote?</P>
    <P>I look forward to the full participation of the members of the Defence Forces in setting up this structure, a structure which will give each man a say in such matters as pay, welfare matters and conditions of service.  Living close to the Curragh, I feel I have a good idea of the problems facing many of the families of Army men.  Accommodation in some of the living quarters leaves a lot to be desired.  Low wages have also caused many problems.  I, along with everyone else, look forward to next June when Gleeson will report on Army pay.</P>
    <P>I would say to those who are finding fault with this Bill: it is nice to see you taking an interest in the Army.  You are usually unaware of their presence, until there is a bus strike, a petrol strike, refuse uncollected or some nasty mess to be <Col N="294" /> cleared up.  Please continue to show the interest expressed here tonight and last night.  Certain parties in this House have been known to express an opinion that we could do without an army.  When a military barracks was to be built in some counties, there were objections.  Some speakers here tonight and last night, for their own petty, political purposes, have not helped the morale of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has made a straightforward effort to help the Army in this Bill.  He intends getting this Bill passed and he will succeed.  He deserves to succeed because his motives are correct. The thinking and the spirit of the Bill are correct.  It will restore the dented morale of the Army and give them courage and hope.  That is what morale means &mdash; confidence, zeal and loyalty.  I believe that the <i>esprit de corps</i> and determination shown by the Minister for Defence and the Fianna Fáil Party in this House tonight will evoke a reciprocal response in all the ranks of Ireland's Defence Forces.  I wish the Bill a hasty passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on bringing this imaginative legislation before the House. The Bill provides for the establishment of associations for the purpose of allowing members of the Defence Forces to express their views on matters related to pay, grants and pensions without compromising the systems of control within the Defence Forces.  Two radical measures initiated last year are clear evidence of the Government's commitment and concern for the well being of the Defence Forces.  The independent pay commission was established to inquire into the remuneration and conditions of service of the Permanent Defence Forces.  The work of the commission is proceeding.  Preparations were made for the establishment of new representative associations.  There can be no doubting the bona fides of the Minister in this matter.  What has been done represents completely fresh thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is straightforward in that it is <Col N="295" /> enabling legislation, just like the corresponding Garda Síochána legislation. The detail is left for inclusion in regulations which are more flexible and more appropriate to what is an unfolding situation. In leaving the detail for incorporation in the regulations, subject to scrutiny by the Dáil, the new system is similar to what applied to the Garda Síochána under the Garda Síochána Act. We are all aware of the tremendous goodwill which the Garda representative body have established between the Government, the public and the Garda Force themselves.</P>
    <P>Consultation is obviously the essence of the Bill.  The association will represent members in relation to pay, allowances, gratuities, grants and pensions, welfare matters, recreational facilities, medical benefit schemes and family support systems.  Contrary to allegations made by members of the PDFORRA, members will be allowed to make statements to the news media on matters which fall within their mandate and the associations will be allowed to raise money by subscriptions. It is essential that the Defence Forces have a forum for expressing their views in relation to their pay and other conditions of service.  It is equally important that the discipline and order which exists within the Defence Forces is not compromised.  It is important to facilitate the wishes of the Defence Forces while at the same time ensuring that the common or public good is not compromised. This Bill ensures that the proper balance is maintained.</P>
    <P>An examination of representative bodies in other European countries suggest there is a great diversity of arrangements in different countries.  I welcome the election of members to the representative bodies and this will ensure that genuine views and problems will be brought to the attention of the Minister. The appointment of a senior official of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment will ensure that these elections are carried out in a proper and democratic manner.  The Minister is to be complimented on seeking submissions <Col N="296" /> from interested parties to determine a suitable system of election.  The Bill will give members of the Defence Forces a real say on pay and related matters while at the same time it will not compromise the system of control within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings a fine balance to a very sensitive issue.  The new representative bodies for the Defence Forces will be independently entitled to speak to the media and will be able to negotiate pay and a whole range of welfare issues.  I welcome this Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies I welcome the opportunity provided by the Government to discuss a Bill which is <Col N="297" /> probably a century too late.  However, I must give some credit to the Minister for Defence for taking the bull by the horns and doing something about it.  At this stage he must realise that the proposals he has in mind will not meet with the approval which would be expected of the Opposition benches or of the rank and file of the armed forces.  I do not blame the soldiers or anybody in the Army for not taking the present Government at face value.  If one were to refer to the infamous Fianna Fáil Manifesto of 1977, the Fianna Fáil Party said their objectives would be:</P>
      <P> 1.  A new code for the administration of military law.</P>
      <P>2.  Establishment of a women's service corps.</P>
      <P>I think they got around to that.</P>
      <P>3.  Introduction of a new and fairer system for promotion than that introduced by this Government.</P>
      <P>They were referring to the Coalition Government of 1973-77.</P>
      <P>4.  A reduction in the age limits to a more realistic level.</P>
      <P>5.  Access to Army hospitals for retired servicemen requiring treatment.</P>
      <P>6.  A training scheme to prepare those due for discharge for outside employment, and further assistance by educational grants if required after discharge.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were pious platitudes embodied in an election manifesto aimed at buying votes to get back into power and successfully, if I might say, persuading the military personnel to vote in large numbers for Fianna Fáil.  The gift that Fianna Fáil have had since their inception was to be able to tell people what they were doing, make them believe it was for their good, get them to support them in the elections and then proceed to do nothing about it.  If I had time I could go through <Col N="298" /> the strata of society and point out different examples where Fianna Fáil succeeded in persuading people that this was what they stood for when in fact they were doing different things altogether.</P>
    <P>I do not blame members in the Army for taking up an anti position on the proposals introduced by the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>A report in today's <i>Irish Press</i> says: &ldquo;Lenihan's Bill Unlikely to End Army Discontent&rdquo; and I will quote sections of the article:</P>
      <P>But with vocal opposition to the Tánaiste's plans coming from ordinary soldiers it now looks as if the real fighting has just begun.</P>
      <P>Surely this is a warning to the Minister for Defence who brought in this Bill to heal the wounds of the last few years where soldiers wives marched to fight for their rights.  We are looking for consensus, and it is time the Minister looked to the Opposition benches and listened to the pleas from responsible Deputies of all parties to start the discussions now.  If there is to be consultation, let us start in this House and let the elected representatives, including those in the Army whose wives come to clinics and to the homes of Opposition Deputies to outline their case.  I will again quote from the article in the <i>Irish Press:</i></P>
      <P>... Mr. Lenihan, looks to be set on a collision course with the unofficial Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a warning that he is on a collision course.  I am a personal friend of the Minister for Defence.  He and I were elected to this House on the same day and we have remained friends ever since. It is not out of acrimony that I say this because I have always liked the man, and I think that feeling has been reciprocated. I know the Minister for Defence will <Col N="299" /> listen to real dialogue and on the strength of a lifetime in politics I am asking him to set up an all-party committee of 14 or 15 Members of the House to debate the matter because if it is to have the support of the armed forces &mdash; the soldiers, noncommissioned officers and the wives and families of everybody concerned &mdash; and if the goodwill on these benches is to be harnessed by the Minister for Defence, he has to reciprocate and listen to the pleadings from this side, because if he does not, as the <i>Irish Press</i> article says, &ldquo;the battle has just begun&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>No one wants to go through what the politicians have listened to for the past two or three years from the wives and friends of young men in the Army.  We all have friends and relations in the Army.  The Minister should read the article on page eight of today's edition of the <i>Irish Press</i> which puts into proper context the views of Members of this House and of the families of Army personnel.  There should not be a voice in the wilderness pleading with the Minister to get off his high horse though I acknowledge he is the first Minister to come into this House with real proposals.  We should look for consensus in seeking the proper balance in an effort to meet all the arguments being fairly put forward both by those able to speak publicly and on behalf of those who do not have the facility to speak publicly.  Those are fair and reasonable arguments and nothing short of what they are looking for is going to satisfy either them or Opposition Deputies.</P>
    <P>It is not too late for the Minister to accept that his proposals fall far short of what the soldiers and their families require.  Rather than make a political football out of this issue, as Deputy Power has said, we should look at the matter sensibly and ask the Minister to set up an all-party committee who would report before the end of May and consider all the fair arguments being put forward by those who know best.  I do not claim to have a monopoly on good ideas and with respect, I do not think any other Member in this House has either. The Minister has a challenge on his hands <Col N="300" /> but if he wants to go down the road of consensus he will be pushing an open door so far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned and given the views expressed by them, an open door so far as The Workers' Party and the Labour Party are concerned too.</P>
    <P>Having made those few remarks I will now hand over to Deputy McGrath but before I sit down I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, convey to the Minister my request that he should consider setting up an all-party committee.  I think everyone realises that this is the way forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I thank my colleague, Deputy Harte, for sharing his time with me.  I wish to congratulate the Minister for Defence on taking the initiative and bringing forward this Bill. Even though this is a move in the right direction I am disappointed with the Bill, given the recent statements of the Minister. We are being asked today to support and pass legislation without knowing its scope, implications and impact on the men whom it is supposed to help.  The Minister in this Bill and in the document issued to members of the Defence Forces is asking them to elect representatives to work on their behalf in an unknown and vague framework.  This is disappointing given that we are all aware that the Members of the Defence Forces have been facing difficulties for a long time.  It also appears that this Bill has been hastily prepared and brought before the House in an effort to rush it through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A representative body is badly needed to work on behalf of the members of the Defence Forces but this proposed legislation will not provide the structure for such a body or provide for the freedom of expression or the framework to bring about much needed reform.  I consider some sections of the Bill to be extreme and repressive.  Section 6 (2) would make it illegal for non-military personnel to encourage or invite a soldier to join a trade union or a representative body other than the official group proposed by the Minister.  I find this most objectionable.  It would appear that the <Col N="301" /> members of NASA who have attended the House both yesterday and today would no longer be in a position to support and encourage their husbands to look for fair play, decent wages, and conditions and the chance to support their families.  Is this not the type of repressive legislation that we would associate with other parts of the world and which reminds us of the big brother syndrome or of the KGB who seem to be falling out of favour in the eastern part of the world? I call on the Minister to take another look at that section and in the interest of family harmony and common sense either to withdraw it or amend it.</P>
    <P>On Friday last the Minister issued a document to all members of the Defence Forces setting out how elections should take place to elect representatives and what the functions and responsibilities of those elected representatives should be. Some of these guidelines are, indeed, questionable and offend the very nature of democracy and representation.  One of the conditions to be fulfilled before a person can become a candidate in an election is that their conduct rating must be not less than good.  I wonder how many Senators and Deputies would have found their names on a ballot paper if these same standards were applied to elections for the Oireachtas.  Recent revelations add further to the list of notables who would never have even reached the starting line if these standards were applied across the board.  Surely regulations such as these reflect mistrust of our Defence Forces and of the men who unselfishly and regularly put their lives at risk on our behalf.  Indeed, today in my own constituency of Longford-Westmeath members of the Defence Forces were out searching for arms and explosives.  These are the men we are afraid to trust to elect their own representatives. We can be justly proud of the service given by our Defence Forces, be it in patrolling the Border, acting as a back-up to the gardaí on their many hazardous operations or, indeed, the many ceremonial duties they perform.</P>
    <P>Our troops have served abroad and have done so with distinction.  Indeed, <Col N="302" /> they are the envy of forces all over the world.  However, the Minister is doubting the abilities of these very same men to choose wisely their own representatives. Does the Minister question their ability to choose the men they want to represent them or is it the case that he questions their ability to choose the men he might want to represent them?</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that there should be a single non-transferable vote.  Why is it that he is proposing to introduce this system of voting which is a major departure from the normal and traditional system of voting in Ireland?  Again, is there an element of doubt that our Defence Forces will not elect the right candidate and does this not represent mistrust of our Defence Forces and a backward step in our democratic system? I ask the Minister to urgently review this section and make the necessary alterations.</P>
    <P>A further requirement the Minister suggests of the representative body is that all meetings must be held within the particular camp or barracks.  I cannot understand the logic of that regulation.  Is it that the Minister feels that he must be able to control where and when the meetings take place or is there some more sinister motive?  I am a trade union member, a member of the INTO, and I am aware that one of the regulations in our union is that meetings must not take place in the workplace.  Yet, if the new representative body is established all meetings must take place within the confines of an Army barracks.</P>
    <P>The Minister further suggests that press releases and press statements from a representative body can only be issued from headquarters.  I suggest that the Minister is not allowing the representative body freedom and trusting them to behave in a responsible manner.  If a body is to be muzzled in this fashion then I ask the Minister what will their function be and to what extent will they represent the men who day after day, week after week, carry out their duties in a professional manner but, unfortunately, do not receive the pay and allowances worthy of their role.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> The Minister suggested in his document that subscriptions may be collected from the members of the Defence Forces. However, he did not indicate how this money would be used and for what purpose it should be spent.  I suggest that if a representative body is to function in a worth-while manner they require expertise from outside to negotiate conditions, pay claims and so on.  There does not appear to be any facility in the Bill to take account of that.  Furthermore, if all meetings are to take place within the confines of an Army barracks or unit how will civilian personnel, the paid employees of this organisation, gain access?  The Minister has made an error and I should like to ask him to redress it.</P>
    <P>In recent media statements the Minister said that PDFORRA were a self-imposed group and were not representative of the Defence Forces.  I suggest that even though elections have not yet taken place the PDFORRA group have been authorised by an excess of 8,000 soldiers to act on their behalf, to arrange for democratic elections to take place and to arrange to establish a representative body.  Surely a mandate of that proportion does not mean that the soldiers are represented by a self-imposed group.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to meet the PDFORRA representatives now to discuss the problems.  I appeal to him not to wait until the Bill has been pushed through the Dáil.  He should not wait until we have a polarisation of positions and a confrontation developing.  I ask the Minister to move now before it is too late and to demonstrate his sincerity in finding a just and equitable solution to this difficulty. Only recently I heard the Minister calling on Unionists in Northern Ireland to enter into dialogue to bring about a lasting peace there.  I should like to ask the Minister to show his faith in dialogue by immediately arranging to meet with the PDFORRA group either officially or unofficially or, perhaps, through a mediator.  The important thing is that he should set up a forum for discussion to bring about an amicable solution to the <Col N="304" /> formation of a representative body within the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Deputy Stagg I should like to state that I had hoped at some stage to call on one member of the Independent group, Deputy Foxe, and perhaps Deputy Stagg would consider the position of that Deputy who has been in the Chamber for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>With the agreement of the House, I propose to share my time with Deputy Foxe.  I should like to preface my remarks by paying tribute to the Permanent Defence Forces who have supported the civil authority faithfully since their foundation.  I should like to congratulate them on their peace-keeping role at an international level.  I would like to see their role expanded into the social area and that there would be a defensive rather than an offensive policy behind the formation of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>While I welcome this enabling legislation I regret that the Minister did not grasp the nettle and deal with all the problems concerning the Defence Forces.  I regret the restrictiveness of the provisions of the Bill.  However I should like to contrast the provisions in the Bill with the position of the Minister's predecessor who, by his repeated statements that no such body was needed, desirable or allowable and by his stone-walling tactics, permitted the morale in the Army to drop to its lowest ebb ever.</P>
      <P>The Bill must be viewed in conjunction with the Government's proposals, available in the Library, to produce regulations under the provisions of the Bill. Those too will add up to an unacceptable, restrictive and impotent structure.  If the proposals are implemented we will have an inhouse organisation, a tame pet of the gurus of the Department whose teeth have been extracted, who will be under the thumb of the gurus in the Department. This reminds me of the invitation from the spider to the fly to come into his parlour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demand of the members of the Defence Forces is an unstoppable one <Col N="305" /> and the Minister, and the Government, would be foolish to attempt to stop it. They want a democratic representative association with teeth that will be an effective voice for the serving soldiers. Nothing short of that will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I should like to reflect on the history of what gave rise to this demand, and the Coalition Government can take no credit for the concessions they are now forced to make.  A previous Fianna Fáil Minister blankly refused to contemplate the establishment of such an association.  He made false promises prior to the last election of substantial pay increases for the members of the Defence Forces in an attempt to diffuse the situation.  Those pay increases were not granted.  As a result of the poor pay, soldiers and their families had to resort to borrowing from moneylenders to sustain themselves.  That was very prevalent in my constituency.  We must bear in mind that there were huge security risks involved in that.  Gardaí who work side by side with soldiers on similar duties receive five times the rate of pay that soldiers earn.  Soldiers, of necessity, take a greater risk in the security duties they carry out but their rates of pay are miserable.</P>
    <P>It is important to highlight that at a time when the pay of our soldiers is very low the Government have paid £1 million on a Ray Ryder System of ground to air missiles.  I understand, from an authoritative source, that those missiles are only suitable for use in warm climates. The four missiles we have cost £60,000 each, they cannot be used if it is raining or windy.  That type of waste was taking place in the Department of Defence at a time when our soldiers were approaching moneylenders to try to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>It is not out of the ordinary for soldiers to have to work between 60 and 70 hours each week.  They are not paid overtime, and some of the duties were not described as &ldquo;duties&rdquo; with the result that they were not paid duty pay.  It is not uncommon for soldiers to work 70 hours in one week for a flat rate of pay.  The duty pay is a pittance in comparison to what would be a normal overtime rate.  The housing for <Col N="306" /> soldiers is a public scandal.  I have no doubt that if health board officials were allowed to survey the living quarters for soldiers and their families, they would condemn them as unfit for human habitation. At the time as money was being wasted on useless surface to air missiles, soldiers were left in such hovels.  The health care, minimal as it was, available to soldiers was further restricted.  The archaic and muddled contradictory Army regulations were further used by the Department and by those in charge to make life for soldiers unbearable.  These are the reasons the demands arose.  In desperation the army wives formed NASA.</P>
    <P>It was the conditions I have described and the intransigence of the Minister's predecessor and his refusal to accept the realities that caused the Army spouses to take to the streets.  It was the gross exploitation of the weakness of the members of the Permanent Defence Forces, without an association, that gave rise to the unstoppable demands for that association.  It was the participation of the Army wives in the electoral process which frightened the electoral daylights out of Fianna Fáil &mdash; in my constituency &mdash; where they could no longer count on the huge block vote when the postal votes were open which forced them to recognise the reality.  No credit is due to this Coalition Government because anything they are conceding has been squeezed out of them.</P>
    <P>Despite all of this there was continued prevarication and delay.  Expectations were raised about an association and about pay, but there was no action.  A vacuum was created by the Government. In that situation and in exasperation, the members of the Defence Forces formed PDFORRA.  It was established, it exists, and it is a reality that 8,000 members plus of the Defence Forces have joined and given allegiance to that association. While there is no legislative framework for it, the demand for a right to determine the form of their own association is now stronger and I believe should be heard through that association.</P>
    <P>Government inaction, Government <Col N="307" /> exploitation, Government stonewalling and Government prevarication led to all of this.  At the door of the Government must lie all the blame.  The Government's reaction is an ill conceived and hasty attempt not to deal with the situation but to turn back the tide.  I am convinced it is the gurus in the Department of Defence rather than the Minister who attempts to turn back the tide.  I want to assure them that their chance of turning back that tide is as good as the man with the three pronged fork who tried to do so long ago.  What is being done is an attempt to restrict and limit the association, to leave it powerless and meaningless.  I want to assure the Minister and the House that that will not be acceptable to the members of the Defence Forces.  I also want to assure him that it will not work.</P>
    <P>The Bill before this House, viewed in conjunction with the Minister's letter of 20 February 1990 and circulated with the regulations to every member of the Defence Forces, represents an attempt to present a <i>fait accompli</i> without negotiation, without discussion, without consultation. Many aspects of the Bill and the regulations are so restrictive as to make them unacceptable and, in some instances, unconstitutional.  I should like to give some examples.</P>
    <P>Regulation 7 (a) requires a candidate to be of good disciplinary standard.  Due to the selective &mdash; I stress the word selective &mdash; operation of the antiquated disciplinary code, an exemplary soldier could be found less than good.  A soldier can be paraded literally for no reason.  Every time he is paraded a black mark is put down against his character even if he is exonerated when paraded.  If he speaks to his local TD about a housing matter or any other problem totally unrelated to his business as a soldier that is an offence of which he can be charged.  If a button is missing off his uniform he can be put on parade.  If an officer decides that he has not the correct hairstyle he can be put on parade.  If he has family difficulties, totally unrelated to the Army, he can be put on parade.  If he has certain types of loans he can be put on parade.  I believe <Col N="308" /> candidates could be excluded from being candidates by being put on parade on these types of non-important issues.  I believe that the members &mdash; not the officers, or the Department of Defence &mdash; should decide who the candidates are and they have a democratic and constitutional right to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the circulated regulations on electoral process demonstrates that the Department of Defence intend to organise, run and operate the total electoral process.  I believe that members of the Permanent Defence Forces are quite capable of organising their own election and that they will demonstrate that to the Department of Defence in the very near future.  This is a futher attempt by the Department to cling to the type of overall control they had previously.  I would be most anxious that any regulations would provide for a PR type election so that no artificial majorities could control the total association.  Given the no strike clause, with which everybody agrees, I think it is most important that arbitration on the matters affecting the association would be binding as referred to in annex D of the regulations.  In relation to the constitutionality of some of the measures proposed, including the regulations, I support my comrade, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who spoke eloquently and definitively on the matter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Bill is seriously flawed, it is inoperable and there are serious constitutional questions about it so that a very serious question mark is placed over the whole process.  The regulations circulated by the Minister through the Chief of Staff to the Permanent Defence Forces, are unacceptable and are an attempt to usurp the rights of members and their representatives.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to withdraw this Bill and to negotiate with PDFORRA who now represent 8,000 Permanent Defence Force members.  I believe an agreed formula can be found if such negotiations were to take place on the structures and the scope of association. There may be technical difficulties for the Minister in actually negotiating with PDFORRA, but there is an <Col N="309" /> independent review body established and in place on which all are represented and which could be used as a negotiating machine.  Also the Minister has been offered the good offices of my colleague, Deputy Ryan.  If all these avenues were explored it would be possible for the Minister to come back here with agreement on all sides, and that would be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I should warn the Minister and the House if he goes ahead we will have another fiasco.  Nobody will join the association the Minister is proposing, nobody will run for elections to the body the Minister is proposing, and nobody will vote to elect anybody to that body. These are the reasons the Labour Party put down a considered amendment on Second Stage; we could not support the Bill in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for arranging time and my gratitude to Deputy Stagg for giving me some of his time.  At the outset I would like to compliment the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  It is long overdue.  Over the last few days a number of Deputies have given many and varied reasons the Bill was introduced. The mere fact that it is here is more important than the reasons for its introduction.</P>
      <P>In June 1989 the Army body decided that an organisation, an association, or an affiliation, should be formed through which they would be allowed to express their grievances on two main issues, namely, pay and conditions.  In that month their organisation, known as PDFORRA, was set up.  In the meantime, out of 11,200 men and officers approximately 8,000 have joined PDFORRA.  We should bear in mind that between 700 and 800 men are overseas at the moment and that it is conceivable that if they were free to join, the ranks at the moment would be in the region of 8,600 to 8,700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's idea of an association resembles closely the ideas the men had, and while there is agreement on many points there is disagreement on a few major points.  The Minister has suggested that there should be three associations, <Col N="310" /> one to represent the officers, one to represent the NCOs and one to represent the men.  On the face of it that sounds very democratic.  However, the Army men say that what they want is two associations, one to represent the officers and one to represent the NCOs and men.  The reasoning there is that the NCOs by dint of the years of their experience may be more vocal in voicing their disapproval of certain matters, whereas the ordinary soldier due to lack of experience, and Army life being what it is, might be a little more fearful in voicing disagreement with a superior officer.</P>
    <P>The second point of disagreement is with the way complaints and grievances should be aired.  The Minister's idea is that grievances should be aired through the chain of command from the officers right to the top.  That would be very unfair.  If a soldier had a complaint he could not expect an officer who might have a grudge against him to go and make a case for him at HQ.  That would be unreasonable.  In PDFORRA there would be three levels, barrack level, command level and national level.  If a complaint could not be resolved at barrack level it would go on from there to command level and then to national level and from there representatives would bring the matter to HQ.  We must bear in mind that the association designed by PDFORRA would have NCOs and men at all those levels and they would bypass the command chain.  It is grossly unfair of the Minister to try and inflict on a body of people an association in which the officers would deal with the complaints before anyone at a higher level heard about them.  Human nature being what it is, an officer with a grudge against an individual or unit could take a long awaited chance to get his own back on the unit or individual.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Defence Forces were well organised would not mean that their services would be adversely affected.  In fact, the opposite would be the case.  Men represented by an association they want will be more contented and a better job will be done.  The problem in many factories and other work places arises when <Col N="311" /> management tries to use the big knuckle and inflict their ideas on the workforce rather than listening and getting suggestions from the workforce.</P>
    <P>If this Bill passes, PDFORRA will be disbanded.  Does that also mean that the Association of Army Spouses will be disbanded? That association did trojan work for the menfolk and their families last year.  People might say that it would be sexist to disband the association.  Be that as it may, it is not a good idea to disband an association the men want just because the Minister decided to inflict another association on them.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have gone through the various sections, so I will not bore the House with the details of them.  One section says that members on active service may not represent others in the Defence Forces and that those on active service may not be represented by this association. Section 5 bugs me.  That is where it is proposed that the Minister may introduce certain regulations which may enable certain ranks to voice certain disagreements and that those disagreements are to be specified by the Minister.  If the Minister tried diligently to be vague he could not have been more vague than in that section.</P>
    <P>The Army and other Defence Forces have provided many services to the community over the years apart from defence services.  During CIE strikes and refuse collection strikes the Army have come to the fore.  In times of flooding they evacuate both people and animals from waterlogged areas.  Two years ago there was a refuse collectors' strike in Dublin. During that period Ireland sent a senior boxing team to Poland and one of the members of the team was an Army man. Twice in the week during which he travelled to Warsaw that man had to work 24 hours a day and then face a Pole, a man from one of the greatest boxing nations in the world, on the Sunday afternoon. That was demanding a lot from that man.  If the Minister has any doubt that an association formed by Army men would lead to trouble in the ranks, he should take solace from the fact that the <Col N="312" /> sense of duty of Army men and of the Defence Forces in general would always outstrip any other demands.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing the Bill.  There are a few points of difference between what the Minister has suggested and what the Army want.  If those points are not resolved we could be faced with a situation similar to the rod licence dispute which prevailed in the past two and a half years.  Of a total of 11,200 men, 8,500 men have joined a new association and that shows that that association has the backing of the rank and file.  I hope the Minister has more consultation with those men.  If he does this there will be less confrontation in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Defence Bill.  I want to say at the outset that I regard this Bill as a crossroads in the history of the Irish Army who have served this country well.  Since the foundation of the State they have been loyal to our institutions and they have done this country proud both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Coming from the midlands I am very conscious of the Army presence there. This is mainly due to the military barracks which are situated at Longford, Athlone and Mullingar.  The late General Seán Mac Eoin served in the Irish Army and I am proud that after 25 years I have been elected to hold the Fine Gael seat in Longford once held by that famous Irishman.</P>
      <P>While it is not directly related to this Bill it would be remiss of me if I did not mention, as I did on a previous occasion, the standing of the Army at Connolly Barracks in Longford.  When I raised this issue before I emphasised to the Minister the importance of the Army presence in Longford which has added to the commercial, sporting and social life of the area.  I hope that the rumours circulated about the closure of Longford barracks are nothing worse than rumours.  I want to again put on the record of the House my total support for the continuation of the Army presence at Connolly Barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute at this stage <Col N="313" /> to the duty and service given by our Army.  At many times of crisis the Army have come to the rescue and aided civil authorities through their expertise and manpower.  In their military role they have given security and aid to the Garda, during the course of their duties.  They have also added in many ways to sporting and other forms of entertainment.</P>
    <P>Since their foundation the Army have stood by this State and have added to its security.  We should not forget the role our Army plays in world peace.  Our forces have served with distinction and honour in troubled areas throughout the world on many occasions.  We should not forget their loyalty and bravery in bringing honour to themselves and their country and peace to many lands.  At all times they have proved, with very limited resources, that they can hold their own with any of the other armed forces in the world.  I have no doubt that this is due to the overall loyalty and dedication of the Army members.</P>
    <P>I have continually mentioned the word &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; in my contribution which I believe is the key word in this debate.  It would be a grave mistake for any Minister or Government to create a situation where this loyalty could be undermined. I plead with the Minister to have the utmost consultation with army personnel in regard to this matter.  Like many other Deputies I have been approached in recent days by members of PDFORRA and NASA who have raised their opposition to and misgivings about this Bill.  Surely the Government and the Minister are aware of the dangers of bad legislation.  I did not want to remind the House of the recent example of bad legislation and the confusion caused by the rod licence issue but perhaps it is necessary to raise the matter and to point out to the Minister how bad legislation, which is not acceptable to those whom it concerns, can create much damage.  Therefore, it is very necessary for the Minister to take every issue into consideration at this point.</P>
    <P>The requests being made by PDFORRA are very reasonable.  For many years the Army members have not <Col N="314" /> been given the recognition and conditions they deserve.  Their pay and conditions have been improved but we all want them to be improved further.  I want members of the Army to be given the same conditions and opportunities as people in other areas of the public service.  While I agree that the framework and operations of the Army are different from those of other services, consultation should be broadened in order to give members of the Army the right to have their grievances aired and their conditions discussed.</P>
    <P>The present membership of PDFORRA is 8,000 out of a total possible membership of 9,500.  The Minister must be fully aware of the importance of this body in maintaining the normal day to day morale of Army members.  I have every confidence that if the Minister avails of this opportunity to satisfy the members of the Army in their reasonable and worthwhile demands he will be going a long way in taking the Army into a new era.  If he fails on this occasion to recognise the wishes of at least 8,000 members of the Army he will be making a grave mistake and in doing so will put the morale of the Army into disarray.  I know that the Minister is a very reasonable man and has vast experience in public life.  I hope that on this occasion he will show an awareness of the importance of the issues involved in this Bill and recognise these necessary demands.  If he does this he will be paving the way for the continuation of an Army we can all be proud of and, more importantly, in which the members can have pride.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of this Bill the wives of Army personnel will not have to picket outside Leinster House as they had to do yesterday and will not have to go from door to door seeking votes for their candidates at election time.  This State owes a great debt to the Army and its members.  We should honour this debt by ensuring that any legislation introduced here seeks to improve rather than disimprove and has the full backing and support of all Members of the House and of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>As this is the 100th anniversary of the <Col N="315" /> birth of Michael Collins who was the founder of the Irish Army, the Minister should go a long way in meeting the demands of the Army in order to keep up their morale.</P>

      <P>Back in the sixties Bob Dylan sang a song entitled &ldquo;The Times They Are A-Changin' &rdquo;.  Around the time that song was popular I came in contact with the armed forces through my membership of the FCA.  I was a member of the A Company, 20th Batallion, in Griffith Barracks.  This was a very important experience for me as a young man. As a member of the FCA many barrack doors were opened to me which gave me an insight into Army life.  I attended annual camps at Baldonnel, Gormanston, Cathal Brugha Barracks and Kilbride.  There was a more recent visit to Collins Barracks last week by six Deputies from The Workers' Party. There was a 30 year gap between that visit and my initial contact with the armed forces in the sixties.  I must say that the times are indeed a-changing, but in some respects only.  Some of the incredible conditions of the sixties, low pay, for example, have not changed significantly to this day.  Except for the prospect of serving overseas with the UN and thereby earning an exta few shillings, Army life for many of the personnel would be intolerable and many probably would not stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions of the sixties in the area of low pay are still relevant today.  Many Army men have been reduced to using the services of money lenders.  That and the fact that income is so low that many members of the Defence Forces qualify for family income support supplement have been widely publicised.  Is this the way we should be treating men who put <Col N="316" /> their lives at risk for this country, particularly when they serve overseas on behalf of the UN and indeed daily in the Border areas, daily assisting the Garda Síochána in trying to keep criminal gunmen and Provisional IRA terrorists under control?</P>
    <P>The live-in accommodation available to recruits in Collins Barracks catapulted me back 30 years.  The appalling conditions there seem not to have changed since the barracks was built in 1701.  In fact in 1701 the conditions were probably far superior to the conditions prevailing today; at least in 1701 it was a new structure. The dry rot-infested floors in the dormitory areas were not a feature then, nor were the miserable conditions, the state of maintenance, the broken windows, the unpainted, shabby walls, the broken and dangerous stairs, the broken tiles in the bathrooms.  It is an insult to expect our armed forces to live in such conditions.  The sparsely furnished commonroom was more like a cell in Mountjoy with a single television sitting on a table in meagre, miserable surroundings; there was nothing homely about that environment.</P>
    <P>It is the total political neglect of the men who spend their days in conditions like this that has resulted in the formation of the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association, known as PDFORRA.  I would like to ask what real changes have been effected since the sixties when I was familiar with the various barracks in Dublin.  Griffith Barracks no longer accommodates those unfortunate enough to be homeless as it did in the sixties when armed guards had to usher away from the barracks the husbands of the unfortunate families as they could not stay with their wives and children after 6 p.m.  The Dublin Housing Action Committee put an end to that situation.  In Griffith Barracks and in Cathal Brugha Barracks Army men and their families were housed in married quarters in the most Dickensian conditions that I have ever seen in the country.  I have vivid memories of the Cathal Brugha Barracks married quarters, as I have of the married quarters in Griffith Barracks.  The communal toilets, <Col N="317" /> the communal washing areas, the communal outdoor clothes lines were a sight to politicise any young FCA member.</P>
    <P>What has changed is that the men and their spouses have stood together and said that enough is enough and they demand their rights.  Minor progress has been made in that Griffith Barracks is now for sale on the open market and the married quarters in Cathal Brugha Barracks have, thankfully, been demolished. One would have to ask what muddled thinking there is in the mind of the Minister that Griffith Barracks remains unsold and that in regard to Cathal Brugha Barracks which was to have been put on the open market in the seventies and the troops moved to Gormanston, only a tiny portion of the holdings, the former married quarters site, has been disposed of?  Collins Barracks is now in this limbo not knowing whether it is coming or going because it is reportedly for sale.  Perhaps the Minister could throw some light on what Government policy is in regard to the three Army barracks and perhaps he would develop this point by telling us what developments he has in mind for modern barracks throughout the country, particularly barracks that will accommodate the troops if they are moved out of Collins Barracks.</P>
    <P>We are at a historical crossroads in how we channel the rights and the demands of PDFORRA.  The Minister's fears of an organised, modern, negotiating body for armed forces personnel is not sustainable. Modern arms are not enough for our forces.  Modern structures with decent wages, decent conditions and decent modern everyday negotiating rights have to be afforded to them.  The stated fears of the Minister of State, Deputy Vincent Brady, that the formation of an association such as PDFORRA, with a system of organisation and control separate from the Defence Forces, would be incompatible with the system of command that is essential to our Defence Forces are totally unfounded.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party visit last week &mdash; which I believe was with the approval of <Col N="318" /> the Minister and for which I would like to record my thanks and appreciation on behalf of The Workers' Party &mdash; to the GHQ at Infirmary Road and our subsequent visit to Collins Barracks where we were met by the Commanding Officer and his team, illustrated for us the undying loyalty to the State of all ranks within the armed forces.  Let me point out in passing that The Workers' Party visit to Collins Barracks was the first official visit by any political party or group of TDs, and it was an experience that should be shared by my fellow parliamentarians in all parties.  That The Workers' Party were the first party to visit this barracks, which was built in 1701, which has continued in use as a military barracks and can claim to be the only such establishment still in full use in Europe and possibly in the world, only serves to highlight the total political abandonment that must have been felt down through the years by members of the armed forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at an historical crossroads.  The issues are who will be allowed to represent the men and how independent the Minister will allow them to be.  PDFORRA's is the voice the men want to represent them in negotiations on pay and conditions.  Deputy McCartan has documented for the House the numbers of the various ranks in the command areas, Naval and Air Corps.  PDFORRA have the vast majority of members supporting them, in excess of 8,000.  It will be a disaster if my party's reservations about this Bill are not satisfied and I repeat our demand for assurances.  We have stated that PDFORRA should be allowed active consultation and negotiations with the Minister on the proposals the Minister has now put before <Col N="319" /> the House.  With the consultations involving direct negotiations the Minister will get a formula which he can present to this House in time in regulation form.  These men represent the <i>creme de la creme</i> of the armed forces.  They have outstanding qualities.  The Minister should be careful not to sacrifice them in favour of Department puppets or eunuchs.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that good, strong management, welcomes strong representation and from both a strong representative body and a strong management structure he will get the best results.  Let the Minister do the noble thing and go out and talk to PDFORRA, sit down and create a climate for progress and conciliation.  He should not provoke confrontation.  It is ominous to hear reports that at the Whip's meeting tonight the Government intend to apply a guillotine on Committee and Report Stages.  That would be a disaster.</P>
      <P>It would seem that the Minister and the Chief of Staff have calculated the Government's proposals in the document <i>Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups.</i> Has the Minister already made up his mind?  Is he speaking honestly when he suggests he is open to have his mind changed?  It is essential that there be two representative groups, one for NCOs and privates and one for officers, not three bodies as proposed by the Minister. PDFORRA propose to proceed with their election by ballot, the papers for which will be circulated on 30 March next and the vote will be counted on Saturday, 4 April.  I appeal to the Minister not to interfere, not to try to preempt this election.  If he does he will be provoking totally the Forces from whom he expects loyalty in the future and they will have a very important role in future events.  I ask him to acommodate them by not imposing a guillotine on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always regarded, as I am sure has every other Member of the House, the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, as a man who enjoys the respect and admiration of Deputies on all sides of this House.  Now he will require all his <Col N="320" /> considerable political skill and diplomatic experience to deal with the very serious current situation in the Defence Forces. The blame for the appalling mess in the Defence Forces must be shared by all members of the last Government and the responsibility for dealing with the situation lies collectively with all members of the new Government.  The greatest mistake the Government could make would be to underestimate that seething discontent or to hope that if it is ignored it will go away.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces have been one of the most reliable and stable institutions in the State, but it is no exaggeration to say that the stability of the Defence Forces is being threatened by the failure of the Government to deal adequately with the problem of pay and conditions. The discontent and dissatisfaction did not originate in the life of the last Government but they came to a head under that administration.  Successive Governments have always been quick to pay ritual tribute to the great work done by members of the Defence Forces, but the same Governments have refused to put their money where their mouths were by ensuring that members of the Army, Navy and Air Corps were paid a wage appropriate to the onerous and responsible tasks they are asked to perform. Apart from normal duties the Defence Forces have been asked to perform policing duties along the border, at prisons and at important installations.  They are expected to provide air and sea rescue service and to police our fishing grounds. Of course, governments have been quick to call on them to provide emergency services in the event of industrial disputes. Despite this, the Government have failed to ensure that the Defence Forces personnel are paid wages appropriate to their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most rank and file soldiers earn well below the average industrial wage and an Army captain who might have responsibility for 100 men or more would be earning well below what an executive with similar responsibilities in civil life would make.  The poor salaries paid to officers <Col N="321" /> and other highly skilled technical personnel has led to a virtual brain drain and consequent major problems for both the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  Clearly it does not make sense for the State to invest large sums of money in training officers if they are offered rates of pay which provide no incentive to stay in the Defence Forces.  The majority of soldiers, however, know that with nearly a quarter of a million people unemployed there is no prospect of alternative employment in civilian life and they have, quite rightly, turned to campaigning for improved pay and conditions.</P>
    <P>The response of the Department of Defence to the legitimate grievances of the soldiers has simply worsened the situation.  The recommendations of the review body were totally inadequate.  An attempt by the last Government to present them as something they were not caused considerable resentment.  The decision to increase the buy-out rates and to abolish the outpost allowance for certain personnel added insult to injury.  In these circumstances and against the background of continued refusal of the Department to consider the establishment of a representative body, it is not surprising that the Army Wives Association should have got off the ground and that the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association should have been established.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to accept that there is no action they can take to legally prevent members of the Defence Forces from establishing a representative body.  The right of members of the Defence Forces to establish a representative body was explicity recognised in a report of the Legal Affairs Committee of the European Parliament in 1984 who noted that the absence of any such body in Ireland was based, not on legal prohibition, but on traditional discipline. Given the appallingly shoddy way in which members of the Defence Forces have been treated by successive Governments, it is not surprising that some personnel have taken the unilateral decision to establish a representative association.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> Soldiers are simply citizens in uniform and are entitled to the same democratic rights given to other citizens.  The Department of Defence should now accept the inevitable, recognise the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks and Representative Association and seek to establish a working relationship with them.  The representative bodies have posed no threat to order or discipline in the Garda Síochána and there is no reason for the one now established in the Defence Forces not to play a similar constructive role.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way since the establishment of the body by the Garda Síochána.  I understand that heavy handed attempts were made then by the Department of Justice to prevent the formation of the Garda representative body but nowadays people, military or civilians, are much more aware of their rights.  Soldiers and their families, as the events of the past 12 months have shown, are not prepared to be pushed around. My advice to the Minister is not to push them any further or he will risk a series of events which could lead to confrontation.</P>
    <P>The Government and the civilian armchair generals in Parkgate Street should drag themselves into the 20th century and realise that when a man or women puts on a military uniform they should not be expected to surrender all their democratic rights.  The sooner they do that the sooner we will have a return to an acceptable level of morale in the Defence Forces.  A debate on the Defence Forces should not be allowed to pass without the House paying tribute to the personnel who are serving overseas with various UN peacekeeping contingents, especially those with UNIFIL, who face constant danger.  In recent times the Irish contingent with UNIFIL have paid a high price with loss of life in their efforts to bring peace to the region.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government have at last conceded the principle that there should be a formal association to represent the interests of members of our Defence Forces.  However, the Bill as drafted and presented to the House is bitterly disappointing.  It is ill considered, <Col N="323" /> poorly thought out and unnecessarily narrow and restrictive.  I do not know if this Bill seriously represents the personal and political opinions of the Minister.  It may well be that it has been nobbled by the Department's bureaucrats but it is clear that the Minister has failed to match his generous promise of recent weeks with similarly generous legislation.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister and the Government that they should not underestimate the seriousness of the situation. PDFORRA represent the overwhelming majority of enlisted personnel and they are totally dissatisfied with the terms of the Bill which are simply not acceptable to them.  The Minister has only two alternatives; he can withdraw the Bill and go back to the drawing board or he must publicly announce that there will be sweeping changes in the Bill when it reaches Committee Stage.  If he does neither and persists with this ill considered Bill he and the Government are likely to find themselves on a collision course with a large number of Defence Force personnel, leading to unprecedented conflict and chaos within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Bill clearly reflects a Victorian attitude to the Defence Forces and fails to recognise that soldiers are simply citizens in uniform and entitled to the same democratic rights as others.  Under the terms of the Bill virtually all the crucial decisions regarding the organisation's structure and powers of the representative bodies will be made by the Minister for Defence instead of the members.  This House and the members of PDFORRA are effectively being asked to give the Minister a blank cheque before he has shown what is on offer.</P>
    <P>All the detailed requirements under the Bill will be implemented by ministerial order and, to make matters worse, the format used in section 7 is negative as it says that a regulation made by the Minister will come into effect unless a resolution is passed within 21 days by both Houses of the Oireachtas annulling it.</P>
    <P>One of the most essential changes <Col N="324" /> required in the Bill is an amendment to section 7 to ensure that the Dáil will have the opportunity of debating any draft regulations and that a regulation will not come into effect until a motion approving it has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned that the Bill prohibits the proposed bodies from being associated with or affiliated to a trade union or other body without the consent of the Minister.  This is a quite unnecessary restriction.  The Garda representative bodies are affiliated to the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations and this has not caused any problems.  The new Defence Forces body should be free to decide for themselves what body, international or domestic, they want to be affiliated to.  Why should they not be free to affiliate to the ICPSA if they so wish or indeed to seek some sort of special relationship with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?</P>

If he is we are on a disaster course because PDFORRA will not quietly disappear into the sunset.  The Minister is gravely mistaken if he believes that this will happen.</P>
      <P>The crucial issue is that the Minister has the courage and the capacity to break the stifling influence of senior civil servants and Army brass hats who have a rigid and authoritarian position of opposing all changes.  If he can do that agreement will be reached between the Minister and PDFORRA on the measures needed to provide genuinely representative structures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The intention behind the Bill is good.  The Minister set out in the right spirit with a view to providing proper representation for members of the Permanent Defence Forces.  However, as we heard time and time again in the House, things have gone horribly wrong in the meantime.  Instead of a harmonious change to a system of representation which is badly needed, the Minister is now at loggerheads with Army personnel. Indeed, I am in full agreement with Deputy Nealon that the Minister should defer consideration of the Bill until such time as the Gleeson Report has been published in a couple of months' time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mervyn Taylor gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the Private Notice Question with regard to the death sentence imposed on a journalist in Iraq for alleged espionage.  Deputy Taylor has ten minutes to present his case and the Minister of State has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to express my thanks and appreciation to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this most tragic matter on the Adjournment. I hope some good may come of it.  The matter concerns a journalist with the <i>Observer</i> newspaper of London, Mr. Bazoft.  Mr. Bazoft arrived in Baghdad to carry out a reporting mission for his newspaper, the <i>Observer</i> of London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> When he arrived he heard that a major explosion had taken place at a military complex south of Baghdad and that up to 700 people were killed.  As any newspaper reporter would do, he set off to report on the matter for his newspaper. He was given a lift to that area by a friend, Mrs. Parish, a nurse working in Baghdad.  I understand that many other journalists and an ITN newsteam also tried to get through to cover the same explosion but they were intercepted and turned back whereas Mr. Bazoft managed to get through with the aid of Mrs. Parish.  He was arrested and brought before a military revolutionary court charged with espionage.  No evidence was presented to the hearing which was conducted inquisitorial style before a military tribunal, no witnesses were called and no media, newspapers or news coverage was allowed to be present at his trial, nor was his own newspaper allowed to provide a lawyer to assist him with his defence.  He was sentenced to death and Mrs. Parish who gave him the lift was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The system that operates in Iraq, as I understand it, is that there is no appeal to any superior tribunal and only the President of Iraq, who in effect is the dictator of Iraq, Mr. Saddam Hussein, has the power to commute that sentence of death.  In accordance with the practice that operates in Iraq, that sentence could be summarily carried out at any time and an announcement made later that it had been carried out.  That is why this matter is so particularly urgent and why I am asking the Minister to make immediate and urgent representations to the President of Iraq for a reprieve for this unfortunate man who, quite clearly, is no spy but was carrying out the normal function of a journalist.  This is a harsh and brutal sentence but entirely in accord with the kind of activities the Iraqis have been getting up to in recent years.</P>
    <P>You will recall, a Cheann Comhairle, that an Amnesty report on Iraq found that 30 different types of torture are used there, some of which are too ghastly to <Col N="327" /> mention.  The racial attacks on the Kurdish nation in Iraq have been well documented. Many thousands have been killed and it is estimated that 3,000 towns and villages where the Kurds live have been destroyed.  In the town of Hama 20,000 members of a tribe were decimated and killed, and that was reported in the media over the years.  That is the kind of regime we are dealing with here. President Saddam Hussein is not a person to be motivated by compassion but he may be influenced to grant a reprieve by political pressure and political requests.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have quite a substantial trade exchange with Iraq and do an appreciable volume of trading with them. I would ask the Minister to tell the House that he will point out to President Saddam Hussein that this kind of brutality, the kind of trial conducted there and imposing the death sentence with no appeal for an alleged trumped-up charge of espionage in peace time, is repugnant to the basic humanitarian feelings of the Irish people.  He should also point out that we would have to review our trading activities with that country unless a reprieve is granted.  I would go further and ask the Minister, now that we hold the Presidency of the EC, to use that position to bring EC pressure to bear when making representations to the President of Iraq for clemency for this man. The Minister should ask him also, although it is not specifically on the subject but it is connected, to remit the savage sentence of 15 years' imprisonment on the nurse, Mrs. Parish, when all she did was to give the journalist a lift into the zone where this explosion had taken place.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Iraqis may be sensitive about their military activities. We know they conducted a prolonged brutal and bloody war with Iran in which, it is estimated, 500,000 people lost their lives.  We know they used chemical weapons of a destructive nature in that war and that they are planning to manufacture nuclear warheads.  All or any of those military facilities may have been involved in the explosion in that military <Col N="328" /> zone, but in a time of peace, nothing warrants the imposition of the death sentence, something we abolished in all but a very few cases in this country and in respect of which a commitment is being given by the Government to introduce legislation.  I am glad to be able to say that abolishing the death penalty offence of any kind is right and proper in a modern civilised society.</P>
    <P>If this man's life is to be saved, speed and pressure are essential.  We should point out to the President of Iraq that his trading links with this country, and indeed with the EC, could be jeopardised if he allows this sentence of death to be carried out on the journalist, Mr. Bazoft who, I am quite sure, in his cell in Baghdad, is relying on the media and freedom loving, civilised countries such as Ireland to bring pressure to bear against that kind of tyranny.  I hope the Minister will respond positively and indicate that he will take strong and urgent steps against this savagery.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom a rá go gcuirim fáilte roimh an tsuim atá ag an Teachta Taylor sa chás seo a bhaineann leis an Uasal Bazoft.  I welcome the interest which the House and Deputy Taylor are taking in the case of the Iranian born journalist, Mr. Farzad Bazoft who on 10 March was sentenced to death in Iraq for alleged espionage.  Deputies will recall that a British citizen, Mrs. Daphne Ann Parish, was sentended to 15 years imprisonment on the same occasion and an Iraqi codefendant was sentenced to ten years.  As has been outlined this evening by Deputy Taylor, the charges arose out of an unauthorised visit which Mr. Bazoft, a journalist with the <i>Observer</i> newspaper, and Mrs. Parish, a nurse at the Ibn Al Bitar Hospital in Baghdad, paid to a military establishment near Baghdad last September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has asked if the Minister for Foreign Affairs will make urgent representations to the Government of Iraq for a reprieve of the death sentence imposed on Mr. Bazoft.  I am pleased to <Col N="329" /> tell the House that the Minister acted very promptly in organising an appeal for clemency to the Iraqi authorities.</P>
    <P>It became known in the course of Saturday, 10 March that an Iraqi revolutionary court had sentenced Mr. Bazoft to death and Mrs. Parish to jail. The Minister and his Department secured the agreement of our partners in the Twelve to make an appeal on humanitarian grounds.  This appeal was made to the Iraqi authorities at 8.30 (Irish time) on Sunday morning on behalf of the Twelve members of the European Community by the Troika of EC ambassadors &mdash; that is the Irish Ambassador accompanied by the Ambassadors of France and Italy.</P>
    <P>The appeal for clemency which we made is based on humanitarian grounds. We earnestly appealed for clemency both for Mr. Bazoft and for Mrs. Parish and particularly asked that the death sentence on Mr. Bazoft not be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the need for speed when applying pressure.  We made it quickly &mdash; within 24 hours of sentence being passed &mdash; because we were very concerned at the extremely severe sentences passed on subjects of a member state and particularly at the possibility that the death sentence on Mr. Bazoft could be carried out at any time.</P>
    <P>In making the appeal, we have not made a judgment on whether the verdicts were justified.  Our concern has been to ask the Iraqi authorities to spare Mr. Bazoft's life and to exercise clemency in respect of both sentences.</P>
    <P>The ambassadors were received at high level in the Iraqi Foreign Ministry. The appeal for clemency was noted and the ambassadors were informed that it would be reported to higher authority.</P>
    <P>In making the appeal, we were conscious that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iraq is a party, provides that anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence. In the apparent absence of a provision for appeal from the judgment of a Revolutionary Court, as Deputy Taylor pointed out, the President of Iraq can <Col N="330" /> commute the sentence.  A request to the Iraqi authorities for clemency was thus the only option available to the Twelve in this case.</P>
    <P>The action of the Twelve in appealing for clemency has been echoed in the actions of others, including the Secretary-General of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>A man's life is at stake and is still at stake.  Our efforts are concentrated on acting in a way that will be most effective in saving his life and obtaining clemency for him and for Mrs. Parish.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope that these humanitarian appeals will be heard and that the sentences will be commuted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my gratitude to you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to discuss this matter with the Minister on the Adjournment this evening.  I will give a brief outline of the background.  The development of the mushroom industry has been spectacular, to say the least.  In 1980 the value of mushroom production was £5.4 million, last year it was £33 million and the projected figure for 1990 is somewhere in the region of £48 million.  This has to be looked on as an extremely dramatic development.  The market for fresh mushrooms is the real growth area and the processing of mushrooms accounts for somewhere in the region of 15 per cent to 20 per cent of total production.</P>
      <P>Our share of the UK market is increasing. In 1987, for example, it was 8.8 per cent but by 1989 it had grown to something around 11.5 per cent &mdash; I think that figure is slightly understated.  When you translate that into production at home it means that more than 75 per cent of our produce is sold on to the UK market. This is a truely frightening figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industry sources have told me that if the value of the Irish punt goes beyond 95p sterling, we will have a crisis on hands.  That means that tonight we have <Col N="331" /> a crisis on hands.  I am not exactly sure of the closing price of the Irish Punt this evening but I reckon it is worth about 97p sterling.  Companies who have been absorbing the loss of profits caused by the weakness in sterling are now passing that loss on to the growers and have told them so in no uncertain terms in the past week. If this continues it will most definitely lead to disastrous effects.</P>
    <P>I want to give the House an indication of what has been happening to the industry in the recent past.  Western Mushrooms, Roscommon, are in very serious trouble at this point, indeed I am not sure if they are still trading, I did not check it out today.  In Claremorris, eight growers have gone out of business already.  In Carbury it is projected that 18 growers will be forced out of business very shortly. Wexford have lost 26 growers in the past 12 months.  Indeed industry sources in Monaghan have informed me &mdash; this is the area I know best &mdash; that if sterling remains at its present level, not to mention if it gets worse, the average price to growers will be reduced to the level of basic costs and even below it.  They have informed me that a drop of 2p or 3p in the pound sterling will achieve this and they have projected that that is already in the pipeline and will be the case in a day or two.</P>
    <P>Growers are still paying off their original investment, which is quite large.  I suppose in Monaghan terms it would be described as huge &mdash; £10,000 per house &mdash; and that does not include site development costs which in some cases could be £25,000 or thereabouts.  The normal basic unit is three houses, below that you cannot function at all.  Therefore, the investment could be anything up to £50,000 for that kind of development. The optimum size is five houses, which gives an indication of the type of development we are talking about.  The small farmers in County Monaghan, and they are the people who have been involved in this, have laid their futures on the line in developing this industry.  They made the investment, and while they certainly <Col N="332" /> got assistance, they carry the responsibility. They are in no position whatever to handle what is happening at present. Even established growers are in no position to keep their heads above water.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for this.  One reason is that last summer was very fine. One would think that would be good for the mushroom growers, but in fact it was the reverse.  They had very poor crops because they could not control the heat. Growers were looking to the February, March, April period to make a recovery but that recovery is not on the way and will not happen.  Indeed I was informed today that one grower had to sell his car in order to prop up his business.  I am not being sensational, I have been told that reliably.  It looks as if we will have casualties and the scale of that scenario depends on the Government.  For the sake of the mushroom industry I hope that sterling recovers quickly.  That would be the most desirable outcome at present. If it does not recover, I want to know what contingency plans the Government and the Minister have to deal with this matter.  Indications are that the uncertainty which has centred around the British Prime Minister and her activities and attitudes, will continue to bedevil sterling.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor any of us have any control over that.  There is an urgent need to draw up a short-term emergency plan to support the industry.  What I would like to know is whether the Government plan to step in to put in place immediately a fund to support the growers to see them through the present crisis.  Indeed I demand, on behalf of the growers, that the Government immediately do so.  If they fail to do this the flagship of the horticultural industry will collapse before their eyes.  Those of us on the ground know that these are the facts. I have been approached by people who are looking for social welfare assistance at this time.  This is extremely sad.  The Minister must respond and it must be adequate.  I await his reply with interest this evening.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking about what I hope is a short-term crisis but we will not know <Col N="333" /> if this is the case until certain circumstances evolve.  There is a grave need to overhaul and revamp the industry with whom the Minister of State was in close contact recently.  I met him in Monaghan one day in February and I later discovered he was there on a serious mission, to discuss with mushroom growers the extent of the problem.  I am also aware that he is concerned about this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will further be aware of the lack of technology, particularly among growers.  Most growers cannot afford to instal coolers, and this is one of the reasons they sustained such heavy losses last summer.  Ninety-three per cent of growers have no cooling systems. Obviously they do not need such a system in the winter but in a fine summer they are totally and completely vulnerable. The level of research and development carried out by Teagasc on behalf of the industry is inadequate.  Its scale is far too small and this must be drastically improved.  Many of the older houses need to be upgraded as many of them are well over ten years old.  They need to be recovered and the fibreglass renewed.  I have been reliably informed that a grower with old housing stock would need to spend about £4,000 per house to bring them up to standard.  I understand that in America and Europe mushroom houses have a central unit for environmental control and this enables the producer to monitor environmental changes and therefore produce better crops more efficiently.  We have not even begun to consider such a unit here yet.</P>
    <P>In relation to markets, we have all our eggs in one basket as more than 75 per cent of our production goes to Britain, as I said.  This would now seem to be a foolish and unsustainable policy.  We need to diversify as a matter of urgency and look for new markets.  We need to make inroads into the French and German markets in order to provide a healthy base for the industry in the long term.  The mushroom sector is the flagship of the horticultural industry and if we are not careful we will have a Bord Glas but it is quite possible that we will <Col N="334" /> have no glas and that would be a shame. Therefore what needs to be done?</P>
    <P>There must be a contingency support fund for growers to keep them in business through the present crisis.  We must also introduce a system of grant aid to enable growers to bring old housing stock up to standard and grant aid must be extended to cover the introduction of essential new technology.  Teagasc also need to increase their investment in research and development and they must do so very quickly.  We also need to engage in aggressive marketing in order to get a better spread and control the development of the industry.  Even now there are too many companies competing in the one market.  Indeed there was price cutting in January with the result that companies were suffering.  Here I am talking about export markets but if we do not take these steps the mushroom industry will die and the Government will be held responsible for this.  That would be a shame.  I await the Minister's reply with interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by outlining the background to the growth of the mushroom industry which &mdash; and Deputy Cotter touched on this point &mdash; has been quite spectacular over a comparatively short period of time.</P>
      <P>The mushroom industry has expanded rapidly over the past decade from a base of 6,800 tonnes, valued at £6.3 million, in 1980 to 31,000 tonnes in 1989, valued at £35 million.  Of this production approximately 18,000 tonnes were exported to the UK.  These exports accounted for over 12 per cent of the UK market.  A further 4,000 tonnes were exported in a processed form to the Netherlands and Germany.  The balance of production was consumed on the domestic market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are five major compost companies and four major export companies in the country.  These companies have undertaken major investments in collection, storage, packaging and distribution systems.  This has allowed them to compete at the top end of the UK <Col N="335" /> market and meet the exacting standards for the supermarkets.  There are 540 growers in the country and the vast majority of these would market their produce through one or other of these exporting companies.  It is this totally integrated system and the professionalism of the exporting companies which has allowed us to expand the industry over the past decade.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the industry is very interdependent.  If growers are not making a profit there is a decreasing demand for compost and company profits will decrease.  Therefore it is very important when discussing the present difficulties within the industry to avoid laying the blame on one side or the other or creating any divisions between the companies and the growers.  A resolution of the current problems will only come about by the concerted action of all parties and that includes the various State agencies.</P>
    <P>The present difficulties facing the Irish mushroom industry have largely arisen from the very rapid depreciation of sterling over the past number of months and in particular since October 1989.  For the first nine months of 1989 the trade weighted exchange rate was 84p sterling to the Irish pound.  Currently the rate is in the order of 96p.  This results in a price drop of upwards of 6p per lb. to the Irish producer when the sterling price is converted to Irish currency.  It is this fact alone which is the cause of the problem.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks I have met with representatives of both the mushroom growers and exporting companies to discuss this problem and other associated matters.  Whilst the currency exchange rates are outside their control I impressed on them the need to tackle issues which are under their control i.e. their own costs and greater efficiency.  I have asked the compost companies to see if they can reduce their prices to the growers.  They however have indicated that they have little scope to reduce the price and have used the profits on the compost side to subsidise prices on mushrooms on <Col N="336" /> occasions.  It is worth noting that many growers are obtaining upwards of 20p per lb. less than the best growers because of the poorer quality product.  Other growers are obtaining yields of some 30 per cent lower than the best.  At this difficult time for the industry it is imperative that whatever scope for improvement exists is fully availed of.</P>
    <P>Like with all other industries the mushroom industry does not operate in a vacuum.  Ireland only accounts for 4 per cent of EC production and it should be noted that there has been a major increase in mushroom supplies on the UK market from a number of sources and this has led to a situation where it has been extremely difficult for Irish suppliers to get any increase in price from the UK supermarkets over the past year.</P>
    <P>Currency fluctuations are a risk which any exporter has to contend with.  The Minister for Finance has already stated in this House that it is the clear policy of this Government to link the exchange rate firmly within the European Monetary System.  In this way we can reduce inflationary pressures, achieve a stable low rate of inflation and, consequently, improve competitiveness.  The Government's pursuit of sound economic policies aimed at fostering a more competitive environment for Irish business are still in my view the most effective way in which the Government can assist mushroom exporters to compete in the UK market.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to assure the House that I will continue to keep the situation under review.  We shall examine all areas of the industry to see where savings can be made and improvements in efficiency can be achieved.  To this end I can indicate that my Department, Bord Glas, the IDA, Córas Tráchtála and the industry are in the process of undertaking a long-term strategic analysis of the whole industry which amongst many other aspects will of course cover the difficulties posed by the existence of a fluctuating exchange rate with our major mushroom market.</P>

      <P>Interest rate developments, including differentials between Irish interest rates and rates abroad, are kept under continuous review by my Department. However, interest rates are primarily a matter for the Central Bank. The Central Bank Act, 1942, sets out the bank's general function to safeguard the integrity of the currency.</P>
      <P>The Government's role in relation to interest rates is mainly to create a favourable economic climate so that Irish interest rates can be kept as low as possible consistent with maintaining the value of the pound within the EMS.  Notwithstanding recent interest rate increases, the differential between key Irish and UK interest rates has improved by over six percentage points since the end of March 1987, and the corresponding differential with German rates has improved by almost five percentage points.  These improvements are a reflection of the good management of the economy.</P>
      <P>The fundamentals in the economy are sound.  The dramatic progress in restoring order to the public finances, the strong balance of payments current account, and the relatively low rate of inflation give the sound economic background which will allow Ireland to take advantage of improvements in the international interest rate environment whenever they occur.  Therefore, the Government are determined to continue with the economic policies which have been so successful in developing a strong economy and in reducing borrowing and the burden of debt.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the available statistics on refunds of deposit interest retention tax do not distinguish between refunds made to approved charities, those made to individuals aged 65 or over and those made to incapacitated individuals.  The total value of such refunds made in 1989 was £4.1 million; the vast bulk of this is likely to have been repaid to individuals aged 65 years or over.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1986, provides for payment, after the end of the tax year, of deposit interest retention tax deducted from incapacitated persons and persons aged 65 years or over to the extent that they would not otherwise be liable to tax on the relevant interest.  I have no plans at present for any changes in the existing legal provisions.</P>

    <P>I would point out, however, that there is a number of investment options to which retention tax does not apply: credit union interest, and the interest and bonus on the small savers schemes operated by An Post &mdash; savings bonds, savings certificates and national instalment savings.  In addition, the retention tax rate, which is the same as the standard rate of income tax, was 35 per cent when the tax was introduced, but is 32 per cent now and will be reduced to 30 per cent for the 1990-91 tax year.  The Deputies will be aware that the Government are <Col N="117" /> committed to further reducing the standard rate, and thus the retention tax rate, to 25 per cent by 1993.</P>

      <P>There are at present no plans to relocate a Government Department in County Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The Government's current decentralisation programme is based on the original list of centres selected in 1980 when decentralisation of Government Departments to provincial centres was first proposed.  These centres are at Athlone, Ballina, Cavan, Dundalk, Ennis, Galway, Killarney, Letterkenny, Limerick, Nenagh, Sligo and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The decision that the revived programme should include the centres selected in 1980 was guided by the ready availability of sites in many of these locations, and the degree of preliminary planning which had been carried out regarding both the accommodation required and the staff to be transferred.</P>
      <P>The decentralisation programme now under way is ambitious and the Government's priority is its implementation. Phase One of the programme, that is Ballina, Cavan, Galway and Sligo, has been successfully completed, but it will be some time before the three branches that make up Phase Two of the programme are completed.</P>

      <P>Direct tax paid by companies, excluding the bank levy, was £309 million in 1989. This represents 1.5 per cent of gross national product and 4.1 per cent of total tax revenue for 1989.  These figures are provisional and may be revised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in the budget statement, the yield from corporate tax is low by international standards.  In the league table of 22 OECD countries, our yield ranks lowest of all as a percentage of GDP and is less than half of the EC average.  Throughout the 1980s the yield has varied between 4 per cent and 6 per cent of total tax revenue or between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent of gross national product.  Reforms in the corporation tax <Col N="120" /> system were, however, initiated in 1988, principally by the halving of the accelerated capital allowances.  These reforms have been continued in this year's budget proposals to eliminate the accelerated allowances from April 1992 and to limit the cost to the Exchequer of &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; lending.  In addition export sales relief and &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; exemption will terminate in a few weeks' time, and the overall effect will be to significantly boost the yield from corporation tax, particularly from 1992 onwards.</P>

The record of appointments to State boards will show that the directors have discharged their responsibilities with diligence and integrity.</P>

      <Quest>if the Office of Public Works will carry out extensive drainage to the Dromore River system in Counties Cavan and Monaghan, having regard to the fact that this river links Ballybay in County Monaghan with Enniskillen in County Fermanagh and the fact that the resulting improvement to the system would make a valuable input into the development of tourism in the area; and when this work will be carried out.</Quest>

      <P>Drainage works on the Dromore River system in Counties Cavan and Monaghan could only be carried out by the Office of Public Works in the context of a comprehensive arterial drainage scheme for the entire Erne River catchment in which it is situated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> A drainage scheme was prepared in 1970 for that part of the River Erne catchment lying in the State.  The scheme was deemed to be uneconomic and was not proceeded with.  There are no immediate proposals to renew activity in the matter as all resources for arterial drainage will be fully committed for some time to come to other drainage projects in hand.  I cannot say, therefore, when a drainage scheme on the Dromore River might be considered again.</P>

      <P>The estimated net receipt of income tax collected from farmers in 1989 was £50.0 million.  This represents 0.2 per cent of gross national product and 0.7 per cent of total tax revenue for 1989.  These figures are provisional and may be revised.</P>
      <P>Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures given for farmer taxation are, to some extent, estimated.  The figures are based on estimates of the tax paid by full-time farmers together with estimates of the tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits only.</P>

      <P>To date 112 appointments <Col N="126" /> have been made on foot of recommendations from the top level appointments committee.  Twenty-two of these appointments were at Secretary level, five were at the level of Deputy Secretary or the equivalent departmental or professional grade, and 85 at the level of Assistant Secretary or the equivalent departmental or professional grade.  Two women have been appointed to posts at Assistant Secretary level.  This must be seen, however, in the context of the very small number of women applicants.</P>
      <P>The committee consists of two permanent members: the chairman who is Secretary to the Government and the Secretary (Public Service Management and Development) in the Department of Finance.  In addition, two Secretaries from other Departments are appointed by the Taoiseach, usually for a three year term, following consultation with me. The present members are the Secretary of the Department of the Environment and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. All are men.</P>
      <P>A vacancy exists for a representative from the private sector which would fall to be filled by the Taoiseach, again in consultation with me.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to a question by Deputy Rabbitte on 20 February (Official Report, columns 2287, 2288, volume 395) in which I stated that &ldquo;...until the economic and monetary conditions under which the two German states may come together become clearer, it is not possible to reach any firm conclusions as to how they may affect our <Col N="127" /> economy&rdquo;.  Accordingly, I think that it is premature and unhelpful at this stage to speculate on the impact of some hypothetical developments on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> when the outlook is so uncertain.</P>

This will be developed in accordance with the guidelines of the Brady Shipman Martin report which was published in 1987.

      <P>Over the 1989 Christmas holiday period it was reported that part of Grianán an Aileach had collapsed.  An inspection of the site was carried out on 4 January 1990 by an architect and an archaeologist employed by the Commissioners of Public Works.  They reported that the collapse occurred outwards on the south-west side of the fort along a four to six metre stretch.  The lower part of the wall, up to 1.2 metres high, remained sound.</P>
      <P>The area of the collapse was fenced off immediately and a danger notice erected. Works commenced on rebuilding the wall on 8 January 1990 and are progressing satisfactorily.  The high winds in February held up the works but they are due for completion by the end of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="132" /> It is not clear what caused the wall to collapse but it was not due to subsidence. The lower course of the collapsed portion was found to be sound and no archaeological supervision was necessary.  The collapse may have been due to dislodgement of some of the upper stones which could have moved the ones underneath.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce income tax relief on payments made by working parents in respect of child care facilities.  The focus of income tax changes in recent years has been on reducing the income tax burden for taxpayers generally and in particular on reducing income tax rates, and on making special provision for low paid taxpayers through the tax exemption limits.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, substantial progress has been made in these areas: the standard rate of income tax has been reduced to 30 per cent and the top rate to 53 per cent, there have been substantial increases in the exemption limits and a child addition to those limits has been introduced and was increased this year.  Working parents making payments in respect of childcare facilities will have benefited from these improvements and will also benefit from implementation of the Programme for Government objectives of further reducing the standard rate to 25 per cent by 1993 and moving towards a single higher rate of tax.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics for 1989 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the number of prosecutions initiated and convictions secured in 1987 and 1988 arose following a High Court decision in relation to VAT and PAYE offences.  The effect of this decision was that, for technical reasons, the Director of Public Prosecutions could no longer prosecute for the offences in question.  After consideration of the legal issues arising by the Revenue Commissioners, I have been informed by the commissioners that they have now put new administrative procedures in place to deal with the effects of this decision and to facilitate resumption of prosecution activity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 81 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to have the Habitat Directive and its annexes ratified during the Irish Presidency.  It must, however, be agreed by the Commission and the member states.</P>
      <P>Regarding funding, the Commission is examining a revision of the ACE Regulation (Action in the Community in relation to the Environment) with a view to providing funding for sites to be conserved under the directive.</P>
      <P>Funding may also be available under Council Regulation No. 1760/87 which amended Regulation No. 797/85.  The schemes envisaged under these regulations provide for the payment of a grant to farmers who farm their lands in an environmentally sensitive manner.  It will be administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <P>The new house price index, which is published quarterly by the Department of the Environment, is calculated from data supplied by building societies, associated banks, assurance companies and local authorities.  During 1989 the Trustee Savings Banks and other lending institutions have begun to supply similar data giving the index a broader base than before.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the index gives a good picture of house price movements for the purposes of the residential property tax.  It is broadly based and reflects the up-to-date position in so far as house prices are concerned.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to my address to the annual dinner of the Institute of Taxation on 2 March.  What I said about income tax rates on that occasion was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past two Budgets it has been possible to reduce the standard rate &mdash; which affects the majority of taxpayers &mdash; by a total of 5 percentage points, so that it will be 30% for the coming tax year.  This represents substantial relief and means that the Government are clearly on target to meet the objective of a 25% standard rate by 1993.  The top rate of tax has also been reduced by 5 percentage points over the same <Col N="140" /> period and a single top rate of 48% can be achieved by 1993. </P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Government policy as set out in the Programme for Government is to further reduce the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent by 1993 and move towards a single higher rate of tax.  Substantial progress has already been made towards meeting these objectives and I am fully confident that they will be achieved.  The process for their implementation will of course be a matter for consideration in the context of future budgets.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not placing a balanced construction on the Central Bank's latest report.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledges that the budgeted Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1990, at £449 million, is broadly in line with what the markets had been expecting and that the budget measures should contribute to wage moderation and should serve to dampen inflation.</P>
      <P>The package of tax and welfare measures in this year's budget was very carefully judged.  These measures are necessary to promote competitiveness, non-inflationary growth and more jobs and to protect and improve the living standards of the most disadvantaged in our society.  The budget does this while at the same time consolidating and improving upon last year's exceptionally rapid reduction in Exchequer borrowing and debt.  I believe that the mix of policies contained in this year's budget was right, and this view is widely shared judging by the widespread favourable reaction to the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully share the Central Bank's view about the need for a continuing disciplined approach to the public finances, especially in view of the level of accumulated debt.  The Government are determined to maintain the momentum in <Col N="141" /> improving the public finances.  This is indicated clearly in the new medium-term objectives that I announced in the budget.</P>

      <P>The estimated net receipt of income tax collected under the PAYE system in 1989 was £2,335.7 million.  This represents 11.5 per cent of gross national product and 31.4 per cent of total tax revenue for 1989.  These figures are provisional and may be revised.</P>
      <P>Tax collected under PAYE covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed, as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.</P>

      <P>A variety of persons may fall into the category of &ldquo;financial advisers&rdquo; such as lending institutions, insurance companies, portfolio managers, brokers, accountants and solicitors.  The Deputy will be aware in this connection that licensed banks and building societies are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, <Col N="142" /> brokers on the Stock Exchange operate under regulations approved by the Minister for Finance and brokers outside the Stock Exchange are the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Solicitors operate under specific statute and accountants by self-regulation.</P>
      <P>I assume, however, that the Deputy's concern is, in fact, persons outside the Stock Exchange whose sole or main business is to provide investment advice or who hold themselves out as doing so to the public.  Since the overwhelming majority of these particular advisers are insurance brokers also, the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1989, apply in their case.  However, where such investment advisers give advice in respect of non-insurance related investment products only, they are not governed by specific regulations.  While general consumer protection law of course applies to some extent, the need for specific regulatory legislation in such cases is an issue for consideration in the context of the proposed EC Directive on financial services in the field of securities.</P>

    <P>I assume that the term &ldquo;public borrowing costs&rdquo; in the question refers to the cost of servicing the national debt.

It is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of <Col N="143" /> the impact of this increase on the cost of servicing debt in 1990 because this will depend on the duration of the increase and on the composition of the debt incurred during the relevant period.</P>

      <P>Seals are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and it is an offence to hunt or kill them save under licence or permission under the Act.  The best scientific advice available indicates that culling is not an effective method of preventing seal predation of fishery catches.

      <P>The main item settled by EC Finance Ministers during the French Presidency in the second half of last year was the outline of arrangements for payment and receipt of VAT in intra-community trade after 1992.  Under the consensus reached, exports will continue to be zero-rated for VAT purposes during <Col N="147" /> a transitional period and VAT will be charged in the country where consumption of goods takes place.  The Commission are now preparing detailed proposals to give effect to these arrangements in a situation where border controls would not apply.</P>
      <P>While agreement on VAT rates has not yet been reached, it was agreed last December that member states whose standard rate already falls within the range 14 to 20 per cent should not move out of that range between now and 1 January 1993; and that member states whose standard rate is outside that range should not diverge further.  Timetables were set last December for the further decisions necessary on the format and level of the proposed standard VAT rate, on the scope and levels of the reduced rates and on the products which may continue to be zero-rated from 1 January.</P>
      <P>While the post-1992 VAT position is beginning to take shape, much remains to be debated and decided.  The Irish Presidency is trying to maintain the momentum of progress.  We are pressing the Commission to bring forward quickly the detailed proposals now required.  We have also initiated an examination by a Council <i>ad hoc</i> group of the classification of items for the different VAT rates.</P>
      <P>Progress in regard to excises has been slower than in the case of VAT.  We have initiated examination of the proposals at working group level under our Presidency in an effort to advance matters.</P>
      <P>In response to the case that I made at the Council of Finance Ministers, the Commission has now launched a study of the problems which approximation of indirect taxes will pose for Ireland and of possible measures to help deal with these problems.  Deputies will be aware also that, when he was in Dublin recently, President Delors acknowledged the possible need for assistance to countries such as Ireland.</P>

      <Quest>in light of the exemption from stamp duty under section 14 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, in respect of a transfer of property from husband to husband and wife, if he will consider introducing an appropriate amendment, allowing a similar exemption from stamp duty in a situation where unhappy differences have arisen between husband and wife and they are forced to separate and in such deed of separation agree to the transfer of the family home from the joint ownership of husband and wife to the sole ownership of a particular spouse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Persons in the situation described by the Deputy are already favourably treated in that transfers between related persons are subject to 50 per cent of the duty that would otherwise be payable.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 is to ensure that a spouse does not dispose of the family home without the consent of the other spouse.  It also encourages the placing of a family home in the joint names of the spouse by exempting the legal instrument creating the joint tenancy from stamp duty.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork was not awarded the appropriate milk quota based on his 1981-82 milk delivery, in view of the fact that a letter dated 10 March 1986 from his Department indicated that he would obtain 50 per cent of the difference, namely 11,539 gallons; and if there is any further milk quota due to him.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person named qualified for a quota allocation from the national reserve which was set up in 1984.  In accordance with the terms of that reserve he was granted an additional quota of 11,593 gallons which was equivalent to 52 per cent of the difference between the level of his milk deliveries in 1983 and those he made in 1981.  This quantity is the maximum to which he is entitled and no further quota is due to him under that scheme.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that the person indicated has made an application as a small scale producer for an additional quota allocation out of the extra 11 million gallons available this year.  The allocation of quota to this category of producers will be made shortly.</P>

In the following table, &ldquo;section 4&rdquo; relates to motions placed on the agenda of council meetings under section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955. &ldquo;Material Contraventions&rdquo; relates to cases where the material contravention procedures of section 26 (3) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 (as substituted by section 39 (d) of the 1976 Act) were initiated either following the proposal of a section 4 motion which, if passed, would result in a material contravention of the devlopment plan, or otherwise.

During the period of validity of a licence, the licence holder may in fact import far fewer items than the maximum specified under the terms of the particular licence. I can, however, give precise figures in relation to IUDs.  There were 1288 IUDs imported during the calendar year 1988 and 3,000 imported during the calendar year 1989.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a question from the Deputy on 16 November 1989, this project was being reviewed in the context of the overall level of provision in the town, the long-term accommodation requirements of the catchment area and the latest statistical data.  It would appear that the existing permanent accommodation in the post-primary schools in the centre is sufficient to cater for the long-term needs of the catchment area.  The question of the provision to be made for the short-term requirements of the centre is being examined at present in my Department.</P>
