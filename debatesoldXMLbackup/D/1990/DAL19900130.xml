      <P>Before we enter our formal business I should like to welcome a distinguished group of parliamentarians from the British House of Commons Select Committee on European Legislation who are here on an official visit to their counterparts in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I hope the delegates will have a fruitful meeting and that they will enjoy the rest of their stay in Ireland. Céad mile fáilte romhaibh &mdash; one hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>On 24 October last, the House requested the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to report to it, by 31 March next, with proposals for a general programme of reform of Dáil procedures, including the question of televising Dáil and committee proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition is, I think, being slightly audacious in daring to talk about Dáil reform today when he is, for mean party political reasons, driving a bulldozer through a well-established precedent of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fairly free paraphrase &mdash; the kind of turgid prose one finds in that programme would never escape my lips.  Does the Taoiseach not remember that in that document it was promised there would be proposals dealing with, for example, the procedures for bringing legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only saying what was in that programme.  It said that procedures for the passage of legislation through the Dáil and Seanad would be the subject of proposals and that proposals in relation to Question Time would be brought forward; that proposals in relation to the committee system would be brought forward; that a proposal to deal with another matter that exercised the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the past year or two &mdash; the <i>sub judice</i> rule &mdash; would be brought forward and that proposals would be brought forward for involving members of the European Parliament in committees of the House in which they would have a direct interest.  Is the Taoiseach now saying that six months after that was brought forward and some time after the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were given this job to do the Government have made no proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows full well that the Government's view of these matters always is that where possible they should be dealt with on the basis of all-party agreement.  That is the way to make progress.  From that point of view the appropriate vehicle is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  A fair amount of progress has been made and will continue to be made.  I would remind the Deputy that respect for the precedents and traditions of this House is by far the greatest tribute he could pay to the whole question of Dáil reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach now <Col N="1948" /> saying that the Government are not putting forward any proposals to the committee and that they do not intend bringing forward any proposals unless proposals come from somewhere else?  Is he saying that this bit of that programme, like every other bit of it, is not worth the paper it is written on?</P>

I want to remind the Taoiseach that I have a motion on the Order Paper to establish such a committee.  I would not wish to move it in Private Member's time because it would probably be carried.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Dukes</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the distribution of the projected expenditure of £0.5 million from Exchequer sources on the additional press and public relations operations to be carried out on behalf of the Irish EC Presidency in Brussels, Strasbourg and Dublin; the reason these functions are not being carried out through the normal Government and departmental spokespersons; and the process by which the persons and the firm engaged to carry out this selection were selected.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A provision of £500,000 is being made in the Vote for my Department in respect of exceptional expenditure arising from Ireland's Presidency of the European Community.  The expenditure will include fees of £175,000 approximately for press and public relations personnel at press centres in Dublin, Brussels and Strasbourg and fees for an environmental adviser.  The balance of the provision represents contingency provision for the additional meetings, receptions and travel necessary during the Presidency and for special projects in the arts and other areas which may be undertaken during the term of the Presidency in accordance with the practice now current in member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the additional work of the Presidency and to the importance of providing adequate and comprehensive briefing to the large international media corps of some 1,500 who now cover Community affairs, the existing complement of Government and departmental information staff, whose function is the dissemination of information on normal Government activities, could not adequately deal with the additional matters related to the Presidency at this period of major developments within <Col N="1950" /> the Community and in the Community's relations with other countries.</P>
    <P>The selection of the press and public relations consultants was on the basis of their professional expertise and experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in understanding that this expenditure of £500,000, from what appears to be on the Minister for Finances's statement a fairly straightened budget, will be spent on a PR firm here in Dublin to deal with the press corps in Dublin who seem to me to be fairly good already at finding out what is going on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and on the transfer of the new journalist to Brussels, a place which probably has more press and PR people in it per square mile than any other place in the world and the appointment to Brussels of a long time journalist &mdash; I gather he is now called an environmental adviser &mdash; who has been for a very long time a sycophantic fan of the Taoiseach, and whose job is apparently to tell MEPs what is going on in the Presidency, a group of people who have far better contacts already both in the Parliament, in the Council and in the Commission than any amateur journeyman journalist could possibly have?  Is this journeyman journalist in Strasbourg the same person who recently reproduced a Commission document on the environment which bore no title on the outside but bore only a picture of the Taoiseach in very fetching sailing garb with binoculars around his neck and a coast of west Kerry background?  Is that what the £500,000 is being spent on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has not replied to any one of those questions.  Is it his intention to spend public money on hiring a press and PR firm in Dublin to improve his image?  Is it his intention to spend public money on detaching a journalist from RTÉ to send him to Brussels to do a job that is already being done, including a job being done by the Council's press staff?  I will give the Taoiseach a moment to read what the Tánaiste is showing him.  Is it his intention to have somebody sent out to Strasbourg who knows less about the job than any MEP in the hope that he can improve his own image among MEPs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.  A Gulfstream III jet aircraft has been leased for a six month period up to 30 June, 1990 from Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, USA to assist in transport duties during the Irish Presidency of the European Communities.  The aircraft will be operated by the Air Corps during the period of the lease.</P>
      <P>Air Corps pilots have undergone a ground school course and flight training provided by Flight Safety International, at Savannah, Georgia, USA specifically for the operation of the Gulfstream III aircraft.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to established practice and the conventions of commercial confidentiality to give details of the contract price for the lease of the aircraft. However the overall cost of operating the aircraft for the six months including training, fuel, insurance, registration of aircraft etc. will be approximately £1.3 million.  No reimbursement of this cost is expected.</P>
      <P>The decision to charter this aircraft for the duration of the European Presidency was taken on the grounds of efficiency and flexibility, having regard to the pace of work and travel necessitated by the pressures of international diplomacy.  It would be impossible for Ministers and officials to meet the very demanding schedule of meetings with one aircraft only.  Another aircraft of greater passenger capacity and operating range is without question essential in the light of the increasing role of the European Presidency in recent times.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Government already have one jet plane at their disposal, that airlines out of this country operate a very extensive service to the European Community, <Col N="1956" /> that independent reports show that there are upwards of one million people here living in a state of poverty, and that the health services here are in a decimated condition, would the Taoiseach agree that it is nothing short of a scandal that £1.3 million is expended on providing a second jet plane and that this amounts to little more than an ego trip for the Taoiseach and his Ministers?</P>

Could the Taoiseach tell me whether it is the case that procurement of this Gulfstream III jet aircraft was handled by the Department of Transport and Tourism rather than the Department of Defence which, I take it, would be the normal procedure?  Could the Taoiseach also confirm that the fee that would be payable to the finder of an aircraft in cases like this would be between £60,000 and £70,000 and that the person who initially found the aircraft is a Mr. Bob Manson who has recently been appointed to the board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is it true that the original specification for the procurement was written so as to produce an answer in the form of a Gulfstream III jet aircraft? Could the Taoiseach then confirm to me that the aircraft when first acquired was found, on examination by Air Corps technicians, to have a log book that did not square with its history, and was subsequently found to have been involved in an accident previous to that?  Could the Taoiseach then confirm that the aircraft now in use is one that has been made available by the Gulfstream Corporation and, is that the reason the Government <Col N="1958" /> have, so far, allowed no photograph of the aircraft to appear in the public press?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject all the insinuations made by Deputy Dukes in this regard which are, as usual, without foundation.  This is, in my view, an absolute necessity if we are to attempt to carry out our Presidency in the way we should, having regard to the worldwide implications of the Presidency duties these days.  Second, I am quite convinced that, taking everything into account, this will result in an economy to the State over the six-month period.  It is leased for six months and not a moment longer, and it is entirely in accordance with the best <Col N="1959" /> interests of this State to enable us to do a good job in the Presidency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach tell me if he is aware of how many kinds of aircraft commercially available today would fit the kind of specifications he has in mind?  I can tell him for free.  There are at least three.  Could the Taoiseach also confirm whether it is the case, as I have been informed, that the original aircraft found turned out to have been damaged in an accident, that that is not the aircraft now in use, and that the one now in use has been made available by the Gulfstream Corporation?  Is all of that the reason the rest of the grand public who are paying for this aircraft have seen only one small photograph of this aircraft in one newspaper when we would normally have expected the Taoiseach, with his usual style and panache, to have an official unveiling of this aircraft in Baldonnel or Dublin Airport?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat to the House that the Government considered this matter carefully.  There was no wish whatsoever on our part to engage in any unnecessary expenditure.  Having gone into the whole situation and having got quotations in respect of a fair number of aircraft we decided that this was the best, most economic aircraft we could have and we considered that it was absolutely essential for our purposes.  I am quite satisfied that the Department of Tourism and Transport went through all the appropriate commercial procedures to get the best possible bargain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.  In a radio interview, I sought to dismiss some of <Col N="1964" /> the more widely exaggerated comments about the situation in Dublin which sought to suggest that Dublin city's pollution problems were in some way unique or that the problem in Dublin this winter was more than anything previously experienced.</P>
      <P>The facts are that a significant number of European Community cities are in breach of the Community's smoke limits and in Dublin this winter to date has not been worse than previous winters as regards the problem of smog.</P>
      <P>I also stated categorically that the problem would be dealt with and the Government have now decided to secure an immediate end to the smog problem in Dublin by directly tackling its source which is the burning of bituminous coal. Accordingly the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal in the builtup area of Dublin will be prohibited with effect from 1 October 1990.  The Government are confident that this prohibition will have widespread public support and will end the smog problems experienced in Dublin.  This measure is part of a comprehensive environmental action programme to give effect to my pledge of a `Green Presidency' which has, I am glad to say, been widely welcomed.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies, first to my statement in the House on 13 December last when reporting on the outcome of the Strasboarg European Council and on the forthcoming Irish EC Presidency; secondly, to a reply by the Minister for the Environment to parliamentary questions on 14 December 1989 which outlines the programme of environmental proposals to be advanced during the Irish Presidency; and, thirdly, to the Government's environmental action programme, launched last Friday by the Minister for the Environment.  Copies of the programme have been placed in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas and a copy is today being sent to each Member of the Houses.</P>
      <P>As I have said on a number of occasions, the environment will be one of our main priorities during the Irish Presidency and it is my intention to propose to have a major declaration on the environment adopted at the meeting of the European Council in Dublin next June.  Preparatory discussions for this purpose have already been initiated.</P>

Why, for example, is there no intention to bring forward legislation to amend the Air Pollution Act?  Why is there no intention to bring forward legislation on eco-labelling despite the statement on the proposed initiative within the EC?  Why is there no intention to bring forward legislation to provide for a waste management plan or to deal with the abuse of the planning process which has given rise to problems with sewage discharge and so on?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>As I said in my statement on 22 January, I welcome the recent comments by Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Allen and I share their view of the pressing necessity to create hope for the future, and to create new stable relationships in Northern Ireland and Ireland as a whole based on mutual trust and respect and regard for each other's rights and traditions.</P>
      <P>As I said in my statement, I would welcome hearing Unionist concerns at first hand and would place no restriction on the agenda for such a meeting which would take place without prejudice to the Unionist position on the agreement.  Any such meeting would, in my view, focus very substantially on the development of the three sets of relationships in and between these islands, that between the communities in the North, between North and South and between Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that it would be appropriate or helpful to make any further comment at this time.  As to the suggestion that I communicate in writing with Unionist leaders, it is clear from their public comments that they are fully aware of the content of my statement.</P>

In issuing his invitations to the Unionist leadership will he confirm or deny that such talks are not being expressed by him as a precondition for developments within Northern Ireland and that he is not seeking for them to take place before any other talks take place within Northern Ireland itself?</P>

      <Quest>if he will ensure that in the course of the Irish Presidency of the EC, it will be recommended to the EC that a single inter-governmental conference takes place in December 1990 which will combine both the issues for economic and monetary union and improved political decision-making mechanisms; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>The matters discussed at the meeting were our Presidency priorities as outlined by me in this House on 8/9 December and as set out in detail in the Irish Presidency programme, copies of which are in the Dáil Library.  One of these priorities is that of follow-up on the decisions reached at the Strasbourg European Council on the subject of Economic and Monetary Union and this we will actively pursue in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential purpose of the meeting, which was the first ever such meeting held under an Irish Presidency, was to enable us to plan and co-ordinate our work programmes with those of the Commission, ensure the fullest degree of co-operation and support from the Commission over <Col N="1982" /> the six month period and to establish good personal relationships between Ministers and Commissioners.  All of these aims were successfully achieved.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that he has the full support of the Commission for the programme announced by the Government in relation to the Irish Presidency?  In relation to future meetings of the European Council, particularly the meeting that is expected to take place at the end of this year on economic and monetary union, does the Taoiseach expect that a change in the Irish Constitution will be required in order to comply with decisions proposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the meeting in Dublin was very successful from the point of view of agreeing the agenda for the six months of the Irish Presidency.  The Commission expressed itself as being very pleased with the outcome of our work on the programme settled under all the different headings.  I can assure the Deputy that we have the full support of the Commission for the programme, it was worked out in conjunction with them.</P>
      <P>Second, with regard to the inter-governmental conference on economic and monetary union, it would be impossible to say at this stage what the outcome of the conference may be or what implications it may have for us but I suspect the conference will go on for some considerable time and deal with very many complex and complicated issues.  I would be very doubtful that it would involve any constitutional changes here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply may I ask him, in respect of the agenda for the December inter-governmental conference, to indicate if the current Irish Government's position, which hopefully will be recommended by <Col N="1983" /> way of a formal Presidency recommendation in June, is to the effect as set out in my question: that the issues of economic and monetary union will be debated side by side with the necessary improved political decision making mechanisms that are required to go hand in hand with them?  Is that the position of the Government at present?  Is it the position the Irish Presidency will be recommending in June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the preparatory work for the inter-governmental conference will be brought to that stage by June, it is not envisaged that it will.  As the Deputy knows, there are three stages involved in economic and monetary union.  At this stage the main concentration will be on stage 1 and giving effect to stage 1.  There will be some preliminary work done on stages 2 and 3.  The Commission will bring forward a paper in April and some work will be done on the basis of that paper but it is not likely that the agenda of the inter-governmental conference will be settled by June.  At the moment the elements which may constitute the agenda for the inter-governmental conference are, first, the actual arrangements for economic and monetary union and the institutional arrangements necessary for economic and monetary union.  There is some suggestion, as the Deputy probably knows, that the inter-governmental conference should also deal with additional institutional arrangements, but I think that is far from settled yet.  I do not think there will be any decisions on that by June.  The Dublin Summit may give some indication but it is most unlikely that the agenda for the inter-governmental conference will be settled before well into the Italian Presidency.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 28, 65, 74 and 103 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a recent meeting with Deputy Fahey, I informed him of developments in the health services generally.  I gave him a clear view of the present situation in the health services and reassured him <Col N="1985" /> about their capacity to cope with the recent emergency caused by the influenza epidemic.  I discussed with him the specific developments in the South Eastern Health Board area, including the hospital developments at Ardkeen, Wexford and Kilkenny.  I also assured him that I accepted the need to provide new accommodation for the elderly at Dungarvan and had already been in correspondence with the South Eastern Health Board on the matter during 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that he had two meetings on Friday, 19 January 1990 with Deputy Fahey, that he gave him position papers which the Deputy took home to his constituency and that on that basis he found it possible to re-join the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party?  Would the Minister agree that this type of political horse trading with the health service is no way to plan the health service and weakens his own credibility in trying to rationalise and organise the service?</P>

      <P>I met Deputy Fahey once on the day in question, as indeed I meet Deputies from both sides of the House and discuss with them what is happening nationally and in their own area. Deputy Yates is correct when he says that I gave Deputy Fahey a document to peruse.  However, it was a document refuting allegations made by himself and Deputy Dukes.  Very serious allegations were made and Deputy Dukes alleged that dying patients were being turned away from hospitals.  Deputy Dukes knew that was wrong and he was casting a slur on the most caring staff in this country.  He knew that statement was wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period immediately preceding Christmas and during Christmas, Ireland, in common with much of Europe, was affected by a major influenza epidemic.  This had two immediate effects on the health service.  First, there was a very sharp increase in the number of patients presenting to general practitioners and at hospitals throughout the country.  On examination many of these <Col N="1988" /> were found to require admission to hospital. The second effect of the epidemic was on hospital staff whose numbers were temporarily reduced through illness.</P>
    <P>There was a 40 per cent increase in medical admissions to hospitals during December and January compared with the same period last year.  Eight thousand more medical patients than would have been expected were dealt with in this period.</P>
    <P>I have to say, contrary to the impression which many people have sought to convey, that the health services coped very well with a difficult situation. Health boards and hospitals were given all necessary flexibility to do whatever was necessary to cope with the problem. Beds were re-opened, extra beds were brought into commission, extra staff were taken on, and staff who were due to take leave over Christmas stayed at work.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the health service responded rapidly and flexibly to the emergency.  Inevitably, many of the additional patients could not be cared for in optimum conditions.  The scale of the demand for hospital services resulted in some patients being looked after for some period of time in day wards, in additional beds put up in standard wards or in corridors. I fully appreciate that these arrangements were often unsatisfactory for both patients and staff but the great majority of those concerned appreciated the unusual circumstances which led to these measures being taken.</P>
    <P>I have indicated on a number of occasions my concern at delays in elective admissions particularly for some specialties. For that reason the Government made an additional £15 million available in July of last year to provide a 24 hour accident and emergency service at each of the major Dublin hospitals and to reduce waiting lists.  I am pleased with the progress which has been made to date but the full impact of the measures taken has not yet become apparent.  An additional £120 million is being expended on public health services in 1990.  The resources already made available for hospital services should be sufficient to ensure <Col N="1989" /> adequate and prompt care for all those who need it.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, many reckless and completely unfounded claims were made about patients being refused admission to hospital or being denied necessary treatment.  No effort was made to check the truth or otherwise of these stories before going to the media.</P>

Would he further agree that his policy of reducing the number of beds in hospitals has not resulted in reducing costs but rather in increased costs due to the duration of stay?  There is now a lack of confidence in the Minister by the administrative staff, the nurses, doctors and the public generally.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock is correct in that there has been an increased throughput in our hospitals in the last three years.  There has been quite a dramatic increase in the number of patients who have been attended to in the hospitals because of the efficiency measures that were implemented as a result of this Government's programme since 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the pressure on the hospitals, again I accept the point made by Deputy Sherlock about difficulties in dealing with a problem such as that which arose in the months of December and January.  There was an unprecedented increase in the demand for beds, something experienced not only by us but by people in Northern Ireland, Britain and across Europe.  When there is a flu epidemic, just as when a major disaster occurs, the health service has to respond and I am pleased that our health service responded with flexibility to the particular needs of the time.</P>

      <P>I accept that it put pressure on the service and I accept that in some circumstances patients were treated in conditions that were not ideal, but unfortunately this is the nature of health care around the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of ear, nose and throat operations, the Government expressed their concern about the delays, particularly for ear operations for children.  I am glad to say that as a result of the expenditure of £15 million last year, the on-going effects of which will continue through 1990, the number of children <Col N="1991" /> who were on the Temple Street Hospital waiting list in the autumn of last year &mdash; 1,800 &mdash; was reduced to 900 by the end of the year.  That is an indication that the Government's programme is working.</P>

      <P>Since it is increasingly clear that the Minister for Health is now the only person in this country who has not recognised the crisis as it has been outlined not alone by politicians but by consultants, junior hospital doctors, nurses, paramedics and every independent political commentator, would he accept that he has presided over a service that has been savaged over three years, that in the period of his Ministry funding for the general hospitals has been cut by 5.3 per cent in real terms, voluntary hospitals by 6.1 per cent in real terms, health board long-stay hospitals and homes by 5.7 per cent in real terms, and the ambulance and emergency service by 5 per cent in real terms?  The crisis over the Christmas period that the Minister alluded to was entirely predictable, and was predicted by me in 1987.  I endorse the request, what in real terms does he propose to do to solve the dilemma that not only the people of Ireland but everybody involved in the health services acknowledge now exists?</P>

I have one page of it here in which he lists 20 hospitals that he says were closed.  Two of these hospitals were never closed and another 16 are still open under new management.  He even included Jervis Street Hospital and the Richmond, which were closed because of their age and moved to the most modern hospital in Europe, a matter that his own party in Government left sitting for four years.  Does he think Jervis Street and the Richmond Hospitals should still be there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the concern of the Deputies <Col N="1995" /> about the appointment of a receiver to Sunbeam plc and Kerry Fashions and about the possible threat to jobs in these companies.</P>
    <P>There are about 1,000 jobs in the various companies concerned.  There are reasonable grounds for hoping that the majority of these jobs can be saved.  The companies based in Dublin and Bandon have performed profitably and it should be possible to secure their future.</P>
    <P>The Sunbeam plant has had mixed fortunes. Some of it at least has been profitable and efforts must now be concentrated on saving as much as possible of it.  I am particularly conscious of the jobs in question in Cork.</P>
    <P>The Kerry Fashions plant in Tralee has established markets in Europe and the US and is certainly potentially viable.</P>
    <P>I have asked the State agencies concerned to meet with the receiver as soon as possible and to work with him in making every effort to safeguard the jobs in these companies.  I understand that the two agencies concerned have already met with the receiver today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the loss of 450 jobs on the north side of Cork city, an area already devastated by high unemployment, would be a mortal blow to the area, and will the Minister give assurances now that all jobs will be maintained, pending discussions between the receiver and the IDA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the difficulties on the north side of Cork city which have been ongoing for some time and I agree that if these jobs were to go it would be an extremely serious matter. I cannot give a unilateral assurance but certainly everything possible will be done.  It is my belief and hope that the majority of those jobs can be safeguarded in the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree in view of the fact that many aspects of the Cork and Kerry companies are profitable and that the IDA suggested <Col N="1996" /> that they will try to find profitable markets for the knitwear section of the industry in Cork, that his Department should combine with the IDA to help to save the jobs in Cork and Tralee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the knitwear sections have not been profitable.  Notwithstanding that, it may be possible, in conjunction with the various interests concerned and as a result of the discussions now taking place between the agencies and the receiver, to devise a means of selling these factories as a going concern.  The Bandon and Dublin factories are profitable and the IDA advise me that there are good prospects they can successfully be sold as going concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given my understanding that the main financial difficulties with the parent company were in relation to the UK plant and not the Irish plants, will the Minister take steps to ensure that the plants in Dublin, Cork, Tralee and Bandon will be allowed to continue trading? If they cease to trade there will be further serious difficulties.  Given that there are two State agencies involved, the IDA and SFADCo, will the Minister outline what steps he has taken to coordinate the activities of both of those agencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A receiver has been appointed, as I understand it, only in respect of two of the companies, Sunbeam and Kerry Fashions, and a receiver has not been appointed in respect of the other two.  Obviously the IDA and SFADCo are already in touch with each other with regard to the matter, as clearly they should approach the problem jointly.  Their combined resources will be of considerable assistance in trying to resolve the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Sunbeam plant at Cork, would the Minister agree that an essential element of any rescue package must include the maintenance of production at this plant?  Is the Minister having this aspect examined <Col N="1997" /> and can he give an assurance that production will be maintained pending the putting in place of any rescue package?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my earnest desire that production will be maintained.  The receiver who has gone into the Cork and the Tralee plants this morning has decided to continue production there for the moment and I hope he will continue to do that because it makes the possible sale of the undertakings as going concerns much easier if they are in production rather than if they are closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House to what extent the exchange rate and the interest rates have contributed to this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine that so far as some of the companies are concerned, the exchange rate in recent times has not been terribly helpful but the Deputy should bear in mind that this problem essentially arises from the difficulties of the holding company of the group in Britain on the financial side, more than on the trading side.  This group was the subject of a buy-out which was highly leveraged in the past 18 months or so, which was financed by extremely heavy borrowings from banks in Britain. The holding company found themselves unable to meet the commitments they had agreed with the banks in Britain and, as a result, the banks put in a receiver to the holding company.  The trading record of the subsidiaries in Ireland has not been at all bad and most of the divisions of the various subsidiaries here have been able to trade profitably.</P>

My party colleague, the Chief Whip, made it clear at the Whips' meeting last Thursday that we would not agree to the Order of Business because it does not provide time today for a debate on the health issues.  Since the Government have not been forthcoming in relation to a debate of this kind, I formally inform the Taoiseach that, from this moment, my party will not be involved in any co-operation in the ordering of business of the House, nor will they grant any pairs for Ministers or anybody else on the Opposition benches.</P>

If the Government find themselves in difficulty they may blame nobody but themselves.  The public will know that the Government are creating the problem by their own inability to clearly see the problems facing us.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to resume my contribution on behalf of The Workers' Party in response to this Bill.  In doing so at this stage, I want to put on record my unhappiness at the way in which the House has ordered its business and has sought to deal with this important legislation. The ordering and taking of this Bill for debate on Second Stage has been <Col N="2262" /> totally unsatisfactory and entirely haphazard. This is the sixth occasion in the very short life of this Dáil, since last October, that the Bill has been listed to be taken for Second Reading.  It is, in fact, the second Second Stage dealing of the Bill that we have had since it was first published and circulated in the House.  It has been termed the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988.  We are now into the year 1990 and we will be well out of 1990 before we even get beyond Second Stage if progress to date is any indication.</P>
      <P>Important sections in the Bill are drafted which refer to it as the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1989, and of necessity we will have to amend those. What year we will insert instead of 1989 remains to be seen.  There is no guarantee that it will be 1990, though many of us hope it will be.  I have raised this matter at meetings with the Whip and I am now formally raising it on the Floor of the House.</P>
      <P>On 16 November, 21 November, 5 December, 7 December, and 14 December the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill was slotted in as back-up to other legislation to the extent that we had one rather inglorious occasion when a Minister had to stand in on behalf of the Minister for Justice, deliver his speech, and get to the stage where it was only two-thirds finished.  That was no credit to the Minister who was asked to stand in or the Minister for Justice, who was elsewhere dealing with important business on the occasion.  It does no credit to the very important amendment of the criminal law we are seeking to achieve with this Bill. I simply hope, again in the absence of the Minister, that he will bring it back to the table of Government if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is crucial legislation.  It deserves a consistent ordering of the business of the House so that we will be able, with some continuity, to discuss and deliberate on its important principles on Second Stage and beyond on Committee and Report Stages.  This slotting in of the Bill as back-up to other legislation should cease so that it gets some priority in the ordering of business in the near future and is dealt <Col N="2263" /> with consistently and coherently.  The debate was opened by one Minister on behalf of the Minister for Justice and then the Minister for Justice came in on another occasion and finished it.  We have lost continuity of thought and debate on the provisions.  There are very important contributions to be made on the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, my colleague mentions that there are very important contributions to be made. I would point out to you, Sir, that we do not have a quorum in the House and I must ask you to have the House adjourned pending the presence of a quorum while these important contributions are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to acknowledge the point made by Deputy O'Keeffe in seeking a quorum.  It is important legislation.  The point I made before I sat down to allow the Deputy to make his point of order is that this legislation has not been given the priority, attention and continuity it deserves.  I hope that will be resolved by us in the future.  I do not want to make any undue remark about the fact that it seems to have been again slotted in to fill time before we get on tomorrow to what has been described as the business of the year, the budget.  No doubt because of that the continuity of this debate will be broken again this evening and we will have to find another time to slot it in.  I hope that point has been well made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Keeffe said this legislation is crucial.  It is remarkable that within ten years we are, for the second time, discussing reforming legislation in the area of sexual assault, sexual abuse and rape.  This is unique in the area of the criminal law generally.  I cannot think of any other example in recent times where the Irish Parliament has succeeded in addressing an area of the criminal law and its reform.  It is a credit to the strength <Col N="2264" /> of campaign that has been undertaken by those in the field concerned with this general area of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I acknowledged the role played by the various Rape Crisis Centres in dealing with the problem, in highlighting the shortcomings of the law and in particular the amending legislation of 1981.  The fact that we are addressing the law within such a short period of time is also an indication of the fact that the law, as it stands, is grossly inadequate and in urgent need of reform.  It must be acknowledged that before 1980 the previous law in this area was enacted in substance in 1935, and prior to that in 1861 under the Offences Against the Person Act of that year.  While it appears that we are giving remarkably vigilant attention to this area of the law, it is certainly an area where there was a huge amount of neglect unaddressed for decades and there is a lot of improvement needed.</P>
    <P>The debate is all the more urgent in view of recent developments, some of which have taken place in the last month. The continuing problem in the Rape Crisis Centres and the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda must be addressed.  The problem of sentencing in the whole area is a matter of grave urgency in view of a recent development.  The third ground of concern is the fact that the law has remained unchanged since 1981.</P>
    <P>First let me refer to the problems being faced by the victims of crime in this area. The work of the sexual assault unit at the Rotunda and indeed the various Rape Crisis Centres that are established on a voluntary basis around the country has exposed a major problem in Irish society, the sexual abuse of spouses, and, particularly and more worrying, of young children. I believe the scale of this abuse is far greater than many commentators active in the field over the years were prepared to admit, let alone acknowledge, existed.  It is important that we as legislators are able to give this area the currency it requires so that we can keep abreast of what needs to be done and equip those agencies outside in the community, be they the courts, the police or <Col N="2265" /> otherwise, with the tools and means to effectively deal with the problems which exist.</P>
    <P>In this regard I have to say in passing that the performance of the Government in supporting the different voluntary rape crisis centres leaves an awful lot to be desired.  It is a great pity that those who are helping the victims of crime face orders of ejection from their premises and the closing of their doors because of a lack of funding, are unable to recruit staff to maintain existing services and have no capacity to expand existing premises or to open premises in other areas where their services are urgently needed.  The centres in Cork, Waterford, Clonmel and Galway are working under extreme pressure.</P>
    <P>In November 1988 I raised the question of the centres in Dublin and even though promises were made that matters would be put right, recently I read in the national papers that things have not changed one jot, that the funding made available to the centres was only of a stop-gap nature and that the magnitude of their problems has not been addressed by the Government.  In the context of legislation in this area, all we might do in this House in reforming the law will be set virtually at naught if the agencies which help the victims of crime, for example the rape crisis centres, are not maintained and supported.</P>
    <P>The second area which needs to be urgently looked at is that of sentencing, not simply the gravity of a sentence which might be imposed but the many anomolies which exist in sentencing procedures which are so ineffective in the long term in dealing with the problems of sexual offenders generally.  This matter was dealt with in a submission prepared by many commentators working in the field, in particular, the Irish Association for Victims Support in their submission of January 1988, in which they acknowledged the point made by the Law Reform Commission that perhaps the Supreme Court is the tribunal which should be laying guidelines.  I do not fully agree with this and I will come back to it shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2266" /> The Bill as drafted addresses the issue of sentencing in a number of ways.  Firstly, it seeks to amend the definition of rape and sexual offences by introducing a limited extension of the definition of rape, introducing a new offence of aggravated assault and increasing the penalty for such an assault to life imprisonment, which is equivalent to that for the crime of rape.  It also proposes that all such offences of rape and aggravated assault should be transferred to the Central Criminal Court exclusively.</P>
    <P>With regard to the debate on the venue and jurisdiction for the trial of such offences, a strong case has been made by certain quarters that cases should not be taken away from the Circuit Criminal Court but should be left there primarily on two grounds: it would ensure a speedy trial and a hearing would be held in the area where the crime was first committed. Both grounds are important features in any attempt by the courts to act as a deterrent in the recurrance of these offences.  Nonetheless, I believe the recent case in the Circuit Criminal Court involving a soldier and an 11 year old child destroys an argument which might be made for the non-transfer of these cases from the Circuit Criminal Court.  I believe the Minister's argument in support of this provision will win out and that this House will support the proposal that the Central Criminal Court should be the exclusive venue for the trial of these types of offences.  That should certainly be the case even if it is only for a period until some tribunal, such as the Central Criminal Court or a higher court, lays down standards of uniformity for dealing with sentences.  This has been lacking to date.</P>
    <P>The issue of sentencing is crucial to this debate and the reform of the law and there must be unanimous agreement in this House and elsewhere that the crime of rape and aggravated sexual assault must attract the sentence of custodial committal and punishment.  Anyone who has commented on recent events in the Circuit Criminal Court would agree it is appropriate that people who are convicted or admit to serious crimes of sexual <Col N="2267" /> assault on women, young boys or young girls must in all circumstances face custody. Recent cases raise the question of important demands which must be made in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should now give a clear indication that his Department will put in place, either in this Bill or at an early stage, powers so that the Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal against sentences which he considers to be far too lenient and inappropriate.  This right has been bestowed upon the Director of Public Prosecutions in Britain and Northern Ireland and it is clearly one that should be introduced into our criminal law at a very early stage.  This would ensure that cases such as the recent case involving the soldier and the young child would be addressed by a higher tribunal and reviewed against some form of standard. In this way the community could be satisfied that all agencies take the problem of sexual abuse of children and women seriously.</P>
    <P>There is a second need which the Minister must address.  It is time he took action to ensure that guidelines are laid down.  There is a precedent to this where the Attorney General, in consultation with the Minister or his counterpart in other jurisdictions, addressed courts of criminal jurisdiction and requested guidelines.  This was done in the context of rape when the Attorney General addressed the Court of Criminal Appeal. The court expressed the view at the time that there was not enough statistical data or information available to enable it to draw conclusions and lay down guidelines.</P>
    <P>As has been stated by a commentator in the national media recently, the absence of such information is unforgivable in a country the size of Ireland. The agencies working with the victims of these crimes have this information but there is no co-ordination between them and the Minister to present this information in intelligible form to those who might have recourse to it, particularly those who are interested in developing a policy of sentencing in all criminal trials.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2268" /> The point was made that information, statistical and otherwise, on the incidence of various crimes in our community should be made available annually from four different sources &mdash; the Garda Síochána, the prisons, the probationary service and the Department.  This has not been analysed in any co-ordinated fashion to help those who want to work towards the formulation of guidelines.  I say this in the context of the submission of the Irish Association for Victims Support. Having regard to the views of the Commission on Law Reform, the Minister has an active role to play in this area.  We should not sit back and hope tribunals of law will do the work for us, as they have shown a distinct disinclination to do so in the past.  There is nothing wrong with the Minister assembling and analysing the information which is available and coming to the conclusion that guidelines can be formulated on the appropriate term of imprisonment to be imposed in certain instances and, following consultations with the Judiciary, giving directions and guidelines to them.  These guidelines would not, by definition, take away from the general principal that each case should stand on its own right and be judged in the context of the facts.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a need for us to give such guidelines to the Judiciary, and I believe within the Judiciary itself there is a desire to have guidelines of a general nature to help them establish at various jurisdictions what sentence should be considered by a court.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that allied to the question of developing and putting in place a sentencing policy there is the urgent need for the Minister to consider putting in place an on-going educational programme for members of the Judiciary.  I say this without any hesitation whatsoever.  The members of the Judiciary, and there is absolutely no secret about this, are appointed on a <Col N="2269" /> party political basis and on the basis of their allegiance in the past and their service to whatever party are in Government. All of them obviously have very good grounding in the law and they are experienced and competent members of the legal profession, but there is no pre-appointment education.  They are simply plucked from the chambers of the professions and appointed to the Bench. There is no educational process leading to their appointment.  Once there, they are left to their own devices until they retire at the late age of 65 or 70.  None of them is expected or requested to attend courses of education on what is going on in the broader community.</P>
      <P>The failure of the system has been manifested time and again, the last most blatant example took place in the days when communities in Dublin and elsewhere were afflicted with a huge heroin problem.  When police forces and community groups were attempting to address in their communities the problem of heroin abuse the courts were still handing out suspended sentences to drug traffickers. Quite simply, the message &mdash; the seriousness of the problem &mdash; had not come home to them.  In 1977 we passed the Misuse of Drugs Act which made provision for very serious penalties but a short few years later we had to come back to increase those penalties, from 15 years to life imprisonment for drug trafficking, to try to bring home to the courts the urgent need to deal with drug traffickers in a serious fashion.  We have now achieved this, but it took a long number of years to bring home to the Judiciary the extent of the problem, the damage these people were causing and the dangers they were bringing into our communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same in some respects has to be said with regard to crimes of sexual abuse and rape.  The fact that in 1989 a judge of the Circuit Court would feel it appropriate in whatever circumstances to impose a suspended sentence on a person who had raped an 11 year old child and left that child psychologically damaged is a feature of a Judiciary totally out of touch with what is happening on the <Col N="2270" /> ground and in particular with regard to what we as a community expect of our Judiciary in trying to address what I believe is only most recently understood and exposed by the activities of people working in the field of sexual abuse, the major extent and problem of these crimes in Ireland.  Therefore, education is central and important.</P>
    <P>The fourth aspect highlighted by recent developments is the question of sentencing, the question of what do we do with the offender.  The point has been made very succinctly in some editorials recently that we lock people up and put them in prison as punishment, not for punishment, but there is a strong and cogent case made that those convicted of sexual offences &mdash; the type we are addressing in this legislation &mdash; and sentenced, are in need of more than mere punishment and incarceration.  This issue has been raised through the Probation and Welfare Officers Branch of the UPTCS.  The case they make is for the establishment, as a universal feature of all sentences to be imposed on sexual offenders, of a proper regime of psychiatric and psychological assessment and treatment.  I sent their submission to the Minister by way of letter of 12 December 1988.  I wish to read that letter because I think this is an essential and important aspect of this legislation.  The issue was raised by the Probation and Welfare Service and not only in their submission to the Minister.  They had, on a voluntary basis and on their own initiative started two pilot projects, one in Mountjoy and one in Arbour Hill, borrowing on their own good time and initiative to provide pilot schemes for sexual offenders in both those institutions. Building on their experiences there and their contacts internationally, they made a submission to the Minister in which they made the case that the Department and the Minister in particular must act in the area of establishing, as a feature of our prison service, psychiatric and psychological services for sexual offenders, making the point that not to do so would simply mean putting <Col N="2271" /> these people back on the streets, if anything worse off than when they went in on the first day of their sentence.</P>
    <P>The case was raised subsequently at a conference under the heading &ldquo;Alternatives to Custody&rdquo; held in Dublin on 7 and 8 April 1988, which the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Vincent Brady, attended. The association brought together many experts in the field and discussed over those two days the whole issue of alternatives to custody and highlighted in papers &mdash; presented particularly by Mr. Ray Wyer, at the time director of the Gracewell Clinic treatment centre in Birmingham for sexual offenders and himself a former probation officer &mdash; the case for the treatment of offenders of a sexual nature once incarcerated.</P>
    <P>As I said, I wrote to the Minister in 1988 asking him to address this matter in the context of the Bill which had then been in circulation in the Seanad.  I wish to quote in brief.  Referring to the Bill I stated:</P>
    <P>In general, The Workers' Party is happy with the content of the Bill and will be supporting the main thrust of the Bill when it reaches the Dáil. However, there is one area not covered by the Bill, which I would ask you to consider at this stage with a view to introducing an appropriate amendment or addition to the Bill or undertaking to consider amendment of related legislation to cover the issue.</P>
    <P>I understand that you have received a submission and representations from the Probation and Welfare Officer Branch of the Union of Public &amp; Technical Civil Servants (UPTCS).  This touches directly upon the treatment afforded to sexual offenders once in prison and the total absence of any ongoing supervision, once released.  I have spoken with Anthony Cotter, the Press Officer of the Branch, and Anna Ryan both of whom are directly involved in an innovative and pilot scheme for the treatment of sexual <Col N="2272" /> offenders at Arbour Hill; a similar project has recently been initiated at Mountjoy Prison.  In short, the Probation and Welfare Officer Service is convinced that the problems and needs of sexual offenders are unique and require intensive care, confrontation and treatment while in custody, combined with continued supervision and assessment on release after sentence, unlicence or under other order.  Having considered their submission and listened to their arguments, The Workers' Party would be disposed to their view.  We feel that the opportunity of the current Bill is an important time to address this issue, as it is not anticipated that there will be further amending legislation in this area for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>I would therefore be anxious if you might please consider the matter in full and for these purposes, I enclose a copy of the submission of the Service for easy reference.  It is hoped that you might be in a position to respond favourably to their views and consider the drafting of appropriate provisions for inclusion in this Bill when it arrives in the Dáil for discussion.</P>
    <P>I await hearing from you in response and thank you in anticipation. </P>
    <P>That was a letter of 12 December 1988, and I apologise in part for reading it at length.  I did so because to date I have not received even an acknowledgement let alone an answer.  The Minister, I suppose, if not in deference to a Member of the House in correspondence, at least in response to the submission that had been forwarded to him by the union, sought to address this matter on Second Stage when opening the debate on the Bill.  Indeed, he did not do so himself; Deputy Woods was asked to read his speech for him.  I have not got his speech as reported in the Official Report but in the text as delivered and circulated in the House under the heading &ldquo;General&rdquo; he said, before going on to discuss the provisions of the Bill itself, that he was aware that several Deputies of the 25th Dáil raised the question of the treatment of sexual offenders but that this was a separate <Col N="2273" /> matter and outside the scope of the Bill. He went on to say that programmes which had been carefully monitored were already under way in our prisons on the treatment of sexual offenders and, subject to the availability of resources, those which proved resourceful would be continued, and where appropriate extended. He said that the Bill was confined to reforming the law on sexual assault offences and to provisions which related to trials of such offences.  It did not purport to deal with the prevention or detection of such crimes; these were separate issues.  The speech went on to make reference to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill as an aspect of what the Minister is doing in an attempt to detect crime.  I find utterly and totally ridiculous and unacceptable such response by any Minister concerned actively with this area of the law.  To suggest that the Bill is not about the detection and prevention of crimes in this area means the Minister misunderstands totally what the Bill is about.  It means he does not know what he is talking about.</P>
    <P>The Bill is explicitly designed to deal with the prevention and detection of crime.  How does it do so?  It proposes to redefine the crimes involved.  It proposes to deal with the rules of evidence dealing with the conduct of trials in these cases. What is the purpose of these features if they are not to deal with the detection or the prevention of such crime?</P>
    <P>To suggest that the question of sentencing is separate as an issue from the general thrust of this Bill is insulting, in particular to those people who have voluntarily worked to establish these schemes within the prisons.  The Minister has taken them on board in the context of his delivery on Second Stage, suggesting that they are official departmental developments.  In fact, they were pushed on the Department by people working in the field who were concerned about the inaction of the Department, who decided themselves that they should of their own volition, on their own initiative and in their own time, establish pilot schemes of work in this area, and the Minister <Col N="2274" /> suggests they are being carefully monitored. He does not even acknowledge in the course of his address exactly who had thought of these schemes, had put them in place and were working them.  He gives us the impression they were departmentally contrived and established.  They were not, and he is being dishonest in his remarks to the House, but he is being completely disingenuous in suggesting he can cast this whole area of debate and issue aside by suggesting that they have no relevance to this Bill.  They are totally relevant to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The point I made in my letter to the Minister some 13 months ago is that it will be a long day again before we come back to address this area of the law and that this is the only opportunity that this Minister will have during his term of office, however long that may be &mdash; and I hope it will be as long as the Minister wishes it to be &mdash; to address the question of sentencing and the conditions of the sentence once imposed.  Consequently, it is criminally irresponsible of him to walk away from the Second Stage debate on this Bill and merely try to suggest that the conditions of sentencing have no part to play in the context of the legislation. It is essential that the Minister address this point.  His fobbing off and throwing the issue aside is utterly unacceptable and in fact raises grave questions about his commitment and that of his Department to address the problems seriously.</P>
    <P>Sentencing is directly addressed in the Bill.  Sentences are being increased for certain redefined offences, and if that is so why can we not address the issue of sentencing and the conditions and terms of sentences once imposed?  From examining the submission of the probation and welfare service of the Department the reasons that they must be linked become absolutely clear.  I will quote briefly from their submission to help me make the point that it is not simply good enough to talk about how long we lock people up for sexual offences, but how we deal with them in prison is as important as the length of their sentence.  I will quote from a policy document prepared by the Probation and Welfare Officers.  Under the <Col N="2275" /> heading &ldquo;Community Safety, Treatment and Punishment&rdquo;, they say:</P>
    <P>The use of punishment without treatment/counselling must be regarded as short sighted.  Research and those who have experience of working with sex offenders inform us that convicted sex offenders would often have committed other similar offences apart from the ones for which they were convicted in Court.  They also inform us that sex offending is a learned behaviour and unless it is unlearned the possibility of re-offending on release from prison is very high. </P>
    <P>Surely that is an argument for prevention, but the Minister says he does not want to deal with it.  The submission continues:</P>
    <P>However most sex offenders are released back into the community without having undergone a systematic treatment counselling programme.  We feel&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, the Probation and Welfare officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the time is opportune to change this situation and establish systematic programmes for sex offenders in our prison system. </P>
    <P>I agree with the submission for the reasons I have outlined.  The time is opportune.  There is no more relevant time than the present when we are debating the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988, to address this issue. The Minister must ensure before this Bill passes into law that there is a provision that makes it obligatory on the prison service to subject all persons sentenced to terms of imprisonment for sexual offences to undergo a regime of psychiatric and psychological assessment and treatment and that they then be subject to on-going treatment on licence once released at the end of the term of sentence to ensure that the very high risk of re-offending as discussed in the submission is addressed and dealt with effectively.  Under the heading &ldquo;After <Col N="2276" /> Prison &mdash; Supervision and Support&rdquo;, it is suggested in the submission that:</P>
    <P>In addition to the prison programme we strongly recommend the setting up by the Probation Service of a structured supervision and after-care programme for sex offenders on their release from prison.  When released, sex offenders need ongoing supervision and counselling so that they have to continue to face the reality of their offence, avoid re-offending and reintegrate into society. </P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Community Based Supervision&rdquo;, in cases of child molestation and incest, where non-custodial sentences might be imposed &mdash; let us face it, they occur unfortunately all too often &mdash; the submission states:</P>
    <P>In these cases we recommend community based statutory supervision and counselling as the appropriate disposal. Indeed an extended (up to five years) statutory Probation/Supervision Order might be a more appropriate sentencing option than a short prison sentence, especially for some cases of incest, child molestation and paedophilia. </P>
    <P>Again in seeking to draw at some length from the submission I want to illustrate for the purposes of this debate that the people working in the field have made a clear and succinct proposition of what should be done in a concise submission to the Minister.  For the Minister to come in here on Second Stage and with a wave of the hand say that the issue is not to be addressed by this Bill and has nothing to do with this Bill is completely and utterly contemptible and unacceptable.  The basis and need for this approach was addressed in a two-day conference in April 1988 convened by an organising committee comprising people working in the service in Ireland, and also involved those working in the prison and welfare service in Northern Ireland.  The main speakers included a Minister of State in the present Government, Dr. Ken Whitaker, the chairman of the review committee on the prison service, whose <Col N="2277" /> report in 1985 has been assiduously ignored since then and a very important contributor, Mr. Ray Wyre, who works in a special unit for the treatment of sexual offenders in Birmingham, England. He delivered a very useful paper underlining the research and reasons behind the approach now being sought by the Probation and Welfare service here.  In the context of the potential of an offender to re-offend, he said that the sexual offender is not someone who can be easily stereotyped and thrown into a cast of their own.  In the booklet <i>Crime in Ireland: Alternatives to Custody</i> Mr. Wyre states on page 23:</P>
    <P>The one thing about the offenders whom I worked with is that they came from every class and background, more so than any other criminal group. He can be a teacher, unemployed, a police-man, clergyman.  Some of the offenders I am presently working with, (who are nearly all probation clients), are a head teacher, a barrister, a watchmaker, an electronics engineer, the owner of a security firm, two retired men, a waiter and two men who are presently unemployed. </P>
    <P>He continues:</P>
    <P>Some of you who heard me talk the last time, heard me give the New York figures, but I just want to repeat them again.  In one study that was done of the New York Psychiatric Institute in New York City, 411 men admitted they had committed offences against 138, 137 &mdash; 232 child molesters had molested 117,585 children, and 89 rapists had raped 744 women. </P>
    <P>He went on to explain that studies in England where he worked showed comparable statistics.  Given the socio-economic climate in Ireland there is no reason to doubt that the pattern is any different here.  The point he is making is that which has been made in the submission from the welfare service, that this type of offence is a condition that is learned and, once acquired, is of pathological dimensions.</P>
    <P>Mr. Wyre referred to three clients, all of whom had been punished and sent to <Col N="2278" /> prison but all of whom came out of prison exactly the same as they went in, simply because nothing was done with them when they were in prison.  That is exactly the situation that exists in our prison service for the vast majority of sexual offenders, except for those who are lucky to come under the two pilot schemes established by the initiative of the Probation and Welfare Service which the Minister now says he is carefully monitoring for his own purposes.</P>
    <P>Mr. Wyre goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In identifying the problem as I would see it, I want us to remember the following: firstly, that many types of sex offending are extremely addictive, once you get into it, it is incredibly difficult to get out of it.  Second we are not looking at cure, we are looking at control, everybody in this room&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>it equally applies to this Chamber here today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;controls their sexuality, you don't get cured of it you are actually involved in controlling it.  You might not break the law if you let those controls go, but you would get into a hell of a mess. With regard to your present relationships we are all into controlling sexuality and in a sense that is what I am going to attempt to do with the offender. </P>
    <P>What we are talking about is identifying a problem.  We are not talking about cure but about the fact that the problem can be controlled from within the prison and also outside it once the offender has been released into the community.  Mr. Wyre goes on to say:</P>
    <P>As I said before sex offending is not spontaneous, it is part of a cycle of behaviour that one can identify and therefore one can seek to control it. What then is presently being done with regard to sex offenders either in prison or in the community?  On the whole it is a very simple answer &mdash; nothing. </P>
    <P>When referring to sex offenders Mr. Wyre says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2279" /> As a society we would actually rather have these men in the community in secret, in bed-sit land somewhere rather than going through some form of programme in a hostel because nobody wants the hostel in their street. The fact is that we are actually placing sex offenders in the most vulnerable part of society, we are putting them into bed-sits, the other occupants are often single parents with children and yet we still carry on exposing this vulnerable group to high risks because we will not face up to the problem that the majority of sex offenders are in the community. </P>
    <P>Mr. Wyre goes on:</P>
    <P>We need to know right from the assessment stage that even if he goes to prison he is going to be in the community in a relatively short time; we must recognise this and actually do something about it.  When an offender is in prison, we need to set up within the regimes something that would look at how he normalises, justifies and excuses, and examine the addictive behaviour of his offending. </P>
    <P>Those are the reasons advanced by Mr. Wyre in his contribution, a contribution, I have no doubt, that was fully reported back to the Minister in due course by his officials and people who attended that conference.  Those are the reasons borrowed by the Probation and Welfare Service when they made their submission to the Minister over two years ago.  Those are the reasons that prompted me in December to put before the Minister a very specific request, that he would address the need to put in place on a statutory basis a scheme of sentencing and treatment of offenders once sentenced. I find it utterly contemptible of the Minister first that he has never acknowledged or indeed answered the correspondence I sent to him and that he has failed utterly to respond to or even acknowledge the existence of the submission made to him by the Probation and Welfare Service.  In his speech he <Col N="2280" /> suggested that the issue had been raised with him by several Deputies in the 25th Dáil.  There was no reference to the prison service, who had made submissions to him.  Most importantly, it is contemptible of him that he has not indicated that he would work in this House to introduce a new section or an amendment to the existing law to deal with the problem. He did not even indicate that he is prepared to consider that it is a matter for amending legislation or for putting on a statutory basis the need for such a service in our prisons.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge I have gone on at length about this issue but I have done so simply because I believe it is important to put on the record on this occasion, as broadly as possible, that this Minister has been equipped with all the arguments, the reasons and the research to act in this area, lest the message might go out that perhaps it is some new-fangled idea that had been thought up by individuals within the service or by a few Deputies in the 25th Dáil and that really there was not a central or core issue at hand.  There is, and it is this.  Sentencing and the conditions under which sentences are imposed are central to this Bill and, more importantly, are central to the way in which we would hope to try to address the problem of sexual offending in our community, a problem which, as I have said, has been totally exposed and the extent of which we are beginning to wake up to as it affects women and young children and family life in Ireland.  For that reason it is an issue that I and The Workers' Party are not going to treat lightly in the context of this Bill.  If the Minister is not prepared to bring in an amendment we will put one down and I hope the people on the Opposition benches who are concerned with this legislation will join with us to try to make the Minister see reason in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comment on some of the provisions in the Bill.  In the <Col N="2282" /> submission prepared by the justice and civil liberties committee in The Workers' Party in January of last year we indicated general agreement with the Bill, and I conveyed this agreement to the Minister subsequently in correspondence.  We intend to support the Bill in its general thrust.  However, a number of issues do not entirely satisfy us.</P>
      <P>We are not satisfied with the definition sections and the attempt to deal with a proper definition of rape.  The Rape Crisis Centre analysed the current law and have argued very strongly for the repeal of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, and its replacement.  They identified in their document &ldquo;Rape Legislation and Investigative Procedures&rdquo;, which they submitted to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights, the major problems with the existing law and I agree with them.  They say that the 1981 Act fails to criminalise rape within marriage, to define rape in its broadest sense, to protect the anonymity of the victim, to restrict the admissibility of irrelevant evidence as to the complainant's past sexual history, and to protect the complainant from feeling that she is on trial and that she is being raped again in court.  Most of those complaints with regard to the 1981 Act are dealt with under this Bill.  I understand that there is dissatisfacation in the way some aspects of the complaints of the Rape Crisis Centre have been addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in The Workers' Party recognise that there are technical difficulties with broadening the definition of rape, but a broader definition is a better option and the Minister should have adopted that option in drafting the legislation.  The Minister's construction of a third offence, namely aggravated sexual assault, is avoiding the issue.  It is crucial that the public understands the crime of rape and we should emphasise that the crime is one of violence and not of sexual passion. The Bill should reflect this.  Making a major distinction between rape by natural intercourse and other horrific forms of assault seeks to undermine this understanding. It seems to us that the offence of aggravated sexual assault will be <Col N="2283" /> viewed as less serious than that of rape. While we acknowledge that the Bill goes some way to meet our requirements, it falls short of what is desirable.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission's report contained a majority recommendation that the Minister should adopt the broader definition.  That is the proper way to deal with it.  Before reading what the report recommends, particular regard must be given to the Law Reform Commission for their work in this whole area.  In March 1987 the then Attorney General, Mr. Rogers, requested the Commission to look at the whole area of the law and to recommend its reform. The Commission responded by seeking extensive information from the Garda Síochána and then had regard to the fourth report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights entitled &ldquo;Sexual Violence&rdquo;.  They provided interested parties and the public with a comprehensive report and consultation paper in October 1987.  Within a few short months the Commission had provided those concerned in the area of reform with this very extensive document outlining all the arguments, running to 80 pages, surrounding the issues which were then &mdash; and still are &mdash; current in the area of reform.</P>
    <P>They also gave us a very good synopsis of the law and a very good discourse on comparative laws in other countries of like regimes.  In January 1988 the Commission convened an all-day seminar which I was happy to attend.  Subsequently, having regard to a large number of written submissions, they prepared their final report in May 1988.  They produced 21 basic recommendations and provided a general scheme for a reform of the law as it existed, recommending how a new amendment Bill could be drafted and giving general guidelines in that regard.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that the Minister followed, reasonably closely, the Commission's recommendations.  Perhaps one would say this was untypical <Col N="2284" /> having regard to the debate on the Larceny Bill in the area of receiving.  Nonetheless, the Minister did have regard to the findings of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I have gone through in small detail the work which the Commission undertook because they should be applauded for the way in which &mdash; between March 1987 and May 1988 &mdash; they went over, as comprehensively as we could have hoped, the whole area of the law and the work involved.  We are very grateful to them for their succinct and concise report.  We are glad that the report has been considered and acted upon.  Having said that, it is curious that the Minister did not accept the recommendation that the report delivered on page 8 on the whole issue of the definition of rape.  I quote:</P>
    <P>We, accordingly, recommend that the crime of rape should be defined by statute so as to include non-consentual sexual penetration of the vagina, anus and mouth of a person by the penis of another person or of the vagina or anus of a person by an inanimate object held or manipulated by another person and that, in this form, the crime would be capable of being committed against men and women. </P>
    <P>It is important to have a statutory definition of rape, not just of women but of men.</P>
    <P>The Commission deliberated the pros and cons and indicated the difficulties there might be in relation to drafting and acknowledging some of the arguments of those against the broader definition, that the law has a particular function, namely to apprehend the criminal, to bring him to trial and have his case disposed of quickly with little fuss or complication.  I do not necessarily accept that argument and I criticise the very narrow view taken by members of the Commission who dissented on this issue and whose views the Minister has adopted.  By inference, I reject the thinking of the Minister that there are insuperable difficulties in the area of definition.  That is not the case, especially when one considers the talent available to the Minister in the department in the draftsman's section and in <Col N="2285" /> the Attorney General's office.  Surely we could come up with a definition which would meet the very succinct recommendations of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The minority view also was that the function of the criminal law is to put people on trial and, where necessary, to put them away.  Criminal law has a far wider responsibility of responding to community needs, of giving a clear indication that it is sensitive to the views of the community generally, it should reflect those views and give a platform to them in the form of a trial when a person is brought before a court.  It is crucial that the public understand the nature of the crime of rape.  Differentiating between one form of sexual assault as non-rape &mdash; although we all believe it to be rape &mdash; develops the view that there is a difference when really there is none.  It is important to get it right in legislation and we should be clear that the penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth is horrendous for the victim, regardless of whether the penetration is by the penis or an inanimate object.  It makes no difference, it is humiliating, degrading and a violent form of assault.  It is rape.  No one in this House will argue otherwise. It is certainly the view in the community and I do not think anyone will take the opposite view.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will not accept that argument because he perceives legal drafting difficulties.  I do not believe these difficulties are insurmountable.  We should, in this legislation, ensure that the definition of rape is of the broadest sense and reflects the view held by the community. They should certainly heed the views of every victim of a crime of aggravated assault of a sexual nature under our current laws.  The Government must realise that an assault involving an inanimate object is as horrendous, degrading and humiliating as an assault with a penile projection erect.</P>
    <P>Even in the definition in section 3 there is an even more unnecessary narrowing of the definition in regard to aggravated sexual assault. The Minister suggests at subparagraph (a) that aggravated sexual <Col N="2286" /> assault should include serious violence or the threat of serious violence or is such as to cause injury, humiliation or degradation of a grave nature to the person assaulted.  The section went on to deal with the particular and stated:</P>
    <P>...includes &mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis, or (b)  penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person.  </P>
    <P>That in itself, if we are thrown back to accepting the Minister's formula, is unnecessarily narrow.  It should, in subparagraph (a) include, penetration (however slight) of the anus or the mouth by the penis or any inanimate object.  The Minister has lost the point by suggesting that the forced penetration of the anus or the mouth is only objectionable in this context if it involves a penis.  The use of an inanimate object, a bottle, a knife, a poker or a phallic object is as degrading and as violent when forced into the anus or the mouth as it would be if it was by the penis.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister is narrowing his definition.  It appears that he does not accept the suggestion that we should be legislating to deal with rape of the male adult.  That is missing entirely in the Bill. The Law Reform Commission advocate that we should work towards a universal definition of rape, that it is an offence equally capable of being visited on a man as on a woman or on a child, male or female.  The Minister loses that entirely in the narrow way in which he has refused to adopt the broad definition.  He creates the offence of aggravated sexual offence and in defining that offence omitted anal or oral penetration by an inanimate object.</P>
    <P>We advocate the broad definition, we accept the arguments of the majority of the Law Reform Commission and we will be pressing them by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister, if he is not disposed to accept that approach, to look at the suggestion that he should have a wider definition of aggravated sexual assault in section 3.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2287" /> I welcome section 4 which outlaws marital rape.  The only observation I should like to make at this stage is to wonder aloud why it has taken the Legislature so long to address the urgent need to amend the law in that respect.  It has been argued for decades that rape within marriage was, unfortunately, a regular and constant form of degradation of the woman.  A change in our criminal code in regard to that is long overdue.  It is a poor reflection on the House that it has taken it so long to address that feature of our law.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that a boy of 14 years or under was incapable of sexual intercourse is a joke.  That should have been addressed in our law a long time ago.  I welcome the fact that it has been addressed in the Bill and that it will no longer be a defence for those of 14 years and under who commit such offences.  It is a major anomaly in our law that while we criminalise people who are seven years and upwards we have maintained this odd exception for those of 14 years and under in the context of rape.</P>
    <P>The amending provisions relating to the restriction on the right to cross-examine a complainant, or to adduce evidence about sexual experiences of the complainant with any person other than the accused without an application being approved by a judge in the absence of the jury in advance, is a welcome development of the law in that it will seek to protect the victim or the complainant in the witness box.  There is no doubt that our law was unduly weighted against a person who was the victim of the crime of rape or serious sexual assault.  It was simply a further rape of the victim in a trial to allow her to be questioned at length about previous sexual experiences that had no direct bearing on the particular incident involved.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with the Minister's amendments in that regard but I suggest that the application to restrict cross-examination should relate to any previous sexual experience.  It should be made at the beginning of the trial in the absence of the jury so that a victim will <Col N="2288" /> be in a position to assess at the outset where she stands with regard to the overall direction the cross-examination will take and will not be in the position of having to go into the witness box unsure of what road she may be brought down. She should not be left sitting in the witness box or other location while an application is made, leaving her in the difficult position of having to give evidence immediately afterwards, probably incapable of composing herself into a calm condition so that she can address whatever questions are directed at her in further cross-examination.  That is the best way to approach this issue.</P>
    <P>The attempt to address the definition of consent is welcome.  There is no doubt that there was a lot of confusion in our minds after the law concerning that was dealt with in 1981.  It can be suggested that what was in the mind of the accused, or what he reasonably might have thought to be in the mind of the complainant or victim, was an unsatisfactory approach to this issue.  There was the possibility that drink as an excuse could be used.  In that regard some explanation might be found for the remarkable decision of the case involving the soldier to which I referred.  One of the excusing factors seemed to be that the person was drunk at the time.  That clearly can have no part in excusing crimes of this sort. The definition in the 1981 Act was ambivalent when it came to understanding whether consent existed.  The Bill as it proposes to amend the law in that regard is welcome and will be supported by us.</P>
    <P>The provision to do away with the need for corroboration in section 6 is welcome. The Bill leaves it to the discretion of the judge in any case to warn the jury of the dangers that might arise if they convict without corroboration.  That is an established procedure and is a sensible one.  It should be left to the judge in any case to rely upon it but to have it, as it has been, as a universal principle that had to be applied in all cases because it was a woman who was giving testimony was an insult to women in general.  Again, I wonder why it has taken us so long to <Col N="2289" /> address that insult and strike it from our Statute Book.  It seems incredible that we had of necessity, because it was a woman who was giving testimony, to warn a jury that her testimony in those circumstances was unreliable unless supported by independent extraneous evidence when the testimony of a woman in all other circumstances, and men in every case, could be accepted without corroboration in instances of assault.  I welcome the change in this area.  Equally the efforts in the Bill to protect the anonymity of the victim and of the accused until such time as he is convicted are a welcome extension of what was attempted, without success, in the 1981 Act.</P>
    <P>We welcome these developments and will support them on Committee Stage. Our one proviso is that the complainant in a sexual assault offence trial should, in the interests of justice, be accorded full anonymity and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill should be amended to include the following: &ldquo;No matter likely to lead members of the public to identify a person as complainant may be published or broadcast&rdquo;.  It is our view that the Minister's provision in this regard is not as absolute as it should be and that it can be improved upon by a simple amendment along the lines I have suggested. I hope the Minister will consider this point.</P>
    <P>The provision to transfer cases of rape and aggravated sexual assault to the Central Criminal Court is one which our party will support.  I understand there is some concern that this provision will downgrade the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court as a court of criminal jurisdiction and will place upon the Central Criminal Court an unnecessary workload which it may not be able to handle, considering its experiences in the past.  There has also been in the past the feature of persons borrowing on the Central Criminal Court as a place to which they could seek to have recourse by transfer to delay trial. Here I note that it is at the power of the director and not at the election of the accused that trials will be taken up by the <Col N="2290" /> Central Criminal Court.  They automatically go there and the problem I have mentioned will not arise.</P>
    <P>A case has been made that considering the greater number of these cases emerging in recent years the work of the Central Criminal Court may back up unduly. There is the risk that removing these trials to the remote location of a court sitting in the Four Courts in Dublin could have an adverse effect on the role of courts in maintaining a deterrent function in this area.  An offence committed in the provinces, in Galway, Limerick, Cork or Waterford, of the nature of rape or aggravated sexual assault will in time be transferred to the Central Criminal Court in Dublin and dealt with there.  There is no practice of the Central Criminal Court sitting in circuit around the country, as the High Court does.  It sits invariably in Dublin and sits as one court alone.  I recall only once ever that any more than one division of the Central Criminal Court sat at one time and that was to deal with an inordinate backlog in the 1970s in that court.</P>
    <P>A crime committed outside Dublin will be transferred to Dublin and dealt with at a later date at a remote location.  I am worried that the fact of the crime might be lost in the community where it was committed and that its trial and all the trial can teach us about the horrific nature of these crimes will be lost if not adequately reported in the local newspapers, as inevitably it would be if dealt with in the local Circuit Court.  That worry must be addressed.  Possibly it could be addressed by the Central Criminal Court sitting in circuit or the High Court sitting in circuit could take up for a number of its days a Central Criminal Court jurisdiction to deal with crimes of this kind originating in that area.  It could also be dealt with by ensuring some link between the national and provincial newspapers so that there would be full coverage of these crimes.</P>
    <P>The simple case of the soldier receiving a suspended sentence for the rape of an 11 year old makes the argument unanswerable that this provision in the Bill must be supported.  The Circuit <Col N="2291" /> Criminal Court scored the greatest own goal possible in the debate on where and how these cases should be tried.  For the reasons I have given, I would propose that the transfer exclusively to the Central Criminal Court should be for a limited stated period in the first instance.  I am suggesting a period of between three and five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of that period we could address the question of whether it would be proper to continue the trial of these offences at that jurisdiction. We could also review whether a proper sentencing code had begun to emerge.  One of the advantages of the Central Criminal Court's dealing with these crimes exclusively will be the enabling of the tribunal sitting in one location constantly dealing with these crimes to begin to lay down guidelines of some order in the area of sentencing.  It is the ideal opportunity.  If we decide in five years' time to revert these cases to the Circuit Criminal Court, at least there will be a clear picture of sentencing which will have evolved in the interim.  For that reason we agree with what the Minister is proposing and with what is being argued strongly for by those working in the area of victim support and attempting to combat the crime of rape and serious sexual assault.</P>
      <P>The provision dealing with the exclusion of the public from hearings is a good working provision that will help assure the victims of crime that more favourable and fairer conditions will exist when they will be called upon to give evidence at trial.  It is a welcome provision which we support.  The argument has been made by those working in the field, particularly in the Rape Crisis Centres, that more should be done to help the victim in addressing the trauma of giving evidence at trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An argument has been made for separate legal representation.  We do not <Col N="2292" /> support that and I am not unduly concerned that the Minister has not addressed it in the Bill.  It is generally accepted that the experience of complainants of rape as they go through the criminal justice process is unlike that of the complainants of any other crime.  The trauma experienced in this area is unparallelled and unequalled when compared with the trauma experienced by the victim of any other serious crime.  In no other criminal case is the complainant likely to be subjected to the type of cross-questioning and humiliation which is prevalent in rape cases.  Thus, it is futile to argue that the role of a victim of a rape sexual assault offence is similar to that of the victim of other crime such as robbery, common assault etc. as a witness in court. For that reason different considerations should exist to ensure that a victim or witness in these circumstances is encouraged and helped, as far as possible, to give testimony in fair and favourable conditions.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party recommend that the complainant should have a right to full, independent legal assistance and full consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions' office to ensure that they are fully informed of the workings of the criminal justice system, the complainant's rights and duties and the complainant's role in court.  We accept that the representation should not involve the right of participation in legal argument or representation at the trial.  It should involve someone who is assigned and available to the victim for assistance during the trial and in all stages leading to it.  A victim should be advised of all the stages and decisions taken by the director or the prosecuting authority, whoever that might be, in a particular case and not necessarily have the right to influence decisions in that regard.  There is a cause for concern abroad that victims do not know what is going on from day to day.  They do not know whether they are likely to meet their alleged attacker on the public street, whether he has been granted bail, whether he is still in custody, whether the charges will be extended or whether charges will be <Col N="2293" /> dropped or amended.  We believe the complainant should be given, as a matter of course, a copy of the statement they had given to the Garda so that it is available to them to refresh their memory and to prepare them for the purpose of giving testimony at the trial eventually.  A standard booklet should be devised by the Minister for Justice which would be available to all the victims of sexual offences explaining all the circumstances attending the investigation and prosecution with particular emphasis on the role of the complainant as witness.  This is something that the witness complainants could bring home with them and consult when problems recur in their minds as they live over the trauma of a nightmare of what has happened them.  They can revert to the book to see if the answer is there concerning what is troubling them at the particular time.</P>
    <P>A positive attempt should be made to ensure that some court officials or attendants at rape and sexual offence trials are women.  This is important.  Nothing can be more traumatic for a woman arriving on the day of the trial in the company of male gardaí or whoever conducts her into the court than to walk into a court full of male lawyers and a male judge &mdash; if it is at the Circuit Court the judge has to be male because there is no female Circuit Court judge in the country &mdash; and perhaps be faced by a jury which can be entirely male and the clerk of the court might well be male.  It is important in these cases to ensure that there would be there a female presence either in terms of an attendant to assist, counsel, advise and comfort the person or an officer of the court, members of the jury or whatever.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation and we, in The Workers' Party have given it much time and attention.  I have already complained about the way in which the business of the House has been ordered to deal with it.  I hope we will now address this legislation in a concerted and considered way in the future and that the Minister will take on board some of the points that have been made, particularly the one which I dealt with at more length <Col N="2294" /> than others, the question of sentencing and what is experienced by the offender once sentenced.  The Bill is one we will support on Second Stage and will seek to amend in a fundamental way on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to meet us in this regard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett made a reference to the Bill.  He said &ldquo;it is not important&rdquo; and proceeded from there to say that it could be postponed.  In <Col N="2296" /> addition to that we have had the spectacle of the Fine Gael Party calling a quorum every 15 minutes to further delay and downgrade the importance of this legislation, despite the fact that they were facilitated by the postponement of the Child Care Bill committee meeting this evening.  All of these things will be seen by the public in their proper light, a lot of play acting and messing by members of Fine Gael because they are a little piqued.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt in my mind that when the record of the 26th Dáil is reviewed this legislation will, despite what is happening, probably rank as one of the most important pieces of legislation passed by the Dáil.  I say that, mindful of all the other legislation that is already on the Order Paper and likely to come before us in the lifetime of this Dáil.  What makes it so significant is the fact that it reflects the changing attitudes in our society over the past decade, particularly changes in social attitudes and the change in attitudes to women. The Bill is also significant because it resulted from a consultative process which, while it may not be unique, was certainly unusual.  I refer to the fact that the Bill reflects most of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report on rape which itself was the result of widespread consultation through individual submissions in a seminar attended by many interested parties. Tribute is due to the Law Reform Commission, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights and the very many groups who participated in that consultative process and whose influence can be seen in the final recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and indeed in this Bill itself.</P>
      <P>The Bill is also significant for the fact that we have it before us now a mere nine years after the previous law on rape was passed.  It is not the usual practice for such fundamental changes to be made in major legislation in such a short space of time.  This reflects the changing attitudes in our society and the fine work that was done by the various groups I have already mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2297" /> The purpose of the Bill as outlined in the explanatory memorandum and by the Minister is to provide additional protection for women who suffer sexual attacks.  It is against this yardstick that the Bill must be measured.  In other words, the basic aim of the Bill is to ensure that someone who has gone through the trauma of rape or serious sexual assault will not have that trauma added to by their experience in court or in the prosecution of the person responsible. The Bill improves substantially the protection to the victim of rape and other sexual crimes.  The provisions in this Bill aimed at this protection are very substantial and radical.  They are also very welcome as they remove serious defects which were contained in the 1981 Act, in particular section 9 which proposes that all rape and aggravated assault cases be heard in the Central Criminal Court, section 10 which excludes the public from such cases and section 12 which requires a prior application to the court in respect of evidence of previous sexual experience of the complainant with the accused. These all offer additional protection and will also make it somewhat easier for the victim to come forward to ensure that a rapist is convicted and punished.  They will at least reduce the ordeal that has to be faced by the victim in a court case. The very fact that it will be easier for the victim to go to court should have the effect of acting as a deterrent and it is well established that the less chance a person has of being detected and prosecuted the higher the incidence of the particular crime.  This Bill will redress the balance in favour of the victim.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us will, I believe, lead to more successful prosecutions for rape and facilitate and encourage the victims of rape to come forward to ensure that the rapist is prosecuted.  The statistics indicate that the percentage of rapes actually reported is considerably lower than the official figures we have would indicate.  According to the official figures from Garda sources the number of proceedings instituted for rape in the years 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 were 34, 31, 34 and 34 respectively.  If one contrasts these <Col N="2298" /> figures with the number of calls to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre for the same years there is a vast difference.  The respective figures are 408, 1,004, 1,372 and 1,236.  A fair percentage of those calls would relate to non-rape incidents and other incidents in the distant past but there is still a huge discrepency in the incidence of rape and the number of cases brought to court.  I have no doubt that a major cause of that discrepancy in the figures is the reluctance of victims to come forward bacause of the ordeal they would have to undergo during a court case under the provisions of the 1981 Act. A number of sections in this Bill will be helpful in addressing that problem.</P>
    <P>Apart from those difficulties and the difficulties associated with the victim going to court, the discrepancies can also be explained by certain social or even family pressures put on victims not to pursue a case.  In a number of cases I am aware of, family members or indeed members of the clergy have been instrumental in convincing victims not to pursue a rapist or someone guilty of abuse.  I do not question their motives for doing this but I would certainly question the desirability of this type of interference. Anything which makes it easier for a victim to go to court, as I believe this Bill will, is to be welcomed. However, there is little point in making it easier for a victim to pursue a case if the chances of a conviction are not reasonable.  In this context the present situation is hardly encouraging.  The percentage of convictions for rape in the years 1984-87 are as follows: 27 per cent of cases prosecuted in 1984, 10 per cent in 1985, 9 per cent in 1986 and 14 per cent in 1987.  These figures would hardly inspire a victim of rape to go before the courts to try to have a rapist prosecuted. I have no doubt that these low numbers of convictions cannot be attributed solely to our courts.  One need only refer to a Supreme Court decision of May 1988 in which the attitude of the court was clearly outlined by Mr. Justice Finlay, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The crime of rape must always be <Col N="2299" /> viewed as one of the most serious offences contained in our criminal law even when committed without violence beyond that constituting the act of rape itself.  In <i>Attorney General v. Conroy,</i> this Court stated that the nature of the offence was such as to render unconstitutional any statutory provision which could permit it ever to be regarded as a minor offence.</P>
    <P>The act of forcible rape not only causes bodily harm but is also inevitably followed by emotional, psychological and psychiatric damage to the victim which can often be of long term, and sometimes of lifelong duration.</P>
    <P>In addition to those damaging consequences, rape can distort the victim's approach to her own sexuality.  In many instances, rape can also impose upon the victim a deeply distressing fear of sexually transmitted disease and the possibility of a pregnancy and of a birth whose innocent issue could inspire a distress and even a loathing utterly alien to motherhood.</P>
    <P>Rape is a gross attack upon the human dignity and the bodily integrity of a woman and a violation of her human and constitutional rights.  As such it must attract very severe legal sanctions. </P>
    <P>That quotation by Mr. Justice Finlay in May 1988 clearly outlines the view of the highest court in the land to the crime of rape.  However, I am not so sure that attitude pervades down to the lower courts or indeed to the general public and the members of juries.  Despite the gravity with which the most senior court in the land views this despicable crime and the efforts of the Garda, very few convictions have taken place in the courts.</P>
    <P>I believe the problem in this regard is one of attitudes.  There has been a lack of convictions and criminal proceedings and attitudes will have to change.  If someone who hitches a lift in a car is subsequently robbed by the occupant of the car their word would never be doubted when they reported the crime. <Col N="2300" /> The crime, as reported, would be investigated and pursued.  If a person whose house is burgled reports the crime and claims insurance their word is not doubted and they are not questioned as to whether previous burglaries had taken place on their house.  If someone is mugged or attacked on a street and they report the crime, again their word is very seldom doubted.  The report would be accepted and acted upon almost immediately. There may not be witnesses in any of the above cases but I venture to suggest that the reports on all of them would be accepted.  The first reaction of people to all of these cases is one of sympathy for the victim and condemnation of the perpetrators of the crime and a desire to bring them to justice.</P>
    <P>However, if a woman is raped in circumstances similar to any of the above the attitude of many people, particularly of men, is quite different.  Their first reaction might be one of sympathy for the victim, at least ostensibly, but after the initial sympathetic remarks the next remarks may throw a shadow of doubt on the victim.  If a woman took a lift in a car, they ask what she was doing taking a lift from a stranger and did she not know it was dangerous.  Immediately some doubt is cast on her version of the story and many people believe she is partly to blame.  If a woman is raped during a break-in on her house, the same doubts are cast on the woman's role &mdash; did she know the person who broke in, could she not have got help or why did she not keep the house secure?  If a woman is mugged and raped on the way home from a dance, a pub or after shopping, again doubt is cast on her story.  In at least one case reported in the press sometime ago the fact that a woman had run half naked and badly bruised to a house was apparently not taken as sufficient evidence by a jury that she had been raped.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a common male attitude, which of course would not be admitted to, that if a woman is raped she was somehow looking for it.  If a woman invites a man back to her flat or house for a drink and he subsequently rapes her it is hard to get a jury to convict him, <Col N="2301" /> even if the physical evidence of the abuse is very strong.  At present if a judge gives a direction to the jury on the dangers of convicting a person on uncorroborated evidence it is hard to get a jury to convict him at that stage.  It is welcome that this practice will be changed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have referred to attitudes, particularly male attitudes, in what is still, whether or not people like it, a male-dominated society.  I think the belief underlying these attitudes is that a man can lose control much easier than a woman and, therefore, the responsibility is placed fairly and squarely on the woman to act responsibly at all times.  If she does not do this and wears a miniskirt, does not wear a bra, has a few drinks or flirts with men, then the belief is that she must have been looking for it and must take the consequences.  Unfortunately that seems to be the view of many people on juries, particularly when we take the number of convictions for rape into account.</P>
    <P>In rape cases the defence have always tried to bring out evidence about what a woman was wearing and her character to strengthen doubts in the minds of juries. Nobody can blame defence lawyers for doing this &mdash; an accused person is entitled to the best defence &mdash; but juries should not be unduly influenced by it and they will not be if their attitudes are balanced. A woman who invites a virtual stranger to her flat or house for an after dance drink may be very unwise, but she does not deserve to be violently attacked and raped.  Similarly, the woman who accepts a lift in a strange car, again, may be very unwise but she does not deserve to be raped.  The point I am making is a very basic one: unless attitudes change in society, no law, not even the excellent legislation before us, will help in ensuring that justice is done in cases involving rape.</P>
    <P>The record of the Circuit Criminal Court, which was referred to earlier by Deputy McCartan, is not very encouraging. The natural tendency is to blame the judge and the recent decision in the case involving the soldier, which has been referred to, will not help in instilling a <Col N="2302" /> sense of confidence in the judiciary.  In most cases it is the jury who decide if a person is guilty or not guilty.  In the four year period I mentioned 82 cases came before the Circuit Criminal Court, provincial circuit, and convictions were obtained in ten of those.  It is very significant that in some court districts no convictions were obtained in cases involving rape.  Perhaps I am reading the statistics wrong, but they worry me.</P>
    <P>While the Bill before us will go some way towards strengthening the victim's hand in gaining a conviction further steps are required.  I support the view that an accused is deemed innocent until proven guilty.  I also support the doctrine that the burden of proving an accused's guilt should rest on the party asserting that guilt.  However, I would question the standard or degree of proof required in rape cases whereby a conviction may be obtained.  The degree of proof required in rape cases, as in all criminal cases, is that the accused's guilt must be established beyond reasonable doubt.  Again, I pose the question as to what is reasonable doubt.  Let me quote a gentleman I would not like to be caught quoting too often, Lord Justice Denning who said:</P>
    <P>If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility in his favour, which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is possible but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt. </P>
    <P>The question I would pose to this House is: if it is possible to gain such strong evidence in rape cases.  The essence of rape is a lack of consent on the part of a famale victim to sexual intercourse.  What evidence will the victim have to show that there was a lack of consent?  Fortunately, under this Bill she will no longer have to display the cuts and bruises to show that there was a lack of consent, but what witnesses will she be able to call to show that there was a lack of consent at the time of penetration?</P>
    <P>Rape, unlike practically any other crime, rarely takes place in the public eye, yet the prosecution must prove the <Col N="2303" /> accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. That degree of proof may be appropriate where it is more than likely that there has been some witness to the commission of an offence.  Here, with the help of witnesses, one will be able to seek with reasonable confidence to convict and to show guilt beyond reasonable doubt. However, the question must be asked, in the light of the statistics I outlined earlier, if it is virtually impossible to obtain a rape conviction if the standard of proof is so high.  For example, this Bill introduces the crime of marital rape.  This is a move I support and approve of but one must ask how can this crime be proved.  By its very nature it is ultra-private.  How can one prove beyond reasonable doubt what occurred in the matrimonial bedroom or home?  At the very least, the fact of marriage could be said to raise a reasonable doubt and render this new offence absolutely meaningless.</P>
    <P>I propose that this Bill be amended to incorporate a provision whereby the degree of proof in a rape case or at the very least in cases involving marital rape should be on the balance of probabilities, that is, what is the most likely version of events and who is more likely to have given a truthful version of the facts to the courts.  This standard of proof would be less rigorous than requiring a case to be proved and established beyond reasonable doubt.  It would be particularly appropriate in cases involving marital rape where the absence of witnesses would probably cause the prosecution's case to fail using the present test of beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this proposal will be viewed as a departure from one of the very fundamental tenets of Irish criminal law, that in criminal cases the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.  However, my proposal to lessen the required degree of proof to that generally found in civil cases would provide a useful step in protecting our female citizens from rapists and sexual attacks. I fully appreciate that there might be a reluctance to depart from the established practice of proving a criminal case <Col N="2304" /> beyond reasonable doubt.  However, the Bill before us incorporates a fundamental departure from established practice, and Deputy McCartan referred to this in that under section 6 there will no longer be a requirement that a judge must give a mandatory warning in his charge to the jury when dealing with uncorroborated evidence but he or she may do so at her discretion.</P>
    <P>From time to time there are calls for the removal of this presumption of innocence and certain people may view my proposal as an erosion of the rights of the accused, but I believe very strongly in civil rights for all citizens, be they an accused, a victim or otherwise.  Again, I endorse the fundamental principle that an accused's innocence be presumed until guilt or otherwise is proven.  However, in the case of rape just as accused persons must be given a fair chance to uphold their innocence victims must also be given a fair chance to prove their case. The standard of proof required in rape cases, particularly in marital rape cases, denies the victim a fair hearing.  A fair hearing will be provided by altering the standard of proof required to one of the balance of probabilities.</P>
    <P>I also suggest to the Minister that he examine the composition of juries which I believe, rightly or wrongly, influences the rate of convictions.  The figures since 1979 indicate that in only 12 cases out of a total of 87 cases for which I have records did the number of women on a jury exceed that of men.  In the vast majority of cases the charges were dismissed.  I ask the Minister to take a look at that aspect to see if it would be possible to introduce a requirement that at least half the jury must be women.  I am aware that there are various rules which allow the defence and prosecution to exclude people, but I do not know if it can be made a requirement that there be a certain number of each sex on a jury.</P>
    <P>Let me make two final points on the Bill itself and on the question of the extension of the definition of rape.  This call for the extension of a definition of <Col N="2305" /> rape which was a majority recommendation in the Law Reform Commission report is dealt with adequately under the creation of a new offence.  If we extend the definition of rape I fear that we will lessen the perception at least of the seriousness of that crime.  The concept of rape at the moment is clearly defined.  Perhaps an extension could lead to unsatisfactory verdicts and we would be back to square one.  For that reason I believe rape as defined should remain as it is.</P>
    <P>Rape is a crime of violence using sex as a weapon.  It is not about passion at any stage, sexuality or anything like that. It is about power.  It is about a rapist seeking complete control over his victim. Rape is not committed for sexual gratification; it is all about power, and should be treated accordingly.  A considerable body of research in the US more than in Britain or here shows that practically all rapes are planned.  They do not just happen.  It is not always that the poor man is sexually provoked and cannot control himself; it is more sinister than that.  It is a crime which must be treated very seriously.  This Bill treats it seriously and will be a major improvement in our legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought, Sir, that perhaps you were going to read a message from the Government Chief Whip to the <Col N="2306" /> effect that Standing Orders have been suspended to allow a debate on health. Unfortunately, we will have to wait for another day.</P>
      <P>I will refer briefly to some of the points made by Deputy Dempsey.  I do not doubt his sincerity when he stated that this is perhaps the most urgent and important legislation before the House.  I welcome his comments and hope he now will exercise sufficient clout with the Government Whip's office and with his own parliamentary party to ensure the speedy passage of the Bill and that it will be placed a little higher on the agenda of the House and on the Order Paper than heretofore.  I am sure he has noticed that the title of the Bill is the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988, yet since 1987 he has been supportive of a Government who have allowed this matter to gather dust.  Accepting his sincerity, I hope we can get speedily through Second Stage of this Bill and then deal with the appropriate amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that the Bill is passed prior to the summer of 1990.  I look forward to keeping a close eye on Deputy Dempsey's contribution in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said in this debate that this is the second occasion on which we are dealing with such legislation since the early eighties, that in ten years &mdash; and this I believe is unprecedented &mdash; we have a second Bill dealing with the same subject.  It has been pointed out that this is a reflection of changing attitudes.  I am not so sure. Rather than a reflection of the changing attitudes, could it not be that we got it wrong in 1981 and that is why we are again dealing with this subject in 1988, 1989 and 1990?  Rather than pointing to a massive change in Irish society, a massive shift in regard to concern about rapists, victims of sexual assault and criminal law generally, could we not say we may have got it wrong in 1981, that while the 1981 Bill went some way towards addressing the problem, it did not go far enough, and that we are back with the 1988 Bill in an endeavour to come to grips with the omissions or the positive faults in that legislation?  I hope that at some time in <Col N="2307" /> the future we will not say we got it wrong in 1990 and we should introduce another Bill.</P>
    <P>If we are to get it right in 1990 it is important that we pay sufficient attention to the various reports and articles that have been written on the subject and the submissions made by many bodies over the past few years.  Having considered the Law Reform Commission's final report &mdash; I take it the Government have done so &mdash; it is a pity so many of their recommendations have not been taken on board.  I hope that as soon as we pass this legislation we, as legislators, will not be lobbied by interest groups from every sector of the community asking why we did not pay more attention to the Law Reform Commission report and that we will be back here in five or six years with further amending legislation.  I think we will have a very interesting Committee Stage debate where many amendments can be thrashed out.</P>
    <P>For almost all victims, rape is the most traumatic experience of their lives.  In addition to the violence used against the women, the stigma of having been sexually assaulted leads to long-term feelings of guilt and degradation, fear and humiliation &mdash; fear of a similar attack and fear of becoming integrated into the community to live what we can best describe as a normal life.  Undoubtedly rape victims are traumatised in the extreme by the experience.  Statistics show that many are forced to leave their jobs and homes. Many families break up as a result of there being a victim of rape in the household. Not surprisingly, many find it impossible to form natural and steady relationships with men thereafter.</P>
    <P>There are a number of cases in this regard which need no highlighting by me, but it is important when dealing with legislation such as this to remember that we are dealing with a crime that is in many ways unique within society.  It is important then that society's attitude towards the victim is changed, that society becomes far more compassionate and helpful to the victim of a sexual assault.  For too long we have ignored <Col N="2308" /> the plight of the victim, often too easily wrongly blaming the women for being the architect of her own downfall.  More often than not victims are left alone to suffer long lasting feelings of guilt, sorrow and extreme remorse.  That is tragic.  No matter what legislation we enact, we are not going to deal with the problem of the plight of the victim unless we change our attitude.</P>
    <P>We must look to the attitudes of the Garda Síochána and the Judiciary towards rape victims or anybody involved in the crime of rape.  There is a feeling on the part of the powers that be that they should not interfere, that it is not the duty of the Garda Síochána, or in many ways of the Judiciary, to be seen to interfere in a personal relationship.  That inhibition must be hit on the head and cast aside.  Judges must be seen to take a more lenient view of the victim.  Unfortunately, in many cases on conviction there is a plea on behalf of the offender, the assailant, that it was a once off offence, out of character, and a pledge will be given that such an offence will not take place again.</P>
    <P>I accept but will not repeat the alarming statistics given here this evening by Deputy Dempsey.  In fact, he said out of 87 cases brought before one court circuit there were no convictions.  In the case of a conviction, pleas of mitigating factors such as, it was a once-off incident&rdquo;, or &ldquo;there was provocation&rdquo; are made.  One can see with little difficulty that there are gross inefficiencies in the present law.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the question of mitigating factors, I must refer to our attitude to drink.  In rape, sexual assault and criminal cases drink is put forward as a mitigating factor.  The defendants plead to his lordship that &ldquo;unfortunately we sexually assaulted this poor girl but we were very drunk on the occasion and did not know what we were doing&rdquo;.  A common occurrence throughout our court system is that the judge is prevailed upon to take a more lenient view of the fact that somebody had taken so much drink that they were not capable of making a decision and did not even know what they were doing.  In other European <Col N="2309" /> countries and in countries throughout the world the fact that somebody had been drinking would command a heavier sentence from a sitting judge than we would impose in this State.  During a court trial of an alleged rape case it is reprehensible that drink can be put forward as a mitigating excuse as to why the assault might have taken place.  I believe that until such time as the full weight of our legal system is brought to bear on the mitigating excuse of drink, persons and to a lesser extent property, will not be adequately protected.</P>
    <P>Research in the area of rape shows that rape is not a sexually motivated crime but is borne out of anger and frustration, jealousy and hatred and is a sign of psychological disfunction, either temporary or chronic anxiety, on the part of a person to inflict a level of violence on another person.  It is important that we do not treat rape as a sexual crime but as a violent crime and if we do that, we should have no difficulty in meting out the proper sentence and retribution to a person convicted of such an odious offence.</P>
    <P>I believe, and it has been referred to earlier but it bears repetition, that the prevailing attitudes will have to change. It is important that we remember that men in our society are still categorised in a way which allows many to consider violence to be an acceptable reaction when things go wrong.  It is often considered manly to give somebody a clout in the ear.  It is considered manly to exercise physical force to prove a point, and an argument to prove a point in a public house often escalates quite easily into violence.</P>
    <P>There is an acceptance on behalf of the male sex that it is good to engage in physical violence and to be at the ready if one is called upon to prove one's manhood in the form of physical violence.  I believe that in far too many homes fathers are setting a bad example for their sons by engaging in physical violence from time to time as a sign of their manliness. Is it any wonder that young people can grow up in an atmosphere where physical violence is the order of the day <Col N="2310" /> if we do not prevail on fathers to take a less active role in meting out physical violence?  I believe parents and teachers have a tremendous role to play in this regard.  As I said earlier, we can have all the legislation in the world but we cannot force a change of attitude on people.  It is very important that we have a hard long look at the relationship between the sexes.  Ireland more than any other country has refused to accept the changes in western society, as the previous speaker has said, that have been foisted on us over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we still have segregated education.  Prevailing now as it was 50 years ago is the incredible taboo on the part of the Church as far as matters pertaining to sexuality are concerned. There has been no thawing of the attitudes there.  However, I believe it is very important if we are to put the sexes on an even footing and if we are to have a healthy relationship between the sexes that the Church would change its attitude in this regard.  We still have the traditional separation between the sexes at most social events which taken with segregated education and the attitude of the Church has led to a deep lack of understanding between the sexes from a very early age.  I think that is perhaps a reason that signs in a relationship may be interpreted wrongly from the female to the male and gives rise to a position of supremacy being exercised by the male that ends up in the tragedy of a sexual assault or rape.  It is of fundamental importance to change our attitudes and it is something that our schools, parents and Church leaders will have to pay particular attention to.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the specifics of the Bill.  One of the fundamental changes envisaged by the legislation is the making of rape within marriage an offence.  I was not in the House in 1980-81 when the present Act was being debated and I am not sure if any Member present here tonight was, but I would like to know why this was not incorporated in that legislation?  It seems absolutely amazing and shocking that we should pass reforming legislation in the eighties that did not <Col N="2311" /> incorporate a provision that allows for a husband to be brought before the courts on a charge of raping his spouse.  Certainly one can only point to a ludicrous anomaly which exists at present, that a co-habitating couple would appear to have far more protection from the law in this instance than would a husband and wife.  Yet, we are a country in favour of the family and we give the family an important role in our Constitution. Nevertheless, we have this glaring anomaly and it is certainly time we did something about it.</P>
    <P>Expert groups have shown that the vast majority of rapes occur within marriage and if one looks at the reports of groups such as Family Aid and the Rape Crisis Centre who have been doing trojan work within society one can see that there is a very high incidence of complaints by wives of alleged rape by their husbands. I cannot for the life of me understand why for so long we have given this proprietorial role to the husband that on marriage he became master over his wife and could exact sexual favours from her at each and every opportunity and should he force himself upon her she was left with little redress under the law.  That is a disgrace and I regard that section as being of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>Similarly, as regards the capacity of a person under the age of 14 to commit a rape or sexual assault, the media as well as the interest groups to which I have referred earlier have highlighted over the past number of years instances where such offences were committed by boys under that age.  One only has to point to the statistics that show that boys under the age of 14 have become fathers.  Surely if that could happen in society, it is irrefutable evidence of the fact that somebody under the age of 14 could be in a position to commit a rape.  The fact that these people had immunity under the law amounted to something of an injustice.</P>
    <P>The fourth report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights referred to this point, reference which, I am sure, the chairperson will <Col N="2312" /> address when she is making her contribution. I would like to put on the annals of this House the tremendous work that the Committee on Women's Rights have done in highlighting rape and other related women's issues and bringing them to the Floor of this House with a level of urgency that perhaps would not exist had such a committee not been in operation.  It is perhaps testimony to the work of this committee that we are dealing with such reformist legislation this evening.</P>
    <P>There is a number of points of controversy in the Bill, points that have drawn conflicting comment from many of the interested parties.  Some sections will undoubtedly draw very interesting debate on Committee Stage.  The first confrontational aspect of the legislation is the whole question of separate legal representation.  This is a matter that has been considered by a number of groups, not least the Law Reform Commission. It was with some justification that bodies such as the Rape Crisis Centre and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights proposed that an element of separate legal representation be afforded to the victim of a rape or a sexual assault. This is not surprising having regard to the atmosphere within the court area and to the lack of professional help available to the victim.  It is not surprising that, in order to ensure that the alleged aggressor is punished, there were calls for separate representation for the victim in a court of law.  There was also the feeling that the State prosecution team probably do not afford the victim the amount of help to which she is entitled.</P>
    <P>It was following considerable debate and weighing up of the pros and cons of the matter that the Law Reform Commission recommended that there be no change in the present position.  Having had a look at both sides of the argument I am in agreement with their position.  It would probably give rise to constitutional difficulties if certain changes were made, given the set up of our court structures. Perhaps there is another way around the problem.  I will briefly quote from the Law Reform Commission report.  They <Col N="2313" /> dealt with the shortcomings of the present system and stated that it was urged that the complainant should be separately represented throughout the proceedings by a barrister or solicitor of his or her choice who would be entitled to intervene in the proceedings to protect his or her interests whenever he considered it appropriate to do so.  They said also, and rightly so:</P>
    <P>In some cases, far from assisting in the conviction of guilty rapists, it might so complicate the hearing and alienate the jury as to result in unjustified acquittals...we are satisfied that the complaints to which we have referred can and should be adequately redressed within the confines of the present system.  Accordingly, we do not recommend that there should be any provision for separate legal representation of the complainant. </P>
    <P>What the Law Reform Commission are saying, prior to saying that there should not be separate representation, is that they believe that the complaints should be adequately redressed within the confines of the present system and that is very important.  We must look at the present system and build on that in the hope that there should not be a need for separate and individual representation.  If we had paid sufficient reference to working the system as it exists, perhaps these various groups would not be calling for separate and individual representation.  The nub of the argument has to be the amount of help we afford to the victim.  Since the Bill does not allow for representation, we must work the system from within.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill is to be recommended in so far as the holding of cases <i>in camera</i> is concerned.  There is a lot more that we can do in order to minimise the trauma but that will be a very difficult undertaking.  There will have to be a familiarisation course which would bring the victim into the court system, show the victim around and organise meetings between the victim and the prosecuting counsel, Chief State Solicitor's office or whoever is representing the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There should be a <Col N="2314" /> communication team from the very first day who would keep the victim fully informed and try to do something to minimise the trauma she will undoubtedly suffer.</P>
    <P>This course of help to the victim can take two forms.  First, it would deal with the immediate aftermath of the crime when the victim has to tell somebody about her tragic ordeal.  In many cases the victim will not do that because of the lack of structures that are available to her; instead she will keep it to herself. The second form of victim support would take place prior to the court proceedings. In this day and age, given the level of general medical service practitioners we have in the country and the statistical breakdown of male and female, there is no reason, in every capital town in every county, that there is not for each Garda station a panel of women doctors, one of whom would be on call at all times so as to come to the aid of the victim of an alleged sexual assault.</P>
    <P>In many of our general hospitals there should be a sexual assault centre.  This is something that would not be a huge charge on each health board.  A room should be made available, as should professional back-up and advice, to a victim in the immediate aftermath of the crime. There should be a victims examination room in the Garda station with medical and washroom facilities and there should be at least one trained person in each Garda station to deal with counselling a person in the immediate aftermath of the crime.  In time there could be pre-court counselling where copies of statements could be made available to the victim along with professional counselling services. Progress reports on the case should be furnished to the victim from time to time.  The victim should know whether there has been an application for an adjournment or whether there has been an application for bail and should know whether these applications were being granted.  At the moment the victim knows nothing about the case other than that someone has been charged and that she will be told when the case will be heard. The victim should not be regarded as just <Col N="2315" /> a witness but must be given pride of place in the case.  The prosecuting counsel and solicitors are the only people on the victim's side in securing a conviction.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly many victims are afraid of the male-dominated legal system and that could give rise to a woman's silence which could result in a rapist going free to strike again.  It is vital to have these post-crime and pre-trial procedures and I will seek an undertaking from the Minister to have those procedures set up. If they are set up the call for separate representation will be rendered superfluous.  I hope the Minister will make some reference to the way in which he will encourage the State to help the victim of rape from the time the offence is committed and the trial.</P>
    <P>Another area which has given rise to much publicity relates to the definition of rape.  In the early eighties the Dáil decided not to broaden the definition of rape but we now have another opportunity to do so.  The Minister should look more seriously at this option than did his predecessor in the Seanad last year.  The reasons for the Minister's non-acceptance of the broadening of the definition do not hold water and before Committee Stage the Minister must come up with a more reasoned argument than that put forward to date.  According to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Thursday, 22 February 1989 the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, stated in relation to broadening the definition of rape that the effect of bringing a number of offences within the definition of rape might well be to change the public perception of it, that the public would no longer know when a rape as defined at present had been committed and that, as a result, the stigma and the odium which the public attach to rape could be reduced thus bringing about the opposite result to that desired.  I have heard the Minister and other members of his party argue that point in the Seanad.  I do not accept it. Rather than reducing the public perception of the crime we have to enhance the public perception of the horrific crime the Minister for Justice has described <Col N="2316" /> insufficiently as aggravated sexual assault.</P>
    <P>An argument has been put forward that rape is unique simply because a pregnancy can result and that such actions must be distinguished from other horrific assaults of a sexual nature.  That argument does not hold water either.  If rape is defined as something that can result in a pregnancy it would mean that a woman over the age of 65 years could never be raped.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that when replying to Second Stage.  The sense of invasion is equally as shocking when one considers some of the fairly horrific sexual assaults which the Minister has chosen to ignore in his definition.  Experts agree that non-penile rape is as degrading as orthodox rape, if I can call it that.  The Law Reform Commission discussed this matter in great detail and in their report came out in favour of broadening the definition of rape.  I hope the Minister will consider broadening the definition so that we can have legislation on rape that will not be criticised as the previous legislation has been since its enactment in 1981.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister has chosen to ignore another valuable and important recommendation of the Law Reform Commission relating to compensation for the victims of rape and allied offences.  The Law Reform Commission report at page 22, paragraph 55 says:</P>
    <P>We had provisionally recommended that there should be express statutory provision enabling a judge to order the accused on conviction of rape and allied offences to pay compensation to the victim in addition to the provision for penalties.  There has been little dissent from, and a wide welcome for, this proposal and we accordingly adhere to the recommendation. </P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister has not taken that recommendation on board. The payment of compensation cannot in any way compensate the victim of rape for the invasion of privacy that has taken place and for the degradation and trauma that goes with it, but at least it would be <Col N="2317" /> an extra avenue available to the judge.  I hope the Minister will address that issue and, if not, I hope my party will seriously consider putting down an amendment in that regard.</P>
    <P>Having referred to the court atmosphere and to the fact that we are dealing with a legal system that is male dominated, one must look at the composition of juries in rape cases.  We should have at least a 50-50 representation in crimes of a sexual nature having regard to the fact that the majority of High Court judges, all Circuit Court judges, and the vast majority of district justices are male. We need a balance to minimise the sense of alienation of the rape victim who goes to court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No reference to this legislation can be made without dealing with the consistency of sentences.  We can decide to pass this legislation but unless there is uniformity and guidelines laid down in regard to sentencing, matters will, unfortunately, be left to chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not elaborate on the case in Wicklow Circuit Court which has already been referred to but one can go far beyond that to show a record of gross inconsistency in relation to convictions for rape and indecent assault over the past number of years.  In Wexford District Court in 1982, on conviction of a crime of rape of a 13 <Col N="2318" /> year old girl, a three months suspended sentence was handed down.  In many recent cases of rape, terms of 14, 15 or 16 years were handed down.  I am not saying that is wrong but certain guidelines should be laid down to ensure that justice is seen to be done on a uniform basis.  If someone commits an offence in an area where a judge takes a more lenient view than a judge in another part of the country we are not doing much to inspire confidence in our judicial system.</P>
    <P>Of course the question of sentencing has not just cropped up over the last few weeks in the light of recent decisions. The Rape Crisis Centre produced a submission dated 7 February 1984 and, as far back as 1983, made recommendations on sentencing procedures.  At that time the Rape Crisis Centre stated that they have kept records of the outcome of court hearings on rape and sexual assault cases between 1977 and 1983.  They were astounded by the inconsistencies of the sentences, ranging from the one I quoted, a three months suspended sentence imposed on a man who raped a 13 year old in Wexford &mdash; that sentence was handed down on 4 February 1982 &mdash; to a 15 years' penal servitude sentence imposed on a man convicted of rape at Dublin Circuit Court in 1979.  Those sentences speak for themselves.  I am not saying that every case is the same, each case must be judged on the circumstances, nevertheless there are gross inconsistencies in sentencing and we must look at how that matter can be redressed.</P>
    <P>There have been calls to the Minister to address himself to this problem immediately but, before he does, the Presidents of the High Court and Circuit Court should call their colleagues on the Bench together to formulate guidelines for sentencing, not just in relation to rape and sexual assault, but right across the board in criminal matters.  If that is not done immediately, there is a very positive role for the Minister for Justice in calling the parties together and ensuring, through the office of the Attorney General, that guidelines for sentencing are drawn up at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Page 21 of the 1983 report states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2319" /> In fairness to both the victim and the accused, we recommend that sentencing guidelines be established to regularise the inconsistencies which currently exist.  It is quite obvious that sentences reflect the level of seriousness afforded to the crime of rape by the particular presiding judge.  The personal whims of judges can hardly be a sound basis for fair criminal hearings. </P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that that report was not acted upon.  If it had been acted on, we would probably not be talking about inconsistencies.  As I said, the Presidents of the respective courts should endeavour, with their colleagues, having guidelines issued to ensure that the type of sentencing we have seen in the recent past will not continue.  It is important that we should have a system of training, and retraining, for our judges so that the sentences they impose will reflect the attitude of society to the crime the defendant is convicted of.  It is important to note that the vast majority of judges who hear rape cases are middle-aged men who at law school did not get any basic training in family law matters.  They are, perhaps, in need of training as far as sentencing in such cases is concerned to reflect the odium for these crimes.  I sympathise with those judges who are faced with this difficulty but they are divorced from society to such an extent that they are in need of retraining from time to time to remind them of the way society reacts to certain crimes.  A course should be arranged for our judges every three to five years.  If that was done I do not think we would have the criticism that we are hearing across the board about the inconsistency of sentences.</P>
    <P>I am not recommending direct ministerial intervention in this regard.  It is important that the Minister, and Members, keep as far away as possible from the Judiciary.  The Judiciary should maintain their independence at all times but the time may come when the Minister will have to intervene in regard to sentencing. It should be pointed out that very high sentences have been meted out to <Col N="2320" /> people convicted of rape in the Circuit Court.  It has not all been one-way traffic. The move from the Circuit Criminal Court to the Central Criminal Court may not, as many people expect, mean that the crime of rape will be dealt with more severely by a High Court judge.  One gets the impression from what some people have stated that there is a lack of understanding or a flaw in the Circuit Court but I do not accept that.  In looking at the Wicklow case one should also consider that two of the longest sentences for rape were handed down by the Circuit Court, a 20-year sentence by the President of the Circuit Court and a 21-year sentence by the late Mr. Justice Neylon who died recently.  The latter sentence was reduced to 17 years on appeal by the Supreme Court.  Those who state that the transfer of cases from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court will mean that those convicted will receive longer sentences are not giving a true picture of what is taking place.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan suggested that the sentence similar to that handed down in the Wicklow case would not be imposed if such a case was heard in the Central Criminal Court but I must remind him that five or six years ago there was an outcry about the Fairview case.  Has he forgotten that that case was heard by the Central Criminal Court?  I do not think that the transferring of these cases to the Central Criminal Court will mean that we will not have an inconsistency in regard to sentencing.  It is important that guidelines on sentencing are given to our judges.</P>
    <P>The right of appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions is important and I hope the Minister will give that serious consideration between now and Committee Stage.  It is important that the concern of the State is manifested in an avenue of appeal.  Under the British system &mdash; I am not saying it is flawless &mdash; one can appeal from a lower court to a higher court in a criminal matter in regard to sentencing but there is no avenue of appeal from an acquittal.  The Director of Public Prosecution should have an avenue of appeal in regard to the severity <Col N="2321" /> or leniency of a sentence.  The Minister should give this serious consideration.</P>
    <P>We must take a serious look at the rehabilitation programmes, if any, that are available to those convicted of rape. There is not much point in locking a person up for 14 or 15 years if they do not receive some form of professional counselling while in prison.  We have failed to provide that help for prisoners.  I urge the Minister to address that problem which I consider to be as important as the level of sentencing.  We must ensure that when people who have been convicted of rape return to society they will have learned the folly of their ways.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 10 which provides that rape cases be heard in camera.  The holding of a rape case in public can be a degrading and horrifying experience for the victim.  It is worth considering the way the media report such cases.  Without being too critical of the media I must say that the reporting of such cases is less than sensitive.  The media, while doing a duty to society by highlighting sexual assault and rape cases should be more sensitive to the feelings of the victims. There should not be any glamourising in the reporting of rape cases.</P>
    <P>Most Members are in favour of removing rape cases entirely from the ambit of the District Court.  At present, with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions a defendant can on a plea of guilty have his case dealt with by the District Court.  I am glad the Bill redresses that.  In view of the sentences that can be imposed by a district justice there is no doubt that the penalty can never fit the crime.  The fact that a person pleads guilty to such a charge should not mean that he will get a favourable sentence.</P>
    <P>The argument about which court should deal with these cases should be considered on Committee Stage.  The Central Criminal Court is not beyond criticism as far as its sentencing policy is concerned.  I have no doubt that if the Minister proceeds with the Bill as presented there will be a need to appoint additional High Court judges because it is important that there should not be any delay in the hearing of such cases. <Col N="2322" /> Members have referred to delays that have occurred in the Circuit Court in the hearing of rape cases.  I do not believe that delay exists.  When one looks at Circuit Courts throughout the country over the past 18 months or so one finds there has been a delay of no more than six months in many cases of rape.  I do not believe there is room for criticism of the Circuit Court in regard to delays.</P>
    <P>I am not sure we can give a universal welcome to the transfer of all cases to Dublin, even if the Minister appoints sufficient High Court judges to deal with the problem.  There would be great inconvenience for gardaí, for victims and those supporting them and for witnesses coming from the country who could incur considerable expense while staying in the city for the duration of the case.  With the sentencing guidelines I have mentioned and with priority case listing, perhaps there is an argument in favour of leaving Circuit Court jurisdiction in regard to these cases.  We can discuss this matter in more detail on Committee Stage.  Certainly the taking of cases out of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should not be seen as a reflection on that court.  Most Circuit Court judges work long and hard and night sittings take place on most circuits. This section of the Bill should not be seen as being in any way critical of the workload of the Circuit Court judge.  I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that more High Court judges will be appointed.  More women judges should also be appointed, given the imbalance in the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the Bill to the question of temporary release orders, a matter which has from time to time given rise to complaint and criticism.  I hope it is a matter with which we can deal in this legislation.  Perhaps crimes of rape or of aggravated sexual assault should not come under the temporary release order scheme.  This was part of a submission to the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  The Rape Crisis Centre recommended in 1984 that the Department of Justice be ordered to explain the breaking of their own assurance that in future no temporary release <Col N="2323" /> orders would be given for those prisoners serving sentences for armed robbery, rape and serious sexual offences.  These people should never be considered for temporary release.  I do not have the figures for the late eighties.  I am awaiting them from the Department of Justice but I would be very critical if it were the case that temporary release orders were still being granted for people convicted of these more serious crimes.  I would have no hesitation in placing rape on top of the list.</P>
    <P>We as legislators have to set our sights on removing from society the many forms of violence against women.  If we are to do that, we could not do better than take the advice contained in the fourth report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights dealing with sexual violence. That report contains three recommendations which can be a lesson to us in our role as legislators.  The first recommendation is to ensure a greater measure of protection and support for the victims of rape and serious sexual crimes.  The second recommendation is to establish a strong deterrent to potential rapists and other sexual offenders and the third is to help in establishing a better environment in which men and women will feel safer in business, in social life and in the home itself.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this Bill goes some way along that road.  It needs amending, tightening up and fleshing out and I hope we will proceed to do that on Committee Stage so that this legislation will not be criticised from day one, as unfortunately our previous attempt to reform the law in this regard was criticised in 1981.</P>

      <P>As every other speaker in this debate has done, I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on his initiative in introducing it.  This is the third, if not the fourth, time in the life of the present Dáil that I have had occasion to compliment the Minister, Deputy Burke, on the introduction of necessary reforming legislation.  That is an eloquent testimony to the performance of his duties as Minister for Justice since he was <Col N="2324" /> appointed to this onerous Department last year.  I would also mention the contribution of my fellow county man, Deputy Gerry Collins, now Minister for Foreign Affairs, who laid the groundwork for much of this legislation.  He is also to be complimented.</P>
      <P>This is the second time in this decade that we have addressed this subject. Many speakers have said the reason is that social attitudes within society have changed, as has society itself, during the past decade.  Deputy Flanagan's theory is that we got it wrong in 1981.  Whether we decide with the benefit of hindsight that this was so or whether it is because of changing attitudes in society that we are again discussing this subject does not concern me.  The critical thing is to ensure that we get it right now.  If anybody has any delusions about this being an easy task, that it is a simple thing to deal with this sensitive and delicate area, he or she has only to look at the report of the Law Reform Commission.  The commission in their report divided down the middle, in so far as it is possible for a five-person commission to do so.  On the central issue the commission divided three to two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>A majority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That was on the question of whether the definition of rape should be extended.  One of the two who dissented was none other than the chairman of the commission, for whom I have tremendous respect.  That is in no way to denigrate or downgrade the other dissenting member of the Law Reform Commission, Mr. Simon O'Leary, barrister-at-law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central question is whether the definition of rape should be extended. There are compelling and persuasive arguments either way.  The Law Reform Commission adverted to the arguments in favour of an extended definition of rape.  I will summarise those three arguments. The first argument is that the present offence of rape is no more distinctive than other similarly serious forms of sexual offence.  The counter argument has been used that it is a distinctive <Col N="2325" /> offence in the sense that it is the only form of sexual assault that can give rise to pregnancy.  A supporting argument is that the concept of rape has existed for centuries and people have a concept of rape which has developed over those centuries.</P>
    <P>The second argument used by the majority of the Law Reform Commission who advocated the extension of the definition was that the present definition reflects an unwanted paternalism towards women.  In support of their argument to that effect the Law Reform Commission referred to the 1987 report of the Law Reform Commission of Victoria who stated that the modern emphasis is not on the protection of virginity, the risk of pregnancy or disease or the defilement of another man's wife or daughter, but rather on providing the appropriate level of protection for the sexual autonomy of men and women.</P>
    <P>The third argument used by the majority of the Law Reform Commission is that in Ireland today the usage of the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; has a broader meaning than the legal definition of rape contained in the 1981 legislation.  These arguments by and large have been supported and elaborated on by other Members of this House.  Because one or two further arguments have been advanced during the course of the Second Stage debate I would like to refer briefly to what a number of other speakers have said.  For the record I am paraphrasing what was said as I do not want to go back over the Second Stage debate again.  As reported at column 224 of the Official Report, volume 394, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, the Fine Gael spokesman on Justice, said:</P>
    <P>On reading the Bill, and in particular the definition of aggravated sexual assault, my own reaction was that in many ways the offence of aggravated sexual assault is even more horrific than rape...</P>
    <P>It has been very strongly suggested that women who have been traumatised in this manner feel and react as if they have been raped.  It was also suggested that it would be of some <Col N="2326" /> solace to women who have been treated in such an appalling fashion if the offence with which the perpetrator was charged was called rape.  I am strongly influenced by that case.  I wish to make the proposal that the Minister should have a rethink to see if an extension in the definition, to include such conduct, would bring some comfort and solace to women who have been degraded in such an appalling fashion. There is a strong case for going along that road.</P>
    <P>In similar vein we have the contribution of Deputy Kavanagh, the Labour spokesman on Justice, column 235 of the same volume of the Official Report.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Minister should have taken the opportunity to redefine that section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is section 2 of the 1981 legislation&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the old Bill rather than have introduced the new sections dealing with sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault.  Indeed, the definitions are already in the new Bill under the heading of aggravated sexual assault.  I believe they should have been included as a new definition of rape in section 3....since that would make it absolutely clear why we all want to see this addition to the definition and would make it clear to people if they commit rape what is included in the definition.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan of The Workers' Party expanded on that and brought in a few new arguments in support of his contention that the definition should be broadened.  As we read at column 245 of the same volume of the Official Report, Deputy McCartan said:</P>
    <P>We recognise that there are technical difficulties in broadening the definition of rape but we feel it is a better option than the approach taken in the Bill.  It is crucial to public understanding of the nature of the crime of rape to emphasise that rape is a crime of violence and not sexual passion.  The Bill should reflect that.  There is a grave danger in creating the categories set <Col N="2327" /> out in the Bill that we will perpetuate the notion of myth, call it what you will, that there is something different and apart in the crime of rape from other serious sexual assaults.  There is not. </P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan went on to say, column 246:</P>
    <P>it seems that the offence of aggravated sexual assault will be viewed as less serious than rape, and for that reason we are not happy with the approach taken in the Bill. </P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan further stated:</P>
    <P>Criminal law must have a wider, more positive and active role to play than merely the primary objective as set out by the two people who comprised the minority dissent.  There must be more to our legislation than merely the apprehension, conviction and punishment of the guilty.  As legislators, we should use our legislation to attempt to lay down social parameters and directives from this House.  It is important in this context, particularly as we are addressing a definition of rape for the second time in this decade, that we get it right on this occasion. </P>
    <P>Nobody can disagree with the last sentence I have quoted from Deputy McCartan's contribution.  Nevertheless, the powerful minority of the Law Reform Commission, which included the chairman of the commission, argued that the paramount importance of any criminal provision is the apprehension, prosecution and conviction of the perpetrators of the crime with which the legislation is designed to deal.  The paramount objective of criminal law relating to sexual assault is the apprehension, prosecution and conviction of people who engage in sexual assault.  Of course, Deputy McCartan is absolutely right &mdash; and I, too, have used this argument on occasion &mdash; that the criminal law should be used to make statements, it should be used to send signals.  We did it in the Larceny Bill where we created a greater maximum sentence for receiving than for <Col N="2328" /> ordinary larceny; the intention being to send out a signal from this House that the Government regarded the crime of receiving as more heinous than the crime of simple larceny.  While everybody would agree that it is right, that it is the done thing and has been the done thing for centuries, that the criminal law should send out signals and make statements, nobody could argue &mdash; and I do not think anybody has sought to argue &mdash; Deputy McCartan certainly did not seek to do so &mdash; that that should be the paramount objective of the criminal law.  Certainly it is an important objective but it cannot be put on the same plain as the main objective of the criminal law which the minority report of the Law Reform Commission rightly stated to be the apprehension, prosecution and conviction of criminals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the majority of women.  When the Deputy is making her contribution I will treat her with more courtesy than she is affording me.  If that is the paramount importance of criminal legislation, it seems to me that in view of the serious division of opinion among legislators, in view of the serious difference of opinion among academic writers on this subject, in view of the serious divergencies of opinion among the criminal Bar and in view of the serious divergencies of opinion among many other people who have more than a passing interest in this area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I would say there is a heavy onus on the people who suggest this fundamental change to extend the definition of rape to establish a case for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is further paternalism, Deputy O'Dea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they have succeeded in discharging that onus.  As I <Col N="2329" /> have said, it is important to make statements &mdash; I will come back to that later in my contribution &mdash; but there is genuine division of opinion on this point.  If one were to accept &mdash; and I think everybody in this House, including Deputy Barnes, would accept &mdash; that the primary purpose of any criminal provision is the apprehension, prosecution and conviction of criminals, the onus is placed firmly on the people who are advocating this radical change to state and to make a compelling case as to why this change should occur. In my opinion the onus is not discharged.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom the definition of rape has not been extended despite intensive research and representations. The Law Reform Commission referred to the report of the Heilbron Committee who stated:</P>
      <P>the concept of rape as a distinct form of criminal misconduct is well established in popular thought and corresponds to a distinctive form of wrong-doing. </P>
      <P>The matter was again considered at length by the Criminal Law Revision Committee in the United Kingdom who again recommended against an extension of the definition.  That commission stated in their report:</P>
      <P>we consider it likely to be harmful to the administration of justice if the definition of a serious offence becomes out of step with the understanding of a large section of the public.  We appreciate that other forms of penetration are serious, degrading and can lead to pain and injury, but we take the view that they are distinct from rape. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a male view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Let it be said that the majority of the Law Reform Commission took the view that the apprehension, prosecution and conviction etc. of criminals is the primary purpose of this enactment and went along with the suggestion that the offence of indecent assault should be recategorised as aggravated <Col N="2330" /> sexual assault.  It would appear to me that there is a certain contradiction here.  It has been some time since I read the Law Reform Commission report.  No doubt Deputy Barnes will correct me if I am wrong but my recollection is that the Law Reform Commission accepted that suggestion.  However, I would make the point, and I am prepared to argue it with anyone who wishes to argue it with me, that the arguments in relation to the extension of the definition and recategorisation of the offence of indecent assault are separate and distinct arguments. Nobody could deny that in regard to some of those activities that will be categorised as aggravated sexual assault, if and when this Bill becomes law, the term indecent assault would be woefully inadequate to describe them.</P>
      <P>Something that is allied to that, and which just strikes me in passing, is that one of the reasons this offence of indecent assault does not seem to have attracted the sort of odium and loathing that some manifestations of the offence should have attracted is that it includes all sorts of sexual offences, from the most grievous short of rape or similar to rape to some relatively minor sexual assaults.  Another reason is that it has in some way become confused in the public mind with the other much lesser offence of indecent exposure.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the offence of indecent exposure is not a reprehensible offence; it is quite a serious offence.  In Ireland, however, we have to take reality as we find it and that offence of indecent exposure is looked on by large numbers of people as something of a joke.  It is, therefore, imperative that we recategorise the offence of indecent assault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; which the Minister has chosen to use certainly sounds more serious than indecent assault.  That is the intention of the Government and it is along the lines recommended by the Law Reform Commission. Looking at it as objectively as possible from the point of view of the ordinary citizen listening to this debate, aggravated sexual assault certainly sounds more serious than indecent <Col N="2331" /> assault.  When the facts of a few trials relating to aggravated sexual assault become known to the public, that type of crime will attract something akin to the loathing, contempt and odium that at present attaches to the offence of rape. The offence of rape has been around for centuries so naturally it will take some time for this to happen but it will happen when the facts become known to the public.</P>

      <P>While we hope many trials involving the offence of aggravated sexual assault will not take place, inevitably some will and when the details of those trials are published that offence will attract the sort of odium, loathing and contempt which at present attaches to the offence of legal rape.  Deputy Barnes is a bit premature, if I may use that expression, in her objections to this definition.  The legal definition of rape used in the Bill is along the lines suggested by the minority report of the Law Reform Commission.  It is a repetition of the definition used in 1981.  The minority of the Law Reform Commission which included the President of the commission, Mr. Justice Keane, took the view &mdash; for the reasons I have stated I believe they rightly took the view &mdash; that the definition of legal rape should not be extended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to share my time with other Deputies from my constituency.  Deputy Timmins cannot be present because he has another engagement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me this time to underline the grave problems which have resulted from a storm which hit the south and east coasts on the night of 16 December last.  Since the night of the storm the people in Arklow, Bray, Wicklow and in other villages along the east coast have been living in fear of the return of a <Col N="2334" /> similar storm to the one which devastated the north beach in Arklow and put great strain on the esplanade in Bray, thus making it liable to collapse if remedial work is not carried out immediately.</P>
    <P>About 200 to 300 people live in the vicinity of the north beach area in Arklow.  About £8 million of domestic and industrial property in the area in which about 100 people are employed is threatened by the total collapse of the sand dunes which protect it from the sea. The leisure facilities and car park are also under threat.  I was delighted the Minister for the Marine, Deputy John Wilson, visited the area along the Wicklow coast and took note of the problems there. However, I have had to raise this matter on the Adjournment tonight because during the past few days no protection has been afforded to the people living in these areas.  Flooding has again occurred and covered the new road leading into the industrial estate in Arklow.  At least three factories in that estate have been flooded and this has put into doubt the continued existence of at least two of them.  The harbour walls in Arklow are in danger of falling into the sea and this could lead to the closure of the commercial and fishing port there.</P>
    <P>As has been indicated to the Minister, the solution to this problem is the provision of 200 metres of rock armoury north of the harbour along the north beach and the carrying out of certain work to the harbour walls.  Of course, this is a costly area to repair.  Various sections of the Department of the Marine and Wicklow County Council have been considering the provision of money so that the council can carry out these works.  The Minister is well aware of the problems in the area.  We were very happy he visited the area to see the problems but the people living there are afraid that if the gale turns slightly from the south to the south-east the flooding will wreak havoc on the whole area.</P>
    <P>Because there will be a high tide at 11.30 p.m. tonight and there is a force eight gale people are living in considerable fear for their lives and their property.  Urgent action needs to be <Col N="2335" /> taken.  I appeal to the Minister to allow Wicklow County Council to start the remedial work on the rock armoury and to take into account the problems of the Bray esplanade at the same time.</P>
    <P>As I said, I want to keep my remarks short so that the other Deputies can get in.  However, I want to underline the real urgency of this appeal.  This problem cannot wait for a long-term solution; urgent action needs to be taken.  Long-term action can take place but it is essential that the sand dunes in the north beach area are replaced with rock armoury and work carried out on the esplanade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank Deputy Kavanagh for sharing his time with me.  I will be sharing my time with Deputy Jacob.  The fact that all four Members from County Wicklow will have stood here tonight in the Dáil to underscore this problem is a sign that we do not think this is a party political issue; we believe it is an issue of the gravest concern to the people of County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>For a number of years there has been an effective moratorium on any kind of coastal work, irrespective of what Government were in office.  We want the Government to take immediate action in this area.  The Minister for the Marine, Deputy John Wilson, has been very kind to the people in County Wicklow and both he and his officials visited the area to inspect the damage.  Every goodwill he could have shown us he has shown us.  As Deputy Kavanagh has said, it is difficult here in the Dáil to underscore the plight of the people along the east coast, which extends from Bray, to Kilcoole, Arklow and further along the south-east coast. There is certainly a need for some long-term schemes to be put in place but in the short-term we need cash for very specific emergency work which has to be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred to the problems in Arklow and I should like to lay specific emphasis on the problems in Bray.  The esplanade at the pier in Bray <Col N="2336" /> is currently under threat.  The same high tide that will potentially devastate the north beach area of Arklow tonight could also be wreaking havoc in Bray.  It is absolutely vital that work be undertaken there in the immediate future.  The Government need to make provision for a long-term budget for coastal erosion which perhaps could run for four or five years but there is a specific need to protect lives and property in Bray and Arklow tonight.  A few moments before this debate started Councillor Pete Mills, Chairman of the Urban District Council, phoned me from Arklow.  He, other councillors and staff have been out for the past hour sand-bagging houses for the second time today.  The tide has flowed through houses and property and devastated the premises of Arklow Engineering Services.  That same tide stands every chance of destroying houses in Bray tonight.</P>
    <P>This is not a party political issue; all of us in this House want to find the funds for this work.  I have every confidence that the Minister and his staff, together with the local authority, can find this funding.  The only thing missing at present is money.  I do not care whether this money comes from the Department of the Environment, the Department of the Marine or Santa Claus.  I want the money to be provided for this work.  That is the message coming from all quarters in County Wicklow tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity of contributing briefly to this debate.  In particular, I should like to thank Deputy Kavanagh for sharing his time with us in order to debate this vitally important issue.  The fact that he has done so emphasises the enormity of the problem in our constituency, particularly in the town of Arklow.  I will not dwell on the technical aspects as these have been comprehensively dealt with by my colleagues. The Minister is fully <i>au fait</i> with the matter having had the good sense to come down and visit us to see the position for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The town of Arklow, most of the <Col N="2337" /> remaining industries there, its unfortunate people and their homes are vulnerable to the elements.  The most recent storms swept away all the protective structures which in place along the north beach to keep out the sea.  It will not require a major storm to cause further massive damage and destruction.  Even as I speak, there is flooding in the town and should we get an easterly wind prior to corrective action being taken, the consequences will be disastrous.</P>
    <P>In general terms, I feel strongly that insufficient emphasis is placed on coastal protection.  During the most recent storms many of our coastal counties took a severe battering, for instance our neighbouring county of Wexford also suffered. In County Wicklow, damage was also caused in Wicklow town, Kilcoole and Bray, where there are serious problems, which need to be addressed as a matter of extreme urgency, as Deputy Roche has said.  If there ever was a case where the stitch in time saying could be applied this is it.  If we fail to act we will end up having to spend many millions of pounds correcting something which should be corrected now.  It has been firmly established that the one area in County Wicklow where immediate, urgent action needs to be taken is the town of Arklow, particularly the north beach, and the port which is of vital importance to the town has been severely damaged.</P>
    <P>During the past decade Arklow has seen very hard times.  It was once a thriving industrial centre, but it has seen the rundown of the fertiliser and pottery industries which has devastated the town economically.  Now, these good people are again being devastated, this time by the elements.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Wilson, for visiting my constituency to see the destruction.  I now call on him, on the Minister for Finance and on the Government in the strongest <Col N="2338" /> possible terms to treat this matter with the urgency it requires and to provide the necessary funding so that remedial works can be carried out immediately.  I am convinced there is a grave responsibility on all of us to ensure that this matter is attended to now, not weeks or months hence.  Failure to do so may result not only in damage being caused to homes and other property, but may also result in a loss of life.</P>

      <P>First, I wish to express my appreciation at the fact that the three Deputies &mdash; a fourth Deputy was unavoidably absent &mdash; have joined together and co-operated to present their case on behalf of the coastal areas in their constituency so clearly, so effectively and with so much punch.  In fact, this House could take a lesson from what they did in trying to achieve something positive, co-operate and stick to the facts.</P>
      <P>As far as my Department are concerned, I have responsibility for coastal protection, storm damage does not form part of my brief, but rather is a matter for the local authorities and the Department of the Environment.  As Deputies have said, I visited the various areas and I do not have to be persuaded that serious damage was done which presents a danger to the inhabitants in Arklow, particularly at the north beach, and will affect employment.  There is a caravan park and holiday amenity located there, and this whole area is in serious danger because the gabions were just thrown aside by the storm and the natural defences were cleared away.  It was pointed out to me previously, as it was tonight, that an east wind and a high tide leave the area in a very serious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the three Deputies, Deputies Kavanagh, Roche and Jacob &mdash; for the clarity with which they put their case and for co-operating in presenting it.  I visited Arklow and Bray and have received deputations from further south.  I accept that there is a very serious problem.  It is scarcely necessary for me to explain that coast protection consists of engineering works, and rock armoury was specifically <Col N="2339" /> mentioned by Deputy Kavanagh, to prevent progressive damage to the coastline by the continuing encroachment of the sea.  The State's involvement in coast protection has heretofore been defined by the Coast Protection Act, a slow Act, of 1963 which enabled the Commissioners of Public Works to consider proposals for coast protection schemes made by local authorities in accordance with the Act.  I understand that since 1963 nearly 100 such proposals were made but only six schemes were completed.  Major coast protection projects can cost in the region of £5 million to £10 million.  For example, a scheme for Rosslare was estimated at £5.5 million in 1986 and a scheme for Bray at £3.5 million in 1983.  The 1990 Estimates make provision of £150,000 in the Vote of Roinn na Mara for coast protection works.  The House will be aware that this responsibility passed to my Department at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this problem deserves our most serious attention, and the areas prone to coastal damage are a matter of serious concern.  As I said, I see the responsibility for coastal protection as being partially mine, inherited from the Office of Public Works, and storm damage being the responsibility of the local authorities.  Let me say to the House, to you, a Cheann Comhairle, and to those Deputies who have made the case, that I am making an attempt to meet the case outlined by the Deputies. At this moment I cannot go any further than that, but I want to assure them that it is a matter of some concern, not just verbal concern, for me and I am directing myself to the objective of doing something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, for allowing me to raise this issue.  The Skerries Shirt Company, based in Skerries and Blackrock, opened in 1949 in Skerries, and currently employs approximately 66 people.  Last week the staff were served with protective notice starting from 7 February until March.  I raise this issue tonight to appeal to the Minister and the IDA to do all in their power to ensure that this factory does not close.  The factory produces high quality shirts known as German Street Style Shirts which are the equivalent of Saville Row suits.  This is a very specialised market.  These shirts are very much sought after.  That market still exists.  The imminent closure of this plant does not arise directly from a falling market.  I believe it is possible to save this factory and I hope every effort will be made to do so.  All the staff employed in Skerries come from the Balbriggan-Lusk-Rush-Loughshinny-Skerries region, and the demise of this factory would be a devastating blow to all these towns. There is very little industry in any of them; in fact, this factory is the last of its kind employing people in any numbers in Skerries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a steady demise of the clothing industry in Ireland and it would be shameful if we allowed this high quality, specialised industry to die.  I believe it will be possible through IDA intervention to ensure its future.  If we do not secure its future we will be giving in to all the outside competition in the clothing industry.  The Minister, Deputy <Col N="2341" /> O'Malley, is not here but I trust the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Smith, will take the message to him and tell him that this company require assistance now so that the protective notices can be withdrawn and the company can continue in operation and upgrade there premises to ensure their competitiveness in the market.  Almost all the production from the Skerries plant is exported to the High Streets of London where it has a ready market.</P>
    <P>I hope the news the Minister brings me tonight will be good and I can go back to the people of Skerries, Rush and Lusk and tell them their jobs are safe, that we will have a factory that continues to produce these specialty shirts and boxer shorts.  There may even be Members of this House who wear their products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Owen and Deputy Ryan for sharing their time with me.  As I understand it, the factory in Blackrock employs 90 staff, mostly female workers, producing mainly for the home market &mdash; indeed, 100 per cent for the home market.  Unfortunately, they depended on one outlet for 95 per cent of the goods produced.  Perhaps it is not very wise to put all your eggs in the one basket.</P>
      <P>The factory was opened in the early fifties and the staff come from the Dún Laoghaire Borough and south county area.  Given the chronic state of unemployment it is always pleasant to read and hear of new jobs being created, but over the last ten days we have all been shaken by the announcement of approximately 2,500 jobs about to be lost.  Nixdorf, Sunbeam, Coca Cola, and I understand another computer company, are about to go but that has not been announced yet. Now we hear about the Skerries shirt factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various agencies are available to us.  I wonder if NADCORP could be used in this instance.  I ask the Minister to consider it.  From the latest statistics available to me through the CII, I notice £450 million worth of clothing is imported into this country and the CII estimate that we could have import substitution rather <Col N="2342" /> easily to the tune of £66.5 million which would mean a substantial number of jobs. If we get people who have the skills in this area losing out and perhaps going off to other types of work it will be a serious setback to achievement of our targets.</P>
    <P>Rather than take up all the time available, let me thank again the Deputies who allowed me to say a few words.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to make every possible assistance available to the factory in Blackrock so that the 90 jobs can be saved and, I hope, expanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Owen and Ryan for this opportunity to speak. I will not take up Deputy Ryan's time, considering he and Deputy Owen asked for this debate.  Members of the House will agree that the numerous job losses in these times are outside our control. Some of them have been as a result of a decision made outside these shores, sometimes even to shore up the base company, even though the Irish company has been productive.  Therefore, it is all the more pressing that we give support and urgent funding to indigenous industries, particularly one that has a reputation for standard and quality.  This matter is of particular interest to us because it concerns jobs, and particularly female jobs, because we all know the level of female unemployment in Ireland is even higher than male unemployment. I am not making any great deal about that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for giving us the opportunity of raising this important issue, as far as our constituency is concerned. The Skerries shirt factory has been in existence for 40 years and some <Col N="2343" /> of the staff have been employed there for 27 or even in one instance 35 years.  The factory is located in what has been classified as an industrial employment black-spot in north County Dublin in the catchment area of Balbriggan and Skerries. In Skerries there is a lack of industry; this is one of the few industries that exists in the town.  Employment in Balbriggan is 28 per cent.  To the young girls being bussed in there every morning the thought of having to go on unemployment assistance must be unbearable.</P>
      <P>The factory is a viable proposition.  The expertise and commitment of the staff is obvious and I have no doubt there is a willingness there to make a go of this firm.  There is a proven demand for the product and there are export possibilities. I ask the Minister this evening in responding to give us a commitment to do everything in his power with the IDA to get other people who will work with the workforce to ensure that this factory will continue to exist for many years to come and perhaps we will all be wearing boxer shorts made in County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their constructive approach to this problem.  I share their concern about the proposed closure of the Skerries Shirt Company's manufacturing operations at Skerries and Blackrock and the consequences for the workforce involved, many of whom have had long years of service and may not be well prepared for the new opportunities that may come.  The House will realise, of course, that in the case of any enterprise a closure decision is a matter essentially for the owners and management of that enterprise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen was a little optimistic in relation to her statistics and her knowledge of the trading position of the company. They are far from being healthy, to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There may even be questions there.  However, the trading difficulties have been there for a while, due to tough and increased competition. Overall, adverse factors such as cheaper imports and changes in the marketplace with the growth in market share of the multiples have contributed to the company's difficulties.  The company's problems have now been exacerbated by the downturn in retail sales in the UK an important market for their products.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the adverse impact both economically and socially of the loss of a total of approximately 150 jobs as a result of the proposed closure of the Skerries and Blackrock factories.  I understand, however, that the company will continue to trade while orders on hands are serviced.  In the meantime I have asked the IDA to do everything in their power to find an alternative company to take over these operations.  I can assure the House that the IDA are actively pursuing this matter.  In the context of Deputy Barrett's proposal we will see to what extent a contribution can be made from that source.  Rationalisation and restructuring have taken place on a wide scale in the clothing industry since 1973 when we joined the EC.  This was part of an ongoing requirement to adapt to changing market opportunities and to restructure to meet competition at home and abroad.  Nevertheless, the process has been a painful one with significant job losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable resources have been employed in the past decade by the State to help clothing companies in this restructuring process and to increase their competitiveness. A wide range of measures are in place and are being implemented on an ongoing basis to address the weaknesses identified in the sector, which include lack of scale, lack of attention to marketing and lack of finance.  The measures in place include financial packages with increased emphasis on State support for marketing and technology; marketing initiatives, home and export; company development planning; training programmes etc., and involve the State <Col N="2345" /> agencies working very closely with the sector.</P>
    <P>The major challenges facing the Irish clothing industry in the future are the completion of the internal market in 1992 and the longer-term phasing out of the Multifibre Arrangement which permits developed countries to maintain quota restrictions against low-cost imports from developing countries.</P>
    <P>The clothing industry must prepare itself to meet these challenges and the increased competition from low-cost sources which they will bring by increasing its competitiveness and developing its export markets.  It will be necessary for the sector to place increased emphasis on management and marketing functions <Col N="2346" /> and to exploit the advantages of quality and quick response to the needs of the consumer in order to remain competitive in the face of the inevitable increase in imports from low-cost sources.  While the support agencies play an important role in helping the industry to develop and expand, much of the initiative rests with the industry itself to exploit new markets and to be competitive on the home market.  I assure the Deputies that every effort that can be made through the State agencies will be made to see if the retention of these jobs is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I made a particular point of tackling the waiting lists as part of the programme of work undertaken with the additional funds which were made available to acute hospitals in 1989.  He will also be aware that waiting lists are now a common feature of health services throughout the world. In this country, the waiting lists for most specialties are not excessive but I accept that we have a number of &ldquo;blackspots&rdquo;. I am particularly concerned about these. Two of them, orthopaedics and ENT, are raised by the Deputy in this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to orthopaedics, the priority is to increase the throughput for hip <Col N="2002" /> replacement operations.  As a result of the special measures taken last year, the output for this procedure increased from the projected target of 1,900 to 2,200 in 1989 and to 2,700 in 1990.  This is a very significant increase when viewed against a total waiting list figure of less than 2,000.  This must also be viewed against a throughput of only 1,600 in the early 1980s when the waiting list was also 2,000.</P>
    <P>Even though output is being increased dramatically, demand continues to grow so that the effect on the absolute numbers waiting is a gradual one.  Overall, however, about 63 per cent of those waiting are on the list for less than one year but I accept that there are some areas where the waiting time is excessive and I will be paying particular attention to these.</P>
    <P>On the ENT side, I have been particularly concerned about the problems of child deafness and I specifically targeted funds to alleviate this problem.  About one-half of the 1,800 awaiting treatment at the end of the summer 1989 have now been attended to.  The objective is to ensure that all children needing grommets will be attended to within six months.  I have been paying particular attention to the areas with the longest waiting time for ENT procedures.  I am very pleased to say that very satisfactory results are being achieved.  For example, the waiting list in the Midland Health Board area has been reduced by 217 in the last quarter of 1989 and there will be a very significant further increase in throughput in 1990.  It is hoped that the waiting list of about 1,000 in Temple Street Children's Hospital will be largely cleared by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>These are specific, tangible results which are being achieved as a result of the initiatives taken last year.  The full effect of these initiatives will only become apparent as the year progresses.  They are part of an on-going programme of eliminating undue waiting times in any particular specialty.</P>

      <P>The licence granted by the Nuclear Energy Board specifies the limits for disposal into the environment for different groups of radioisotopes and these limits depend on the radiotoxicity of the radioisotopes in question.

      <P>It has been Eastern Health Board policy for some years to phase out the Lower House at St. Brendan's Hospital because of the unsatisfactory condition of the building and the serious risk of fire.  The board gradually transferred patients to suitable alternative locations either to other hospital settings or to the community.</P>
      <P>In November 1988 a fire was discovered in a vacant area of the Lower House which was brought under control with no loss of life.  At that stage there were upwards of 200 patients still being cared for there and following the recommendations of a professional fire consultant, the board decided, in view of the very serious risk of a further outbreak of fire, to transfer the remaining patients as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>By December 1989 there were 50 patients remaining in the Lower House and these were transferred to alternative accommodation by 15 December.  The fear of a total failure of the electrical and heating systems in the Lower House made it imperative to transfer patients out of the building without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unit J, to which 30 of the remaining 50 patients were transferred, was <Col N="2006" /> the Geriatric Assessment/Rehabilitation Unit for St. Laurence's Hospital and operated as such until the transfer of services to Beaumont Hospital.  This unit was reopened by the Eastern Health Board in August 1987 to accommodate 30 patients from the Lower House.  It was not possible to complete necessary adaptations before the unit was brought up to full patient complement on December 15.  However, this was completed within two days.  The Eastern Health Board has indicated that this work was similar to that which takes place on an ongoing basis in most hospitals.  I am satisfied that conditions in Unit J have been brought to a satisfactory level.  It is the board's intention to gradually transfer patients from Unit J over the next two/three months to alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy will appreciate that given the very difficult situation regarding the condition of the Lower House, the Eastern Health Board acted as quickly as possible and at all times in the best interests of patients in its care.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="2007" /> propose to answer Questions Nos. 38 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, in common with the other health boards enjoys a high degree of autonomy with regard to the organisation and delivery of health services, including dental services.  This autonomy derives from the provisions of the 1970 Health Act.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board commissioned the report referred to by Deputy De Rossa in light of some difficulties being experienced by the health board and in light of the recommendations of the working group which I established to review the delivery of dental service.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the report were adopted by the Eastern Health Board and an overall strategy to implement those proposals has been developed.  A number of pilot projects have begun in specific areas.  The report commented on the large number of dental surgeon posts which were filled by temporary appointments.  The Local Appointments Commission has organised competitions from which many of the posts have now been filled by permanent appointments.  Further appointments are expected while the health board is also seeking the services on a temporary basis of a number of dental surgeons and auxiliaries to participate in the special pilot projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present it is estimated that there are about 11,000 adults and adolescents awaiting dental treatment from the Eastern Health Board for a year or more.  The board screens applications for routine dental treatment and priority is given to particular groups such as pregnant and nursing women and the elderly whose names are placed on a special list for which the waiting time is currently about 10 months.  The health board are actively taking steps to improve their services for all adult groups through further involvement of private dental practitioners.  In addition, I am currently arranging with the health boards to improve the dental services to alleviate the long waiting <Col N="2008" /> times for routine dental services for eligible adults and adolescents.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 39 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>Every dental practitioner undergoes basic training in orthodontics and can provide routine orthodontic treatment. However, the more complicated treatments can only be carried out by or under the guidance of dentists with specialist training.</P>
      <P>Six fulltime posts of consultant orthodontist were created for the health board dental service but only one post, that in the Mid-Western Health Board, has been filled despite repeated advertisement of all the posts both in Ireland and abroad over the past few years.  I am committed to the filling of the five vacant posts of consultant orthodontist for the health board dental service.  The conditions attached to the posts are under examination in my Department at present to see if they can be made more attractive to potential candidates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the numbers awaiting orthodontic services, I have asked the health boards to update their waiting lists.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government made a special allocation of £300,000 available to the health boards <Col N="2009" /> late in 1989 to enable treatment to commence on 500 top priority cases before the end of 1989.  I am actively examining the possibility of making further additional funds available for this purpose in the current year.  It must be pointed out that these sums supplement the not inconsiderable sums already allocated by the health boards to the provision of orthodontic treatment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos, 41, 59, 71 and 383 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is concern about the present level of speech therapy provision. In particular, there have been representations about the needs for additional speech therapists for the mental handicap services.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each health board to assess the needs for different categories of health personnel in its area and to apportion the resources available to them in accordance with the priorities fixed. Health boards are at present drawing up their detailed budget plans for the current year and in this connection I understand that the North Eastern Health Board are examining the possibility of strengthening their speech therapy services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as mental handicap services are concerned, any proposal for additional speech therapists should ideally form part of an agreed prioritised coordinated service plan proposed by the health boards' Mental Handicap Coordinating Committees which are representative of the main service providers in each area. <Col N="2011" /> In the area of the Eastern Health Board, there are 25 speech therapists employed in the community care services, 25 in the hospitals and 20 in voluntary organisations for the physically and mentally handicapped.  The board have not yet filled the two vacancies in Kildare to which I referred in my reply to a question by the Deputy on 21 November last but they are awaiting applications in response to recent advertisements for the purpose.</P>

These regulations <Col N="2012" /> do not apply to persons who are entitled to a medical card under EC regulations or who are in receipt of a disabled persons maintenance allowance.</P>

      <P>In view of the amount of misleading information about this subject I would like to avail of this opportunity to put on record the facts about the funding of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.</P>
      <P>Late in 1988, the centre reported that it was experiencing serious financial difficulties. In response to this, I decided to allocate a grant of £20,000 for the centre from the national lottery proceeds.  It was made clear at the time that the grant was to be channelled through the Eastern Health Board and was subject to the centre reaching agreement with the board on the co-ordination of its services with the statutory services being provided by the board.  I also made arrangements for the health board to assist the centre in resolving its financial difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Budget Statement of January 1989 the Minister for Finance announced that the Government had decided to make available a grant of £100,000 towards the restructuring of the Dublin <Col N="2016" /> Rape Crisis Centre.  It was subsequently decided that this grant would also be channelled through the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>A review of the financial circumstances of the centre was undertaken in January 1989 by the health board's finance officer. It emerged that the main financial problem was a large accumulated debt owing to the Revenue Commissioners for outstanding PAYE and PRSI contributions in respect of its staff.  Because of the threat of imminent court proceedings, the health board paid over a sum of £90,452 to the centre on 28 February last to discharge the debt to the Revenue Commissioners for outstanding PAYE and PRSI.</P>
    <P>At the same time, representatives of the centre agreed that any further payments would be subject to the completion of a report on the activities and finances of the centre by a review team which had been established by the health board. Unfortunately, the review team experienced considerable difficulties in completing their task because of the absence within the centre of any information base on its activities and the necessity to put in place an agreed arrangement for the collection of detailed data on the level and type of services being carried out there.  As a result, the report on the centre's services and activities did not become available until November 1989.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, a further grant of £10,500 was made available by the board to the centre in September last.</P>
    <P>Following recent discussions between representatives of the centre and officials of the health board, a grant of £20,000 issued to the centre recently.  This covers all outstanding balances of funds allocated to the centre from the national lottery and in the 1989 budget.</P>
    <P>The question of direct health board funding for the centre in the future is to be the subject of further discussions between the centre and the health board based on agreed arrangements for the co-ordination of their services with those of the board.</P>

      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board was notified on 7 December last of its non-capital allocation for 1990.  The Deputies will appreciate that decisions on the detailed distribution of the allocation by programme are matters for the health board.</P>
      <P>The number of beds and resources to be provided at any hospital in the area are also matters for decision by the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance.  The board have already given very careful consideration to the question of hospital services in the area and have decided that Ennis and Nenagh Hospitals should continue to provide acute medical and surgical treatment for their present catchment populations.  In determining the exact level of services and number of beds required at each hospital it was necessary for the board to examine the population of the areas and their characteristics; the number of patients who travel outside the counties for hospital treatment; and the relationship which exists between both hospitals and Limerick Regional Hospital.  Following assessment of all these factors the board decided on the appropriate number of beds which is sufficient to provide an acceptable level of service.  It is my intention that Ennis and Nenagh hospitals will continue to provide a satisfactory level of care for the patients in their areas.</P>

      <P>The 1990 allocation of £143 million to the Southern Health Board represents an increase of 7.8 per cent over the original 1989 provision.  The board recently voted to accept the allocation and will be meeting in the coming weeks to discuss a detailed budget for the year.  The Deputy will appreciate that the detailed apportionment of the allocation among the various programmes is a matter for the board.  In regard specifically to the public health nursing service there has been an increase in the number of public health nurses working in the Southern Health Board area since March 1987.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there has been a waiting list for dental treatment in Donegal since 1983; that because of the length of the waiting list, the North Western Health Board are not accepting new applications for dental treatment until this waiting list has been cleared; and if he will provide sufficient funds to allow the dental section of the North Western Health Board in Donegal to provide the service which is required to meet the needs of the people.</Quest>

      <P>The North-Western Health Board, in common with the other health boards, gives priority to the provision of dental services for children, as a result of which there has been a curtailment of services for adults during the late eighties.  The service for children is school-based and there are no waiting lists for service.  Eligible adolescents are also treated and there is a high level of treatment provided for both groups.</P>
      <P>The board suspended the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme in 1987 and only provided an emergency service for adults.  The waiting lists for routine treatment for adults were temporarily closed.  In 1989, a special allocation of £100,000 was made by the North-Western Health Board to the dental services in order to recommence routine services for adults.  Priority is being given to persons requiring dentures and extractions in association with the need for dentures.  These services are being provided by the dental surgeons on the health board staff in accordance with special local arrangements.  The North-Western Health Board are again accepting applications from eligible adults for routine dental services.</P>
      <P>I have been aware of shortcomings in dental services for eligible adults for some time and am currently examining the possibility of providing additional resources to bring about an improvement in these dental services for eligible adults.</P>

      <P>The implications for eligibility for health services of the judgment referred to by the Deputy were considered in my Department at that time.  I understand that it was considered that the judgment did not impact on the decision to withdraw specific drugs from GMS availability. The facts in relation to the withdrawal of the drugs to which the Deputy refers is that these were over the counter items and there were alternatives available to medical practitioners providing services under the GMS where they were considered medically essential and appropriate to the requirements of the individual circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have initiated a special inquiry, under the direction of the chief medical officer of the Department, into the reported abnormal increase in the number of deaths during the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>His initial report confirms that there had been an increase in the number of deaths over the same period last year. Some of this increase can be attributed to the complications of influenza in elderly people with underlying respiratory or cardiovascular conditions.  Samples provided to the Virus Reference Laboratory by doctors have confirmed that the flu epidemic was country-wide.  A full report will be made to me when an analysis of death registrations by cause for the relevant period compared with other years, is completed by the CSO.</P>

      <P>The over-riding consideration in relation to access by a patient to medical records is that the confidentiality of the patient's medical records must be preserved.  It has not been the practice to release medical records except for the purpose of legal proceedings or to another doctor for a second medical opinion.</P>
      <P>The rights of patients to medical record information held on computers is governed by the Data Protection Act, 1988 and the Data Protection (Access Modification) (Health) Regulations, 1989 made thereunder.  These regulations provide that information will be made available to the patient, unless the doctor considers that its release could cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of the patient.</P>

      <P>I have already recognised in this House that the level of dental services provided by the health boards is inadequate at present.</P>

I am currently examining the possibility of making further additional resources available to bring about a further improvement in the orthodontic services and an improvement in the provision of routine dental treatment for eligible adults.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board have decided to provide alternative housing for the 21 mentally handicapped residents in the unit referred to by the Deputy in bungalows on a site on the campus of St. Loman's Hospital.  My Department are discussing with officials of the board how this proposal can be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Eastern Health Board have spent £60,000 approximately renovating and refurnishing the existing unit.  This renovation work, which has just been completed, has greatly improved conditions for residents and staff of the unit.</P>

      <P>The Health Research Board recently released a report which analysed the health status of travellers.  This report stated that the infant mortality rate for travellers in 1987 was 18.1 per 1,000 live births compared to the national figure of 7.4 per 1,000 live births.

Following the receipt of a report on dental services, the Southern Health Board decided that these services should in the future be provided through the board's own dental officers.  However, due to recruitment and financial constraints, to date additional dental staff have not been recruited.</P>

      <P>Funding for my Department's Health Promotion Unit for health promotion and health education initiatives comes from a number of sources.  While the funds from <Col N="2035" /> the Exchequer represent the largest proportion of available resources, funds are also available from the national lottery and from the European Community.</P>
      <P>The unit's work programme for 1990 reflects a broad intersectoral orientation. The programme includes the development of a strategic framework for health promotion under the aegis of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion.  In addition to health service based programmes such as immunisation, the unit will also be involved in developing policies on a range of issues including nutrition, smoking, alcohol, safety and exercise.  In this process the unit will work closely with the health boards and will involve other Government Departments and a range of interested groups in the voluntary, commercial, professional and educational sectors.</P>
      <P>A new anti-smoking campaign will be launched during the year.</P>
      <P>The campaign to eliminate measles, mumps and rubella is continuing.</P>
      <P>Also continuing will be the food hygiene campaign, called CLEANWATCH, which enlists the support of local health boards, retailers and the general public in promoting greater awareness of the importance of hygiene in food and catering outlets.</P>
      <P>The unit will be addressing the drug problem through a multi-disciplinary community based programme called &ldquo;Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers&rdquo;. This programme makes available training courses for facilitators in each health board who in turn bring interested people in the community together to familarise themselves with the local problems and, where appropriate, to engage in followup action in their own locality.  To date over 200 facilitators throughout the country have been trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In collaboration with the National Youth Council the unit will complete the development of a special programme on Drink Awareness and Youth (DAY). The package aims to educate young people about alcohol and to equip them with the skills necessary to deal with choices they will have to make about alcohol <Col N="2036" /> during their lives.  The DAY programme is currently being piloted around the country and will be available nationally in the spring.  The programme is geared to the 14-16 years olds and will be disseminated through youth clubs.  Resource materials for use in schools are also being developed.  These materials, which are directed at the 12-14 years olds and which include a new educational video will be available by summer.</P>
    <P>A broader based health promotional package for young people dealing with diet, exercise, nutrition, friendships, drug abuse, alcohol and smoking is also planned.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the Department of Education comprehensive resource materials on AIDS have been developed for use in schools.  The materials have been pilot tested in a number of preselected schools around the country.  The Health Promotion Unit and the Department of Education are now in consultation with relevant interested parties such as school management, teachers unions and parents groups.  The intention is that the materials will be available for distribution nationally during the current school year.</P>
    <P>The development of a health related physical fitness programme for young people to be developed through physical education classes in all schools will also be pursued.</P>
    <P>Further school based programmes which will be supported are a health educational project in schools throughout the Mid-Western Health Board area and the development of health education materials to support teachers.</P>
    <P>A conference on &ldquo;Health Promotion in the School&rdquo; will also be organised as well as seminars on cancer education for teachers.</P>
    <P>School initiatives of particular importance are a national poster competition which will be launched shortly in primary and post-primary schools to design a lifestyle poster for possible use nationally and to provide a new health education focus in schools.</P>
    <P>A major European Conference &ldquo;Teaching of Cancer Prevention at <Col N="2037" /> Schools&rdquo; will take place in Dublin next month which will involve participation by European educationalists.  This conference will be run in conjunction with the Commission of the European Communities and is one of a number of initiatives which I will be undertaking during my period as President of the EC Council of Ministers for Health.  The theme which I have chosen for the period of the Irish Presidency is &ldquo;Youth and emerging Health Problems&rdquo; and in addition to cancer education we will also be focusing on alcohol and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, the unit is developing resource materials for a community based programme on healthy lifestyles. The programme will be piloted shortly in the Mid-Western Health Board.  This project will address issues such as diet, nutrition, exercise, smoking, alcohol and stress and will be directed at a number of different audiences from the community setting to the workplace.</P>
    <P>Financial support is provided by the unit for the community based Kilkenny health project &mdash; a pilot programme to modify risk factors for heart disease.  The evaluation of this pilot project will commence shortly which will consider the potential of the project for replication on a national basis.  An evaluation of the recent anti-smoking campaign will take place which will form an important part of the preparation of further national campaigns.</P>
    <P>The unit will be supporting a number of voluntary organisations, providing financial and other assistance for health promotion activities, such as disseminating health information materials and running health related seminars.  Further community based programmes include the development of a programme to educate and inform young people about child abuse.</P>
    <P>In addition the Health Promotion Unit itself will continue to distribute to the public a wide range of health promotion materials.  Since these materials are too numerous to mention individually, I propose to circulate the complete list of <Col N="2038" /> available materials with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>In association with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, the unit have established a distribution network through pharmaceutical wholesalers to all pharmacies in the country.  In this way the public is given immediate access to a wide range of the unit's health promotion literature.</P>
    <P>The unit will shortly be opening a comprehensive video library to cover health promotion topics and will have titles available to health agencies, professionals and educators.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that sufficient funds will be available to the Health Promotion Unit to ensure that an active and comprehensive health promotion programme will be in place in 1990 as in previous years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the requirement for acute consultant staffed general hospital beds in the Eastern Health Board area is around 4,600 while there are currently over 5,000 beds open in that area.  On the basis of the recommendations of the report of the Working Party on Services for the Elderly, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> there is a need for approximately 3,615 extended care and welfare beds in the Eastern Health Board area and the bed provision in public and voluntary facilities is around 3,700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that this level of bed provision, coupled with available places in the private nursing home sector is adequate to meet any emergency or epidemic that could reasonably be contemplated. Indeed, the excellent manner in which the health service and its staff have coped with the exceptional level of serious illness in recent months has shown this.  Local management in health boards and public voluntary hospitals have had whatever flexibility is required to deal with the problem.  Hospitals have given <Col N="2041" /> absolute priority to emergency cases and in order to ensure that every person who requires admission can be accommodated additional beds have been opened and non-urgent admissions postponed.</P>
    <P>A study is under way to establish the medical conditions of those admitted to the Dublin accident and emergency hospitals during this period and the effect of emergency admission on bed availability. The full information sought by Deputy Garland in relation to the number of admissions of persons suffering from <Col N="2042" /> chest complaints will not be available until it is possible to analyse the hospital in-patient inquiry data for the period in question.  However, a study conducted during part of the period concerned indicated that around 30 per cent of admissions through the accident and emergency service in Dublin were respiratory.</P>
    <P>The data in relation to bed numbers are not readily available in the form requested by the Deputy.  However, an indication of the bed situation in the Dublin hospitals is as follows:</P>

      <P>Psychiatric services in County Roscommon are being developed and improved and I have provided the necessary capital resources to the board to enable a new 30-bed acute psychiatric unit at the general hospital to be completed. The Deputy will be aware that the report &mdash;<i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash; envisaged that acute psychiatric services should be developed in conjunction with services in acute general hospitals.  This approach will continue to guide the planning of services in County Roscommon. In addition, a range of back-up community based facilities, such as support hostels, day centres, workshops and community residences are being put in place in various locations throughout County Roscommon.  The nature of future services to be provided in St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, is the subject of discussions between my Department and the Western Health Board.  The Western Health Board will be maintaining adequate services at the Sacred Heart Home in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>In all consultations and discussions which have taken place in relation to hospital services in County Roscommon the primary concern of all parties has been and will continue to be the welfare of the people of the county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Strategy in relation to food safety is based primarily on the effective and successful enforcement of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-1989, coupled with a health promotional programme which includes advising the public of dangers arising from the mishandling of food, ineffective storage facilities and inadequate cooking arrangements.  Features of the promotional aspects of my Department's strategy on food safety are the ongoing CLEANWATCH programme and an information leaflet on Hygiene in the Home which was circulated widely recently to the public through primary schools and to relevant organisations.  In addition, the health boards in their enforcement of the regulations carry our regular monitoring and sampling programmes in conjunction with the regional analytical laboratories.  They also coordinate their reactions to reports of any outbreaks of illnesses in which food is incriminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Food Safety Advisory Committee which I established in July 1989 in association with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, represents a broad range of medical and scientific expertise and fulfils a very important role in the whole area of food policy.  Recently they presented three important reports on <Col N="2046" /> listeria, food irradiation and bovine spongiform encephalopathy.  Reports on salmonella and campylobacter are currently being prepared.</P>
    <P>While existing strategy in relation to the protection of the public is well geared to meet any challenges which may confront us in the future, we nevertheless all need to increase our vigilance and watchfulness.  Both the public and the food industry have also an important role to play in this regard.</P>

      <P>It is essential to distinguish between reported and actual numbers of suicides. The article to which the Deputy refers based its calculation of increases on the number of reported suicides which, due to improvements in recording of cases, has increased.</P>
      <P>The article uses a base year, 1970, in which very few suicides for the younger age group were reported.  A leading Irish professor of psychiatry has pointed out that such a low base severely distorts the actual rate of change, since even a small numerical increase amounts to a very high percentage increase.</P>

      <P>The conditions governing payment of domiciliary care allowance provide for a review of cases at appropriate intervals to establish the continued existence of the need for the allowance.  Therefore it has, been the established practice by health boards since the introduction of the scheme in 1973 to review eligibility at regular intervals.  The frequency of the review would depend on the circumstances of each individual case.</P>

      <P>Mammography is available to women at a number of hospitals throughout the country on referral from their general practitioner.  The benefits of screening for breast cancer have yet to be established in this country.  At present mammography is used largely as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or worried women, and, in some cases, for `at risk' women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medical opinion is divided on the value of mammography.  Before a national breast cancer screening service can be considered it will be necessary to establish whether the results reported from studies in other countries could be achieved in Ireland.  Therefore the Deputy will be interested to learn that a three year programme for breast cancer screening in a defined catchment area came into operation last year.  20,000 women will be invited to take part in this multi-disciplinary study which is being carried out by the Mater Foundation in association with other health agencies. The programme is part of a network of <Col N="2050" /> pilot schemes on breast cancer screening in the member states of the European Community to enable countries without large scale screening programmes to acquire the necessary experience and to allow for exchange of information and findings.</P>

      <P>The provision of hospital services in Roscommon is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries of the board in this matter.  I am informed that overcrowding levels on the scale mentioned by the Deputy are not experienced in Roscommon.  I understand that the normal medical bed complement is 35 and that this can be increased in response to exceptional demands such as was experienced during the recent flu epidemic. Elective admissions to the surgical department were reduced to cater for the increased level of medical admissions.  I am informed that additional staff were employed as considered necessary.</P>
      <P>A small level of overcrowding has been experienced within the last two weeks. The situation is being monitored closely.</P>

      <P>The primary task of the Development Co-operation Office, which was staffed by an officer of the Department at First Secretary/Assistant Principal level, was to oversee the disbursement of official development aid to the Sudan.</P>
      <P>The office was located on the eighth floor of the Sudan Development Corporation Building (junction of Middle Road and Street 19), New Extension, Khartoum.  Prior to that it operated from temporary hotel accommodation.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on accommodation in the period was approximately £52,800.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer's tax free allowances are restricted by the amount of his social welfare pension to take account of the tax attributable to that pension, which is paid gross. The result is that the tax due on that pension is collected under the PAYE system.</P>
      <P>The tax free allowances covered by the certificate which issued to the taxpayer in March 1989 were reduced by £2,926 in respect of his social welfare pension. From the details furnished on the taxpayer's return of income in October 1989, it was evident that the restriction of his tax free allowance to take account of the social welfare pension was too low.  His tax free allowances were, accordingly, reduced by a further £220 on 19 October 1989.</P>

      <P>While the situation in regard to the submission by returning officers of accounts for the 1989 General Election has improved substantially since the Deputy's colleague asked his question regarding disabled voters, there is as yet insufficient data on which to base a reasonably accurate reply.</P>
      <P>Returning officers are required to submit final accounts in respect of a General Election within 26 weeks of that election. As accounts outstanding in respect of the 1989 election are now well overdue I have asked my Department to ensure that they are submitted as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I would hope to have sufficiently comprehensive information to enable me to give definitive answers to the Deputy's questions within the reasonably near future.  If the Deputy would care to resubmit the questions, or contact my Office in about two months, I would expect then to be in a position to give a definitive reply.</P>

Automated Entry Processing (AEP) will be introduced at all import and export points including the land frontier on 1 January 1991.  The access to the AEP system will be via a managed network.  The impact of the revised procedures on the employment of Customs and Excise staff on the land frontier will not become clear until some time after 1 January 1991 as this will depend on the level of participation by the trading community.

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works did not lodge an objection with An Bord Pleanála as there was no known archaeological site within or close to the proposed area of quarrying.  Dowth tumulus, the nearest major national monument in the Boyne Valley megalithic cemetery, is approximately 1.25 miles away across the river Boyne.  The commissioners considered, therefore, that they had no sustainable grounds for objecting to the operation under the National Monuments Acts.  These Acts do not provide for the protection of battle sites.  As a precautionary measure the commissioners requested An Bord Pleanála, in the event of permission being granted, to insert conditions which would ensure the protection of any archaeological material that might be uncovered.  Such conditions were stipulated by An Bord Pleanála and the company in question have retained an archaeologist to supervise the stripping of overburden.</P>

      <P>My powers in this area derive from my role as the licensing authority for fish culture projects and relate to conditions which may be imposed through that regime.  There are a number of other relevant agencies viz.

      <P>Nuvan is the proprietary name for a pesticide preparation which is based on dichlorvos and which is used, inter alia, to control sea-lice in farmed salmon.</P>
      <P>Because of toxicological problems and of reports of evaluations &mdash; at EC level and by the United States Environmental Protection Agency &mdash; the Department of Agriculture has called up under the EC Classification, Packaging and Labelling Regulations all pesticide products based on dichlorvox including Nuvan.  The products will be subjected to indepth toxicological and ecotoxicological evaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, on evaluation, dichlorvos (Nuvan) poses an unacceptable risk to man or to the environment the necessary remedial <Col N="2083" /> action will be taken to remove such chemicals from the market.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, and pending the findings of current studies, my Department are continuing their efforts to ensure that there is stringent control and vigilance over the use of Nuvan in the fish farming industry.  In addition to the existing reporting requirements of the licences issued by my Department, enhanced controls were put in place in June 1989 covering e.g. safe disposal of surpluses and containers, prior notification of use and comprehensive record keeping.</P>
    <P>I would add, in relation to Nuvan, that its active ingredient dichlorvox does not persist in the marine environment as it breaks down in sea-water; very little dichlorvos enters the salmon flesh where in any event it would be rapidly broken down.  Therefore, there is no human health hazard from dichlorvos to the consumers of farmed salmon.</P>
    <P>Nuvan is not banned in the United States.  In the United Kingdom, the Government in July 1989 granted a product licence for the use of the substance in salmon farming.  As already indicated, the parallel procedure is in train in this country where the National Drugs Advisory Board is the assessor for a product licence for Nuvan.</P>

      <P>Climatic conditions and lack of the necessary processing infrastructure have inhibited the development of alternative cropping in Ireland.  While this matter, therefore, does not figure as a major item in the list of priorities I have identified for our Presidency, I am, nevertheless, anxious to encourage the development of those alternative crops, <Col N="2084" /> notably certain protein crops for flax and hemp production, which are considered to offer the best prospects given our particular situation.  Also, in the context of its Agricultural Price Proposals for 1990/91 the EC Commission is seeking to encourage the cultivation of minor grains (eg. canary seed, millet and buckwheat), as an alternative to the more widely grown cereals.  I will, of course, be endeavouring to have these proposals adopted as part of the overall prices package for which I am hoping to have agreement by the end of March.</P>
      <P>As regards set-aside, a general EC scheme has operated since December 1988, mainly in the cereals sector.  A recent Commission report to Council envisages a further development of the existing measure, whereby farmers who set-aside at least 30 per cent of their arable land and sow at least 50 per cent of the &ldquo;fallow&rdquo; area with cereals for nonfood use, will qualify for Community aid.</P>
      <P>To the extent that the Commission's most recent set-aside proposals contribute towards the promotion of rural development and environmental protection, they will enjoy my full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of the free beef scheme are reviewed each year and, in planning the 1989 measure, my primary concern was to ensure the widest and most equitable distribution of the available beef.  I believe that the scheme achieved this objective and some 120,000 people have benefited compared with less than 50,000 in 1988.</P>
      <P>The increased allocation of intervention beef which I succeeded in obtaining from the EC for the 1989 scheme made it possible to extend the scope of the measure.  The most needy welfare categories were identified in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare and comprised:</P>
      <P> (1)  Hostels and day-centres providing meals for homeless people.</P>
      <P>(2)  Certain social welfare recipients i.e.</P>
      <P>&mdash;recipients of long-term unemployment assistance and equivalent FÁS trainees</P>
      <P>&mdash;recipients of long-term supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2087" /> For 1990 I will of course review the categories covered by the scheme.  The increase in the numbers eligible for the 1989 free beef scheme indicates the Government's clear commitment to expand the scheme to the maximum possible extent.</P>

      <P>Because of toxicological problems and of reports of evaluations at EC level and by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, my Department have called up &mdash; under the EC Classification, Packaging and Labelling Regulations &mdash; all pesticide products based on dichlorvos including Nuvan.  The products will be subjected to in-depth toxicological and ecotoxicological evaluation.  It is expected that these results will be available in July next.</P>
      <P>If on evaluation dichlorvos (Nuvan) poses an unacceptable risk to man or to the environment, the necessary remedial action will be taken to remove such chemicals from the market.</P>

      <P>I understand that, following the practice advocated by the National Prices Commission when price control was in operation, importers of magazines from the UK had entered into legally binding contracts to buy sterling prior to the strengthening of the Irish pound against sterling.  Their contracts involve forward buying of sterling and I understand that contracts are not due for renewal until the middle of the year. Consequently, for price comparison purposes, it would not be appropriate to merely convert from the stated sterling charge to IR£1 as at a current date.  In addition, as the product is VAT-free in the UK, due allowance for this and the additional cost of transport from UK to Ireland must be taken into account when a comparison between retail charges here and in the UK is being undertaken.  I am, however, concerned to ensure that the benefit of the strong Irish punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling should accrue to the Irish consumer to the fullest extent possible.  To this end I am having the pricing structure of imported magazines examined as a matter or urgency and such action as is warranted by the outcome of this examination will be taken by me at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Both my Department and the Irish Insurance Federation have received only a small number of queries from persons in this profession regarding the availability of motor insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In exceptionally difficult cases cover can be obtained through the declined cases agreement.  This is an agreement <Col N="2106" /> between the authorised motor insurers and the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Declined Cases Committee, established under the agreement, examine cases referred to them by my Department where motorists have been declined cover by five or more insurance companies, and nominates a company to quote for the risk involved.  Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration it is necessary for my Department to have copies of written refusals from five insurance companies indicating the order in which they were approached together with details of any previous insurance held in the last three years.  I am not aware of any cases, involving musicians, which had to be referred to the Declined Cases Committee in order to obtain cover.</P>
    <P>I understand that all insurers regard certain occupations (e.g. musicians and taxi drivers) as being high risk as their vehicles tend to be on the road for longer periods, particularly late at night, and would, therefore, be exposed to much greater risks.  As a result some insurers will decline such a risk while others will quote and apply an occupational loading.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as the insurance supervisory authority, my primary and statutory duty is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements. In this regard I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience. There is no legal obligation on any insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote in any manner or at any particular premium.</P>

      <P>Following the most recent monthly review the price of autodiesel increased in early January, 1990 due to a substantial rise in the ex-refinery cost of the product during December 1989.  Since then, the cost of the refined product has decreased and, if this trend is continued, it is to be expected that there will be a reduction in the maximum wholesale and retail prices set in February, 1990.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Prices Commission were disbanded and centralised price control was abandoned in 1986.  I wish to avoid the reintroduction of such controls. In comparing prices charged by various establishments, one must compare like with like.  One has to take into account the service provided, as well as the product. However, I would be very concerned if publicans generally were taking excessive margins.  Consumer awareness should influence competition and I would urge consumers to discriminate in favour of the keener price taking account, where appropriate, of the service provided.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy to place a greater emphasis on ensuring that a competitive market and consumer awareness about prices exist.  To this end, there is a commitment in the <i>Programme for Government</i> to strengthening Irish competition legislation.  A Bill, which I propose to bring before the Houses of the Oireachtas for enactment this year, is being prepared to achieve this.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question relates to the explosion on 23 December, 1988 at the Marino Point plant of Irish Fertilizer <Col N="2110" /> Industries (IFI).  Immediately following the explosion, industrial inspectors of my Department carried out a series of investigations and had extensive consultations with the company.  Following their inquiries, the inspectorate reported to me that the incident occurred due to metal fatigue failure of a weld and subsequent rupture on a section of 24 inch pipe which was conveying process gases, resulting in an explosion and fire.  There were no personal injuries as a result of the incident and damage was largely confined to the plant.</P>
      <P>Since the plant restarted production in February, 1989, the inspectorate, which is now part of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, have visited the site on five occasions and have had monthly contact with the management of the company.</P>
      <P>The company has taken measures to prevent a recurrence of that incident including monthly radiological checks of the pipe welds in that part of the plant that previously failed.  The monthly examinations continue to show no defects in the relevant structure.  The company has also continued to evaluate various design options for maintaining plant safety.  The inspectors of the Authority will continue to monitor the operation of the plant.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the results of the investigation as described in my answer will contribute towards reducing the anxieties of people in the area.</P>

      <P>There is no legislative provision for the granting of adoptive leave.  The granting of such leave is regulated entirely by negotiation or custom and practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme for the granting of adoptive leave has been in operation in the Civil <Col N="2111" /> Service since 1983.  The question of introducing similar schemes in the public sector generally and in the private sector has been a matter for negotiation in individual employments.  I am aware that arrangements for the granting of adoptive leave have been agreed in some employments.</P>
    <P>The question of making a statutory provision for the granting of adoptive leave to all employees has been considered on a number of occasions in recent years.  However, in the context of other social priorities, and in particular the need to create and maintain employment through minimizing non wage costs, it was considered inopportune to introduce a statutory provision for paid adoptive leave.  I will however keep this matter under review.</P>

An examination carried out by my Department in respect of the three year period from 1985 to 1988 showed that approximately 7 per cent of notifications of proposed redundancies are not subsequently implemented.  On this basis, the number of actual redundancies qualified under the Redundancy Payments Acts during 1989 would be approximately 12,460.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1988 persons who have reckonable income or reckonable emoluments, as determined in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts, are liable to pay PRSI contributions as self-employed contributors, provided their income is in excess of £2,500 a year.  These contributions establish a personal entitlement to contributory old age and widow's and orphan's pensions.</P>
      <P>In extending social insurance to the self-employed the Government decided that both earned and unearned income would be assessable for PRSI and, accordingly, the definition of reckonable income includes moneys received by way of maintenance payments.  To exempt such payments from liability for PRSI contributions would cause many persons in need to be excluded from social insurance cover and from possible entitlement to social insurance pensions.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed in May 1987 on the basis that the rate of means assessed against him exceeded the maximum rate payable in his case.  Since then his means have been reviewed a number of times and on each occasion the means assessed against him have exceeded the maximum rate payable in his case.</P>
      <P>He made his latest request for a review of the means assessed against him on 11 November 1989.  Following a fresh investigation of his circumstances a deciding officer decided that by failing to disclose full details of his means, the applicant failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of a qualification certificate from that date.  Accordingly he is not entitled to payment of unemployment assistance from that date.</P>
      <P>A form to enable him to appeal against this decision has been issued to him.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 23 November 1988 to 24 November 1989.  Payment was suspended from 25 November 1989 as he had an insufficient insurance record in <Col N="2120" /> the tax year 1987/88 to qualify him for continued disability benefit.  However, following further investigation, his insurance records for 1987/88 and 1988/89 have now been amended and payment of benefit has been restored.</P>
      <P>A cheque for £272.10 has been issued to the person concerned, being the amount of arrears of disability benefit due from 25 November 1989 to 26 January 1990, less £126 refunded to the North Eastern Health Board in respect of supplementary welfare allowance paid to him during this period.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit under the occupational injuries scheme from 8 June 1989, in respect of an incapacity from an alleged accident at work on 6 June 1989.</P>
      <P>Pending the completion of investigations necessary in connection with the claim, his entitlement to disability benefit on an interim basis was examined.  It was found, however, that he had less than 39 paid contributions to his credit and he failed to satisfy the contribution conditions to qualify for disability benefit.</P>
      <P>An inquiry addressed to his employers failed to confirm the alleged accident and the case had to be referred for investigations by the social welfare officer.</P>
      <P>These investigations have been completed and it has been decided to allow the claim for injury benefit from 8 June, the first day of medically certified incapacity.</P>
      <P>Arrears of injury benefit due to the claimant, less the amount of supplementary welfare assistance paid to him since he made his claim to injury benefit, will be paid at an early date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of free fuel allowance is that the claimant must not be living in a local authority house where heating is provided.</P>
      <P>The application for free fuel allowance of the person concerned was rejected as he indicated on his application form that he was living in a centrally heated local authority house.</P>
      <P>On foot of the Deputy's representations, further investigations have been made in the case, which have confirmed that the person concerned does not benefit from subsidised heating.</P>
      <P>A deciding officer held on 24 January 1990 that the person concerned is entitled to free fuel allowance payable from 20 October 1989.  A payable order book payable from 26 January 1990 will issue to his local post office shortly and arrears of £70 covering the period 20 October 1989 to 19 January 1990 will issue in due course.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned has a total of 475 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in this case, is from 1953 to April 1989.  This total is equivalent to a yearly average of 13 and is, therefore, not sufficient to qualify him for a retirement pension; contributions paid prior to 1953 cannot be taken into account in determining the yearly average.</P>

    <P>As the person concerned was employed in the United Kingdom, his entitlement to a <i>pro rata</i> pension is being assessed under EC Regulations &mdash; taking both his Irish and British insurance records into account.

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 260 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>In October last year I introduced a new social assistance scheme for widowers and deserted husbands.  Under this scheme widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children may qualify for non-contributory means-tested payments on the same basis as women in similar circumstances.</P>
      <P>The question of extending to widowers and deserted husbands entitlement to the contributory pensions at present available to widowers and deserted wives will be considered in the context of, <i>inter alia</i>, any further EC Directives on equal treatment in social security and the advice of the National Pensions Board which is preparing a report for me on future policy in relation to pensions generally.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the cost of introducing contributory widower's pension and deserted husband's benefit schemes on the same basis as the existing contributory schemes for widows and deserted wives would be £50 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme a person can receive assistance in the form of a weekly supplement to help meet the cost of rent. Under these arrangements a payment can be granted where the rent exceeds £3.20 per week.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to supplements is determined by the health boards.  In general, they are calculated so as to leave the client with a disposable income, after payment of his rent, which is equivalent to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate appropriate to his family circumstances, less £3.20.</P>
      <P>Other factors, such as possible over-accommodation &mdash; whether there are other non-dependent adults living in the household who could reasonably be expected to contribute towards the rent &mdash; would also be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>Regulations governing the scheme require that a rent supplement shall not, without the consent of the Minister for Social Welfare, exceed £30 per week. Payment of a supplement in excess of this amount will be sanctioned where the circumstances of the case warrant it.</P>
      <P>A leaflet produced by the Department gives detailed information on rent and mortgage supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme.  It is available from the information offices of the Department in Dublin and around the country and from the health boards.</P>

      <P>The application for free electricity allowance of the person concerned has been approved.  The ESB have been instructed to apply the allowance to his account from the November/December 1989 billing period onwards which is the appropriate commencement date under the scheme.  He is now also entitled to a free television licence which he may obtain at his local post office.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the free fuel allowance, a person must be unable to provide for his/her own heating needs. This requirement would debar a person from receiving the allowance where his/her own heating needs are provided for under the provisions of a deed of transfer.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the deed of transfer agreed to by the person concerned and his son on 18 June 1986, the latter has undertaken to support and maintain his father during his lifetime.

      <P>The person concerned was awarded old age non-contributory pension at the maximum rate from 28 September 1984 based on an assessment of weekly means of £4.01 arising from capital. He is being paid at a reduced rate of pension at present.</P>
      <P>Following a review and reinvestigation of the case, a deciding officer decided on 19 December 1989, that he was only entitled to a pension from 15 December 1989 at £29.90 per week, the rate appropriate to a person with weekly means of £28.13 who is living alone.  Means were assessed on the basis of profit from a holding and the value of capital.  The increase in means was mainly attributable to a holding recently left to the person concerned by his deceased brother.</P>
      <P>An appeal form has issued to the person concerned to enable him to appeal, if he so wishes, against the deciding officer's decision.  He has been requested to set out clearly the grounds of his appeal and to include any relevant documents in support of his appeal. When this form is returned his case will be referred to an appeals officer for decision.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 17 November 1989.  Following an investigation, a deciding officer assessed him with means of £9.96 per week derived from the value <Col N="2138" /> of board and lodgings in his parents' home.  The total income of his parents, including an allowance from the SouthEastern Health Board, was established at £204.40 per week.</P>
      <P>Due to the exceptional circumstances of this case, both parents being in receipt of a blind pension and with other dependants, the case was reviewed by a deciding officer who has assessed him with nil means with effect from the date of his claim.  All arrears due as a result of this decision will be paid to him without delay.</P>

      <P>This person is in receipt of pension since 25 April 1986.  He has been assessed with means derived from a farm. In June 1988 he applied for an increase in pension having transferred the holding to his son.  However, he has retained an interest in some of the proceeds and it did not appear that the son was in beneficial occupation of the farm in the ordinary sense.  Under social welfare legislation, a person who deprives himself of pay, income or property in order to qualify for old age pension or an increase in pension continues to be assessed with the means in question.  Accordingly the assessment of his means remained unchanged and the application for an increase was refused.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed this decision.  Following reinvestigation of the case by the local social welfare officer, the appeals officer decided in December 1988 to uphold the original decision not to grant an increase in pension as there had been no change in the appellant's circumstances.  The appeals officer held that, although the holding has been transferred to his son, the person concerned was still in beneficial occupation of the holding.  The appeals officers decision is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>

      <P>Payment of allowances in respect of children's footwear is made on a seasonal basis between the months of September and January each year.  In the period from September 1988 to January 1989, the latest period for which complete information is available on these payments, 56,069 households were assisted in respect of 154,187 children.</P>
      <P>The allowance is intended for school-going children of social welfare beneficiaries who are unable to provide for their children's footwear needs.  Beneficiaries who, for example, have other income or whose claims are of a short-term nature would not qualify for an allowance.</P>
      <P>A separate leaflet outlining the details of the footwear scheme was made available in October 1989 to encourage people to avail of the scheme and posters advertising the scheme were placed in social welfare offices and other outlets.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say what proportion of eligible persons did not receive footwear allowance.

      <P>There are no general criteria, in relation to traffic accident data, laid down by my Department for the provision of traffic route lighting on national primary routes.  Each application, by a local authority, for the provision of traffic route lighting is assessed, by the Department, on its merits.  The main factors taken into account are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" />  (1)  whether there is a night-time accident situation at the location in question, and</P>
    <P>(2)  whether the accident pattern is one in which the provision of public lighting is liable to reduce accidents significantly.  </P>
    <P>In general, traffic route lighting is confined to urban areas.</P>

      <P>Under the urban renewal programme, tax reliefs and rates remissions are available, within certain time limits, in respect of development and redevelopment carried out in the designated areas.</P>
      <P>In 1989, a sum of £2 million was provided in State grants to assist works by local authorities designed to enhance the environment of the designated areas and to complement other development under the urban renewal programme.  A list of the works assisted by these grants in 1989 is set out in the schedule.  The original provision of £2 million for these grants in the 1990 Estimates will be increased to £2.5 million, in accordance with the recently announced environment action programme.</P>

      <Quest>whether the building of the Dundrum by-pass for Dundrum, Dublin 14, forms part of the Government's current five year road programme; when the proposed by-pass will be built; and when funds will be provided by the Government for the provision of the by-pass to relieve severe traffic congestion in the Dundrum area of south Dublin.</Quest>

      <P>The cost of constructing or improving non-national roads, such as the proposed Dundrum by-pass, normally falls to be financed by the local authorities from their own resources supplemented by the discretionary grants for road improvements provided annually by my Department.  The timing of the construction of schemes funded in this way is a matter for the relevant local authority. <Col N="2168" /> Only a limited amount of funding is available to the Department to provide special road grants for such projects.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to identify specific non-national road projects in the roads element of the operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructure, a draft of which has been submitted to the EC Commission in accordance with the Community Support Framework adopted by the Commission. The selection of non-national road projects to receive special road grants will be made in the context of the annual road grant allocation process, having regard to the budgetary provisions available for such projects, the competing demands of projects of this type throughout the country and whether the projects meet the criteria for assistance from EC Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>It is intended that an element of the Dundrum by-pass project, linking Sandyford Road to Ballinteer Road, will be built in conjunction with the Southern Cross Route which is scheduled for construction during the period 1992 to 1995, subject to the statutory procedures involved.  I am not in a position, at this stage, to indicate a likely construction period for the remainder of the by-pass project.</P>

      <P>I have had requests from many urban local authorities and interested persons for an extension of urban renewal designation to their areas, and all such requests are carefully considered.  Given the special nature of the urban renewal incentives, comment on particular cases has to be at the discretion of the Minister for the Environment and is normally reserved.</P>
      <P>I have however stated my proposal, in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 59 of 19 July 1989 and subsequently, to extend designation for urban renewal to a number of new areas in Dublin inner city and to parts of Ballina, Bray, Carlow, Clonmel, Drogheda, Ennis, Longford and Portlaoise.</P>

      <P>The information in relation to the receipts and expenditure on the management and maintenance of local authority housing is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.  As these functions are the responsibility of individual housing authorities, their cost is not directly subsidised by the Exchequer, apart from the general rates support grant, and must be met from rental income, the revenue portion of the proceeds of tenant purchase schemes, which is normally 40 per cent, and the revenue resources of the authorities themselves.</P>

      <P>The total amount of claims for planning compensation at the end of 1987, the last year for which published data is available, was £10,228,500.  It is understood, however, that at the end of 1989 claims against Dublin County Council, which account for almost all such claims, amounted to £13,507,500.</P>
      <P>The total amount of planning compensation paid by planning authorities in the years 1982 to 1987, the period for which published data is available, was £90,571.  Payments during 1988 and 1989 by Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation amounted to £2,021,917.</P>

      <P>The statutory basis for control exercised by my Department over the use of food additives is to be found in a series of regulations made under the Health Acts, 1947-70, and the European Communities Act, 1972.  These regulations specify the additives which may be used in food and in some cases restrict the use of specified additives to certain foods up to specific limits.  They are regularly updated to take account of EC Directives.</P>
      <P>In addition to these specific controls, the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Food Hygiene Regulations contain provisions which provide general protection to the public by prohibiting the sale of food which is adulterated, contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that the use of permitted additives is kept under constant review in this country by an expert advisory body, <Col N="2184" /> namely, the Food Safety Advisory Committee. In the event of the committee expressing concern about the safety of a particular additive, appropriate action in the interest of public health and safety would be taken.</P>
    <P>The statutory controls are enforced by the health boards.  Each health board conduct planned food sampling programmes under which different foods are sampled and analysed on a regular basis. The samples are analysed by the public analysts for compliance with specified regulations, where these exist, and for compliance with the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Food Hygiene Regulations. The tests used, where these are not prescribed in the relevant legislation, are internationally recognised ones. Where a sample is found not to comply with the law, the analysts issue a certificate on the basis of which prosecution proceedings may be taken by the health board.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made of the hospital authorities regarding this matter.  It is understood that the person concerned attended at the Meath Hospital's accident and emergency department on 24 November 1989 with a laceration of his left hand and that there was some delay before he was treated.  This delay was caused by the attendance at the accident and emergency department of a number of seriously ill patients who needed immediate attention and admission.  The number of examination areas was <Col N="2185" /> severely restricted while these patients awaited transfer to the wards.  Of necessity people with lacerations and other nonlife threatening conditions had to wait until these cases had been dealt with.  I understand that the person concerned did receive the appropriate care and attention when seen.</P>
      <P>Given the nature of the accident and emergency service it is impossible to anticipate when and how many people will present for treatment nor can one anticipate the type of the injuries that have to be dealt with.  I am satisfied that adequate resources have been provided to enable the Meath Hospital to significantly improve its accident and emergency service which is now available on a 24 hour, seven day week basis.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I initiated discussions on a review of the common contract in September 1987.  An agenda of issues to be covered was agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation.  Agreement was reached in June 1988 with the organisation on the scheduling of consultants' commitments.  Despite this agreement, the organisation subsequently instructed members not to proceed to agree or record their specific <Col N="2187" /> schedule of commitments at local level. When it became clear that a satisfactory solution to this issue could not be reached, the Government decided in May 1989 that the review of the common contract and other arrangements appropriate to consultants, including remuneration, should be referred to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  The matter will be further considered in the light of the review body's report.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the growing problem of homelessness among young people in our cities and towns and the Government have taken a number of initiatives in advance of the enactment of <Col N="2188" /> the Child Care Bill which is at present before a special committee of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>In 1988 the Government established a special £4 million fund for disadvantaged youth from the national lottery funds set aside by the Government for youth affairs.  The overall objective of the fund is to develop a wide range of community youth projects aimed at meeting the needs of those among our young people who are facing special and complex problems. In particular, the Government decided that the needs of groups considered to be particularly at risk such as the young homeless, young travellers and young substance abusers should be given priority consideration in the allocation of this special fund.  I am pleased to be able to say that the Government allocated a sum of over £1 million to a wide range of new initiatives geared specifically to the needs of these particular groups of young people.  These funds have been allocated through the health boards, mainly to a wide range of voluntary organisations in different parts of the country.  The allocations include increased funding to enable some existing services to be enhanced as well as allocations to enable new services to get off the ground.</P>
      <P>As far as the Ballymun area of Dublin is concerned, a shelter for homeless boys, run by the Arrupe Society, is located in the Ballymun flats complex.  This project is receiving financial assistance from the special fund.  Furthermore, a new residential centre for homeless girls, funded from the same source, is being developed by the Eastern Health Board in Ballymun.  Dublin Corporation have allocated flats for the centre, a project leader is about to be appointed and it is expected that the centre will be operational by the middle of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the facilities available in Ballymun, homeless children and young persons from the area are placed, as necessary, in various hostels and residential centres around the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also mention that five additional social workers were appointed by the health board in 1987 to deal specifically with homeless young persons.  One <Col N="2189" /> of these social workers is assigned to the Ballymun area.</P>

      <P>While the principle of patient confidentiality prevents a full discussion of an individual case on the floor of the House, I can say that the neuro-surgery department of Beaumont Hospital informed the patient's general practitioner on 7 December 1989 that it was in a position to accept an immediate referral and to assess this patient.  It also stated that the policy of the hospital board was to fund external referrals or consultations only where it is satisfied that none of its consultant neuro-surgeons are in a position to provide a service in a particular case.</P>
      <P>I understand that the general practitioner in consultation with the family has in the interim arranged to have the patient treated elsewhere.</P>

    <P>Data for 1987 and 1988 is provisional and based on year of registration.</P>
    <P>Source: Reports on Vital Statistics, Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest an increased mortality from cancer in any particular geographical region of the country.  It is, however, known that an increased risk of cancer is associated with life in urban environments.  This association is experienced in all countries, including Ireland, where accurate mortality statistics are collected.</P>
    <P>The percentage of smokers in the population has declined considerably during the last ten years.  For adult men the rate has dropped from 40 per cent to 32 per cent, while for adult women the reduction has been less marked falling from 31 per cent to 27 per cent.  There is, however, a long-term lag between reductions in smoking and consequent falls in lung cancer mortality.  Since women started smoking heavily about 2030 years later than men, lung cancer deaths in women are continuing to rise whereas for men they have begun to level off.  It is to be expected that the recent changes in smoking habits will result in lower rates of mortality from cancer of the lung in coming decades.</P>
    <P>Mortality from cancers of the lung, bronchus and trachea have increased greatly in all western countries during the last four or five decades and lung cancer is now the most common form of fatal malignancy.  In Ireland, lung cancer accounts for over 20 per cent of all cancer deaths per year.  For females, breast cancer accounts for nearly 20 per cent of all cancer deaths and is the most frequent cause of death from cancer in women. Mortality rates from breast cancer have been relatively stable in recent years. Stomach cancer, formerly one of the most common causes of death from cancer, has fallen dramatically in recent decades and now accounts for around 500 deaths annually compared with over 1,000 per year 30 years ago.  The reasons for this decline are not clearly understood but seem likely to be related to changes in diet.  For detailed information on mortality from all forms of cancer may I refer <Col N="2195" /> the Deputy to the Annual Reports on Vital Statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>Risks from specific forms of cancer can be associated with certain occupations where carcinogenic materials are used. The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health (NAOSH) was recently established to provide expertise in this and other areas related to occupational safety and to work towards ensuring safe working conditions.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2196" /> The drop in the numbers covered by medical cards in this area between 1987 and 1988 is largely due to the removal of invalid cards (for example, those that are no longer eligible or have left the area or have died) from the records of the Southern Health Board in preparation for the implementation of the new GMS contract.</P>

      <P>Experiments carried out in the UK on a very small sample of domestic microwave ovens indicate that:</P>

      <P>(2)  microwaving instructions given by food processors cannot take account of the variability in oven performance;</P>

      <P Just="Center">Safe Use of Microwave Ovens.</P>
      <P Just="Center">(Food Safety Advisory Committee).</P>
      <P> 1.  Microwave ovens are best suited to reheating and defrosting small quantities of food.  Meals should average 2cm depth, as this is the optimum thickness to ensure proper cooking.</P>
      <P>2.  The centre of the food cooked in a microwave oven should reach a temperature of 74ºC.</P>
      <P>3.  Instructions regarding standing periods once the oven is switched off must be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  All food coming out of the microwave oven should be piping hot.  If <Col N="2201" /> not, the food should be returned for a further heating period.</P>

      <P>Lohar national school was a two teacher school up to 30 June 1984 when due to the insufficiency of the average enrolment, because some pupils from the area were going to other schools, the assistant teacher became redundant.  This teacher secured a Diocesan Panel post from September 1985 which resulted in Lohar becoming a one teacher school. There were 15 pupils enrolled in the school at the time.</P>
      <P>In the light of the low enrolment in the school the manager was informed by letter on 8 August 1988 that grants were being withdrawn from the school with effect from 31 August 1988 under Rule 29 (2) of the Rules for National Schools. An appeal was received in the Department regarding the reopening of the school.  Some of the parents were not prepared to accept the decision and took it on themselves to keep the school open, employing a teacher at their own expense.  Eight pupils attended in the 1988-89 school year.  A similar number started in the 1989-90 school year.</P>

      <P>The higher education grants scheme is subject to annual ongoing review and is also subject to amendment in the light of such review.  Apart from this ongoing review a more detailed review by an interdepartmental committee of the criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means under the higher education and related grant schemes has presented to me in 1988.</P>
      <P>The question of determination of income or means for the purposes of eligibility is a complex one affecting a number of Departments and/or agencies under their aegis.  I have, therefore, referred back to the interdepartmental committee the question of assessment procedures to be adopted in the context of this problem being relevant to several other Departments e.g. Revenue, Health and Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>As part of their training, national teachers do a course in the use of computers in national schools.  This provides training in a wide range of computer facilities and applications and focuses on their use in the teaching of subjects on the Primary School Curriculum.</P>
      <P>At second level, pre-service training courses vary widely in nature and, therefore, in the extent to which they involve computers.  In some courses, computers play a central role.  For example, teachers pursuing degree courses in Thomond College of Education in Wood and Building Technology, Metal and Engineering, Technology General and Rural Science and a graduate diploma in Business Education follow courses in computer technology and computer applications and control systems as an integral part of their courses.  Computer technology is also used to support the course content and to enhance teaching methodologies.</P>
      <P>Courses in computer studies are available to all students taking the Higher Diploma in Education, computer techniques are also encompassed in courses such as educational technology and the methodology of teaching certain subjects.</P>
      <P>Extensive in-service training is being conducted in computer application and machine control and production systems.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate vocational programme requires the use of computer technology in certain specified areas.  In addition, my Department has organised the writing of courseware by teachers for use in the teaching of such subjects as mathematics, geography, history, physics, biology, remedial English and business studies.</P>

      <P>My Department's Curriculum Unit published in December 1983 a review of the transition year project (1974-1983) and of the then pre-employment courses, now called Vocational Preparation and Training Courses.  The reviews greatly aided the revamping of these programmes when they were made more widely available in recent years.  My Department commissioned a survey in 1985 by the ESRI on the VPT programmes operated during 1984-85.  The ESRI has again been commissioned to conduct a follow-up survey of participants in the Vocational Preparation and Training Programmes in the school year 1987-88 and of principals of the schools providing the programmes. A draft report is in course of preparation and the result will be published as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Special measures to assist national schools in disadvantaged areas have been operative since 1984.  In 1986 and 1989 systematic internal reviews were conducted by my Department's inspectorate on the basis of completed questionnaires and observation.  The results show that grants for books and materials made a significant impact and that many schools had initiated home/school/community liaison programmes.  The programmes for future years will take into account the findings of the results.</P>
      <P>Specific research is not currently being undertaken by my Department in relation to remedial teaching but the position is being kept under review by my Department's inspectorate.</P>
      <P>The question of attainment levels in the certificate examinations in comparison to those in other countries is a matter to which the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will be devoting attention.</P>

      <P>In general, all degree courses in Ireland &mdash; including Northern Ireland &mdash; and other non-degree courses which comply with the following criteria are recognised for grants purposes under the higher education grants scheme.</P>

      <P>The number of community schools which have been established in accordance with the terms of the model lease for community schools is 47.</P>
      <P>Deeds of Trust have been signed in respect of 24 of these schools and the agreed local contributions towards the building, equipping and furnishing of the schools payable by the relevant VECs and religious have been paid in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2235" /> The contribution payable by the relevant VEC is 5 per cent of the cost of building, equipping and furnishing a community school.  The amount payable by the religious is normally arrived at by agreement.  It is not Department practice to disclose details of confidential agreements reached in individual cases with the religious regarding the level of local contribution to be paid.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 467, 473, 474, 475 and 476 together, as they all relate in one way or another to applications for assistance for tourism development from EC Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism approved by the EC on 21 December 1989 provides for the investment of over £146 million of Structural Funds in the sector over the period 1989-1993.  Copies of the programme have already been lodged in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>Structural Funds will be allocated under three separate sub-programmes: Sub-Programme 1 &mdash; £51 million ERDF to assist tourism developments by public/similar bodies; Sub-Programme 2 &mdash; over £66 million ERDF to assit private sector tourism development and promotion; and Sub-Programme 3 &mdash; over £28 million ESF for tourism training by CERT and the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Detailed budgets and strict criteria are laid out in the Programme under all 3 Sub-Programmes.  The Deputies' questions relate exclusively, however, to Sub-Programmes 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>Under Sub-Programme 1 some £28 million has been allocated to the OPW to enable them to carry out a major revamp of a number of important cultural and heritage attractions and inland waterways.  The remaining £23 million under this Sub-Programme will be administered by Bord Fáilte and SFADCo for tourism works to be carried out by local authorities, regional tourism organisations, fisheries boards and other State and semi-State bodies.  Projects will be selected in accordance with criteria outlined in the Programme and I understand from the two agencies that work on this selection process is now under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-Programme 2 provides some £66 million for a scheme to assist private investment in Irish tourism.  Full details are provided in the programme.  This scheme is being administerd by Bord Fáilte and SFADCo and will provide grant aid for improved facilities related to Irish culture and heritage, and to a <Col N="2242" /> wide range of sports and leisure activities for visitors.  Restaurants are not among the eligible category of works listed in the scheme.  Bord Fáilte and SFADCo are currently evaluating projects and expect to be approving the first group of projects in the near future.</P>
    <P>Day to day administration on sub-programmes 1 and 2, including evaluations, assessments, selection, and approval of projects, is a matter for the administering agencies having regard to relevant criteria and budgets in the programme.</P>

      <P>Outline proposals for the provision of a light rail system on the former Harcourt Street railway line are being examined in my Department.  The proposals, which are based on substantial aid from the EC and/or the Exchequer, were only received earlier this month and were not included in the submission made to the European Community in the context of the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>Another possible option for the Harcourt Street line is the provision of a busway.  As busways form part of the road infrastructure, questions in relation to them are matters for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should inform the Deputy, however, that I recently had a meeting with representatives of CIÉ, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, at which the Department of the Environment was also represented, to consider <Col N="2243" /> the various proposals relating to the Harcourt Street line.  Following that meeting I set up a small working group comprising representatives of the various interests involved to examine the matter in greater depth and requested them to report back to me quickly.  Following receipt of the report, I will consider the matter further in consultation with the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>An Iarnród Éireann board of inquiry has investigated the accident involving the Tralee-Dublin train at the accommodation crossing at Cuddagh, near Mountrath, on 14 November 1989. I expect to receive a full report shortly. In the light of that report, I will determine whether any further action is necessary.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I should inform the Deputy that, following the railway accident near Clarmorris on 24 September 1989, the board of inquiry appointed by Iarnród Éireann to investigate the accident was given the additional mandate of examining the possibilities of eliminating where possible, or reducing, the hazards in the operation of accommodation level crossings.  In the course of this review, consideration will be given to what additional measures are necessary and existing procedures will be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann have been discussing with the IFA and the ICMSA the safe use of accommodation crossings by farmers. All known users of such crossings have already been visited by railway personnel and instructed on the safe and proper use of the crossings.  In addition, a media <Col N="2244" /> campaign has been launched, advertisements have appeared in the farming press and at marts and there has been a series of spot radio advertisements.</P>

      <P>Examinations in professional competence have been held twice yearly since December 1977.  It would not be possible to give accurate figures of the pass-failure rate for all of the 26 examinations since then as some candidates who failed in one examination often succeeded in a subsequent one.  The position for 1988 was that out of a total of 1,497 candidates who entered for both national and international road haulage examinations, 632 failed.  In 1989, out of a total of 1,753 candidates, 520 failed.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that the purpose of the directive on access to the profession of road haulage operator is to ensure that road haulage operators are better qualified.  In this way they are better equipped to contribute to improvement in the quality of the service, to greater road safety and to the rationalisation of the market.  All of this consequently rebounds to the benefit of users, operators and the economy as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that some people have difficulty in passing these examinations but I regret that because of the EC requirements it is not possible to accommodate those who cannot prove competence.  I should mention, however, that there is provision in the relevant EC directives whereby a person who has a certificate of competence and who is of good repute <Col N="2245" /> can be designated as transport manager for a business until such time as the competence requirement can be satisfied by the operator.</P>

      <P>Bus Átha Cliath have informed me that the number of passengers carried in 1989 was 161.8 million. The company have explained that on the basis of availing of spare capacity on existing services, an additional 30 million adult passengers per annum would have needed to be carried so as to achieve a break-even situation.  The company consider that it would have also been necessary to substantially improve traffic conditions in the city to allow faster turnround times so as to achieve the increased utilisation of their fleet which would have been necessary.</P>
      <P>The above conclusion is based on the assumption of no Exchequer subvention.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 479 and 480 together.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann have informed me that the estimated number of passengers carried on the railway system in 1989 was 24.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company have explained that, given the present utilisation of their rolling stock and rail infrastructures, it would not have been possible to cater for the additional passenger and freight operations on the whole network which would have generated sufficient revenue to achieve a break-even position.  This situation <Col N="2248" /> is not unique to Iarnród Éireann as many other railway companies are in a similar position.</P>
    <P>The company's provisional estimate of travel on the DART system in 1989 is 15.2 million passenger journeys.  They estimate that 25.4 million passenger journeys would have been required to break even in 1989.</P>
    <P>The above conclusions are based on the assumption of no Exchequer subvention other than that for the interest charges on the capital cost of DART, which in 1989 amounted to £11.3 million.</P>
