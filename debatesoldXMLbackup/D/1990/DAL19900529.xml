      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the elements of the Joint Programme for Government 1989 which have been carried out to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As stated in the opening paragraphs of the <i>Programme for Government 1989-1993</i> in the national interest, the agreed objectives in that document together with the objectives set out in the Fianna Fáil document <i>National Recovery &mdash; The Next Phase</i> constitute the programme to be implemented by the Government.  This programme together with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the National Development Plan form the basis of Government policy over the four years to 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's programme is steadily achieving its objectives.  I would like to cite, <i>inter alia,</i> some fundamental achievements such as high economic growth, continued correction of the public finances, falling unemployment, increasing employment, reductions in income tax rates, moderation of indirect <Col N="472" /> taxes, the environmental action programme, the extension of urban renewal areas and special social welfare increases. I would also refer the Deputy to the report of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which summarises the economic and social achievements of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the words about steady progress towards the achievement of the goals set down in the <i>Joint Programme for Government 1989,</i> might I remind the Taoiseach of the cornerstone section which states that at the end of 1989 the new Government would bring forward detailed proposals for reform of the Oireachtas and in that process would examine, among other issues, the procedure of the passage of legislation through the Dáil, Seanad etc., as well as a commitment to local government reform?  Will the Taoiseach not acknowledge that this document, which is a kind of a verbal sticking plaster to bind together two essentially alien partners, has failed to deliver where it counts? More people are unemployed this week this year than this week last year, our best and brightest people are overseas, the hip replacement and orthodontic queues are getting longer, mortgages on average are £100 a week higher than they were this time last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was trying to establish how many of those positions have fallen victim to the embargo and how many have been absorbed by senior and middle management posts within the Civil Service in order to protect and maintain the promotional prospects of those grades.

An bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit a rá an bhfuil dul chun cinn ar bith déanta ar an aerstráice féin?  Tá sé go mór ag teastáil ó mhuintir an oileáin.  Cad é an scrúdú atá déanta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus cad é an staid ag a bhfuil <Col N="476" /> an scrúdú sin agus cathain a bheidh a fhios againn an bhfuil siad chun dul ar aghaidh leis an aerstráice nó nach bhfuil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá stair fhada ag baint leis an gceist seo, ag dul ar ais go dtí 1974. Mar gheall ar an scéal faoi láthair, tá sé á scrúdú ag Údarás na Gaeltachta, mar a dúirt mé sa bhfreagra, agus tá na riachtanais agus na deiseanna á gcur san áireamh mar chuid den staidéar atá á dhéanamh ag comhairleoirí turasóireachta ar son an Údaráis i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall.  Chomh maith leis sin, má tá aerstráice le bheith ar fáil ar an oileán agus ceann eile ar an mhórthír, caithfidh an tÚdarás cinnte a dhéanamh de go mbeidh eitleán ar fáil ionas go mbeidh seirbhís rialta ann.  Idir an dá linn tá Údarás na Gaeltachta ag cur £33,000 ar fáil gach bliain chun seirbhís héileacaptair a sholáthar.  Tá a fhios agam na deacrachtaí atá ag muintir Thoraigh agus is eol dom an plean forbartha atá réidh acu.  Taobh istigh den teorainn airgid atá againn, déanfaidh mise mo dhícheall chun gach cuidiú a thabhairt do mhuintir an oileáin sin.</P>

Duine ar bith sa Teach seo a bheadh ag caint fúinne gan tacaíocht a thabhairt do Oileán Thoraigh, b'fhéidir gur cheart dó ceist a chur síos faoi fhorbairt ghinearálta, agus an cheist <Col N="477" /> a chur síos é féin, agus tabharfaidh mise na freagraí dó agus inseoidh mise cén Aire Airgeadais a bhí ann ag an am sin nach raibh sásta airgead a chur ar fáil chun staidéar a dhéanamh ar Oileán Thoraigh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 7 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>My Department already issue cards in a number of circumstances.  Prior to 1979 all insured persons were issued with an insurance card which provided identification and to which insurance stamps were affixed.  At present new entrants to social insurance are provided with a lightweight card advising them of their RSI number and unemployed persons are issued with signing cards which they must produce for identification each time they attend at the local employment exchange or office.  More durable signing cards have been provided for unemployed persons and a pilot scheme of plastic cards to claimants in a number of offices in Dublin has been quite successful.  Many of these cards are used for identification purposes when the holder is dealing with my Department and the Department will continue to seek better ways of improving identification procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, the question of whether magnetic cards will be used for social welfare purposes is a possibility that is being examined in a general way having regard to various factors.  Progress in this <Col N="479" /> area will depend, I believe, on the opportunities provided by emerging technologies. There is no immediate need for such cards at present.  In view of the widespread use of magnetic cards by banks and other financial institutions, magnetic cards may have something to offer social welfare claimants in the future.  Such cards could extend the range and nature of the services that my Department might provide.</P>
    <P>I am examining various measures which would offer improved services to claimants in the future.  These services would include greatly improved access to our services at local level, comprehensive advice on social welfare entitlements and related services or benefits and, ideally, a wider range of payment options. Improvements of this nature will not be fully realised until better arrangements are available for claimants to establish their identities.  It is intended that identification of claimants will be based mainly on the individual's RSI number.</P>
    <P>Planning is underway to move responsibility for the issuing and management of the RSI numbering system from the Revenue Commissioners to my Department.  This will help to improve service to the public and act as an important control measure.  The scope for abuse involving personation will be reduced by a more secure identification arrangement.  These new arrangements will begin to be phased in later this year and the actual transfer of responsibility will take place next year.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to issue identification cards, magnetic or otherwise, to the entire adult population, nor are there plans for my Department to act as a general supplier of information on individuals to other Departments or organisations.  The exchange of data between my Department and other organisations is strictly regulated in law. Apart from specific provisions within the social welfare code, the Data Protection Act introduced in 1988 gives protection to members of the public in relation to computerised information.</P>
    <P>Since 1979, when the PRSI scheme was introduced, data on employer and <Col N="480" /> employee PRSI contributions collected by the Revenue Commissioners is transferred to my Department for social welfare purposes.  These contributions are used as the basis for deciding on entitlements to social insurance claims.  In addition, my Department have links to and exchange information with other agencies such as health boards and FÁS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply which ranged over areas which perhaps were not directly related to the question.  Will he clarify the status of the remarks made by the secretary of his Department, in which he indicated that he expected they would issue social welfare ID cards to the total adult population? Will he ensure that any changes &mdash; I can see that there might be merit at some stage in such a system &mdash; will entail maximum attention being given to the privacy, records and confidentiality of the individual because that is the area that caused greatest concern in response to the remarks made?</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy &mdash; as I have in my original reply to the three different questions &mdash; that there is adequate provision in law under the Data Protection Act to protect people in this regard.  There are also other protections and I intend to ensure that there is protection for our clients, the only people with whom we will deal.  The secretary of the Department did not make any statement in regard to this matter.  The remarks were made by one of the assistant secretaries who was quoted following a technical conference in which he was explaining the developments in technology which could, in future, affect the way we do things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that technology will effect us.  A wide range of cards is available from Telecom and there are insurance cards to all sorts of others. This is the way people live nowadays. We have done surveys on the attitude of our clients to cards generally.  We find that younger people do not understand anything else and that they want this kind of transaction, whereas older <Col N="481" /> people are much more reluctant to accept it.  It is interesting to note &mdash; as I learned recently &mdash; that in France when older people had the availability and the facility which went with these cards they took to them very quickly.  It is one thing to do a survey and to find that people are not very enthusiastic but it can be very different when facilities and options under this kind of system are provided.  If the Deputy reads my answer fully she will see the direction in which we are going.</P>

      <P>My question specifically refers to the magnetic identification cards.  When the Minister talked about cards he did not say whether all social welfare recipients had been offered Visa, American Express, Gold Card, Access or others.  Why has the Minister chosen to give identity cards to categories of social welfare recipients?  It discriminates against one section.  The question of an identity card for everyone &mdash; regardless of whether they have a social welfare number &mdash; is a different matter.  The Minister admitted that he has confined identification cards to recipients of social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy should refer to my comprehensive reply to three questions.  In the old days people were not used to plastic cards and there was just one social welfare card in operation. We modernised the system and transferred the issuing of RSI numbers to the Revenue Commissioners.  As was pointed out by Deputies on many recent occasions, that has not been the most satisfactory arrangement in relation to the RSI numbers as they apply to social welfare.  It is quite satisfactory in relation to collection of moneys but we are concerned with paying the people and there have been many instances in which this <Col N="482" /> has not been satisfactory.  We will now take over the issuing of RSI numbers which is a huge undertaking.  Do not underestimate its size.  We are going back to the 1979 system but we will be using modern methods.  There used to be one card for unemployment assistance but it is now a combined one for unemployment assistance and benefit.  It is very simple, everyone who has one uses it regularly. The signing day, RSI number and certification number are entered on the back of the card and nobody has any problem. There is no discrimination in this regard. We really need to have RSI numbers very clearly issued.  I have not doubt that new technology will operate in this area because the Department involved is a leader in this regard.</P>

      <P>There is nothing new about this system, it operated in 1979.  Perhaps the Deputy has only now discovered it? Everybody had a card in 1979 &mdash; perhaps the Deputy is too young to remember &mdash; it was very useful because they could show it to employers.  However, with the improvements in the scheme and the PRSI system coming into effect the card was done away with.  With it the control that the individual had also went.  As a result of demand from Deputies in this House &mdash; apart from anything else &mdash; we are coming back to the system where the RSI numbers will be issued by the Department.  What they use it for afterwards is their own business but some people will find it very useful.  People get all sorts of benefits in shops when they produce the unemployment card; that <Col N="483" /> has nothing to do with the Department although, of course, they encourage shops to provide such benefits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 21, 102, 104, and 105 together.</P>
      <P>I am introducing a special extra allowance of £3 per week for low income households to offset the additional costs arising from the ban on bituminous coal in built-up areas of Dublin.  The additional allowance will apply for the period of the heating season under the national fuel scheme, namely mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>Those living in restricted areas who will receive the new allowance will include all households that already receive a weekly fuel allowance of £5 under the national fuel scheme.  Their allowance will be increased to £8 per week.  This includes all long-term social welfare and health board recipients who are unable to provide for their own heating needs and live alone or only with dependants or other social welfare recipients who are also qualified for a fuel allowance.  They will now receive an allowance of £8 per week instead of the standard £5.</P>
      <P>The new allowance will also apply to people who have been in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or disability benefit for at least three months and persons receiving family income supplement who meet the other conditions for qualifying for a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>In all, approximately 81,000 households are expected to benefit under these provisions.  The total estimated cost for the period covered is £6.32 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Minister has already issued guidelines to community welfare officers and those in his Department who will be implementing this extra allowance.  In view of the fact that the allowance will be limited to the shorter period &mdash; initiated some years ago with regard to the fuel allowance &mdash; and that the ban commences in September, would he consider extending the period during which this allowance will be payable?  In addition, would he allow some flexibility, outside the social welfare system, to community welfare officers dealing with low income families <Col N="485" /> who may be in receipt of State pensions other than social security ones?  Is he aware that they are a group who will be hard hit by this measure, who will have absolutely no cushion unless it is provided through the social welfare system?</P>

      <P>We have been particularly careful here to cover that short term. I can tell the Deputy we encountered enormous administrative difficulty in doing so with regard to disability benefit, apart from anything else, because of the numbers coming in and out of the system. We have endeavoured to cut the short term down to three months which I am sure the Deputy will agree is reasonable; that is as low as we could go while administering it efficiently.  The vast majority of this work will be undertaken by the Department of Social Welfare.  We can combine it with the payments we are making already; that is already in process. For example, the pension books at present being issued have the extra amounts entered in them.  This comprises part of the computerisation process about which we spoke earlier.  We have also provided for people on low incomes who are at work by extending this provision as an increase in the family income supplement. Also, we will shortly be announcing substantial improvements in the family income supplement itself which will be applicable into next year.  I am quite certain that the measure we are taking will meet the requirements of those either in receipt of low incomes at work or dependent on social welfare.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 27, 31 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The new clothing allowance which I am introducing this year will help families on social welfare payments with the costs of school clothing for their children at the start of the coming school year.  This allowance will be of major benefit to the families concerned and recognises the difficulties that many families on social welfare experience in meeting these costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity to combine the clothing and footwear assistance which I am providing in a new simplified <Col N="487" /> clothing and footwear scheme at two rates &mdash; £40 for each secondary school child and £25 for each primary school child.</P>
    <P>Footwear needs are being met within the new scheme which replaces the streamlined footwear scheme for school-going children which I introduced in 1988.  Over 170,000 children of people dependent on health board and social welfare payments, including unemployment assistance, will benefit at a cost of £5.3 million.  This figure includes the extra £3 million I am now providing for clothing and the amounts hitherto provided for children's footwear under the footwear scheme and for school uniforms.</P>
    <P>The clothing and footwear scheme will be administered by the health boards as part of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme which is funded by my Department.  In determining entitlement to a clothing allowance under the new scheme, health boards will have regard to the circumstances of each individual case.  Maximum allowances have been fixed at £40 for children attending secondary school and at £25 for children attending primary school.  These maximum allowances will apply where the family is solely dependent on the basic rate of the relevant social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>Health boards were given details of the new scheme in a circular letter which issued on 16 May.  It is a matter for each board to determine the arrangements for administering the scheme in their area. In order to ensure the effectiveness of the scheme, however, boards have been advised that it is vital that allowances under the scheme be paid before the commencement of the school year in September next.</P>
    <P>Persons in full-time employment are not entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.  Thus, recipients of family income supplement scheme will not, in general, qualify for the new clothing allowance.  However, I have made significant improvements in recent years in the benefits available under the family income supplement scheme.  I will shortly <Col N="488" /> be announcing further substantial increases in the rates of payment and a new minimum payment to recipients under this scheme with effect from July of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it reasonable to expect community welfare officers to arrange for these payments to be made in advance of the commencement of the ensuing school year in view of the late notice?  While welcoming the general improvement I should like to know whether, in this case, the benefits will be applicable to long-term recipients of disability benefit?  The Minister quite rightly responded to their request in the fuel area.  Will he say whether he will respond to their critical position with regard to this scheme, as he indicated he might in the course of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been particularly anxious to introduce this measure as early as possible.  It should be possible to pay by the beginning of the ensuing school year given the fact that the scheme has been simplified &mdash; Deputies should remember there are only two rates applicable &mdash; and, secondly, that the information with regard to it has been made available to health boards from 16 May.  When I met the health boards about this subject earlier the community welfare officers stressed that they would need that information before the end of May so that they could effect payment at the beginning of the school year, taking into account summer holidays and so on. That is why it has been announced so early.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of qualifying families. These would be in relation to SWA, UA, long-term and short-term, widows' pension and deserted wife's allowance, the same categories as qualify at present; they will all qualify.  I might tell the Deputy that that is where the 170,000 children enter in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Social security systems in the various member states have developed separately in the light of the political, economic and social history of each country.  As a result there are significant differences in the way systems are organised and the manner in which benefits are provided.  Disparities in the levels of economic development achieved by the various member states also result in significant differences in the levels of benefits which it is possible to provide.</P>
      <P>Given these differences it is accepted by the Commission and all member states that harmonisation of national systems of social security throughout the EC is not a realistic possibility at least in the short to medium term.  However, it is also recognised that the divergence of social security systems may serve to place a brake on free movement and exacerbate regional imbalances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, at an Informal Council of Ministers for Social Security in Ashford Castle on 27 April, which I hosted, a broad consensus was reached on the need for a strategy of convergence of social protection objectives and policies.  This would involve the development of an <Col N="490" /> agreed set of objectives for social protection, with member states being committed to the gradual introduction of appropriate measures, having regard to levels of economic development and financial capacity, to meet the objectives. Progress in achieving the objectives would be monitored at Community level. Arrangements would also be made to enable member states to exchange information and compare experiences on the effectiveness of their social protections systems in achieving the objectives.  Such a process would greatly contribute to the evolution in a converging manner of systems of social protection throughout the Community in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Commission was asked to expedite work in this area in consultation with senior officials of the members states, with a view to bringing forward proposals before the end of 1991, in line with the commitments given in this regard in its action programme, relating to the implementation of the Community Charter of Basic Social Rights for Workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister when he says that the various member states have developed their own social security systems but the problems which have arisen have been resolved with the creation of the Single Market.  Would the Minister not agree that those in receipt of social welfare payments have been forgotten by the European Community and that the Social Charter only caters for those at work and makes no attempt to ensure that unemployed immigrants from non-EC countries would receive benefits under the social security systems operated by the various member states? Would he also not agree that the Council of Ministers at their two day meeting in Ashford Castle should have given some serious consideration to the case being made by those facing difficulties in claiming social welfare payments in the member states of the European Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, I thought the meeting was particularly helpful and valuable.  Indeed, I can show <Col N="491" /> the Deputies some correspondence I received from the Ministers of other countries who also thought it was particularly helpful and valuable at this time. The Deputy has put his finger on the problem when he said the social welfare provisions are limited, in that the articles relate to workers, including migrant workers, and things which affect workers.  We reached consensus on the need to promote convergence which marks a major change, improvement and development within the Community but this has not been recognised by people generally.  This perhaps is understandable. The coming together of the member states to consider the developments taking place in the context of the Single Market represents a new beginning.</P>
      <P>One of the concerns expressed was that on the completion of the Single Market there would be a reduction in the real value of social welfare benefits within some member states but the member states are committed to trying to avoid this.  In relation to the development of the rest of the system, I felt that it was very important that we hold such a meeting. I found that I could consider these matters within the OECD or the Council of Europe but that it was not possible to do so within the EC.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, new arrangments are being made.  The Commission is going to propose new arrangements to enable member states to exchange information and develop an agreed set of objectives in developing social welfare systems which would recognise the demograhic changes taking place all over Europe, with particular reference to the elderly, lone parents and the unemployed. Much has been achieved as a result of getting this matter on to the table and focusing people's minds on it. I hope the Deputy will see the fruits of this in coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that talks are still taking place, but would he not agree that the least that would be <Col N="492" /> expected is a uniform method of payment? I appreciate that it would be difficult to devise a uniform welfare payment system in the light of the various socio-economic factors in member states, but can the Minister tell us if he has ever considered the one stamp rule which appears to be an irritant for so many returned emigrants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised that matter, so please do not stop him, a Cheann Comhairle.  It has been buried for a long time but has now come up again for examination.  The one stamp rule is a very sensitive issue in certain member states.  We are very anxious to bring about some improvements in those arrangements and has been agreed to consider the matter further.  The Commission brought forward suggestions and proposals but they were rejected and this matter has remained buried for years. However, in Ashford Castle it was back on the table and this is a good example of what has been achieved.  The purpose in convening the informal Council of Ministers is to get the Ministers to talk about directives, the details of which have been worked out by the Commission, and to find out if some modifications are necessary, but one of the things they can do is to put new approaches and policies on the table.  Our French colleagues started this process last year and we have advanced it considerably this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 9, 13, 18, 23, 109 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>The dental benefit scheme was extended to cover dependent spouses of insured persons from October 1987.  A total of 239 dentists have entered into an agreement to operate the extended scheme.</P>
      <P>From the outset, I arranged to have details of dentists who have signed agreements covering dependent spouses made available at local offices of my Department. Any person who requires dental treatment can obtain details of their nearest participating dentists from these offices or by telephoning my Department. To date, over 66,000 claims for benefit have been received from dependent spouses of insured workers.</P>
      <P>The extension of the scheme to dependent spouses as introduced in 1987 was opposed by the Irish Dental Association which advised their members not to sign the contract to operate the extended scheme.  Last year the association as part of their continued opposition to the extension of the scheme, called on their members to discontinue providing certain treatments for all insured persons.  As a result, some dentists are imposing charges on patients for extractions, root treatments and dentures.</P>
      <P>Any person who is asked to pay charges which are not due should refuse to do so and report the matter to my Department. There is, however, no provision within the scheme whereby patients who proceed with treatment and pay such charges can be reimbursed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The association have sought fundamental changes in the dental benefit scheme.  In March 1989, following an examination of the scheme by a joint working group involving the association <Col N="497" /> and officials of my Department, I introduced a package of improvements which included substantial fee increases in respect of some treatment items.  I have indicated to the association that I am prepared to consider other ways in which the scheme can be improved as resources permit.</P>
    <P>I met the association in January this year and there have been subsequent contacts at official level.  Within the last ten days there was a meeting at official level to clarify certain details regarding dental costs supplied to me by the association.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to explore any avenue for settling this matter on an agreed basis.  I am very concerned, however at the fact that certain dentists were refusing to provide items of treatment provided for in their contract.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the contract, I am empowered to take specific actions against any dentist who is in breach of his contract.  Deputies will appreciate that while discussions continue with the Irish Dental Association, I am reluctant to exercise these powers.  However, I cannot indefinitely permit the situation to continue where patients are being refused benefit to which they are entitled. If this matter cannot now be resolved through discussions with the association I will have no option but to take action against the dentists concerned.</P>
    <P>I believe the dental benefit scheme is a good scheme from which over 300,000 persons benefit every year and I am determined to preserve the scheme for the benefit of insured persons and their dependants.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific case mentioned in one of the questions, the person concerned is entitled to dental benefit. Unfortunately, an incorrect notification was issued to him.  The claim has now been reviewed and payment will be made to his dentist in respect of the treatments contained in the claim.  The person concerned has been notified accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that he is seriously out of touch with the gravity of the situation?  As a <Col N="498" /> result of the failure of his Department and himself to resolve the dispute with the dentists, is it not a fact that there is virtually no provision of dental treatment for insured workers and that the net effect of two years of dispute is that a scheme which was up and running and providing full cover for insured workers is now in tatters?  I point to the example of a person from Finglas, in my constituency, who approached every dentist in that area and had finally to go to Swords to have an abscess treated because he was not prepared to pay for a treatment to which he was entitled.  The Minister does not seem to appreciate the seriousness of the situation on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me answer that point first.  I do not agree at all with the Deputy. I fully appreciate the situation; in fact it does not help matters to have Deputies coming in here saying that the system has broken down, because it has not.  We are treating 300,000 people, and those who are not co-operating with the extension of the scheme to dependent spouses are very much in the minority.  That is the reality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of dependent spouses treated is continuing at roughly the same level.  A total of 239 dentists have signed the contract and that is considerably more than the last time the Deputy raised a question in relation to it. The number is continually increasing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Please let me finish Deputy.  Either Deputies want an extension and wish to support it and are prepared to support me in doing so, or they want to go along the lines suggested by some members of the Irish Dental Association that we should have an open-ended grant-in-aid and the dentist charges whatever he or she likes.  Let us be <Col N="499" /> clear that that is what we are faced with at present.  As I have explained in my reply to the questions, I am having discussions with the dental association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to a degree with the Minister that the scheme is essentially a good one, that is if it worked.  Quite clearly it is not working and the number of representatives that all politicians are receiving is a clear indication that the extension of the dispute is having a very negative effect not only on the spouses of insured workers but also on the insured workers themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the fact that the dispute has escalated and that insured workers are not being afforded extractions, will the Minister outline clearly what steps he intends to take to avoid the total collapse of an essentially good scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, I and my officials are involved in discussions with the Irish Dental Association. However, I do not accept the Deputy's assertion of the collapse or total collapse of the scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to be written to from anywhere.  From the outset a number of dentists did not want an extension of the scheme.  The previous Government did not attempt to extend the scheme and that lay dormant.  However, I took it on board and went ahead with the extension of the scheme.  Since then 66,000 dependent spouses have been treated and they continue to be treated at the rate of 2,000 extra per month.  That is continuing.  The number of dentists who have agreed to operate the scheme is continuing to increase but we still have the situation where dentists are conducting a campaign to prevent the operation of the scheme.</P>

They have provided a new basis for this discussion quite recently and that is being examined.  I have undertaken not to say any more about that at present.  There is a desire among many members to have an agreed solution and I would be very anxious to see that.  In my reply I have made it clear that I will have to take action at some stage if these matters are not resolved in the reasonably near future.</P>

      <P>A straight answer to a straight question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Life is more complicated than being able to give simplistic answers. I am sorry if I give the Deputy a proper answer as distinct from a ridiculous one. At the outset, the number of dentists the Department envisaged as essential to run a scheme for the dependent spouses was 150 but that number has been long since passed.  The difficulty then arises with the distribution rather than with the number of dentists.  One of our problems is that our insured workers' scheme applies to almost all dentists in the country &mdash; about 630.  Some of these do a very small proportion of work in the social welfare area and a very large business in the private area; others do a very large social welfare business and a very small business in the private field and there are all sorts of categories in between.</P>
      <P>What matters at the end of the day is whether there are sufficient dentists to do the work that is required and whether there is a proper distribution.  We have had difficulties with distribution.  The last time questions were asked on this matter, four counties had no dentists prepared to undertake the extension to the dependent spouses but there are now only two counties in that category.  To understand how the scheme works, you have to take into account the different groups working within it.  One group have said that if we extend the treatment to dependent spouses, it will affect their private practice, and they are not anxious for that equation to be altered in any way.  I presume that is the root of the whole question.</P>

      <P>I am making a number of important improvements in the national fuel scheme from the start of the next heating season.  The national fuel scheme applies to persons in receipt of long-term social welfare payments subject to certain conditions.  Up to now a person living with somebody else could qualify for a fuel allowance only if the other person was a dependant, a person providing full-time care and attention where the qualified person was incapacitated, or a qualified person in his or her own right. Thus a person was not entitled to an allowance if he or she was living with somebody in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance.  From October a person in this situation who would be otherwise entitled to a fuel allowance will qualify under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am also extending the national fuel scheme to smallholders under the same conditions as apply to other recipients of long term unemployment assistance. These improvements will come into effect from the beginning of the next heating season in October and will benefit some 9,000 additional beneficiaries at a cost of £0.5 million in 1990 and £1.2 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beneficiaries under the national fuel scheme who are affected by the ban on <Col N="503" /> bituminous coal which will apply to certain areas of Dublin will also receive an additional £3 a week to help minimise the cost to them of smokeless or low-smoke fuel from October next.  The duration of the 1990-91 heating season will be the same as last year.  It will run for 26 weeks, commencing in mid-October and continuing to mid-April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the case involving Douglas Harvey Barber and Guardian Royal Exchange.  The European Court ruled in that case that the benefits payable by an employer to a worker in connection with the latter's compulsory redundancy fall within the scope of Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome which provides for equal pay for equal work.  It considered that a pension paid under a private occupational pension scheme is covered by this provision.  In the Court's view it is contrary to Article 119 of the Treaty for a man made compulsorily redundant to be entitled to claim only a deferred pension payable at the normal retirement age when a woman in the same situation is entitled to an immediate retirement pension as a result of the application of an age condition that varies according to sex in the same way as is provided for the national statutory pension scheme in the UK.  The application of the principal of equal pay must be ensured in respect of each element of remuneration and not only on the basis of a comprehensive assessment of the consideration paid to workers.</P>
      <P>The court also ruled that Article 119 has direct effect and may be ruled upon before the national courts.  However this direct effect may not be relied upon in order to claim entitlement to a pension, with effect from the date of the judgment, except in the case of workers, or those claiming under them, who have before that date initiated legal proceedings or raised an equivalent claim under the applicable national law.</P>
      <P>The majority of occupational pension schemes in Ireland provide for equal retirement ages for men and women and, accordingly, the judgment should have few implications for Irish pension schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware the Pensions Bill which is currently before the House provides <i>inter alia</i> for equal treatment for men and women in occupational benefit <Col N="505" /> schemes along the lines laid down in EC Directive 86/378/EC.  The directive permits member states to defer the compulsory application of equal treatment with regard to pensionable ages until such time as this is provided under the State scheme or is required by a further directive. I am currently studying the implications of the recent court decision in this context.  I propose to take cognisance of the court's judgment in the context of the Pensions Bill.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the reason his Department continue to maintain a code which disallows an applicant for unemployment assistance to claim depreciation of fixed or capital assets as an expense necessarily incurred in running a farm in the determination of the rate of means attributed to any such applicant.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Means from farming for unemployment assistance purposes is assessed under section 146 (1) (c) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by section 13 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985.  The calculation is done on an income and expenditure basis and represents the income from the farm less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  In determining the net income of the farm, allowances are made for such current expenses as the rent of land, stock replacements, fertilisers, crop sprays, seeds, veterinary expenses, the cost of feeding stuffs, the cost of electricity and petrol used for farm purposes.</P>
      <P>The principles applied for social welfare purposes when making allowances for the use or capital equipment by smallholders are separate and distinct from those applied in business generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of capital assets, such as farm machnery and equipment, the capital cost is not allowed as an expense. Instead, an allowance is made for the depreciation of these assets which, of their nature have a fairly definite life span <Col N="506" /> and the use of which is very directly related to farm output.  Depreciation on such assets is, accordingly, estimated as a proportion of the gross output of the farm.</P>
    <P>Where farm machinery or equipment is purchased outright, an allowance for depreciation relative to their usage is made.  Where the purchase is by way of a hire purchase or leasing arrangement the full amount of the repayments due under such agreement is allowed in the means assessment; alternatively, a reasonable allowance for depreciation is made.</P>
    <P>Depreciation is not allowed in respect of other capital assets such as farm buildings, yards and land reclamation. Allowances for the erosion of capital assets such as these are not considered appropriate to the unemployment assistance scheme which essentially is a cash income support scheme.  However, the normal cost of repairs, upkeep, and maintenance is allowed.  If for some reason these cannot be readily determined, percentage allowances are made related to gross output and the income generated.</P>
    <P>When depreciation or overhead costs are allowed on a percentage basis, the figures used are based on the latest available data in the annual national farm survey published by Teagasc.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the impact which the proposed EC social welfare legislation will have on Irish pensioners in 1992-1993 in relation to their benefits; and whether this will adversely affect entitlements as they are at present un-coordinated with State benefits.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>EC regulations provide for the protection of the social security entitlements of employed and self-employed workers, members of their families and surviving dependants where they move to other member states in the course of their careers to reside and/or to take up employment or self-employment. Provision is also made for the protection <Col N="507" /> of entitlements in the case of temporary stays, such as holidays, in other member states.</P>
      <P>A person who has been insured in more than one member state in the course of his career, is entitled to a pension from each of those states.  He may receive from each state either a pension based on his insurance in that state or, if it is higher, a pension which is in proportion to the periods of insurance he has completed in that state as compared with his total combined insurance in all the states where he was insured.  These regulations have applied in Ireland since our accession to the European Community in 1973.</P>
      <P>On 31 July 1989 The EC Commission submitted proposals for a series of amendments to the regulations governing the payment and calculation of pensions. These amendments, which are mainly linked with the case law of the European Court of Justice in this area, are designed to simplify the rules for awarding pensions under the regulations and ease the rules which apply to overlapping entitlements, particularly in the case of invalidity pensions.  The adoption of these amendments will improve the existing protection of pension entitlements afforded by the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC regulations on social security do not apply to occupational pension schemes.  Entitlements under such schemes can represent a major proportion of pension entitlements, particularly for workers on higher earnings.  I have been concerned about this matter and, as President of the Council of Ministers for Social Security, I raised this issue at an informal Council of Ministers for Social Security which I hosted here on 27 April 1990.  At this meeting the protection of entitlements under occupational schemes in the case of persons who change jobs or move to other member states was one of the main topics discussed.  There was a general consensus that priority should be given to the introduction of appropriate measures in this regard at both national and Community level.  The informal Council also provided <Col N="508" /> Ministers with an opportunity to give preliminary indications as to what measures would be feasible in the short-term to improve the present position and what the priorities should be in the medium to long term.  The discussion at the meeting will greatly facilitate and speed up the consideration of this matter at Community level with a view to specific proposals being brought forward at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his extensive reply.  It was so extensive that it does not allow me to ask as many supplementaries as I would have wished. I commend the Minister for his efforts in this area because there is no doubt in the minds of trade unionists, in particular, that the implications of EC legislation in the 1992-93 period will definitely affect people's entitlements.  That is the view of the professionals representing these people.  We commend the Minister for his efforts and we ask him to keep us informed of what he sees will be the implications for both un-co-ordinated State pensions and co-ordinated pensions also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his support in this matter.  As far as our business today is concerned, when we will be taking the Pensions Bill, 1990, we are very much to the forefront in that regard and this is something which is recognised by other member states.  They have committed themselves to pursuing this approach on the international basis so there will be a ready exchange between countries.  It is directly related to mobility.  There was a difficulty in bringing these within the EC legislation but in relation to mobility it affects particularly skilled people and those involved in management moving from one country to another.  I am very conscious of that difficulty and it is an issue I brought home to member states at a recent Council meeting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Pensions Bill is the most important piece of legislation concerning occupational pensions to come before this House since the foundation of the State. Its purpose is to regulate occupational pension schemes, ensure that they are properly administered and that, above all, the pension rights of members and their dependants are adequately safeguarded. I plan to achieve this by setting down minimum standards in key areas and by providing a framework for the regulation and supervision of schemes.  I wish to ensure that members can change jobs without forfeiting their pension rights; schemes are properly funded; <Col N="597" /> employers deliver on the promises made to the employees; and members have full access to all information about the running of their schemes and the security of their pensions.  The Bill also provides for equal treatment for men and women in relation to the scope and conditions of access to schemes, benefit rights and contribution levels.</P>
    <P>The operation of occupational schemes to date has been governed mainly by 19th century trust law.  This is the first time since the foundation of the State that comprehensive legislation to regulate the operation of these schemes has been introduced.  The provisions of this Bill are in line with best international practice. Its enactment will put Ireland in the forefront internationally with regard to the regulation of occupational pension schemes.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill, therefore, marks a milestone in the history of the development of an overall system to provide for adequate and secure pension cover for our citizens.</P>
    <P>At the outset I would like to review the developments which have taken place in relation to pensions and to highlight the important role of occupational schemes in the evolution of our national pensions system.  The first priority of the State has been to ensure that the old, the widowed and the permanently incapacitated have an adequate basic income.</P>
    <P>Initially this was provided solely by way of schemes of social assistance.  Since then a comprehensive social insurance pensions system has been developed. This involved the introduction in 1935 of the widows and orphans contributory pensions; in 1961 the old age contributory pension and in 1970 retirement and invalidity pensions.  Compulsory social insurance has been progressively extended to the various categories in the labour force.  The most recent major development in this regard was the extension by me of social insurance pensions to the self-employed in 1988.</P>
    <P>The basic weekly rates of pensions have been increased substantially in real <Col N="598" /> terms, particularly over the past decade. In addition many pensioners qualify for free travel and allowances for electricity, telephone rental, TV licence, fuel and the living alone allowance.  At present some 375,000 persons are dependent totally or to a significant degree on a weekly social welfare pension, or 473,000, if dependants are included.  The overall cost of providing social welfare pensions will amount this year to some £1.25 billion, or 45 per cent of total social welfare expenditure of some £2.76 billion.</P>
    <P>For much of our history old age, widowhood and permanent incapacity brought with them poverty, deprivation and dependency.  The progress that has been made in developing the overall social welfare pensions system has meant that a reasonable, basic level of pension is now available.  This was borne out by a recent ESRI survey on poverty which showed that the elderly, in particular, were no longer a high risk group.</P>
    <P>To ensure that all citizens have a basic level of social welfare pension, the State has relied on occupational pension schemes to provide workers with a supplementary pension related to their pre-retirement income.  These occupational pensions are normally provided as part of their terms of employment for employees in the non-commercial public sector.  A comprehensive system of tax reliefs has been introduced to encourage the development of occupational schemes in the private and commercial semi-State sectors.  The present tax treatment of occupational pension schemes is based on the provisions of the Finance Act, 1972.  The objectives of such tax reliefs are two-fold.  First, they promote formal arrangements for the provision of retirement pensions and for dependants in the event of death.  These are designed to assist employees in maintaining the standard of living to which they had been accustomed while in employment.  Secondly, they encourage national savings by the accumulation of pension funds.</P>
    <P>This approach has been very successful. There are over 25,000 occupational pension schemes in existence in Ireland today.  Some 550,000 employees <Col N="599" /> or roughly two-thirds of the total number in employment are members of supplementary schemes.  Pension schemes have also become a major vehicle in the national economy for savings and investment. There are no comprehensive returns of statistical and financial data for the pensions industry.</P>
    <P>However, on the basis of the most recent estimates the assets of pension funds currently amount to some £10,000 million.  Annual contribution income is in excess of £500 million while new investment income is of the order of £600 million. Benefit payments out of these schemes are estimated to be in excess of £250 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the major part which the system of tax reliefs has played, and is continuing to play, in the development of occupational pension schemes. The cost of these reliefs in terms of revenue foregone is considerable.  The National Pensions Board in their report on the tax treatment of pension schemes estimated that the cost of tax relief on contributions in 1989 would be £203 million. Tax relief on the investment income of pensions in 1989 was estimated at £162 million.  However, these tax reliefs are in effect an investment in the future.  They facilitate the provision of pensions which will result in employees during retirement and after death, their surviving dependants, being considerably less dependent on State funded services.  This leaves the State with more resources to devote to those who have to rely mainly on State schemes for pensions and other essential services.  In addition, of course, once the pensions become payable they are subject to income tax in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Occupational pension schemes now have a major role in this country in the provision of pensions.  This can be seen in the numbers covered, the value of pensions provided and the significant contribution being made by the State through the system of tax reliefs to the growth and development of privately funded occupational pension schemes. Acccordingly, it is in the interests of all concerned, not least the State, that a comprehensive and effective system for <Col N="600" /> the regulation of occupational pension schemes is in place to ensure that members' pension rights are adequately safeguarded.</P>
    <P>To assist Deputies in understanding the need for the regulatory system provided for in this Bill, I would like to describe briefly the nature of occupational pension schemes and the regulatory environment in which they currently operate.</P>
    <P>Occupational pension schemes in the semi-State and private sectors are usually financed by setting aside funds during the working lifetime of the employees.  These funds are normally placed in the control of trustees who hold and invest the funds under the terms of a trust deed.  By creating a trust fund in this way the pension scheme becomes a legal entity separate from the employer's business. Schemes must be set up in this way in order to be exempt from income tax and capital gains tax in accordance with the Finance Act, 1972.  Some schemes, notably public service schemes, operate on a pay-as-you-go basis meeting the cost of current benefits out of current revenue in much the same way as salaries and wages of current employees.  Such schemes are referred to as unfunded schemes.</P>
    <P>Pension schemes can be divided into two basic types &mdash; defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.  In a defined benefit scheme the member's benefits are defined by reference to the member's salary or wage, an index, or a fixed amount.  The cost of those benefits is borne either entirely by the employer &mdash; a non-contributory scheme &mdash; or by a combination of contributions by the employees themselves and the employer &mdash; a contributory scheme.  Benefits on retirement at normal retirement age are typically a stated percentage of the member's pensionable salary, which may be salary at, or perhaps averaged to, retirement.  The amount payable may be reduced to take account of pension entitlements acquired under statutory social insurance.</P>
    <P>A defined contribution scheme is one in which the contributions to be set aside each year by the employer and, if contributory, by the employee in respect of each <Col N="601" /> member are defined.  The benefits payable under such schemes are not normally defined but are determined by reference to the amount of the defined contributions and the investment return earned on them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the development of occupational pension schemes has been strongly influenced over the years by tax reliefs.  The requirements for tax approval have largely determined the extent to which the schemes are currently regulated.  The retirement benefits district of the Revenue Commissioners is responsible for the approval of pension schemes under the Finance Act, 1972. Their supervision, however, is mainly limited to ensuring that tax exemptions are restricted to bona fide pension schemes and that the benefits paid and the contributions set aside to fund the promises made are not excessive, i.e. that the pension schemes are not being used for tax avoidance purposes.</P>
    <P>Pension schemes with benefits provided out of separate funds are also invariably set up as trusts in order to qualify for tax reliefs.  The administration of such schemes is subject to the general body of law relating to trusts and to the specific terms of the deeds under which they are established.  The interests of the members are thus protected under trust law in two respects: the trust fund belongs in equity to the members to the extent that the assets are required to provide benefits for them and/or their dependants; the trustees are answerable to the members for any losses due to fraud or other breaches of trust and are obliged to disclose information about the general state of a pension scheme, if asked to do so by the members or beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>If members of the scheme have reason to believe that their scheme is being mismanaged, they may sue through the courts for breach of trust or for an order removing the trustees.  They may also seek to have their rights to information enforced through the courts, if necessary, in accordance with trust law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> There are a number of major shortcomings in the present system.  The main body of the statute law in relation to trusts is contained in the Trustee Act, 1893 which was not passed with pension schemes in mind.  The general nature of this law is such that it can be very difficult to assess if the trustees are performing properly and in accordance with trust law.  If members of the scheme have reason to believe that their scheme is not being administered in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed or is being mismanaged, the redress currently is through the courts by suing for breach of trust or for an order removing the trustees.  Members also have a right to information on their schemes under trust law, but legal proceedings may also be required ultimately to obtain redress in this area.  The likelihood of long delays and the uncertainty as to the outcome, given the vagueness of trust law, will generally act as a major deterrent to members taking legal proceedings to enforce their rights, particularly given the substantial legal costs that could be involved.  Even if successful action were taken against the trustees, it is doubtful if such action would redress the problems since in most such cases it is unlikely that there will be adequate funds available to the trustees.  This would arise because of the insolvency of the employer, underpayment of employers' contributions, or poor investment performance of the fund, or by a combination of such factors. For evidence of this I need only refer to a number of unfortunate situations which have arisen over recent years.  These were well publicised in the national media and concerned schemes where following the liquidation of the company, the assets were found to be deficient in terms of the members' justified expectations.</P>
    <P>Another major shortcoming concerns the provision made for members of pension schemes who change jobs.  The arrangements made to preserve the pension entitlements of early leavers where they move to another employment or to provide them with a transfer payment to the scheme of their new employer have been regarded as inadequate.  Few <Col N="603" /> schemes maintain the real value of preserved pensions.  As a result, 90 per cent of pension scheme members who change jobs settle for a refund of their contributions, which in many cases is well below the value of the pension entitlements they have foregone.  In addition, of course, the persons concerned at retirement or in the event of their premature death, their surviving dependants, may end up with a very inadequate pension.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the National Pensions Board was established in 1986 to report to the Minister for Social Welfare on the priorities for the regulation of occupational pension schemes and the general development of pensions for the future.  Thus began a process which has culminated in the publication of this Bill.  The first report of the Pensions Board made a series of detailed recommendations for the regulation of occupational pensions.  I then asked for and received the views of the various interested parties on the recommendations made and in the light of the report and views received I prepared my proposals for Government.  These were submitted in May 1989 and Government approval obtained for the drafting of legislation on the basis of these proposals.</P>
    <P>In May 1989 also the board submitted its fourth report which dealt with the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational pension schemes.  That report provided me with sound guidance in drawing up the proposals for legislation in this area, which also form an important part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The drafting of the legislation proved to be a much more complex and time-consuming task than any of those involved had anticipated.  Considerable technical assistance was given to my officials in this task by some of the top experts on occupational pensions in this country who are, or had been, members of the National Pensions Board.  I would like to put on the record of this House my appreciation of the contribution made in the course of this whole process by these experts, and indeed by all the <Col N="604" /> members of the National Pensions Board, who gave freely and unstintingly of their time and considerable expertise. I would also like to place on record my appreciation of the work done on this legislation by the officials in my Department.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, is the product of a process involving wide consultation and the harnessing of the considerable goodwill and expertise of all the various interests associated with occupational pensions in this country.  As such it is, I believe, a model as to how Government can work with the various interested parties in the achievement of objectives which are for the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>In formulating my proposals, I have been careful to strike a balance between on the one hand providing adequate safeguards for the protection of members' pension rights and, on the other hand, ensuring that the continued development of pension schemes is not put at risk by overregulation.  I believe that I have succeeded in striking the right balance in this regard.  I would now like to give a broad outline of the main objectives which I wish to achieve with this Bill.</P>
    <P>The primary objective is the establishment of a legal framework and a system for the supervision of occupational schemes, which will ensure that schemes are properly administered and that there are adequate safeguards for the pension rights of scheme members and their dependants.</P>
    <P>This will be achieved by setting down clear statutory requirements regarding the disclosure of information to scheme members and other interested parties; setting out the duties and responsibilities of trustees, and providing that trustees who fail to comply with the requirements will be guilty of an offence and subject to substantial fines or, as a last resort, can be removed; and establishing a statutory pensions board to monitor and supervise compliance with the new requirements.</P>
    <P>My next objective is to provide for the compulsory preservation of occupational pension entitlements and for their revaluation, in the case of members who change <Col N="605" /> employments.  As an alternative to preserved benefits, a member will have the option of having a transfer payment made to the scheme of his new employer or of purchasing an annuity from an approved life office.</P>
    <P>My third objective is to ensure that the pension promises made in the case of defined benefit schemes are backed by adequate and secure scheme assets. Accordingly, the Bill provides for minimum funding standards which will require trustees to arrange for actuarial valuations every three and a half years, in order to establish that the assets of the fund are adequate to meet the pension promises made.  To increase further the protection of members' pension rights in this regard, provision has also been made to enable me as Minister to provide, by way of regulations, that any self-investment or concentration of investments over a prescribed percentage shall not be taken into account by the actuary for the purposes of complying with the minimum funding standards.</P>
    <P>A fourth objective is to provide for the progressive implementation of equal treatment for men and women in relation to occupational benefit schemes in line with the requirements of EC Directive 86/378/EEC on this matter.  I also intend to take into account the recent judgment of the European Court of Justice of 17 May in the Barber case in relation to equal retirement ages.  I will explain this in more detail later.</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to refer to the issue of member trustees.  This has received a lot of attention in recent weeks.  The Bill as currently drafted does not make provision for the appointment of member trustees.  I would like to briefly outline the background to this issue.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board agreed that the participation of members in the appointment of trustees is a desirable objective but differed in their view as to whether it should be a statutory requirement &mdash; a majority being in favour while a minority considered that it should be encouraged only through voluntary agreement between employers and <Col N="606" /> members.  Given the reservations expressed on the issue the board considered that progress towards the fulfilment of the objective should be gradual rather than immediate.  For this reason the board recommended that statutory provisions in this regard should not come into operation until a period of three years has elapsed following the date of the enactment of the Pensions Act.</P>
    <P>I agree with the National Pensions Board regarding the desirability of member participation in the appointment of trustees, particularly as it would improve the interest in and commitment of members to their scheme.  However, I have to take into account the serious reservations of employers regarding statutory requirements in this area and, in particular, their view that such requirements could be an inhibiting factor in the extension of occupational pension schemes to employments where they do not already exist.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is my intention to ask the new statutory board, as a priority, to take whatever steps are needed to encourage employers to appoint member trustees on a voluntary basis by, in particular, allaying fears in relation to such appointments employers may have.  This would be very much in line with the functions of the new board as laid down in section 10 of the Bill regarding the issuing of guidelines, codes of practice and the setting of standards generally in relation to the duties and responsibilities of trustees.  I would envisage that after a three year period the board would then report to me on the issue and advise me as Minister on the extent to which the right of members to participate in the appointment of trustees requires a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>It was my intention initially to wait until then to make whatever statutory provision would be necessary.  However, having consulted with the various interested parties I have decided that it would be more appropriate to make special provision in the Bill giving me powers as Minister for Social Welfare to prescribe by way of regulations for member participation in the appointment <Col N="607" /> of trustees.  This will ensure that when the three year period has elapsed there will be no delay in making the necessary provision.  I will, therefore, be circulating the text of an appropriate amendment to the Bill before Committee Stage to provide for this.</P>
    <P>I am determined to ensure that as far as possible the whole question of member participation in the appointment of trustees is dealt with in a way that will give members an effective and meaningful role in the administration of what are, after all, schemes designed for them. At the same time I want to ensure that legal requirements in this regard do not hinder the extension of occupational pension schemes to employments where they do not already exist.</P>
    <P>As the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill is a comprehensive one, I do not propose to give a detailed account of the contents of the Bill.  I will instead give a general overview of the main provisions of each of the seven parts with particular reference to those areas which are of major importance.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill contains the usual general provisions and calls for few remarks except in relation to section 3. This section provides for offences and penalties for contravention of the provisions in the Bill.  It also provides that a prosecution for an offence may be instituted by the new Statutory Pensions Board to be established under Part II. This is a very important provision.  At present virtually all pension schemes are subject to the safeguards of trust law. However, as I mentioned earlier those rights can only be enforced by members instituting proceedings in the High Court, if they are prepared to meet the risks of litigation.  Under the Bill it will now be possible for an aggrieved member to request the pensions board to take an action on his/her behalf against defaulting trustees or employers, rather than rely on his/her own resources.  From the members' point of view this is a significant development as it affords them a readily accessible means of redress.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill provides for the establishment of a new statutory board <Col N="608" /> An Bord Pinsean &mdash; The Pensions Board. Section 10 sets out the general functions of the board.  The primary functions of this new body will be to supervise the implementation of the new legislation.  It will also have an advisory role to the Minister for Social Welfare on pension matters generally and on apppropriate standards for occupational pension schemes.  The new board will be broadly representative of the main interests in pensions schemes, namely the trade unions, employers, the pensions industry and the Government.  I believe that the composition of the board will enable them to be effective in performing the tasks set for them.</P>
    <P>To fulfil their role it is essential that the board have the necessary powers and resources available to them.  Sections 15 and 16 enable the board to appoint a chief executive and to employ their own staff. Section 18 provides the new board with the necessary powers to carry out inspections of a pension scheme's books and records and to obtain all the relevant information relating to the affairs of a scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for the imposition of fees on pension schemes.  I would like to emphasise that the purpose of these fees, which were recommended by the National Pensions Board, is to meet the administrative expenses of the new board.  The scale of the fees and the basis for their determination will be set down in regulations under this section.  The level of the proposed fees will be determined by me in consultation with the members of the new board.</P>
    <P>The success of this legislation in safeguarding the rights of pension scheme members is crucially dependent on the board operating with the maximum efficiency.  I believe that this can be best achieved by having the administrative expenses financed by the occupational pension schemes.  They will have a direct and ongoing interest in the successful and cost-effective operation of the board.  In addition, given the scale of the tax reliefs available to occupational schemes, I do not consider that taxpayers should also be asked to finance the cost of the regulatory <Col N="609" /> system for the protection of members' pension rights.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that one of the major shortcomings in the present arrangements for occupational pension schemes is that few private sector schemes make adequate provision to protect the pension entitlements of those who change jobs, particularly in relation to maintaining the real value of these entitlements.  As a result many members who leave to take up other employment settle for a refund of their contributions. This results in the pension entitlements they have acquired on reaching retirement being considerably less than their periods as members of pension schemes should have conferred.  Lack of protection of pension entitlements on leaving can also be a major barrier to mobility between employments, particularly in the case of persons aged from mid-30 upwards.  At this stage people are much more conscious of pension cover and of their responsibilities for dependants.  It is essential today to have adequate pension cover in view of the fact that people are living much longer in old age and the rising costs of maintaining a decent standard of living after retirement.  Today's 30-year-olds must plan realistically for some 15 years of retirement and possibly more.  The average will be 15 years and I should like to state that people will need to make provision for those years.</P>
    <P>Having examined the present arrangements, and their shortcomings, I have decided that the best way forward would be to introduce a proper system of preservation of pension rights with an option to transfer the equivalent value of members' entitlement to another suitable scheme.  Accordingly, Part III of the Bill contains the necessary provision for the protection of members' pension rights in the event of their leaving a scheme before normal retirement age.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the Bill provides for a statutory entitlement to preserved benefit in respect of service after the commencement date in the case of a member who leaves a pension scheme before retirement age, provided he/she satisfies <Col N="610" /> the following minimum qualifying service requirements.  He must have at least five years qualifying service of which at least two years fall after the commencement date.  The requirements in this regard are simple to operate and are broadly in line with current practice.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 and 29 deal with the levels of benefit to be preserved.  A distinction is made in the Bill between benefits provided under defined benefit schemes and those under defined contribution schemes.  In the case of the former, schemes will be obliged to preserve an appropriate part of any benefit earned for service after the commencement date. In the latter case the amount of preserved benefit shall be equal to the actuarial value of the contributions accumulated on behalf of the member at the date of payment in respect of such service.</P>
    <P>Under section 31 refunds of members' contributions will no longer be permitted for periods of service in respect of which members are entitled to preserved benefits. This is essential, since to do otherwise would not result in any improvement in the existing situation.  These provisions also apply to any additional voluntary contributions made by the member.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the preservation requirements only apply to service after the appointed day.  This means that members will still be entitled to opt for a refund of contributions paid in respect of periods up to that date, January 1991.  Moreover, refunds of contributions will also be payable in respect of periods after that date, in cases where members do not fulfil the qualifying service requirements for preservation, for example less than five years in the scheme.</P>
    <P>A number of pension scheme members who intend leaving full-time employment early, for example, on marriage or to look after their children on a full-time basis, have planned to opt for a refund of their contributions to help finance house purchase or other expenses associated with setting up a home.  They have expressed concern that this may no longer be possible.  I wish to take this <Col N="611" /> opportunity to assure them that contributions paid to date will not be affected by the provision concerning preservation.</P>
    <P>A system of compulsory preservation on its own would do little to solve the problem of the &ldquo;early leaver&rdquo;.  Any proposal which hopes to achieve a real and meaningful improvement in this area must incorporate a provision whereby preserved benefits are revalued between the date of leaving and eventual retirement. Otherwise, the preserved pension loses value in real terms.  Section 32, therefore, makes provision for a minimum revaluation of preserved benefits from a date five years after the commencement date or the date of leaving, if later, up to retirement age.</P>
    <P>The minimum annual rate of revaluation proposed in the Bill is the lesser of the increase in the consumer price index or 4 per cent per annum.  The National Pensions Board had proposed in addition that where the rate of inflation is greater that 4 per cent but less than 10 per cent an additional increase of half the excess over 4 per cent should be provided, thus giving a maximum increase of 7 per cent. Many of the interested parties which I consulted felt that the board's formula for revaluation was unduly high and would in any event give rise to very real practical problems for pension schemes.  For example, trustees of a scheme may wish to purchase a deferred annuity contract for an early leaver to be revalued in accordance with the requirements laid down in legislation.  However, insurance companies are only geared to providing such contracts at fixed rates of revaluation. There are no contracts available on the market which will automatically revalue in relation to a variable rate of inflation.  It would also cause difficulties for schemes in their effort to satisfy the proposed new minimum funding requirements under Part IV.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposed revaluation formula set out in section 32 is a reasonable compromise.  It is easier to administer and is aimed to fully match any increase in inflation up to 4 per cent. Provision is made in the section to vary <Col N="612" /> by regulations the 4 per cent ceiling if this is found necessary.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that this proposed rate will be the statutory minimum requirement.  If schemes can afford to do better, then there is nothing in the Bill precluding them from doing so.</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Bill gives a member of a funded scheme who builds up an entitlement to a preserved benefit the right to take a transfer payment as an alternative to his preserved benefit entitlement.  The transfer payment shall be the equivalent to the actuarial value of the member's preserved benefit including an appropriate element for revaluation. A member may choose to have the transfer payment made to the scheme of his new employer or used to purchase a deferred annuity contract from a life office.</P>
    <P>Section 36 enables the Minister to make regulations excluding from the application of the proposed preservation requirements schemes already having a comparable system of preservation and revaluation for early leavers under their own rules.  It is my intention to exclude public sector schemes who operate the public service transfer network from these requirements.  Such schemes cater for those employed in the Civil Service and the broader public service, including the vast majority of semi-State companies. Persons who leave such schemes before normal retirement are entitled to preserved benefits which are more generous than those provided for under this Bill.  Revaluation of preserved benefit entitlements under such schemes is linked to salary increases which are normally more favourable than the formula linked to increases in consumer prices as proposed in the Bill.  It is not proposed, therefore, to change the basis of revaluation for such schemes in order to comply with the new requirements.  There is also in existence an extensive transfer network whereby full credit for past service is provided to employees moving within public sector organisations.</P>
    <P>Many current scheme members who intend to remain in full-time employment but may wish at some future date to <Col N="613" /> change jobs have expressed concern that no provision has been made requiring preservation in respect of periods prior to the commencement date.  I wish to stress in this regard that the National Pensions Board estimated that the cost of preservation in respect of future service on the basis of the conditions they recommended would approximate at most to 1 per cent of pensionable salaries and would be substantially less in the case of schemes with a relatively low level of membership turnover.  The overall cost of preservation on the basis of the conditions set out in the Bill is likely to be marginally less, given the fact that the conditions are somewhat more restrictive than those recommended by the pensions board.  Moreover, one of our leading actuaries has estimated that the additional cost of extending the preservation provisions to the past service of existing scheme members may not amount to more than 0.5 per cent of pensionable salaries.  In view of these considerations I urge employers to follow the lead given in the Bill and to provide for preservation in respect of past service rights where this is the wish of members.  It is not my intention at this stage to make this mandatory but I will be keeping the situation under review.</P>
    <P>Trustees and sponsoring employers will have a variety of options open to them to meet the costs of preservation. Some schemes will have no difficulty in meeting these costs given the favourable rates of investment return in recent years. Others could increase the contributions from employers and employees or both. Non-contributory schemes could be changed to contributory ones or changes could be introduced in the scheme's benefit structure by, for example, taking social welfare benefits fully into account or changing the benefit formula.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to Part IV of the Bill which provides for the introduction of a funding standard.  The main objective of the new funding requirements is to prevent employers from making pension promises which they are unlikely to be able to afford, and to <Col N="614" /> enhance the security of the promises already made.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides that the new minimum standard shall apply to all defined benefit schemes.  Scheme trustees will be required to submit to the pension board at regular intervals actuarial funding certificates prepared by the actuary to the scheme.  These certificates will certify whether the standard is being adhered to.</P>
    <P>An initial actuarial funding certificate will be required within a period of three years after the commencement date.  I propose that this commencement date will also be 1 January 1991.  This certificate must state that sufficient assets exist within the scheme to cover 100 per cent of the liabilities relating to pensions in the course of payment, additional voluntary contributions made, transfer value entitlements and the benefits which have accrued in respect of post commencement date service.  The latter benefits are those which must be compulsorily preserved in respect of future service under Part III (including appropriate provision for revaluation).  It will also need to certify the degree of solvency achieved in respect of accrued benefits relating to service prior to the commencement date.</P>
    <P>Subsequent actuarial funding certificates must be submitted every three and a half years after the effective date of the previous certificate.  Certificates which have an effective date not more than ten years after the commencement date will, in effect, be required to certify that the solvency level of the scheme has not deteriorated in the meantime below the level initially certified.</P>
    <P>After a transition period of ten years every defined benefit scheme will be required to have reached a funding standard which will enable it to fully discharge the accrued benefit expectations of its members.  Accordingly, certificates which have an effective date more than ten years after the commencement date will need to certify that total assets at that date are at least sufficient to secure 100 per cent of all the liabilities of the scheme.  These are transitional phasing <Col N="615" /> arrangements to make it feasible to meet the new statutory requirements.</P>
    <P>The proposed funding standard provided under section 43 differs from that recommended by the National Pensions Board, in that full protection is given to the entitlements of current pensioners. From the beginning schemes must certify that there are adequate assets in the fund to provide for the benefits of current pensioners in respect of service prior to the commencement date as well as service after that date.  In the event of wind up, provision is also made for the first priority to be given to current pensioners.  Under the board's original proposals circumstances could be envisaged whereby these benefits could be put at risk in the event of a winding up in order to fully secure other benefits provided under the scheme.  I am glad to say that under the provisions of the Bill benefits paid to pensioners are to be given maximum protection and must be fully funded at all times.</P>
    <P>The funding standard will not add to the overall cost of benefit provision &mdash; no augmentation of benefits levels are imposed and by definition no additional financial commitments arise.  They will, however, have an impact on the pace of funding for many schemes because of the need to accelerate contribution payments to conform with the solvency targets.  The effect on existing contribution levels will depend on the funding policy currently adopted for each scheme.  The general impression within the pensions industry is that the funding policies adopted by the majority of schemes are such that compliance with the proposed new standards should not give rise to any significant extra costs.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the accounting bodies have recently taken an interest in this area and have recognised the importance of pension liabilities within company accounts.  They have recently published a statement of standard accounting practice No. 24 dealing with disclosure of pension costs in the accounts of employers.  The provisions of SSAP 24 &mdash; as it is called &mdash; apply in full to Irish registered companies which are <Col N="616" /> quoted on the UK and Dublin Stock Exchanges for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 1988.  Non-quoted Irish companies will be obliged to implement in full the financial provisions of the standard during the accountancy period which commences on or after 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>SSAP 24 adopts as its basic objective that the costs of pensions should be charged against an employer's profits on a systematic and rational basis over the period during which the employer derives benefit from the employee's service.  This requires the actuarial assessment of an annual pension cost for a defined benefit scheme which is expected to remain substantially level over a period of time.</P>
    <P>SSAP 24 does, of course, deal only with the recognition of pension costs in company accounts and does not have any direct effect on the funding programme which the employer adopts for his pension scheme.  Nevertheless, it seems inevitable that, in most instances, the SSAP 24 pension costs will be reflected in actual contribution payments to the pension scheme.  The SSAP 24 provisions, therefore, require the adoption of funding policies for pension schemes which are fully in line with the requirements of the Pensions Bill.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the disclosure of information in relation to pension schemes.  It is often said that occupational pension rights are the biggest investment an employee holds; worth far more than any investment he controls personally including even his home.  It is only right, therefore, that full information is available to the individual about this major asset.  Indeed, the view has been expressed that many of the difficulties experienced to date in relation to pension schemes result from a lack of information on the part of the scheme members.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the serious deficiencies in the legal protection afforded the members in this regard and to the fact that one of the main objectives of this Bill is to provide members with effective and comprehensive rights to obtain full and necessary information in <Col N="617" /> relation to their pension scheme.  There are two broad requirements provided for in this area.  First, the trustees must obtain specified financial and actuarial information on the scheme under their control.  Secondly, the members must be provided with adequate information to enable them satisfy themselves about the running of the scheme, its financial soundness and the security of their benefit entitlements.</P>
    <P>Sections 53 to 57 set out the general disclosure requirements and provide that the more detailed requirements be covered by regulations.  Some commentators have expressed disappointment at the lack of detail concerning the new requirements and the difficulty of assessing their effects on individual pension schemes.  I was very much guided by the National Pensions Board in this regard which recognised that the requirements in this area, by their very nature, would be fairly detailed and may not be appropriate for primary legislation given that their application to particular types of schemes would have to be kept under constant review.  The board recommended that the more general requirements should be set out in the Act with provision for the more detailed requirements to be included in regulations. In drafting the Bill I have adopted this approach.  It is my intention, as soon as the Bill is enacted, to publish the more detailed requirements in regulations.</P>
    <P>During the course of our consultations on the board's proposals, it became clear that there is widespread agreement on the need for full disclosure of information along the lines recommended by the board.  Therefore, I intend to waste no time in bringing these into effect.  For the benefit of Deputies I would like to set out clearly what these requirements entail. Different requirements will need to be set for different types of schemes.  For example, the essential information only will be required from unfunded schemes. There will be reduced requirements for defined contribution schemes and schemes with fewer than 50 members.</P>
    <P>Section 55 requires trustees of schemes <Col N="618" /> to obtain at periodic intervals actuarial valuations and audited accounts.  In the case of defined benefit schemes an actuarial valuation must be carried out every three and a half years.  This is in line with current good practice.  The actuarial funding certificate to be prepared for the purposes of the new funding standard will be completed at the same time as the actuarial valuation.  The valuation must be carried out by a qualified actuary and must be made available for inspection by members and their trade union representatives.</P>
    <P>It shall also be a requirement for schemes to produce annual audited accounts prepared by a qualified auditor &mdash; surprisingly, there is no current legal requirement for pension schemes to have an independent audit of their accounts. The objective of the accounts shall be to give employers and scheme members a true and fair view of the nature and magnitude of the financial transactions of the scheme for the scheme year and the nature and disposition of its net assets at the accounting date.  Therefore, the audited accounts will outline the financial assets and liabilities of the pension scheme and the way in which the trustees have discharged their stewardship responsibilities during the period. Unfunded schemes, death benefit schemes and frozen schemes will be exempt from these requirements.</P>
    <P>In recent years there have also been developments in accountancy practice, relating to pensions accounting and disclosure. A Statement of Recommended Practice &mdash; SORPI &mdash; on pension scheme accounts was issued in May 1986 by the Accounting Standards Committee.  This statement represents the accountancy profession's guidance on current best practice on the form and content of such accounts.  Although it is not mandatory, pensions schemes are encouraged to follow it.  Our detailed requirements in this area which I propose to outline in regulations will be similar to these professional guidelines.  Accordingly, schemes which already follow the guidelines should have little difficulty in complying with the regulations.  In fact it will <Col N="619" /> be a requirement for the accounts to contain a statement that they have been prepared in compliance with the professional guidelines and, if not, to provide an indication of material departures from this.</P>
    <P>Section 54 requires trustees to provide an annual report in respect of each scheme year after the commencement date.  This report shall normally consist of: a report by the trustees; an investment report; the audited accounts and a copy of the latest actuarial funding certificate.</P>
    <P>The report by the trustees shall include basic information in relation to the scheme such as: (a) the names of trustees and any other persons or organisations acting for the scheme such as actuaries, auditors, solicitors, and investment managers; (b) a statement of the number of members, pensioners and persons with preserved benefits; (c) a statement of any amendments to the scheme over the past year; (d) details of any increases in pensions granted during the year or of any ex gratia payments made and (e) a review of the financial development of the scheme and likely anticipated future developments.</P>
    <P>The investment report shall include a statement of the investment policies pursued during the year and any material changes in these policies during the year or in comparison with the previous year. A comment on the investment performance of the fund shall also be made.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, there will be reduced requirements for defined contribution schemes and smaller schemes with fewer than 50 members.  As recommended by the board, these will be less onerous than the full details I have just outlined.  In place of the full requirements for annual trustee reports and annual audited accounts such schemes shall have the option of issuing a shortened report prepared by either an independent accountant or the insurance company managing the scheme.  This report shall include the following information: (a) a general statement indicating the basis on which contributions to the scheme are calculated; (b) a statement indicating how the assets are invested including the <Col N="620" /> extent of any self-investment or concentration of investment; (c) confirmation that the contributions paid in the relevant period represented the amount due as set out in (a) above or, alternatively, a note of the amount received where this is different from that due; and (d) in the case of &ldquo;small&rdquo; defined benefit schemes, a copy of the most recent actuarial funding certificate.</P>
    <P>I would like also to refer to section 53 which is an important provision in itself. While sections 54 and 55 impose obligations on trustees to produce annual reports and other financial documents, section 53 places a general requirement on them to disclose these to members, prospective members, their spouses and trade unions representing the members together with a comprehensive range of additional information.  This additional information shall include: details about the constitution and rules of the scheme; certain basic information about the scheme and details about an individual's benefit entitlements and options under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about the cost of implementing these disclosure requirements, in particular the administrative costs.  I do not consider that the costs involved will be significant in terms of the resources of many schemes.  Many schemes already provide their members with comprehensive information. Those which follow good practice will find that they have little or no extra burden to bear as a result of the legislation.  Moreover, the option of shortened reports for smaller sized schemes will go a long way towards mitigating any extra costs for such schemes.</P>
    <P>Combined with the new minimum funding requirements in Part IV, I believe that these new measures will greatly enhance the security of members' pension rights.  It will improve the rights of members to access to information on the level of funding of pension schemes and thus the extend to which future benefits are secured.  Members will be much more aware of their rights under the schemes and the basis on which their pension expectations are founded.  It will <Col N="621" /> also enable them to satisfy themselves that schemes are being run in their best interests.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill contains a number of specific provisions affecting trustees of pension schemes.  I have already referred to the absence of any specific statutory provision covering the duties of pension scheme trustees.  Such duties are subject to general trust law and to the trust deed of the pension scheme.  The only general obligation on trustees is to look after and manage the trust assets and to use them to make provision for the beneficiaries. It can therefore be difficult to assess if the trustees are performing properly in accordance with trust law.  Furthermore, if members believe that their scheme is being mismanaged, the only redress currently is through the courts by suing the trustees for breach of trust or for an order removing the trustees.  Such a case would normally be heard by a Chancery judge of the High Court and the substantial costs involved would normally make it prohibitive for members to contemplate such action.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with both these shortcomings. First, it clearly defines the duties and responsibilities of pensions scheme trustees and, secondly, it provides an appropriate means of redress for the individual member.  Section 58 outlines the main duties of trustees as follows: (a) to ensure that the contributions due to the scheme are paid into the fund and are properly invested; (b) to ensure that the benefits of the scheme are paid as they become due; and (c) to ensure that proper membership and financial records are kept.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill, to which I referred earlier, provides that trustees who fail to comply with the new requirements will be guilty of an offence which shall be punishable by a system of fines.  Section 61 in this part of the Bill provides that the High Court may order the replacement of the trustees, if following a request made to it by the pensions board, it considers that such action is necessary in the interests of the members of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that a member's remedy <Col N="622" /> for non-compliance with the new requirements would initially take the form of an approach to the trustees either directly or through his trade union or staff representative.  If this approach or informal contact does not produce the desired result the member, or his/her trade union, could make a complaint to the board which would then investigate the allegation on the member's behalf.  It is hoped that the involvement of the pensions board would normally be sufficient to achieve the required action.  If this course of action fails to provide satisfaction the board would then use its power to take legal proceedings on behalf of the member against the defaulting trustees or any other culpable person.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill represents an important step in providing equal treatment for men and women in occupational benefit schemes.  It implements in full the requirements of EC Directive 86/378/EC on this issue.  The main schemes covered are occupational pension and sick pay schemes and long-term disability schemes.  Optional benefits, single member schemes and personal schemes are excluded in line with the provisions of the EC Directive in this regard.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill will override any differences in the treatment of men and women in occupational schemes in relation to: eligibility for membership; the obligation to contribute; levels of contributions payable by members and employers; and benefit rights.  There are special safeguards for those absent from work by reason of maternity or for family reasons.</P>
    <P>I wish to state that I am fully committed to the elimination of all discrimination between men and women in occupational social security schemes.  In line with the approach being adopted at EC level in this regard, I consider that there is a need for schemes to have transitional periods before full compliance with the principle of equal treatment is required.  This is necessary to enable employers and/or trustees to meet in a planned way any extra costs arising from the implementation of the principle of equal treatment and to ensure that the entitlements <Col N="623" /> already acquired by existing members, both men and women, are protected. This approach was also recommended by the National Pensions Board in its fourth report.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in line with the timescale laid down in the EC Directive, schemes will have up to 1 January 1993 to comply in full with the equal treatment provisions in the Bill.  Discrimination in contracts of employment and collective agreements must also be removed by that date.  The deadline is extended to 30 July 1999 in the case of employee's contributions, where the rates differ by reference to the use of different actuarial factors for men and women.  The Directive also permits member states to defer compulsory application of the principle of equal treatment for pensionable age and survivor's benefits, at the latest until a further Directive requires equality in this area. This is also reflected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The 1985 ESRI survey on occupational pension schemes showed that in only 13 per cent of schemes was the retirement age for women lower than for men.  These schemes would invariably be longer established schemes.  In virtually all new schemes and in the case of new entrants to existing schemes, equal retirement ages are normally provided for. Inequality in this respect does not occur therefore, in the vast majority of schemes in this country.  This is mainly due to the fact that there is equality in this regard under the basic social welfare schemes which have a major influence on the way occupational schemes are designed.</P>
    <P>Equality of treatment in this area could involve having an equal retirement age at either the later age which normally applies to men or at the earlier age which normally applies to women.  On grounds of cost it is likely that schemes would equalise at the later age.  The National Pensions Board stated in its Fourth Report that this is a reasonable and practical means of achieving equality of treatment, particularly having regard to the financial implications.</P>
    <P>The net effect of equal treatment in this regard in the vast majority of cases, therefore, would be to worsen the <Col N="624" /> position of women who can now retire at the earlier age, with no corresponding advantage being given to men.  For these reasons I decided that equal treatment in this area should not be made mandatory until this was provided for in the next EC Directive.  I expected that transitional arrangements would be provided for in that Directive which would protect the position of women who are currently eligible to retire at the earlier age.</P>
    <P>I considered that it would be important that Irish legislation be fully in line with the requirements of the next EC Directive in this area.  Otherwise the Irish women concerned could be worse off than their counterparts in the other EC countries, if the provisions of the Directive were more favourable to them than Irish legislation.  Alternatively, the schemes might have to alter their rules further, if Irish legislation in this area did not fully comply with the provisions of the next Directive and, as a consequence, had to be changed to provide for such compliance.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Bill, however, the European Court of Justice in its recent judgment of 17 May in the Barber case appears to have ruled in effect that compliance with Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome requires equal treatment in relation to retirement ages under occupational schemes.  The court also ruled that Article 119 of the Treaty may not be relied on to claim entitlement to a pension in line with its judgment in this case, prior to the actual date of the judgment, except in the case of workers or those claiming under them who have before that date initiated legal proceedings or raised an equivalent claim under the applicable national law.</P>
    <P>I am at present having this judgment examined within my Department.  <i>Prima facie,</i> it would appear that with effect from 17 May, the date of the judgment, differences in the treatment of men and women in relation to retirement ages under occupational schemes are contrary to Article 119 of the Treaty.  If, having examined the matter, I am satisfied that this, in fact, is the case, I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage <Col N="625" /> to bring the appropriate provisions in the Bill into line with the court judgment.  I want to avoid the situation where the provisions of this Bill when enacted would be contrary to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The EC Directive also permits member states to postpone compulsory application of the principle of equal treatment in relation to survivor's pensions.  The National Pensions Board in their report made specific recommendations for the progressive implementation of equal treatment in these schemes.  I have found their recommendations broadly acceptable. However, for similar reasons to those I have outlined in relation to retirement ages, I decided that the compulsory application of equal treatment in relation to survivor's pensions should be dealt with in the context of the next EC Directive dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing for equal treatment in this area was also an important consideration.  The National Pensions Board estimated that it could give rise to an increase in pension costs varying from 3.4 per cent to 15.8 per cent, depending on the male-female composition of the workforce.  Requiring schemes to meet these extra costs at the same time as they will have to meet the extra costs of complying with the other provisions of the Pensions Bill would be difficult to justify, especially when EC member states are permitted to defer compulsory application of equal treatment in this area under the terms of the Directive.  It could also lead to a reduction in pension cover for survivor's pensions, where schemes could not fully meet the extra costs involved.  This would adversely affect women engaged full-time on home duties, who are totally dependent on the widow's pension in the event of the death of their husband.</P>
    <P>My intention is to provide for equal treatment in this area in accordance with the terms of the next Directive and within the timescale it lays down.  The recommendations of the National Pensions Board will be fully taken into account <Col N="626" /> in establishing the Irish position on the terms of the proposed Directive in relation to this issue.  However, I intend to keep the situation in this regard under review.  If within two years there does not appear to be any immediate prospect of the next Directive being adopted by the Council of Ministers, I will at that stage bring forward proposals for the compulsory application of equal treatment in relation to survivor's pensions, in which full account will be taken of the recommendations of the National Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to a number of provisions of this part which may be of interest to Deputies.  Section 63 defines the term &ldquo;occupational benefit scheme&rdquo;. This definition includes occupational schemes other than occupational pension schemes such as occupational sick pay schemes and long-term disability benefit schemes.  Section 67 outlines specific exemptions from the principle of equal treatment.  The most notable of these are those which I have referred to &mdash; pensionable ages and survivor's benefits.  Section 69 of the Bill deals with the implementation of the principle of equal treatment.  It provides that where any rule of a scheme does not comply with the principle it will be overridden by this part of the Bill and the more favourable treatment provided to persons of the one sex shall be provided to persons of the other sex.  Trustees of schemes or where appropriate the employer shall be obliged to take the necessary steps to ensure compliance.</P>
    <P>Sections 73 to 78 deal with the resolution of disputes in regard to equal treatment.  In this connection a clear distinction is made in sections 73 and 74 between those concerning occupational pension schemes and those involving other types of occupations benefit schemes.  In the case of pension schemes it is proposed that disputes between members and trustees-employers will be determined by the proposed new pensions board along the same lines as those applicable to the other requirements contained in the Bill.  Failure by any party to comply with the principle will be an <Col N="627" /> offence under section 3.  It is proposed that disputes concerning other occupational schemes will be dealt with by equality officers and the Labour Court on the same basis as for equality of treatment in the employment field.  The procedures for the resolution of such disputes are set out in sections 75 to 77 and are similar to those contained in existing equality legislation, that is the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>I trust the House has found my explanation of the objectives of the Bill and of its major provisions useful and helpful.  Due to its length I regret that I was unable to go into more detail but in my reply to the debate I will try to respond to any points or queries raised by Deputies.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a major and historic piece of legislation.  I believe that it strikes the right balance between the need to provide for adequate safeguards for members' rights and expectations under pension schemes and the avoidance of over regulation of such schemes, which could jeopardise their further development.</P>
    <P>We have managed to balance a large number of adverse factors.  I believe the Bill is very well balanced.  I feel privileged to bring this historic legislation before the House because for generations to come workers will be glad to acknowledge the value of the legislation we are enacting in 1990.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, a Cheann Comhairle, I welcome Deputy Flaherty on her return to this House after the recent birth of another son and I congratulate her on that event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his good wishes, but may I also congratulate him on the birth of major legislation. We are all glad to see this Bill in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we will improve the Bill in its passage through the House so that we will have major legislation on the Statute Book that will regulate and order matters <Col N="628" /> in a way that will encourage the development of the pensions industry.  I share the Minister's concern that we should keep this broad objective in mind during the passing of the Bill.  It will be a balancing act between providing rights and privileges while ensuring that the industry, which is voluntary and delicate, will grow and that we assist its growth.  At the same time we hope to establish well policed standards of management of the schemes outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated for bringing this Bill before the House, but perhaps because of his haste some of the matters that we had hoped he might have dealt with have been excluded.  We, in Fine Gael, welcome the provisions of the Bill regarding minimum funding, disclosure of information, the establishment of the Pensions' Board and especially the provisions for the preservation and transfer of pension rights.  I think perhaps that is the single most innovative and creative measure in the Bill.  It will change the face of retirement for many people in the future.  There is no doubt that on becoming law, this Bill will change things for the better in the long term, because it will ensure full occupational pensions for far greater numbers by allowing the pensions paid in different employments to be preserved or transferred.  However, Fine Gael believe that the Minister has made a major error, indeed towards the end of his script, he acknowledges this in his reference to the results of the recent court cases, but it was clear to us from having met with representatives of the industry that they were deeply concerned at the confusion in the area of equal pay, and equal treatment in pension schemes. They felt there was an impossible burden on trustees to manage schemes without having the legal position clarified, in view of the confusion not only at EC level with Directives but as to whether pensions as remuneration are covered by the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act and that unequal treatment is illegal under existing Irish law.  The Bill continues that confusion and I believe that in the Minister's haste to bring this Bill before the House <Col N="629" />&mdash; indeed we were pressing him to have it &mdash; he failed to tackle these issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the parliamentary draftsmen are again working on this Bill and I hope that on Committee Stage or certainly by Report Stage he will have a fresh look at this.  We in Fine Gael are convinced that it was a major error not to adopt in full the National Pension Board's proposals, and I will deal with that in more detail later. It is regrettable that the Minister has not adopted, at least in principle in the long-term, the proposal for member trustees &mdash; again, I will deal with this in greater detail shortly.  It is vitally important to clarify the legal uncertainties enshrined in the Bill, particularly in the area of equality of treatment.</P>
    <P>I will repeat my overall aim that we hope this Bill will be simple, effective and cost effective.  We believe it is vital to ensure that there is a framework to encourage the provision of pensions and to discourage employers from worsening pension schemes to comply with the Bill. The Minister referred to this in his speech.  I hope when we come to consider this matter in detail we will all be responsive to it.  I have been involved with other legislation in this House where we argued similar cases and the legislation had a deleterious effect on the industry concerned and the practice of the particular occupation.  I refer in particular to the Clinical Trials Bill where warnings to the Minister of inadequate provisions in a certain area have proved to be well founded.  Desirable clinical testing in this country has been set back severely as a result of the way in which that Bill was drafted.  We have to be very conscious we are dealing with a live body, as it were, and that the way we act can have an influence on it.  I hope that we in Fine Gael will keep that very much in mind when contributing.</P>
    <P>We are concerned at the level of exemption proposed in the Bill.  I hope that in reply to Second Stage the Minister will indicate his thinking in relation to different sections.  I will point out the areas in more detail as I go through the <Col N="630" /> Bill.  The Bill is a welcome development in pension law, replacing the Trustee Act, 1893, and altering significantly the Perpetual Funds (Registration) Act, 1933.  The success of the Bill is due in no small way to the establishment of the National Pensions Board who thrashed out many of the issues involved.  The net product of that proposal indicates that this model of preparing complex legislation should be followed with other specialised legislation.</P>
    <P>On 1 March Fine Gael published a statement calling on the Minister to introduce legislation.  We sought mandatory disclosure of information to scheme members, minimum funding standards, actuarial valuations and annual reports and accounts, all of which appear in the Bill.  We sought to ensure that the National Pensions Board would have power to act promptly and also full transferability and the preservation of pension rights which, to a large degree, are included in the Bill.  We sought maximum simplicity and minimum bureaucracy, also a feature of the Bill.  We sought comprehensive equality of treatment in all schemes and provision for member trustees, neither of which are included in the Bill.  The Minister indicated he is committed to these matters in principle and I hope we can convince him, by our arguments, to deal with them.  I am sure my colleagues on the left will support these issues.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the representatives of the industry and indeed the unions and employers not just for their involvement in the pensions board but also for their assistance in briefing me for this Bill.  I found them very open and helpful and very willing to talk about the complexity of the Bill and their views in relation to it.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of anxiety due to the fact that in the past five or six years there have been two or three very high profile examples of a serious collapse of pension schemes which highlighted the gross inadequacy of protection for members of pension schemes.  I am glad those incidents were the exception rather than the rule.  As the Minister has said, <Col N="631" /> 98 per cent of all schemes are well run. Perhaps 90 per cent operate to the highest standard, even in advance of this Bill.  We are trying to provide minimum standards and absolute rights for workers.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the collapse of the H. Williams pension fund and the Castle-comer Castlebrand collapse.  I know certain journalists in the gallery are concerned about this matter because in the past some of their colleagues had occasion to go to court to obtain a right to information about their pension schemes.  There has been a delicate situation in the journalistic world, which is a fairly volatile world but not quite as volatile as ours.  Perhaps those people have reason to regret that this Bill will not be in position in advance of the 1991 estimated start-up date.  There is no doubt that the vast bulk of the industry operates to the highest standard.  As the Minister indicated, in the past year they have introduced new accounting standards and are implementing many of the funding provisions in advance of this Bill. Many of the schemes, particularly in relation to equality, have already been set up in preparation for this Bill.  The people involved are probably surprised to find the Bill expects less of them than they expect of themselves.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal initially with the two areas of conflict, that is the issue of member trustees and of equal treatment. The National Pensions Board recommended that we should adopt fully the principle of equal treatment in pension schemes.  The Minister opted instead for the proposals of the last EC Directive on this matter, which allowed significant derogations.  While the Minister has provided for equal treatment in the areas of access and benefit, he has not provided for it in the areas of survivor benefit or age of retirement.  This has led to problems and since the publication of the Bill he has had to refer to the European judgment.</P>
    <P>The industry is very concerned with the unclear legal position of trustees in making decisions.  They felt the Bill should have adopted the stance of the National Pensions Board report which <Col N="632" /> clarified this area and which moved with the times.  On the one hand the Minister is establishing the principle of equal treatment and saying that any action opposed to that principle is illegal while, on the other hand, he is continuing to enshrine different ages of retirement and different treatment of survivors.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the case the Minister referred to that at present men may seek equal treatment to women and may win a case to allow them access to benefits from the age of 60, on parity with women. If a pension scheme was set up to provide for that, the cost would be enormous &mdash; far greater than if we provided for women's pensions from the age of 65, certainly for future beneficiaries, or perhaps for an agreed pension age for different schemes.  There are a series of approaches to this matter and we will be making a number of proposals on Committee Stage.  Alternatively, I hope the Minister, with the advantage of the advice available to him, will come up with some proposals which we can support.</P>
    <P>The issue of survivor benefits for women is not a huge one because it is a fact that women live longer than men. There is not a serious problem as regards cost in this area.  There would be a saving if the pension age was 65, which would probably be the most appropriate age as regards equal treatment because it is also the age for receipt of the State retirement pension.  As I have said, most pension schemes already provide for equal treatment and many of the schemes for men already provide for a retirement age earlier than 65 years.  The Minister could go further in this regard and I hope he will do so.  I share the Minister's view that requiring different contribution levels for men and women is valid in view of the fact that their life expectancy rates vary and also could be justified in the context of the EC Directive.  The other differences are not equally justified.  Essentially, the Bill's provision on equal treatment implements the EC Directive in its most limited form and avails of the significant derogation permitted in the directive.  This falls short of the comprehensive suggestions contained in the <Col N="633" /> report of the National Pensions Board. We, in Fine Gael, would prefer to see full implementation of the equal treatment principle subject to the specific differences contained in the actuarial tables which are valid on objective grounds, other than sex, of life expectancy &mdash; which is the relevant issue.  I hope the Minister will review that issue.</P>
    <P>On the issue of member trustees Deputy J. Bruton as spokesperson on Industry in the past, produced a document for Fine Gael setting out our view on industrial democracy.  It is a fundamental Fine Gael view that the more you share responsibility and authority within an industry the more unity there will be resulting in greater success and development.  Naturally we would take that point through to the area of pensions.</P>
    <P>Initially, in Ireland we are very slow to adopt new procedures.  I accept that the Minister has a very strong body of opinion to deal with regarding employers.  There is a section of employers who are deeply concerned about the idea of giving this as of right to workers.  The Minister likes to see himself as a leader of opinion &mdash; as we all do &mdash; and not a follower.  I hope in the course of this debate he may be able to do what he said he wishes to do as quickly as he can, and perhaps we could bring the industry with us.</P>
    <P>If we are to establish the principle of worker trustees in the Bill, perhaps we should allow a longer timescale of, say, five years or ten years in which it would be implemented.  The FIE expressed their fears about this to me and to the Minister publicly.  They believe it interferes with an area which up to now had been voluntary. I would not have a great deal of sympathy with that fear.  There are many industries that have had worker trustees for a long time and they worked extremely well.  What I accept as valid is their view that where there has been no tradition of this co-operation, and where there has been no shared experience in the development of a pensions scheme, to give that right overnight to a set of <Col N="634" /> employees may not lead to the most harmonious development of a co-operative approach, or even a realistic approach, to the development of a pension scheme.</P>
    <P>I suggest we adopt a more extended period than that suggested by the pensions board of, say, five years or eight years when pension schemes would have the experience of sharing information over a number of years, of studying the reports, of developing knowledge and of realising &mdash; this appears to be the concern of employers &mdash; that it would become an industrial relations battlefield, which is something nobody wishes to see.  The pensions board and the industry are concerned about that and I hope the employees would be similarly concerned. I can see that it might cause concern if it becomes one of these rights that some of the most macho shop stewards might be heading towards and they could find themselves out of place.  We can get to know the system better by extending the courtship period of five to eight years during which time they could share the information more fully and study the reports.  The workers would begin to realise that they did not need a macho individual looking after their interests, but what they needed was somebody with particular skills and knowledge in the mathematics area who was willing to give the time to study enormously boring reports on investments, unless they had ambitions to be another JR. Essentially, it would be a very mundane hard working activity with very little glamour associated with it.</P>
    <P>In time it would be possible to appoint member trustees to achieve our desired objective in an atmosphere where a shared view would be developed.  So far, where member trustees have existed it has been on a voluntary basis, on the basis of a developing tradition in an industry, and invariably it has been successful. That is the single greatest reassurance we could give employers. The challenge should be to provide leadership in this area and we should not be slow to do so.</P>
    <P>In Britain, they have faced the issue of equal treatment; in fact, they have gone <Col N="635" /> further, perhaps, than is sensible in so far as they do not allow any actuarial distinctions between men and women. They have provided for full equal treatment in the context of the maximum interpretation of all EC legislation.  We should not be out of step with our partners in Europe on this issue even though the law has allowed it.  I know the law has outstripped the directive.  I am aware the Minister is anticipating the new directive and he will have to make changes in the future; if he does not deal with equality and member trustees he is leaving it open to make changes in the future.  He should move at least as far as the National Pensions Board's recommendations.  If he adopted that approach he would have a lot less to do in a future Bill.</P>
    <P>The legal uncertainty is caused by both EC and national legislation.  Where there is any conflict, EC law supersedes. Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome requiring equal pay for equal work is the Article of most concern.  It is very difficult for trustees to operate in an atmosphere of legal uncertainty.  It is essential that that issue be dealt with.  It also would be immensely valuable, and would be a great improvement, if the issue of member trustees was also taken on board.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the sections of the Bill with which I am in broad agreement and, perhaps, make some general points on other areas and issues which I would like the Minister to clarify when he replies to the debate.  Part I deals with preliminary and general provisions of the Bill while Part II deals with the establishment of the pensions board.  In Part I, there will be an interest in some of the definitions.  Some areas are very complex and it is hard for lay people to come to terms with &ldquo;defined contribution scheme&rdquo;, &ldquo;defined benefit scheme&rdquo;, &ldquo;long service benefit&rdquo; and &ldquo;funded scheme&rdquo;.  Those are issues which we will examine, and would be more appropriate to a Committee Stage debate.  Much of this legislation will be implemented by regulations and again we will have our standard debate on the positive and negative regulations.  It is vital to have some indication of the Minister's thinking in <Col N="636" /> relation to the regulations under the sections as we advance through the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is mainly for technical reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has proved that to us before.  The industry has been most concerned about the sections in Part I dealing with expenses.  The expenses may be paid by the Minister out of the funds of the Oireachtas but section 25 also provides that they may be charged to individual funds by way of levy to the board.  There is concern in the industry in relation to this because it is open-ended. Consider the experience of schemes in other countries where boards are in operation.  We have a certain advantage here where we operate in a better situation than that of many of our European colleagues who are faced with state schemes which to them are a problem from the point of view of future funding.  We should be grateful for the general healthy state of our occupational pension schemes and we should not overburden them.</P>
      <P>I would like to know whether the Minister intends to put the whole burden of the cost of the establishment, staffing and general work of the pensions board on the industry.  What is his thinking here? He has given himself a provision to pay it out of Exchequer funding.  Britain has an enormous board who employ a large number of people and are fully funded by the state.  The Canadian experience is of very large, highly policed boards.  It would be of great interest to the industry to know the Minister's thinking in this area, to ensure that a very costly bureaucratic additional burden is not imposed as a result of the new demands under this legislation.  There is concern that the cost will be open-ended and virtually a blank cheque particularly in the light of experience in other countries.  The Minister might clarify that in his reply to this Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II provides for the establishment of a pensions board.  This is a very welcome development.  There may be those who think an advisory board might be <Col N="637" /> better because of maximum participation of the industry, but it seems to me that a statutory board represents the only logical way to go about it.  We welcome the functions as envisaged and there is a possibility of giving them additional functions. There is concern in regard to the chief executive's relationship with the board.  The Irish Association of Pension Funds are concerned that the chief executive of the board should have sufficient independence and clearly delegated functions to ensure that we will not have critical situations awaiting meetings of boards etc. before they are adequately responded to.  I ask the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the question of costs in relation to the establishment of the board.  There has been some representation with regard to membership but by and large the membership as proposed seems to be reasonable.  Very large boards can become unworkable.  I am interested in the fact that the Minister is going to establish this board which probably will be composed largely of people who were on the previous board, and he is going to refer back to them some of the problems on which they have already given him advice.  Will he take their advice next time?  It seems he has not taken their advice on this occasion.  Most of the provisions of this Part are fairly standard, but there is concern about the open-ended nature of the funding arrangement.</P>
    <P>Part III is, I suppose, the heart of the Bill and is very welcome.  It raises issues for some workers and it brings a major change into the operation of and the approach to pension schemes.  Many people looked on their pension scheme as a means of savings they might call upon at any time, and there was concern about this among workers.  Much of that concern has been allayed by the fact that it will not be retrospective and contributions made up to the passing of the Bill will continue to be cashable and will not be, as the workers tend to refer to it, frozen but will have future application. In principle, we support the Minister's <Col N="638" /> approach to the pensions board in this area.</P>
    <P>We could consider some of the detail. No age start-up point is suggested here. There may be some argument for having an age below which the provision does not operate, perhaps at an early stage of employment where there is maximum mobility, perhaps up to 30 years of age. That seems reasonable and from that age one can provide reasonably for one's retirement because there are sufficient years to make a decent provision.  Has the Minister given thought to that?  It might be the answer to some of the concerns about this issue.  It is important to protect certain people against themselves particularly when they wish to cash their pensions and where they have had long service.  We hear even of people at 50 cashing their pensions and, as has been said, handing back so much because they themselves provided a tiny portion and the proportion is often close to 2 : 1 being provided by the employer and effectively they are handing away an enormous sum of money, thus leaving themselves open to the need for State provision ultimately. Therefore, they need protection against themselves and on behalf of the State.  If they get back only a fraction of what they have earned they are effectivley saving for the employer at all stages.  At the early stages of the scheme one might not feel too concerned about that, but for people who have been paying for decades it is close to tragedy and a great folly unlesss it is done in some absolute crisis when such action might seem valid at the time of the cashing in.</P>
    <P>In relation to years of service, the Minister differs in his proposals from the National Pensions Board in that he has opted for the full five years in each case rather than the reducing years for those over a certain age.  Will he explain why he has opted for that lesser provision?  In Britain the legislation has been in place for some time and there they have brought the years from which one can qualify down from five to two.  Does that not indicate that he might come back to this issue very quickly?  I ask the Minister to give some consideration to adopting <Col N="639" /> the strict recommendations of the board in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the context of transfer benefits and the revaluation of preserved benefits, there have been some differences in the Minister's approach and that of the pensions board.  The Minister's proposal is somewhat the less generous.  I have had a view from the industry that this is about what the industry can bear.  Perhaps it is a reasonable proposal.  In the general approach to the Bill the Minister may have got it about right but I would like to hear more details of his reason for moving away from the board's recommendation in that area given that in the board we had broad representation of viewpoints in the area as a whole.</P>
    <P>The section as framed is not very clear as to when revaluations will take place and whether they will take place at the same time.  That point has probably been made directly to the Minister by representatives of the industry and I expect he will respond on Committee Stage.  While the Minister is allowing for improvement in the scale of benefit by indicating that improvement in the amount of benefit should not have a restrospective effect, the industry says the Bill does not deal with improvement in the quality of benefits.  It is not clear whether there will be retrospection in respect of the quality of benefits.  It would involve sudden increases in liabilities for schemes if this point were not clarified.</P>
    <P>There is also concern in relation to section 35.  The current practice in regard to pension schemes is that where a person has defrauded the board or owes money it can be recovered.  Section 35 seems to give an absolute right to the full transfer value of a preserved pension, regardless of that sort of thing.  The Minister might address that valid point.</P>
    <P>We broadly support the funding proposals, which are very much in line with the proposals of the board.  Over a period of time they will bring about a radical transformation of pension schemes.  Current practice varies greatly and it is open to schemes to make provision as they see fit.  Self-regulation of the industry has led to great improvements and the operation <Col N="640" /> of new accounting practices.  The biggest problem in the past was that while an employer could make a promise there was no legal requirement on him to fund that promise.  That remains the position until this legislation becomes law.  Persons can have an expectation about a pension but there is no legal obligation on the employer to make ample provision. Many firms do not make such provision. For example, American companies in their tax break period often do not make provision for pensions during that ten years.  After the ten years they will make full provision.  There will be major changes for companies like that and they will be required to phase in the new system.  Companies may last for 12 or 14 years but some may not.  The Bill will regularise this area and establish minimum standards.  In conjunction with the disclosure of information, this will provide greater protection for members and trustees who have been educated.  It will also provide a general standard for all pension schemes, including those which may be run less favourably for members.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with disclosure of information. The success of this part of the Bill will perhaps decide its effectivenes. There is a lot of interest in trusteeship but there will have to be a good deal of education for members and trustees if they are to take advantage of the information. The area is very complex, as those of us who have had to study it in the past few months are aware.  We have not had to look at actuarial valuations and investment portfolios, which will be the day-to-day work of trustees.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is to achieve its objective, it is important that employers, employees and trade unions appreciate its potential. Many trade unions are already educating their members in respect of pension schemes and employers have been sending their employees on training courses. It is important that this process should accelerate.  The only reference in the Bill relates to the requirement to train trustees.  I hope a substantial number of member trustees will be trained as a result of this Bill, so that they will not be dependent on the paternalism or good <Col N="641" /> will of a company.  We in this country have a strange fear of worker democracy which is somewhat akin to that of Margaret Thatcher, although she has her own particular angle which is not easily categorised. Our fear of worker democracy is very much out of step with the feelings of our European colleagues who take it for granted.  The kind of debate engendered here about member trustees would be unthinkable in other parts of Europe. We have to push the matter further along the road in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The impact of this Bill will depend on members or trustee members studying and understanding the information which will be available on an annual basis.  If this does not happen there will be no increase in protection.  People must be vigilant and must police things themselves. If the National Pensions Board were to police every scheme on an annual basis enormous resources would be required.  There are 25,000 schemes, all of which will be registered with the National Pensions Board.  One can only imagine the level for staff required to assess these schemes individually.  Of course that would be the wrong approach.  It will be a matter of dealing with queries and problems that arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister might indicate exactly how the board will operate.  It will be important for members and member trustees to be in a position to spot problems and call on the board if necessary to use the substantial powers given in this Bill.  If this is not all in place we could have major changes on paper which would not make a great deal of difference and we would still have the crooks and the rogues and maybe just people making unwise or careless decisions.  If people are not still to be open to the consequences of disasters caused by them and suffer huge personal losses, the powers in this Bill must be given substance by people getting involved, getting trained and informing themselves.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to trustees, apart from the issue of member trustees, are very welcome.  Sections 61 and 62 of the Bill allow for the Pension Board to <Col N="642" /> deal with situations such as the H. Williams case where the members themselves had to sue the trustees in an attempt to have them sacked and replaced.  That is to be welcomed because it deals with an issue that was identified as a problem following recent unfortunate experiences.  It represents a significant improvement on the present situation in terms of protecting members against negligent, non-existent and non-performing trustees.</P>
    <P>I have dealt substantially with the equal treatment area.  I indicated that there were problems with both European and Irish law.  Most of our own pension schemes here have changed.  The pension scheme in this House changed, luckily, very soon after I arrived in the House, to take into account the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act and ensure that there was equal treatment.  It is unfortunate that having responded in that way for ourselves we have not enshrined that principle in the Bill.  I hope we will see progress on that.  I am concerned that the Bill declares unequal treatment illegal but does not enshrine the principle I just spoke of.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other minor issues that I think it is useful to raise with the Minister so as to get his response and possibly have them incorporated in the Bill.  One is the issue of costs and whether proposals adopted in Britain to reduce costs should be adopted here.  Could the Minister be involved in any way in assisting industry-wide pension schemes or in the pooling of arrangements for providing pensions which would facilitate movement within industries?  This exists substantially within the public sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt rather globally with the fact that the public sector schemes are excluded from many of the provisions of the Bill.  I am concerned that arrangements for transferability in the public sector are not as good as what is being provided in this Bill.  I would like the Minister to respond to that in some detail before we cheerfully exclude all those sectors from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to disclosure of information, I wonder if all of those areas are <Col N="643" /> adequately provided with information as required.  Before we exclude all those sectors, I would like to have a closer look and be a little more reassured.  Only in the last few days I had correspondence from one of our own Front Bench Members relating to a person who, had he transferred from the area he was in to a certain area, his pension would have been fully transferable, but if he transferred to another area it would not.  We should look at that sort of situation a little more closely before we say that there is no need to apply the provisions of this Bill to any sector of the public service.  If the principle of cashing in on pensions is established in the private sector, should we not also be maintaining similar principles in the public sector?  I have not had time to look comprehensively at the area of transferring or cashing pensions but I would like to come back to it again in more detail later since it seems that the Minister is proposing to exclude most of the public sector pension schemes from many of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Eagle Star made a useful point in relation to the self-employed, although it is largely a tax treatment point.  They are excluded from some of the provisions of the Bill.  However, we are producing a major Pensions Bill and we should ensure that we are adequately dealing with the issue of the self-employed.</P>
    <P>There is also concern about the speed with which this Bill is moving through the House.  It is not that I have any objection to that, but we should be assured that we will have time to seek variations and clarifications and to allow the industry to come to terms with what is proposed.</P>

      <P>After long delays we finally have the legislation and the industry are concerned about having to make financial provisions for it by 1991.  It is all happening very rapidly.  If the new board are established and there is sufficient consultation with them, these problems can be got over, provided the Minister listens to the board more intently than he <Col N="644" /> listened to the last board, because much of the detail of the Bill will be worked out in regulations.  If the industry are sufficiently involved the problems can be overcome.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by broadly welcoming major portions of the Bill.  I regret that the Minister has moved away from the recommendations of the National Pensions Board of bringing together all the groups and anticipating the problems in advance.  In moving away from those recommendations the Minister has, in Fine Gael's view, moved away from having the kind of Bill that we could have wholeheartedly supported.  The Minister indicated a willingness to look at one of the areas.  In relation to the other area he has told us that his heart is in the right place and that it was a question of timing. We would like to move a bit faster on that.  Then there are the multifarious areas of detail that we will look at on Committee Stage.  Subject to the reservations I mentioned, we will support Second Stage of the Bill and we will look at the amendments at a later stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to say that the Labour Party welcome the Bill as a step towards the provision of a comprehensive pension entitlement for everybody at work in Ireland.  It is a major legislative step, involving a Bill with 80 sections, and three schedules accompanied by 47 pages of ministerial introduction and 14 pages of explanatory memorandum.  This puts it in the area of complex legislation, to say the least.  We have been calling for the introduction of these provisions for many years and for that reason we welcome the Bill.  I was pleased to hear from the Minister that it is his intention to introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage. Indeed, while the Labour Party will support the Bill on Second Stage we will be seeking the Minister's support for a number of amendments to strengthen the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with the preservation of benefits, minimum funding standards, disclosure of information in relation to schemes, trustees of schemes and the <Col N="645" /> important concept of equal treatment for men and women in occupational pension schemes.  In his lengthy speech the Minister referred to the need for equal treatment. He told us that while he would like to introduce everything on an equal footing immediately he must await further directives from the Community and I am glad he will be in a position to introduce regulations to take account of further directives.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill it is important to point out that it falls a long way short of providing an adequate level of pension entitlement to people at work.  For instance, the Bill covers only certain categories of employees.  It does not cover the self-employed, farmers or several other categories and it will not do anything to improve the lot of many elderly people at present living on very inadequate incomes.  The Bill does not make it compulsory for all employers to establish occupational schemes and, therefore, it will not extend the coverage of such schemes across the board.</P>
    <P>The Bill is deficient in many respects, particularly in regard to the self-employed who at present depend on non-contributory means-tested pensions. That means that many of them exist in poor circumstances and must subject themselves to the odium of means-testing. The introduction of self PRSI is a step in the right direction but even those in that category, particularly widowed farmers who have disclosed income tax numbers and proved that they are not subject to income tax, have not received any response from the relevant authority, whether it is the Department of Social Welfare or the Revenue Commissioners. Those people should be brought into the net so that they can benefit under the ten year period of contributions clause.</P>
    <P>The pension arrangements for the self-employed, and those in non-pensionable employment, are covered in section 23 (5) (a) and (6) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  There have been many disputes with the Revenue Commissioners in <Col N="646" /> aggregating the amount of qualifying premiums. Basically, they are tax benefits in that they are written off as expenditure but, as the Minister said, those tax incentives to the self-employed amount to investments in the future.</P>
    <P>We are concerned that in addition to the sections dealing with the self-employed &mdash; I am referring to small business people because those owning large concerns are able to look after themselves &mdash; we should deal with the poor people in our community, particularly the elderly people who are living on inadequate incomes.  It is our hope that on Committee Stage we will take account of those problems.  It is only to be expected that a Bill which took such a long time to prepare should have some deficiencies but, with co-operation from all sides, we will iron them out on Committee Stage.  I have no doubt that when the Bill leaves this House it will have been greatly improved.</P>
    <P>For many years the Labour Party's policy was that there should be a single national pensions scheme providing an adequate standard of living for all our citizens aged 65 years and over.  Deputies will recall that it was the late Deputy Frank Cluskey who was the first Minister to reduce the pension age, from 70 to 66 years and I hope it will fall further.  I note the Minister's remark that people who are 30 years of age now could look forward to at least 15 years retirement with good health.  We have always advocated that citizens aged 65 years and over should be paid an adequate pension. There are approximately 500,000 people of pensionable age in Ireland and that represents a substantial proportion of the population.  The number is increasing annually.  Life for many elderly people is often characterised by inadequate income, poor housing conditions, increasing loneliness and isolation.</P>
    <P>The spending patterns of elderly people are characteristically often marked by a much higher proportion of expenditure on necessities like food, fuel and housing and are higher than the rest of the community.  It ought to be one of the main characteristics of our society <Col N="647" /> that elderly people should be entitled to live their lives with the same dignity as any other citizen, without the need for institutional care and in an atmosphere of comfort and security.  Our elderly people have earned their right to a retirement free from financial worry and hardship. An adequate income is the most basic requirement if elderly people are to have normal and happy lives.</P>
    <P>The first priority of any society must be to substantially increase the basic level of pension.  There must be a commitment to maintaining the subsequent relationship betwen the basic pension and other incomes and consumer prices, whichever gives rise to the larger increases.  That concern for the right to dignity of the elderly has never been a marked characteristic of our society, Christian though our society proclaims itself to be.  Many politicians operate on the principle that the voting patterns of old people are fixed and that, therefore, their needs can be disregarded whenever choices have to be made.  In the past few years in particular the elderly have suffered disproportionately from cutbacks in social welfare &mdash; a feature of the policies of the Government and their predecessors &mdash; and cutbacks in health.  We have had the closure of long-stay hospital beds, day care facilities and sub-acute hospitals.  In many hospitals day care centre facilities have been extended arising from the premature closure of sub-acute hospitals. It is the old people who suffer from the loss of services.  We have had cutbacks in the transport and ambulance services and that has made life intolerable for our old people.  We have extended free travel to people but we have removed the services that would enable them to avail of it.  Bus Éireann express buses stop in towns and in a number of villages but generally speaking, people living in rural Ireland who qualify for free transport cannot use those buses.</P>
    <P>We all know of instances of old people who suffer because they are alone and frightened and who do not have the £10 to visit the out-patients' department of a hospital or the transport to bring them there even if they qualified for free care. <Col N="648" /> It often arises from the pride of that generation who will not admit they are suffering hardship and who often neglect themselves.  There have been cutbacks in the free fuel scheme and a shortening of the period during which an allowance is made for heating.  Earlier today we discussed how the weather affected the heating period for which an allowance is given.  The Minister confirmed today that he would not accede to a request to extend those periods.  Cutbacks right across the board have affected the quality of life of old people and we must have regard to this when we are discussing legislation which proposes the establishment of a pensions board.</P>
    <P>One of the meanest cutbacks in recent times has been in the library service, one which many old people depend on and benefit from.  There has been an assault on the rights and dignity of elderly people over the last number of years and this Bill does little or nothing to redress the imbalance.  The Bill is intended to cater for and to protect the rights of people of pensionable age in future.  In debating this Bill we should recognise the harm done to our elderly people over the last few years.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Bill are welcome but it should go a great deal further.  For instance, the Bill proposes the establishment of a National Pensions Board on a statutory basis.  To some extent, this is an extension of the board established by former Labour Party Minister, Deputy Desmond, when he was Minister for Health and Social Welfare from 1983 to 1987.  It is important that the board should be established on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>One of the terms of reference of the board is to advise the Minister on pension matters and standards for schemes.  I hope the Minister's first instruction to the board will be to carry out an in-depth survey of the schemes in operation at present with a view to drawing up a report regarding the minimum standards that should be applied.  We all know of occupational pension schemes where benefits have been good because the scheme was placed on a secure footing by proper <Col N="649" /> financial planning and management. There are also schemes which provide derisory benefits and which have been underfunded to the point of collapse because the enterprise with which they were associated got into trouble.  Thankfully, these cases were brought to the notice of the public by the media.  The legislation in regard to employers' and employees' insolvency, which was retrospective to 1985, although it addressed itself to many areas of workers' rights did not properly address their right to pension funding.  The collapse of certain firms brought home to all the disadvantages of not having proper control or supervision over the various schemes operated by some private sector employers.  I am glad that the Government addressed some of the consequences of these collapses and I hope the Minister will ask the board to look at some of the existing schemes to ensure that they are properly run.</P>
    <P>Some of these schemes operate within the public service although the vast majority are in the private sector.  In the forestry area of the public service contributory pensions for workers were index-linked to social welfare payments on retirement.  As the social welfare pension increased in various budgets or Social Welfare Bills, the payment from the forestry service was reduced accordingly. However, that anomaly was addressed some years ago but it is an example of the inadequate schemes which had been in operation.  It is very unusual for the benefits in a private sector scheme to be index-linked so that the people who pay throughout their working lives can be fully protected from the ravages of inflation following their retirement.  Many private sector schemes offer only fixed pensions which are gradually whittled away until they become virtually worthless.  I hope that the new National Pensions Board will highlight the need for properly funded and managed schemes which will provide a realistic level of benefit to enable people to retire with dignity after a lifetime of work and contributing to the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> In the long term the community must face up to the need for a national pensions plan.  I recall two Green Papers published on the subject, one dealt with a national income-related scheme and was published in October 1976; the other dealt with social insurance for the self-employed and was published in January 1978.  Both these Green Papers raised the possibility of a single unified pensions plan to cover everybody.  They clearly recognised that such a plan would be expensive and would become even more expensive as the number of old people became larger, but it is impossible to put a price tag on a dignified and secure retirement.  Workers will have regard to this in the payment of contributions and those with responsibility in the area of social welfare &mdash; like the Minister &mdash; will also recognise that people have a right to dignity and security in retirement.</P>
    <P>I hope that in time this Bill will be seen as a stopgap but also as a stepping stone on the road to universal coverage by means of proper pension arrangements for the whole community.  Some steps have already been taken.  A few moments ago I referred to the extension of PRSI to the self-employed.  This is a most important step and will remove some of the anomalies in the existing scheme which meant that people, through a legal mechanism, could qualify for a social welfare pension and still enjoy all the perks of their normal standard of living.  This practice was unacceptable to the sectors paying for these benefits through PRSI contributions for most of their working lives.</P>
    <P>In the short term the extension of PRSI to the self-employed was seen as a means of providing revenue to the Exchequer. However, the Exchequer will have to face up to its responsibilities in return for the contributions received.  In overall terms the provision of proper pension arrangements must be seen as an instrument in combating poverty.</P>
    <P>Many of us tend to regard poverty as an urban problem, more typically associated with low-income, large families.  While it is true to say that a great deal of the hard, grinding poverty &mdash; a reality in this <Col N="651" /> country &mdash; is associated with that type of family, I can assure the Minister that it is not confined to the urban community or to large families.  Poverty is to be found also in isolated country farms in rural areas, in the homes of many couples who have retired from small businesses. People in many of these isolated rural areas do not even have the privilege of running water, bathroom or toilet facilities, some &mdash; even nowadays &mdash; being without electricity; they still use candles, paraffin oil lamps, the old iron in the fire, the cake on the griddle.  That is the type of scene still prevailing in County Tipperary, the Golden Vale and the land of honey.</P>
    <P>Many such farms and businesses never generated sufficient resources in order to provide for old age.  Many people have been forced to work long beyond an age others would accept as appropriate for retirement.  Such people had never been in a position to save sufficient money to provide comfort in their retirement while retaining enough to live in any degree of comfort during their working lives.  It is an indictment of all of us that many people in rural areas work seven days a week for long hours into a great age.  I know they are happy in their work but nonetheless they are unable to generate sufficient to provide for themselves in their old age when they become a burden on the State services which have been decimated by cutbacks, particularly in the health area.</P>
    <P>We will never come to grips with this aspect of poverty without a national pensions scheme, funded and managed properly with considerable input on the part of the State.  It is for that reason principally we welcome the introduction of this Bill, recognising that the State has a major role to play in this area, particularly that of looking after its older citizens who have given a lifetime of service in order to generate a living for all of us.</P>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with some of the provisions of the Bill and make some general points.  The first Part of the Bill deals with the establishment of a pensions board.  It is our belief that the Minister should reserve at least three places on <Col N="652" /> that board for nomination by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I note it is the intention that members of the board will be representative of interests involved in occupational pension schemes.  Surely nobody has more experience of their operation than the people who pay into such schemes week after week?  I contend that their representatives should be guaranteed a significant input into the operations of the proposed pensions board.  In addition, I should like to see this pensions board have the powers and functions of an ombudsman, in particular that they would have power to report their findings to the Houses of the Oireachtas, issue reports on wider or individual schemes or in relation to particular aspects of schemes which may concern them.  Above all, we must be absolutely satisfied that the pensions board will be allocated sufficient staff to undertake the duties assigned to them. Deputy Flaherty correctly drew attention to the tremendous task involved.  In setting up the pensions board it is our hope that the Minister will ensure they are allocated sufficient funding and staff to carry out the role assigned them under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The standard funding provisions of this Bill are absolutely vital, ensuring that actuarial certificates are supplied to the board, to enable them to ascertain whether individual schemes satisfy those proposed funding standards at any given time.  If these new rules or standards are observed the pensions board will be inundated with actuarial certificates.  They will have to be properly equipped by way of staff and resources if they are to adequately monitor the operations of these standards.  The most rigorous provisions will not have a satisfactory effect if the pensions board are unable to keep abreast of the information being provided to them or, equally, if they are unable to chase employers who may be slow, if not recalcitrant, in providing such information.</P>
    <P>Parts V and VI of the Bill deal with disclosure of information in relation to occupational pension schemes, trustees of such schemes and their duties.  A major <Col N="653" /> weakness of such schemes is that nowhere is it stipulated who should be a trustee of such a scheme.  I contend that at least one-third of the trustees of all schemes should be directly accountable to and representative of workers in enterprises operating such occupational pension schemes.  I can understand some employers reservations about that concept. It is the view of the Labour Party that this direct accountability to workers' representatives &mdash; who are, after all, the main contributors to and beneficiaries of such schemes &mdash; is essential.  Such accountability must be the responsibility of employees' representatives, leading to a better understanding of companies' finances and of difficulties that might arise in the case of some companies wanting to operate such a scheme.  We will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage with the objective of ensuring that a significant number of trustees of occupational pension schemes are so representative.  It is our view that people at work not only have a right to be involved in the management of their pension schemes but also that the State and employers have a duty to ensure that everybody is properly involved and represented. If we begin on that basis &mdash; in the composition of the pensions board and trustees &mdash; we will be on the right road to achieving harmony in this area, thereby obviating any industrial disputes or concern about adequacy of funding in the future.</P>
    <P>I want to enter a caveat in relation to the provision for equal treatment of men and women in occupational pension schemes.  We have had experience of equal treatment in the past, experience of the manner in which inadequate application of an important principle can cause significant damage.  There are two ways in which to secure equal treatment for men and women in occupational pension schemes.  The first is to equalise the benefits of schemes downwards; that is one option, which is what happened to some extent when equal treatment of social welfare benefits was introduced. We discovered then that many men's <Col N="654" /> positions were worsened in order to bring them into line with the position obtaining in regard to many women.  The provisions of this Bill should render any such equalisation explicit.  When replying I should like confirmation from the Minister that all equalisation will be aimed at improving women's benefits rather than deteriorating benefits for men, so that the net effect will be equalisation upward rather than downward, as happened previously.</P>
    <P>We welcome the provisions of this Bill in so far as they go.  We will be supporting its Second Reading and hope to strengthen it by way of amendment on Committee Stage.  We do not view it as the complete answer to the alleviation of poverty among elderly, retired people. Neither do we view it as an assurance, in itself, that elderly people will always be treated with the dignity they deserve. Nonetheless we view it as a step forward in the protection of working people and the preservation of their future right to an adequate income on retirement.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with the Minister in congratulating the National Pensions Board for the brilliant work they have done and I intend to quote liberally from their recommendations. Perhaps when we develop democracy along the proper path civil servants will <Col N="655" /> also advise us of the implications of legislation to come before the House.</P>
      <P>This is a complex Bill and I congratulate the National Pensions Board for the extremely good work they have done in highlighting the need for a Bill such as this.  The figures produced by the Minister show that there are 25,000 occupational pension schemes in existence in Ireland today.  It is quite astounding that they are not co-ordinated, regulated or policed to the degree suggested in this Bill.  At present 550,000 employees, roughly two thirds of the total number in employment, are members of supplementary schemes and it is mind boggling that only now legislation to control and guide these schemes is being introduced.  According to my notes a sum of £6,000 million is involved but the Minister has indicated that the amount involved is £4,000 million higher, making a total of £10,000 million in circulation under the control of pension schemes, with annual income in excess of £500 million.  These are interesting figures. They highlight the need to introduce legislation.  They highlight also the inactivity of previous Governments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said this, The Workers' Party welcome the Pensions Bill, 1990, as we recognise the need for a statutory body to supervise and establish standards for occupational pension schemes.  Far too many workers have found themselves, through no fault of their own, pensionless as a result of the misappropriation or mismanagement, of pension funds by boards of trustees.  Many workers on leaving employment often experience difficulty in preserving or transferring their benefit to new employment but an attempt is made in the Bill to rectify this problem.  None of us wishes to see a repeat of the case involving the employees of the H. Williams group who had their pensions stopped when the company went into liquidation in November 1987.  Nor would any of us wish to see any other group of workers undertake the costly court procedures undertaken by these very same pensioners in seeking their entitlements and also the removal <Col N="656" /> of the board of trustees and their replacement with a board more acceptable to them.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is much in the Bill to recommend it.  It broadly adheres to the recommendations contained in the First and Fourth Reports of the National Pensions Board.  However, the Bill also has its weaknesses and is in need of strengthening. Sections of the Bill need to be amended but we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to explore the thinking behind the Bill and to debate the amendments The Workers' Party intend submitting.</P>
    <P>One of the issues to be addressed is the question of the right of workers to elect to the boards of trustees their own nominees to represent their interests.  The Minister will no doubt be aware that the issue of the member trustees was addressed in the First Report of the National Pensions Board.  The board pointed out at paragraph 3.21, that currently members of pension schemes have no legal right to participate in the appointment of trustees unless this is expressly provided for in the trust deed. They went on to highlight that only a small number of schemes make provision for member participation in the appointment of trustees and said it is argued that the lack of a right for members to participate is a further shortcoming of the present system and that the National Pensions Board, therefore, recognise the shortcomings of the system and argue in favour of representation for workers on boards of trustees.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also be aware that a majority of board members recommended that there should be a statutory right to worker trusteeships in schemes with more than 50 members where at least 50 per cent of the membership are in favour of this.  In such cases they argued that there should be an equal number of member trustees and company trustees with the chairperson being nominated by the employer.  The Minister, unless he is intimidated by the employers, now has the opportunity to accept amendments which would give workers <Col N="657" /> the right to nominate and elect representatives to boards of trustees.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the concern being expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who feel that the omission of any provision for member participation in the appointment of trustees is a fundamental flaw in the Bill and that this must be rectified.  I am sure the Minister is also aware of the statement of the joint president of SIPTU who has stated that the Bill represents a gross betrayal and breach of faith with the trade union movement in not allowing workers to nominate trustees to the boards.</P>
    <P>We are now into the era of national agreements and programmes for national recovery and we are told, regularly that the Minister for Labour and the Government constantly listen to what the trade union movement have to say, constantly hear words of praise for Congress and see the amalgamation of trade unions being encouraged.  The Government have also welcomed the formation of SIPTU and other amalgamations.  However I ask the Minister to give due consideration to the strong words used by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the largest union in the country, SIPTU, and to take on board the amendments which will be submitted by The Workers' Party in an effort to facilitate and accommodate their reservations.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate if he is happy in not giving workers a statutory function or say in the way in which pension funds worth £10 million or more are used.  The Minister would have to agree that workers, being the main contributors to pension schemes, should have a say, as trustees, in the way in which the funds are managed.  I find it very difficult to accept the argument that workers, who are the main contributors by way of their weekly deductions, usually at source, should not be given such a statutory right under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me now refer to the composition of the National Pensions Board.  My argument on the question of worker participation may be expanded to cover the <Col N="658" /> argument that there is insufficient worker and trade union representation on the board as proposed by the Minister, when one considers that the representation of one in eight &mdash; or 12.5 per cent, which is very low &mdash; is even lower than the existing trade union representation of three in 20, or 15 per cent, on the National Pensions Board.  There is no reason the Government should not give full recognition to the rights of workers and their representatives through the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>There are two major contributors to pensions, the employers and the employees, who are ultimately responsible for amassing £10,000 million in pension funds.  The Minister will have to give the trade union movement and the work force due recognition as major and integrated elements in the debate on pensions. The pensions industry, on the other hand which is quite likely to be represented by actuaries or accountants, has two representatives, and the actuarial and accountancy profession will be represented on the board; in other words, half the board will consist of pensions professionals, civil servants will account for a quarter of the membership while employers and employees will have representation of one eighth each.  I am not making the case for the employers &mdash; who are certainly powerful enough to argue their own case &mdash; but since the two major contributors are the employers and the employees, it would seem that they are insufficiently represented on the board.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the penalties for offences.  I cannot accept that a maximum fine of £1,000 under section 3 (3) is a sufficient deterrent for those who wilfully obstruct or refuse to provide information. The least the Minister could do is to consider having the fine of £1,000 indexed, as I feel fines are far too low to act as a real deterrent; in fact they will lose their value unless indexed.</P>
    <P>The Minister might wish to take on board suggestions for improvements to the method he proposes for calculating the criteria for the revaluation of preserved benefits.  As the Minister knows, there is a five year lead in period, of <Col N="659" /> which at least two years occur after the commencement date of the enactment of this Bill, but I think this will lead to anomalies.  If this part of the Bill were to become operative on &mdash; as the Minister has said in his speech &mdash; 1 January 1990, then only people leaving their employment on or after 1 January 1993 will be entitled to have their benefits preserved and those leaving after 1 January 1996 will be entitled to have their benefits revalued in the following years.  I know this is a complex area but I want to put on record that these anomalies are likely to exist and the section will need to be tightened up.  People leaving after 1 January 1993 will be entitled to have their benefits preserved but they will not have them revalued.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the section which deals with revaluations is that there must be at least a year between the time a person leaves their employment and revaluation applies.  This would mean that somebody who was unlucky enough to leave one month after the annual revaluation date will not have their preserved benefits revalued until one year and 11 months later, whereas a person who leaves the day before the revaluation date will only have one year and one day to wait to have their benefits revalued.</P>
    <P>Section 34 enables the trustees of an occupational pension scheme to transfer <Col N="660" /> payments without the consent of the member and this leaves me a little confused. Would the Minister say what circumstances could give rise to such action or why a member's consent would not be sought in the first place?  The National Pensions Board did not recommend that the trustees would have powers to make transfers rather than to preserve benefits without the consent of the members concerned. Many employees, and indeed some employers, have used or abused pension schemes for short-term financial gain.  For example, employers have often used the pension schemes as a way of enticing workers to leave their employment by boosting the redundancy payments, thus facilitating workforce reductions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, concerned at the failure of the Government's policy in several areas of broadcasting, calls on the Government to appoint, without delay, an independent review body comprised of competent and representative personnel to report to the Oireachtas within six months on the future and quality of broadcasting including:</P>
      <P>(1)  The future funding of RTE and alternative national, local and community radio and television services and the effects on the print media.</P>
      <P>(2)  Questions of copyright, performing right, consumer rights, balance, public order and public morality in an era of increased trans-national broadcasting and advertising.</P>
      <P>(3)  The likely impact of foreign based broadcasting and advertising (including direct and indirect satellite services) on the home market in terms of viability, quality and standards; and how to maintain and monitor quality and standards in this era.</P>
      <P>(4)  To report on current concerns relating to alternative national radio and TV, including Irish language services;</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>and to take all reasonable steps to maintain present services pending the report.</P>
      <P>This debate is taking place at a critical time in the affairs of radio and television broadcasting.  It is taking place at a time when the national radio alternative to RTE &mdash; Century Radio &mdash; has well advertised and imminent difficulties.  While this very immediate issue gives great urgency to this debate, it is not the sole reason for it or even the central one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no independent and comprehensive review of broadcasting since 1974.  Since then there has been a veritable revolution in broadcasting and <Col N="664" /> communications technology which puts into an international context many issues which, heretofore, could be judged solely by national criteria.</P>
    <P>However, for radio and for television, there are very distinct issues and challenges but there are also common issues and the most vital of these is the question of funding.  As a significant part of present and future funding depends on advertising, it is clear that the position of the newspapers and the rest of the print media, who also depend on advertising, has to be considered simultaneously. However, what must not happen is for the vital issue of funding to be a rushed and ill-considered job which ends up missing most of its targets and, in the process, does a great deal of damage. This is clearly a danger from the approach of the present Minister who does not appear to know the difference between burlesque and ballet.</P>
    <P>Let me recall that the idea of a national radio alternative and a national television alternative was the Minister's own brainchild. He overruled the advice of his Department and that contained in the Touche Ross report commissioned with my consent by the Interim Local Radio Commission which I appointed when Minister.</P>
    <P>Having acted against all that advice, the Minister then insisted on imposing heavy handed requirements on alternative national and local radio to a commission whose remit has a heavy touch in practice when a light touch would be more appropriate.  These are the factors that are causing difficulties for Century Radio and for many of our local stations.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is contemplating compounding that error by making RTE pay, and by penalising RTE for its major financial success over the past five years, he will be utterly opposed by this side of the House.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that, when I revealed in a speech in Cork on 12 February last that the Minister was planning to divert income from RTE to independent radio, a one line statement was issued on the <Col N="665" /> same day on behalf of the Minister denying my revelation.  He refused to give any press, radio or television interviews.  It will be further recalled on 27 February when at Communications Question Time he again gave misleading information to the House.  By saying so at that time I was wrongly asked to leave the House. Then in the last week of March in Cork the Minister revealed the full accuracy of my assertions when he announced he was going to &ldquo;level the playing pitch&rdquo;.  Again he refused to be interviewed on radio or television.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister tonight to stop hunking and sliding, to stop this slippery approach, to stop running hither and thither, and to come into this House and tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about his intentions.</P>
    <P>What does he mean by &ldquo;levelling the playing pitch&rdquo; and why did he deny his intentions not once but twice?  Who is it he hopes to penalise and who is it he hopes to benefit by his proposals?  Almost four months have elapsed since I first revealed his intentions.  Yet even now with a crisis imminent he has not revealed his hand.  I hope by this motion tonight we have forced the Minister's hand and that he will make some announcement tonight.</P>
    <P>Having criticised the Minister I wish now to offer him some advice.  I ask him to recognise that any attempt to divert income from RTE to the rest of the media in the Republic could end up penalising RTE and benefiting only TV stations based in Belfast or London.  This likelihood becomes greater as the MMDS spreads and as the penetration of the Republic by Northern and satellite stations spreads with it.  To say this is not to cosset RTE nor is it to deny that a serious funding issue exists which impinges both on alternative national and local radio, TV and newspapers.  Quite the contrary, part of RTE's success and their improvements in recent years have been brought about by the presence or promise of competition.</P>
    <P>Century Radio are its only national radio competition.  It would be a disaster <Col N="666" /> for Century and bad for RTE if Century were allowed to collapse.  Clearly Century need changes but, in this their hour of acute difficulties, we in this House should recognise the quality and contribution made this past nine months by their frontline and background staff alike.  Some of the changes necessary are internal to Century, and indeed some have already been made, but many of the changes needed are legislative and administrative if alternative national and local radio is to survive.</P>
    <P>These changes need to be thoroughly and independently considered by an independent review body and this will take some months.  The Minister should announce such a body tonight.  However, clearly some immediate action is required to preserve alternative national radio pending the study.</P>
    <P>Two things need to be done immediately. Confidence needs to be given to the market by: (1)  A declaration by the Government that they are fully committed to maintaining an alternative national radio station in being as a permanent and continuous feature of our broadcasting arrangements.  (2)  The Government to take power by legislation during this session to temporarily borrow from the proceeds of licence fees up to 5 per cent of the annual total of £45 million, that is £2.25 million, and this to be made available, free of interest, to alternative radio to ensure none collapse during the rest of this year, and pending the report.</P>
    <P>This temporary loan is justified by the fact that the Government, in their haste, have made mistakes and imposed excessive requirements on independent radio. These mistakes can be rectified but they can also be compounded.  I stress, therefore, that this loan can only be a once-off payment to help get over teething problems some of which were of the Government's making.  It is purely a temporary expedient pending the report of the review body that I propose. However, if the Minister proposes more fundamental changes in haste without such a review, the chances are that he will compound his earlier errors and will be throwing good money after bad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> The suggestions that either or both Radio 2 or Network 2 TV should be separated from RTE or in some other way be restricted are misguided and totally unacceptable.  They can only be motivated by malice towards RTE.  For the Minister to embark along this route would be detrimental, and could even be disastrous for RTE.  These are considerations which must be objectively and thoroughly considered and it cannot be a matter of ministerial whim.</P>
    <P>There are other options for long-term funding and for future organisation of broadcasting which require independent analysis.  There is the question of the 10 per cent VAT on advertising in the Republic for newspaper, radio and TV advertising.  In other administrations it is zero.  As Minister, I persuaded our Government to reduce it to 10 per cent some years ago.  Perhaps a further concession would now be timely.</P>
    <P>Given the requirement, and it is a requiement, for a network of independent radio stations both national and local as an alternative to RTE, should the introduction of a radio licence be considered in order to fund the public service element of independent radio?  A £1 licence per annum would yield over £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of extending the reception area of Irish radio and TV into other territories especially into Northern Ireland and into Britain.  This is an area where we have not received the co-operation of the UK authorities in the past but which needs much greater emphasis now because, under draft rules from the Council of Europe which the UK supports, cross-Border broadcasting and, as important, cross-Border advertising will be uninhibited.</P>
    <P>Let me say in that respect that during the negotiation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, as the then Minister for Communications I raised this as an issue for discussion in the negotiations for that agreement.  Unfortunately, the British side utterly resisted the idea of the penetration or coverage of the whole of Northern Ireland by RTE and other <Col N="668" /> broadcasting media based in the Republic. That was the case then but it cannot be the case now as the British authorities have spelled out in their own White Paper that they are totally against the restriction of cross-Border broadcasting and advertising in the context of the draft directive from the European Commission and of the paper from the Council of Europe. Therefore, now is the time, when the Anglo-Irish Agreement is under review and when things appear to be happening in Northern Ireland, for us to put it to the British again that if they mean what they say in their own White Paper they should start by allowing RTE, Century Radio and other broadcasting media based in this State to have full coverage in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>These are some of the matters which need to be considered, and the case for a review body is now a strong one.  It will allow all the interest groups to present their case and challenge other cases. Unquestionably, this is an area where there are conflicting interests.  There are conflicting claims and counter claims. There are assertions by one side about another and <i>vice versa</i>.  There are people protecting their own interests, people making plaintive pleas and others making excessive demands.  We need all these arguments to be weighed up carefully. Some of them interact with one another. Some of them contradict one another, but these are things that need to be assessed independently and comprehensively. This will give time for calm analysis and research and will provide a good basis for long-term decisions.</P>
    <P>In the UK the White Paper to which I have already referred was published in November 1988 and is entitled <i>Broadcasting in the 90s: Competition, Choice and Quality</i>.  It followed several reports, and I will name some of them: <i>The Peacock Report</i> a 1986 report on the financing of the BBC; <i>The Future of Broadcasting</i> published in 1988 as a report of the Home Affairs Committee of the Commons; the subscription television report of 1987 done on behalf of the British Government by Communications <Col N="669" /> Studies and Planning International Limited; a White Paper in 1983, <i>The Development of Cable Systems and Services;</i> a Government commission and study of MMDS in Britain by Touche Ross Management Company; a Green Paper entitled <i>Radio: Choices and Opportunities</i> published in 1987; and in 1988, here was another report of the Home Affairs Committee of the Commons on the Government's plans for radio broadcasting.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis of such thorough analysis and debate that the UK decides its broadcasting policy.  It involves prior advice, examination and comments of both Houses of Parliament and the views and contributions of all interest groups together with professional and independent analysis before legislation was introduced.</P>
    <P>In the Republic we can undoubtedly learn to some extent from the UK reports but we have our own distinct issues, opportunities and limitations.  These require debate and independent analysis before the fundamental decisions for the future are made.  I hope the Minister can accept the case for an independent review body tonight and announce their composition speedily.</P>
    <P>This week the Minister must also appoint a new RTE Authority.  I do not say that they should include only people of no known political persuasion &mdash; that would be absurd &mdash; but they should be composed of a team of competent and suitable people who, when necessary, will stand up to the Minister.  They should be a politically balanced Authority if they are to fulfil their role properly.  They should not be like a Fianna Fáil cumann, as in the past, dedicated, in breach of the law, more to the interest of the party than the Authority.</P>
    <P>The retiring Authority were independent, competent and balanced.  They have led RTE to major reorganisation and expansion and to financial soundness. We thank them as they retire, as we ought to thank all those who work in RTE who have brought about this result. It would be poor recompense for them if <Col N="670" /> their very success is now rewarded by being plundered by a Minister motivated either by haste or by hate or both.</P>
    <P>The issue before us is an important one.  If the proposal is accepted it could have a very important influence well into the next century.  Haste is to be avoided.</P>
    <P>Let me say something about the Minister's style.  He is a man who likes to get things done and for that we must admire him.  I concede that he took in hand the whole broadcasting mess when he became Minister a few years ago.  He spoke in 1987 about the prevarication of the previous ten years.  I was determined not to proceed along the lines I was being pushed because I believed they were ill-judged and would not have stood the test of time.  The Minister embraced the idea of a new independent radio station and an independent television station. Neither of these proposals was well-researched or well-founded.</P>
    <P>Following the experience of the past year or so we realise that some mistakes were made.  The Minister should be big enough to take on board this fact and he and the House should learn from those mistakes.  I hope the product of this debate will be that we learn from those mistakes and that we lay a lasting foundation for a vibrant, successful, high quality broadcasting system on radio and television which will have the support of a wide viewership and listenership throughout the Republic and further afield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke) Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit I am amazed at Fine Gael's bringing forward this motion at this time.  After five years of total inactivity while in Government the Members opposite have suddenly woken up.  They have now finally found something to complain about in all the constructive activity and progress on the broadcasting front brought about since Fianna Fáil came back into office.  For five years the combined Opposition parties, when in Government, presided over the most appalling mess in the broadcasting sphere without a mention of a review body that might have helped to point a way <Col N="671" /> out of the morass.  Sixty or 70 illegal broadcasting stations were operating without hindrance.  They did manage to bring a Bill before the House but that was quickly forgotten about as the parties embarked on an ideological dog fight, about the future direction of broadcasting, which they were unable to resolve.</P>
      <P>I ask the House to picture the scene which faced the Fianna Fáil Government when it came into office: total deadlock and disagreement on the terms of legislation required to license legal radio services; a deeply entrenched pirate broadcasting scene which flouted the law with impunity; and major changes were already taking place in the international broadcasting scene which would inevitably impact on Ireland.</P>
      <P>That then is the legacy on broadcasting which I inherited from Deputy Mitchell on taking office as Minister for Communications.  I would earnestly ask this House to weigh that legacy of inactivity and lawlessness on the airwaves against the substantial achievements during my period of office as Minister for Communications.  I will outline those achievements briefly as follows: legislative proposals for the licensing of independent broadcasting services were brought before this House and were enacted; and long-standing legislative proposals for outlawing pirate broadcasting were brought before this House and were enacted; the Independent Radio and Television Commission was set up and started working immediately; pirate broadcasting was effectively ended; legal national and local radio services were introduced, which services now employ approximately 600 people; the first steps were taken towards providing multiple choice in television in areas not covered by cable systems; and a third television channel was franchised and it is due to commence next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say without fear of contradiction that more has been achieved in broadcasting in Ireland in the past three years than in the previous 20 years.  A review group was not needed to point out the mess broadcasting was in in this <Col N="672" /> country just a short few years ago.  It was there for all to see, holding us up to scorn and ridicule both at home and abroad. Unfettered by ideological hang-ups, the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 like the present Government reached for the core of the problem and took quick and effective action.</P>
    <P>Government policy is designed to ensure that Irish broadcasting becomes a growth industry in line with the growth of broadcasting seen in all other European countries.  Government policy is designed to ensure that Irish broadcasting remains the mainstream Irish viewers' and listeners' choice.</P>
    <P>The growth of broadcasting as a sector in Europe is driven by technology and de-regulation. Technology has created new means of distribution, and de-regulation has created the environment by which new services are phased into the marketplace. The EC policies in relation to broadcasting project major growth in European broadcasting as a result of these factors in the nineties.  Expansion and growth of European media is a major element in EC planning for the nineties.</P>
    <P>My primary objective was to put in place the necessary regulatory framework which would allow the Irish public to create their own multiplicity of choice in broadcasting.  I was very much aware that, with the pace of developments in international broadcasting, this was the last significant opportunity an Irish Minister would get to influence in a major way the development of a strong and vibrant Irish broadcasting industry.  Of equal importance was the need to put in place additional sources of news, information and current affairs.  Given the dominance of broadcasting in informing the public, it was central to Government policy to provide the general public with alternative sources of broadcast news and current affairs.</P>
    <P>Other important elements making up Government policy include the creation of permanent secure employment and providing a seedbed for the growth of an independent audio-visual industrial business in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe that we had the talent and <Col N="673" /> the skills to create a major audio-visual industry in Ireland.  What was missing was the home market on which to start the development process.</P>
    <P>A final and I believe vital part of the Government's thinking was the determination that there should be the lightest possible regulatory regime to oversee the new services.</P>
    <P>The Government's measures in relation to broadcasting are in line with the European trend and in advance of many European countries.  The era of national state monopolies is ending in all countries.  Broadcasting monopolies have not within them the dynamic for growth. The demand for growth has come from the consumer.  The transition from State monopolies to a competitive environment in broadcasting is in response to this demand.  It is Government policy to carry out this transition in a planned manner so as to ensure that the totality of Irish broadcasting is strengthened by the introduction of competition and choice.</P>
    <P>The effect of introducing competition in a domestic context will be to create a stronger Irish broadcasting sector. Government policy achieves: new investment into broadcasting; higher productivity; more choice for the viewer and listener; more employment; and growth in the sector.</P>
    <P>A retrospective look at radio in Ireland illustrates the point.  In the early seventies Ireland had a single national radio service. Pirate radio illustrated the consumer demand for more choice.  2FM was launched in response to this demand, although the continued existence of the pirates through the early and mid-eighties demonstrated that it failed to meet the public demand for an alternative source of broadcasting service.  Today the pirate era is over and the legacy is a radio industry that has grown immeasurably since the days of single channel radio.  The listener has more choice and the industry has growth.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that, in the context of <Col N="674" /> television, the ending of a 25-year monopoly will cause short term difficulties for the State broadcaster.</P>
    <P>In the long term, however, the benefits are very real for RTE.  The real threat to Irish broadcasting is from overseas television services.  Domestic competition increases the total output of Irish broadcasting which is the strongest defence against overseas competition.  Competition also improves the quality of broadcasting as has already been witnessed recently in RTE's schedules.</P>
    <P>Increasing the volume and quality of Irish broadcasting is the only long term answer to overseas competition.  It is the Government's view that the combination of increased productivity through improved work practices and new technology, together with increased resources arising from more total air-time being made available to the advertiser, will be the direct result of the introduction of competition.</P>
    <P>Government policy has recognised the reality of major competition to Irish broadcasting looming on the horizon in the form of increased UK and satellite services.  Seen in this light the ending of the State monopoly is viewed not as a choice but the only effective way to ensure the long-term viability and growth of Irish broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Government's decisive action and clear policy objectives have transformed the scene in a very short time.  Following the establishment of the Independent Radio and Television Commission things began to fall into place very quickly. Already we have seen a national radio service and 18 local radio services start broadcasting with three more due to start shortly.  The emergence of a strong local sector in such a short time has been a revelation.  I understand from the commission that a survey undertaken on local stations has revealed that the great majority of them are matching and even exceeding projected advertising revenue. Projected advertising revenue this year to independent stations is estimated to be of the order of £8-£9 million, which is well up to expectations.</P>
    <P>Employment creation arising out of all <Col N="675" /> this activity has also proved very satisfactory with in excess of 600 people now directly employed in the sector.  I might add that more than half of those jobs are in a permanent capacity.</P>
    <P>Of course, as was made clear by Deputy Mitchell, it has not all been plain sailing and indeed, as I recall forecasting in the debate on the 1988 legislation, there are difficulties to be overcome, but the difficulties in this sphere are not confined solely to the independent sector.  To illustrate the point, I would point to the fact that RTE, with all their broadcasting experience, are having their own particular problems with their Atlantic 252 service.  I note that the service is running at a deficit of over £1 million and in his outgoing report the Chairman of the RTE Authority stated that this service would not break even until at least 1991. Because of their size and resources, RTE are able to support this service through a longer than anticipated development phase.  Against this background some of the judgments on the independent broadcasting sector appear to be somewhat harsh and premature.</P>
    <P>While revenue in the independent broadcasting sector has been up to expectations, the fact of the matter is that the public service obligations we, as legislators, imposed on the independent sector under the Radio and Television Act, 1988, have had a particular impact on costs.  In this regard it has left the independent service at a major competitive disadvantage with RTE who are in receipt of broadcasting licence fees as well as advertising and other commercial promotion revenue.</P>
    <P>The 20 per cent news and current affairs is just one example of the public service obligations we imposed on the independent sector &mdash; an obligation I might add which does not apply to RTE's 2FM which is the main competing service. I believe it was right and appropriate to insert such a requirement because it was the shared view of this House that we wanted something more than wall-to-wall popular music on the new services. There was a clear wish that they should contribute to plurality and choice in the <Col N="676" /> sources of news and information available to the public, which is a critical element in any democratic society. Experience has clearly shown that meeting such an obligation does not come cheaply, particularly if it is to be done in a professional and competent manner. While revenue has been in general higher than projected, the costs of the public service obligations have been far higher than anticipated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to some points he had made in January and February. I want to emphasise that the proposals, combined with the way they have now crystalised, were put forward only after indepth consideration in recent weeks.  This is evidence that the accusations made against me some time ago by Deputy Mitchell to the effect that I misled the House in relation to proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No such proposals had been developed or formulated at the time Deputy Mitchell made his accusation. Indeed, in so far as I began to develop ideas on the issue after that time, initially they went in a different direction to the ones I have brought forward tonight.  I make this point not with any wish to bring rancour into this debate tonight but only to reflect on the seriousness with which I view his accusation, which, of course, is one of the most serious accusations which can be levelled against a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided that some adjustments need to be made with respect to the sources of income available to the broadcasting sector as a whole.  The licence fee is made available to RTE to meet their public service obligations.  The Government, therefore, consider it appropriate that a proportion of this licence fee revenue <Col N="677" /> should be made available to the Independent Radio and Television Commission in order to enable their services meet their public service obligations under the Radio and Television Act, 1988.  In the legislation, I have in mind allocating a portion of the proceeds of the licence fee within a defined ceiling to the IRTC.  Under that proposal the amount which would be made available to the IRTC for disbursement would be of the order of £3 million in 1990.</P>
    <P>Under legislative provisions which I will be presenting to the House within the next few days, this sum will be paid to the Independent Radio and Television Commission to enable them to support the establishment and operation of sound broadcasting services and the new television service provided for in the 1988 Act.  In this connection it will be the duty of the commission to prepare and publish criteria to be used in determining the disbursements to be made to the services in question.  I want to emphasise that the commission will be totally and absolutely independent of Government in their decisions as to disbursements to any service. In determining their criteria they shall take into account a number of factors including in particular the public service requirements of the 1988 Act.</P>
    <P>A number of additional measures will be provided for in the legislation, not all, I might add, directly related to matters affecting independent broadcasting services. Among the provisions proposed are the following: to take power by order, subject to positive resolution in the Houses of the Oireachtas, to cap RTE's advertising revenue &mdash; although I do not intend seeking to exercise that power in the immediate future at least; greater control over codes of practice relating to advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion on both RTE's and the independent broadcasting sector's services; right of the proposed TV3 service to supplement the cable and MMDS modes of transmission with a conventional UHF transmission system; <Col N="678" /> an extension of the ambit of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, primarily to enable certain obligations in relation to the &ldquo;Right of Reply&rdquo; under a recently adopted EC Directive on Broadcasting Activities to be transparently fulfilled; and a series of measures to cope with problems affecting the cable and MMDS industries such as interception of service and damage to systems.</P>
    <P>Apart from these legislative measures, I mentioned earlier that the main rationale for the development of RTE's Radio 2 &mdash; or 2FM as it is now known &mdash; in the late seventies was to respond to the demand being manifested by the pirate stations then in existence.  Apart from the fact that it is questionable whether that service actually responded to the real need at the time &mdash; which was for alternative services as much as for a popular music station &mdash; it is certainly questionable at this time, given the major developments and alternatives available in broadcasting, as to whether its current format represents the best use of what is, in effect, a scarce and valuable national resource.</P>
    <P>In this regard, it is considered that there is a whole area of broadcasting &mdash; closer to the primary public service broadcasting mission of RTE &mdash; which is not being adequately catered for at this time.  I have in mind, for instance, the area of education and the contribution that broadcasting can make there &mdash; for example, in the field of continental languages which is particularly important as we approach 1992 and also indeed in respect of the Irish language because, notwithstanding the excellent service provided by Radio na Gaeltachta, their primary focus is to serve the population of the Gaeltachtaí as distinct from the more general public whose grasp of the language may be limited but who nevertheless have a strong affinity with it.</P>
    <P>Other areas which are poorly catered for would include the rural and farming sectors, business and trade union affairs, social welfare and social affairs advice and information as well as a range of special interest and specialist music areas.  The Government have, therefore, <Col N="679" /> decided to ask the new RTE Authority, as a matter of priority, to develop plans for an alternative use of the 2FM network which will be more in keeping with the public service mandate of RTE.</P>
    <P>To revert briefly to the legislative proposals, it will be noted that the emphasis of the approach being adopted relates to the use of licence fee revenue as against going for an immediate curb on advertising revenue.  While, as I mentioned, I envisage taking power to enable RTE advertising revenue to be capped, subject to positive resolution by the Houses of the Oireachtas, I do not envisage seeking to exercise the power in the immediate future at least.</P>
    <P>There were a variety of considerations which I took into account over the past few weeks as my proposals crystallised which led me to the conclusion that to concentrate on the advertising side might not achieve the desired result.  In particular, while my concern has been to create a fairer competitive environment for all the media &mdash; including the print media who have particular concerns in this regard &mdash; one of the real dangers I foresaw was the possibility that much of the advertising revenue one might seek to divert would leak out to external television services.  Nevertheless, a number of the measures I am taking will, I believe, go a long way towards meeting the concerns of the print media, in particular those governing codes of practice relating to advertising, sponsorship and other forms of commercial promotion, on broadcasting services.</P>
    <P>I am indeed heartened by the recognition on the other side of the House of the necessity to take such action as set out by the Opposition spokesman on Finance, in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 16 May last when he said:</P>
    <P>Ireland's newspaper industry is not being allowed to compete for advertising on a level playing field because RTE are on an inside track.  The expansion in radio and the proposed TV3 has provided other outlets for advertising and, while the newspaper industry was <Col N="680" /> not afraid of competition, the competition should be fair.  Another positive development which has taken place as a result of the Government's broadcasting policy is the introduction of Multi-point Microwave Distribution Systems or MMDS as we know it.  The Government's objective here is to provide real multi-channel television choice in a professional, technically competent manner.  A key element of this new venture is that subscribers in rural Ireland will be afforded the same quality and continuity of service which is currently available on cable systems mainly in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Licences have been issued in respect of MMDS cells covering the whole country and some licensees are already up and running offering service to subscribers. Ireland is leading the field in the introduction of this system in Europe and many other countries are expressing keen interest in these developments.  The development of this service will put another major piece of the Government's policy in place.  As soon as it is in place it is my intention to bring the full rigour of the law to bear on illegal television retransmission systems and to ensure that they are put off, and remain off, the air.</P>
    <P>One of the concerns mentioned in the Opposition motion relates to the impact in Ireland of transnational and satellite broadcasting services.  As I have already said, I was very aware of the fundamental nature of these changes right from the time I took office and I have tried to ensure that Irish broadcasting will have developed to meet that challenge in a confident and effective way.</P>
    <P>Technology costs are decreasing for satellite transmission and choice is increasing quite dramatically.  Fixed satellite services are being used to feed television programming to cable head ends. Direct broadcasting satellites have been launched by a number of European countries.  We have our own ambitions in this area through the Atlantic satellites project.</P>
    <P>All the indicators converge in the one direction: the elimination of frontiers and the internationalisation of audiences. <Col N="681" /> The process is inevitable and irreversible and its implications are becoming more important every day.  These developments require joint analysis at European level and a collective effort by European countries to formulate an international broadcasting framework to cope with them.  That framework has already been laid down in two international legal instruments which will shortly come into force, namely the European Convention on Transfrontier Television, and the European Council Directive on Broadcasting Activities.</P>
    <P>These instruments establish the following rules and standards: freedom of expression and information in accordance with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights; all broadcasts must comply with the law of the member state from which they emanate; all programmes shall respect the dignity of the human being and the fundamental rights of others.  They shall not be indecent, and in particular contain pornography or give undue prominence to violence or be likely to incite to racial hatred; all items of programme service which are likely to impair the physical, mental or moral development of children and adolescents shall not be scheduled when, because of time of transmission and reception, they are likely to watch them; the broadcaster shall ensure that views fairly present facts and events and encourage the free formation of opinion; provision is made for a right of reply where reputation and good name have been damaged by an assertion of incorrect facts in a television programme &mdash; the forthcoming Bill will contain a section which, if passed, would enact this provision into Irish law; detailed provisions are made regarding the form, content and amount of advertising and sponsorship; there is a provision regarding cultural objectives and in particular the development of European audio-visual production; and a guarantee of right of reception in all participating states, where physically possible, of broadcasting services emanating from those <Col N="682" /> states which comply with the requirements of the instruments.</P>
    <P>All this work has been going on over the last three years and has involved countless hours spent in meetings while a Europe-wide agreement was forged. These instruments will, I believe, prevent the excesses of a totally commercially driven international broadcasting sector and allow the positive aspects of an increase in services to emerge.  Given the work done at international level and the fact that the reception of satellite services is inevitable, I feel that it would be totally unproductive to have a review group sit now and ponder these questions.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the strong position of RTE in broadcasting in this country.  I have often said that this is rightly so.  It has a vital role to play in broadcasting and this will continue to be the case.  Its public service ethos will continue to be cherished all the more so as the commercial sector develops.  The Government commitment to a strong public broadcasting service is self-evident from the Government's approval of new developments in RTE over the past few years such as approval to transmit a new lunch time television news service on RTE 1; additional broadcasting hours to enable RTE 2 television to commmence transmissions at 3 p.m. daily; additional broadcasting hours for the Raidio na Gaeltachta service; an extra hour a day to enable Radio 1 to continue broadcasting until 1 a.m. each morning; and additional broadcasting hours for the FM3 service and Cork Local Radio.  RTE were also given approval to build a new extension to the television studios in Donnybrook. This new extension is almost completed and will play a major part in facilitating the making of drama series such as &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another issue mentioned in this motion is the important matter of Irish language services.  It is generally accepted that Raidio na Gaeltachta provides a first class service to the Gaeltachtaí and indeed to the entire country and as I have already indicated that service has been further expanded over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to Irish language <Col N="683" /> television is that Údarás na Gaeltachta produced a report late last year indicating that such a service could be provided at a capital cost of £5.2 million and annual running costs of £9.6 million for a service of two hours per night.  That report has been examined by my Department in relation to the technical and frequency management aspects of the proposal.  The Department agree broadly, albeit with some important reservations, with the conclusions regarding the technical aspects of the service &mdash; although there are some serious limitations with the approach envisaged &mdash; and also with the cost parameters and has informed Roinn na Gaeltachta accordingly.</P>
    <P>In reference to the motion before the House, the proposals which I have just announced will fully meet Deputy Mitchell's encouragement that I take all reasonable steps to maintain present services but I am not prepared to accept his proposals for a review body.</P>
    <P>To conclude therefore, the proposals which I outlined tonight and which I will very shortly be bringing forward in legislative form will create a fairer competitive environment for all concerned and will, I believe, greatly further our overall objective of allowing a vibrant and competitive broadcasting and audio-visual sector to develop in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Minister said in reply to Deputy Mitchell that when it came to the introduction of this broadcasting legislation he had no hangups about ideology.  Following his announcement tonight it is fairly obvious that he was not burdened by any such problems. The Minister has announced that £3 million is to be given to private sector broadcasting despite the fact that all parties in this House who voted for the introduction of this legislation were committed to the market economy.  Are we to take it that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats now accept the principle of funding to the private sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned about The Workers' Party.  We have had our position for many years which Fine Gael did their utmost to obstruct, despite the fact that it was part of an agreement for Government, one of the 14 points we made prior to entering into Government with the Deputy's party.</P>
      <P>We have here a motion which both speakers briefly referred to.  There are four sections in the motion laid down by Deputy Mitchell.  It is fairly obvious, however, that what was intended was funding for Century Radio.  This he has achieved.  Having made our position on private broadcasting very clear during the passage of this legislation, we accept the decision of this House.  It would not be in anybody's interest at this stage to see Century or any of the other radio stations close because people's livelihood depends on them.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat taken aback by some of the points made here tonight.  We have had reference to the level playing pitch. If I were playing on that pitch I would like to start off on the Minister's side because it is obvious that it would be downhill from then on.  We heard reference to the light touch and interference. It seems that once again the Minister has dealt a heavy-handed blow to RTE who refuse to die despite the best efforts of both the Minister and Deputy Mitchell to put them down.  They have responded to the challenges presented to them.  We were told that the middle-aged, middle class and middle-brow type of broadcasting would not survive.  It is fairly obvious that that is what won the day.  RTE continue to prosper despite the best efforts of Minister Burke and Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTE have provided a good service through the years.  We, however, are now giving a handout of £3 million with little in return.  If Century Radio or any of the commercial radio stations are in difficulty I would have no objection to providing temporary funding provided that when things got better, that money would be refunded but it is totally at variance with Government policy on public expenditure to dole out £3 million.  It is outrageous <Col N="685" /> and is an abuse of public funds.  We have been told that RTE may have a little competition as a result of this but that is the type of incentive they could do without.  To add insult to injury we have been told that part of the licence fee will be given to private individuals.  In my view that represents misappropriation of funds entrusted to the State.  The House should not allow this to continue.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Mitchell will oppose this measure.  I agree with funding on a temporary basis provided a refund is paid, but, obviously, that will not happen.  Provision has not been made for the return of that money if the company becomes profitable.  That is not acceptable to us.  Deputy Mitchell described the Minister's performance as something between burlesque and ballet.  I do not know if I could be considered a square dancer but in my view the House has been conned by the Deputy and the Minister. It was a nice pincer movement tonight.  Both of them achieved their aim by ensuring that the creature they created will not die an untimely death.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell told us that a crisis was imminent and we can safely report that that crisis has been averted courtesy of the Minister for Communications. Deputy Mitchell told us that any attempt to divert money from RTE would benefit TV stations across the Border and, having heard the Minister's speech, I wonder if he feels the same.  I would be interested to hear another speaker from his party respond to that statement.</P>
    <P>We have been told that it would be bad for RTE if Century Radio collapsed but in my view RTE have proved beyond doubt that they can provide a service second to none, despite the onslaught, the hype, the Government's support for other stations and the obstacles put in their way.  The Minister told us about the largesse he dispensed to RTE by extending their hours of broadcasting. However, he dug his heels in regard to the city of Cork in that he would not concede one extra hour.  If anything the Minister has reduced the broadcasting time for that city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> The Minister told us that the MMDS system would be available throughout the country but if he goes to the west or the south he will find areas that do not have any chance of availing of that system in the foreseeable future.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the swift action he took to put the pirate stations out of commission.  However, there is a problem in regard to reflector stations.  If that system is to be done away with many people will not have a service for a long time.  The Minister should give further consideration to this matter.  I hope that the crystallisation that has taken place in the last few days will continue and that the Minister will provide a service for those who will not be served by the MMDS system.  The Minister has ignored the health implications of that system. Many eminent medical practitioners have expressed a fear that the rays from that system will be a health hazard but those views have been ignored by the Minister. He did not make any reference to it in his speech.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have since 1979 held the view that broadcasting should be developed by RTE and local community associations.  There is no doubt that the policy we pursued from day one was the correct one and we have been vindicated in our views tonight.  How many more private stations are in danger of closing? We have heard of amalgamations and of stations that have not taken up the option despite having been given a licence by the IRTC.  The Minister's announcement tonight is a further body blow to RTE.  It is contrary to Government policy.  We were told that there would be no more funding to the private sector but that changed tonight.  This is unbelievable and is contrary to what all parties on the right have been advocating for many years.  We will not be supporting Deputy Mitchell's motion.  I see it as a ploy to achieve funding for Century Radio and that has already succeeded.  While the Minister may be complimented by Century Radio for doing that, in my view this represents a sad day for broadcasting in Ireland.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that Deputy Mitchell does not have a lot to say about our policy on broadcasting.  He has tried to get on a bandwagon with his motion which deplores failure in several areas but does not compliment the Government on their successes.  Deputy Mitchell should recall that the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party when in Government failed to deal with the problem of pirate stations and that was because of the ideological problems between the two parties.

      <P>The truth is bitter to swallow.  We are all aware that because of difficulties when in Government and parties opposite did not do anything about the mushrooming of pirate radio stations around the country.  I should like to compliment the Minister, and his predecessor, for dealing with this problem and making changes.  As a party we took a lot of flak in the last election because <Col N="688" /> local radio stations were not in operation but the public accept that we have done a good job since.  Some people query the way the IRTC have done their business. However, it was naive to think that community radio stations would come on stream very quickly because of the number of teething problems that had to be solved.  Some have had to cope with many difficulties.  In my area the LMFM station have proved to be very good in comparison with other stations.  I hope the local radio scene remains with us but the community radio service will take a little longer to come on stream.</P>
      <P>As a public representative I have found that local radio has permitted locals to discuss problems in their areas.  There is no doubt that those problems would not have been highlighted on national stations. For years my home town has been complaining about the lack of proper coverage of events.  There has been a lot of publicity of the bad events in that area but we have not had the vehicle to promote ourselves.  Thankfully, that has been put right by RTE and that may be due to the competition they face in the area.  I understand that in the near future RTE will be establishing a district station in Dundalk which will include a radio studio and facilities for television broadcasts. I hope the bad image that has been portrayed of that area will be put right when we get that station.</P>
      <P>Many people forget that local radio has provided a good emergency service, similar to what was available on the pirate stations. In my area this service were able to contact people at short notice to let them know when there was an emergency.  While the local radios were shelved there was a problem but now that they are again up and running this should be catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area which has caused difficulties with the national radio stations &mdash; I am thinking particularly of Century and local radio stations &mdash; is the requirement to have 20 per cent of their output devoted to news and current affairs.  Perhaps this should be reconsidered because it is quite obvious that a number of the <Col N="689" /> stations very near the borderline in that regard are succeeding.  They are probably not providing the optimum amount of news but, because they are providing wall to wall music, they are succeeding. Obviously, there is a market for that kind of music.</P>
    <P>I am worried that the sum of £3 million set aside from the licence fee to help the IRTC might eventually rise to £30 million.  The Minister should look into this and the matter should be teased out before enshrining it in legislation because it might cause problems in future.</P>
    <P>Radio stations could help in teaching foreign languages because we have neglected to provide such courses in schools.  Perhaps, in the proposed legislation, the Minister will look at this aspect.  The other area where most Deputies have been lobbied is in relation to the Irish language television station.  I am sure that most Deputies would like to see such a station introduced as quickly as possible.  Various lobby groups have been very active recently and I acknowledge the fact that the Minister is preparing to bring forward proposals in this regard.  The sooner the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the extension of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission.  We would all welcome this because there have been complaints recently about subjects which were discussed on RTE chat shows.  There has been disquiet that various topics, which should not be discussed on the radio, have been broadcast.  As I said earlier, Fine Gael should be the last party to criticise the Government because, during their term of office, their efforts were abysmal.  Indeed, that is probably why Deputy Jim Mitchell took so little time to speak.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell referred to the cross-Border radio stations.  An illegal station is broadcasting on the northern side of the Border into the Republic near where I live which engenders advertising revenue from the area.  obviously, this could be taken up by the Minister through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat or with his Northern counterparts.  Local radios have <Col N="690" /> been unable to increase their revenue from advertising because, until recently, RTE had a monopoly in the area.  It is very difficult for local radios to generate advertising from the areas in which they operate and, even in my own area, relatively small companies advertise on RTE. It would be better if they advertised on local radio which would support local industry and involvement.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for what he has done over the last three years in the area of broadcasting.  Indeed, he has not received credit for his efforts.</P>

      <P>I will preface my remarks by saying that nothing influences the public mind or leaves such an imprint on public opinion as the media.  In this regard our broadcasting service over the years has been without doubt &mdash; for the most part &mdash; responsible in its reporting of events and, with some exceptions, it has been fair.</P>
      <P>When speaking on a motion of this kind the sensitivity of the issue is brought home to one by the divergence of views. There appears to be a belief, for example, that by taking the sum of £3 million from RTE and giving it to the IRTC one is placing RTE in a disadvantageous position.  With all due respect to RTE, nothing could be further from the truth. Monopolies are inherently defective. When there is no competition very often standards can and will fall.  Competition adds spice to any business and this also applies to the broadcasting service.  When one questions the fairness of taking £3 million of RTE's licence fee revenue and giving it to the IRTC one should also consider whether the print media are at a disadvantage compared with RTE.  The answer must be irrefutably yes because the print media have been at an unfair disadvantage.  RTE have been in a position to obtain licence fees and revenue from broadcasting and advertising and, of course, the print media do not receive licence fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that when one wants to level the playing pitch, one is trying to be fair and, in this context, the Minister is being fair.  If we do not have <Col N="691" /> competition in the modern Europe, foreign television and radio stations will fill the vacuum by taking away something inherently Irish.  The culture and traditions of our country are expressed through the national broadcasting media. They can be equally well expressed on a level playing pitch through an independent television or radio station.  In this context we must accept that serious problems exist in relation to our media. It is a great pity, for example, that Century are in difficulties and it is a tragedy that <i>The Irish Press</i>&mdash; a leading newspaper for many years &mdash; are also in difficulties. The most important aspect of our media has been that, to a large extent, it told the truth.  The slogan of <i>The Irish Press</i> was &ldquo;the truth in the news&rdquo;.  If external interests are to come here to fill the undoubted vacuum created by Century Radio and <i>The Irish Press</i>&mdash; in the light of experience over the years &mdash; then one cannot be absolutely certain that, in some cases, the truth will not be distorted.  We must recognise that distortions in broadcasting, in the print media constitute the easiest forms of escapism.</P>
    <P>In general such distortions have not been prevalent within the Irish media to date.  It would be my fear that in those circumstances such could occur. Obviously such consequences would not be in the interests of our people.  Certainly it would not be in the interests of the future of this country that any national medium be controlled from outside. Such eventuality would lead to a replacement of the values, traditions and culture our people have enjoyed &mdash; through the print and broadcasting media &mdash; over several decades.  In the final analysis that is the choice presenting the greatest danger: whether one will operate a system within one's country, with broadcasting services controlled by one's own people, or allow the vacuum be filled externally.  It has been unfortunate that in recent years British newspapers have been sold here at much lower prices than indigenous ones.  The need to protect our print media is at least as important as <Col N="692" /> the need to ensure competition within television stations and airwaves.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan say that the transference of £3 million to the IRTC was an abuse of public funds.  I would describe it as something else &mdash; an honest attempt by the Minister for Communications to ensure that Irish companies and people are gainfully employed in a competitive manner on our airwaves.  I cannot over-stress that the truth must prevail.  It is my belief that acceptance of the Minister's proposal will ensure a continuance of the truth.</P>
    <P>Since its formation Radio na Gaeltachta has been a model for every local radio station, its contribution to the people of the Gaeltacht being indeed significant. Indeed the argument could be advanced that the Irish language would be in a poorer state today were it not for their outstanding contribution.  It has been a model of consistency, of truth, and continues to render an outstanding service.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the media can be utilised in a greater educational process than was the case in the past.  I welcome the Minister's statement that in the future foreign languages will be included.  It is crucial that such languages be learned here within the context of an enlarged, unified Europe.  Such learning will add a greater dimension to Irish education generally.  Television, in particular, can be a great educator.  It is indeed unfortunate that, in recent years, its educational role has not been all one might expect.  Admittedly some programmes with an educational content have been broadcast, many most informative, but it is vital that the television medium be used to a greater extent for this purpose.  In due course the Minister might consider the concept of an Open University, with all that that would entail and its undoubted advantages accruing to adults and younger people alike.</P>
    <P>We must state our aims specifically this evening.  The choice lies between a vacuum which will be filled from outside the country or the maintenance of our indigenous controlled companies.  In the light of past experience, faced with that <Col N="693" /> choice, I would go for the truth.  It is my belief that the Minister's proposals and his work to date will achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that Deputy Jim Mitchell should table such a motion as this when one remembers the period of inactivity and the absolute muddle of our airwaves for so many years prior to 1987.  It is true that nothing material was done in regard to the legalisation of community radio, the introduction of a third television station or an alternative national radio station by the then Fine Gael dominated Coalition Government.  There were squabbles within and without that Government but nothing of any note was achieved.  It must be recognised that the Minister has achieved a considerable amount within a short period.  It must also be accepted that community radio here is in its infancy and is bound to encounter teething problems.  What this House should and must address is a continuation of Irish media in the manner in which it has been conducted to date, thereby ensuring that the best possible standards are attained.  We must acknowledge that always competition is inevitable if one is to succeed.</P>

      <P>Tá lúchair orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an tairiscint seo atá curtha os comhair na Dála ag ár n-urlabhraí ar chúrsaí craolacháin, an Teachta Jim Mitchell.  Sílim go bhfuil sé tráthúil go bhfuil an rún seo os comhair na Dála mar go bhfuil míshuaimhneas agus míshásamh ar go leor daoine ar fud na tíre, go díreach cad é atá ag tarlú i gcúrsaí raidió agus i gcúrsaí teilifíse go náisiúnta i láthair na huaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é an mórscéal sna páipéir nuachta agus ar na meáin chumarsáide eile le roinnt seachtainí anuas ná na deacrachtaí móra atá ag cuid de na stáisiúin a cuireadh ar bun le tamall anuas.  Fiú amháin ag an deireadh seachtaine is é an mórscéal a bhí ann ná cad é atá i ndán do Century Radio.  Tá sé mar ábhar cainte ar fud na tíre agus is cóir go mbeadh deis againn an cheist a phlé anseo sa Dáil, an áit a <Col N="694" /> ndéantar na socruithe agus a leagtar síos polasaithe craolacháin don tír ar fad.</P>
    <P>Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé liom féin, tá suim ar leith agam sa tseirbhís atá á cur ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge agus an tseirbhís a bheidh á cur ar fáil san am atá romhainn.  Mar gheall ar an raidió, ní shílim go bhfuil aon ghearán againn sa tír seo.  Ó cuireadh Raidió na Gaeltachta ar bun i 1972, sílim, sin ocht mbliana déag ó shin, aontaíonn gach duine ó gach taobh den Teach go bhfuil an-obair ar fad déanta acu ó thaobh chraolacháin i nGaeilge.  Ní amháin go gcuireann siad seirbhís an-mhaith ar fáil do na ceantair Ghaeltachta sa tír, ó Dhún na nGall go Corcaigh agus Ciarraí, ach cuireann siad seirbhís an-mhaith ar fáil do Ghaeilgeoirí ar fud na tíre ar fad.</P>
    <P>Tá éisteacht ag Raidió na Gaeltachta taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, chomh maith le taobh istigh den Ghaeltacht. Dúirt mé cheana, agus déarfaidh mé arís é, cé nach bhfuil aon pháipéar nuachta laethúil sa tír trí Ghaeilge, mar sin féin, tá muintir na Gaeltachta agus Gaeilgeoirí ar fud na tíre ábalta seirbhís an-mhaith a fháil ó Raidió na Gaeltachta.  Cuirtear an nuacht go speisialta ar fáil dóibh chomh maith le haon pháipéar nuachta, agus sílim go bhfuil an-seirbhís á soláthar acu. Leoga, Raidió Éireann féin, sula dtáinig Raidió na Gaeltachta ar an saol, bhí cláir Ghaeilge ar siúl acusan freisin agus tá cláir Ghaeilge ar siúl acu go fóill.  Tá an-obair á déanamh ag RTÉ mar sheirbhis náisiúnta raidió agus tá siad ag amharc i ndiaidh cluichí, oideachais, spóirt, teanga, ceoil clasaicigh, popcheoil agus ceoil thraidisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Tá an-seirbhís á cur ar fáil ag RTÉ iad féin agus tá ár dtacaíocht tuillte acu.  É sin ráite, ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Aire, chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le raidió FM2, tá a lucht éisteachta féin acusan, ach cuireann sé isteach go mór orm mar urlabhraí Gaeltachta do mo pháirtí féin, nach bhfuil oiread agus focal Gaelige le cloisteáil ar an stáisiún sin.  Is stáisiúin náisiúnta é, is deirfiúr é le RTÉ Raidió, agus is mór an trua nach bhfuil oiread is focal amháin Gaeilge le cloisteáil ar an stáisiún sin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> Mar atá a fhios ag gach duine, tá muintir óg na tíre ag éisteacht le FM2.  Cuireann na figiúirí agus na staitisticí an t-eolas sin ar fáil dúinn agus is mór an trua nach bhfuil deis ag na daoine óga a bhíonn ag éisteacht le FM2 cúpla focal Gaeilge, cúpla abairt Gaeilge, cúpla amhrán Gaeilge anois agus arís a chloisteáil air.  Maidir leis an aos óg, tá lucht éisteachta níos mó ag FM2 ná mar atá ag RTÉ Raidió 1, agus, dá bhrí sin, dá mbeadh an Ghaeilge le cloisteáil ansin anois agus arís, thabharfadh sé stádas agus éisteacht don Ghaeilge nach bhfuil le fáil i láthair na huaire.  Sin an t-aon ghearán atá agam le RTÉ chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le Gaeilge a chur i láthair an phobail.</P>
    <P>Is tráthúil go bhfuil an rún seo á phlé againn, mar níl a fhios ag na daoine go díreach cad é atá i gceist ag an Rialtas nó ag an Aire.  Bhí mé anseo breis agus bliain ó shin agus bhí ordú curtha amach an uair sin ag an Roinn Cumarsáide go raibh na deflectors go léir ar fud na tíre le dúnadh síos, chomh maith leis na stáisiúin bhradacha.  Cuireadh na pirates ón aer ag an am sin, ach tá na deflectors ansin go fóill.  Is é an fáth go raibh siad chun dúnadh síos ná go raibh seirbhís úr ann ar fud na tíre agus go raibh na stáisiúin go léir le bheith ar fáil trí chóras an MMDS.  Go díreach, níl a fhios agam cad é chomh dáiríre agus atá an tAire agus an Rialtas maidir leis an gcóras sin.  An bhfuil siad chun dul ar aghaidh leis?  An bhfuil siad chun úsáid a bhaint as?  An bhfuil siad cinnte gurb é an córas is fearr é?</P>
    <P>Mar shampla, tá sé beartaithe Bealach 3 a chur ar fáil anois, an tríú bealach teilifíse sa tír seo.  An mbeidh sé sin ag dul amach ar MMDS nó an mbeidh sé ag dul amach ar cheann de na miníochtaí eile atá ann.  Sin ceist agus níl a fhios agam ar thug an tAire an freagra go fóill. Ach tá an cheist ag déanamh buartha do go leor daoine ar fud na tíre.  Mar a dúirt mé, is é an raidió agus, go speisialta, an teilifís, an meán cumarsáide a théann i gcionn go mór ar mhuintir na tíre.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le haos óg na tíre, tá an teilifís thar a bheith tábhachtach. Tá mé ag tarraingt mo scéil anois ar <Col N="696" /> pholasaí an Rialtais.  Cad é atá ar intinn acu maidir le seirbhís theilifíse Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil, ní amháin don Ghaeltacht, ach do mhuintir na tíre ar fad?  Tá a fhios againn go léir ó na staitisticí agus na tuairiscí atá curtha ar fáil le tamall anuas go bhfuil an Ghaeilge faoi bhrú sna Gaeltachtaí. Chuir Reg Hindley tuairisc amach cúpla seachtain ó shin agus dúirt sé go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag fáil bháis sna Gaeltachtaí.  An tseachtain seo caite láinseáil an tAire Stáit i Roinn na Gaeltachta dhá thuairisc eile, ceann amháin a bhain le deontas na deich bpunt sna Gaeltachtaí, atá ag dul i laghad bliain i ndiaidh bliana, agus aiste an-mhaith leis an Ollamh Gearóid Ó Tuathaigh, a deir go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag cúlú agus ag éirí níos laige.</P>
    <P>Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach, má táimid chun tarrtháil a thabhairt don Ghaeilge, má táimid chun cuidiú leis an teanga, go mbeadh seirbhís theilifíse trí Ghaeilge ar fáil.  Má chuirtear é sin ar fáil, tabharfaidh sé stádas don teanga nach bhfuil aici go dtí seo.  Tá obair mhór déanta ag Raidió na Gaeltachta ach táimid i ré na teilifíse anois.  Nuair a chluineann daoine an Ghaeilge ar an teilifís téann sé i gcionn go mór orthu agus is cinnte go rachaidh sé i gcionn go mór ar dhaoine óga.  Anois tá sé ar eolas againn go léir gur iarr an Taoiseach ar Údarás na Gaeltachta tuarascáil a chur ar fáil tá dhá bhliain ó shin maidir le teilifís na Gaeltachta, agus go bhfuil sé sin curtha ar fáil ag Údarás na Gaeltachta le beagnach bliain, sílim i mí Mheán Fómhair seo caite.  Cuireadh an tuarascáil sin ar fáil do Roinn na Gaeltachta agus don Roinn Cumarsáide, agus chuaigh sé go dtí RTÉ.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith linn go díreach a fháil amach cad é an dearcadh, nó cad é an polasaí atá ag an Rialtas maidir le seirbhís theilifíse Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na tíre.  Táimid go léir ag fanacht.  Níl aon cheantar Gaeltachta sa tír ó Dhún na nGall go Ciarraí, go Port Láirge agus go Baile Atha Cliath, nach bhfuil cruinnithe ansin agus rún á mholadh ag iarraidh ar an Rialtas seirbhís theilifíse trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil go díreach mar atá molta ag Údarás na Gaeltachta sa tuarascáil a eisigh siad.  Is é an moladh atá déanta acu <Col N="697" /> gur seirbhís neamhspleách Ghaeilge a bheadh ann agus go mbeadh an ceannáras sa Ghaeltacht, go mbeadh stiúideo i gConamara, ceann i nDún na nGall agus ceann i gCorcaigh nó i gCiarraí, agus go gcuirfí cláir fhiúntacha ar fáil i nGaeilge do mhuintir na tíre dhá uair a chloig san oíche.</P>
    <P>Rinne an tAire tagairt ina óráid do theilifís na Gaeltachta agus ceann de na rudaí a luaigh sé ná an costas atá leis, £9.6 mhilliún.  Cuimhnímis, sa Bhreatain Bheag le blianta fada, tá seirbhís theilifíse neamhspleách Bhreatnaise acu a chraol-ann, sílim, ceithre huaire a chloig san oíche, agus an t-airgead curtha ar fáil ag Rialtas na Breataine, ag na stáisiúin neamhspleácha agus ag an BBC féin.  Ag deireadh na bliana seo caite d'fhógair Rialtas na Breataine go bhfuil siad chun £8 milliún breise a chur ar fáil le seirbhís Gháidhlige níos fearr a chur ar fáil do na Gaeltachtaí i dtuaisceart na hAlban agus sna hoileáin.</P>
    <P>Nuair a amharcaimid ar Mhór-Roinn na hEorpa, tá seirbhís theilifíse ar fáil do na mionteangacha sa Spáinn, san Iodáil, agus i dtíortha eile chomh maith.  Seo muid sa tír seo, agus an Ghaeilge faoi bhrú, cé gurb í an phríomhtheanga í, an chéad teanga oifigiúil sa Bhunreacht, agus táimid go fóill ag argóint agus ag plé agus nílimid cinnte an fiú seirbhís mar sin a chur ar fáil nó nach fiú.  Tá an t-am ag éirí gairid.  Chonaic muid cad é mar atá ag éirí le Raidió na Gaeltachta, agus d'iarrfainn ar an Aire, atá ag éisteacht anseo, cinneadh a dhéanamh go luath agus dul ar aghaidh agus an tseirbhís seo a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá foireann iomlán oilte anois ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Rinne siad cúrsa teilifíse i gConamara le bliain anuas.  Tá siad réidh le dul i mbun oibre agus níl de dhíth ach cinneadh ón Rialtas agus an gheallúint a thug an Taoiseach féin dhá bhliain ó shin a chur i gcrích agus ansin an tseirbhís a chur ar bun.</P>

    <Col N="698" />
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I understand I have ten minutes to outline the problem.  At 6 p.m. on Monday morning of this week another Castletownbere fishing boat, MFV <i>Dawn Rose,</i> was rammed by a Spanish fishing vessel, <i>El Capitan</i>.  This followed the ramming last week of another local boat, the MFV <i>Orion</i> by the <i>Laurore</i>, a sister ship of <i>El Capitan</i>.  Both attacking vessels are Spanish owned and crewed, and fly a French flag of convenience.  The attacks are the culmination of a campaign of intimidation and assault against our fishermen by Spanish vessels in recent years. If this campaign is allowed to continue it is only a matter of time before life is lost and, of course, further serious damage to our boats is inevitable.  The estimated repair bill for the MFV <i>Orion</i> comes to approximately £30,000 and the provisional estimate, subject to survey for the MFV <i>Dawn Rose</i> is £20,000.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that these were not isolated incidents.  Confrontational tactics are now employed 24 hours a day by these Spanish vessels.  In the past week there were a number of attempted rammings of boats, including an earlier incident also involving <i>El Capitan</i>.  Boats are now returning to harbour, the crews of which have been subject to attacks by stones and other missiles.  Recently the MFV <i>Derisa</i> had the windows of her wheelhouse smashed in one such attack. The objective of this campaign is quite clear: these Spaniards are conducting a campaign to drive our fishermen out of the hake fishing grounds off our south-west coast.  Our timber boats measuring from 50 to 90 feet are no match for the steel hulled Spanish vessels of 120 feet plus in length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It it time to bring these modern day pirates to order before they inflict further damage to our fleet or even worse, cause fatalities among our fishermen.  I do not underestimate the problem.  It was <Col N="699" /> summed up well in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> editorial last week from which I quote:</P>
    <P>But it would appear that Madrid has done nothing to try and control its marauding fishermen, who now seem unaccountable to any authority.</P>
    <P>Things are now so serious that I am demanding that the Government take immediate action on a number of fronts. First, a Naval vessel should be stationed in Castletownbere.  I wish to pay tribute to the efforts of the Naval Service who are under-resourced and undermanned but despite these difficult drawbacks affecting their operations, they are doing their very best.  I believe there is a need to locate a Naval vessel in Castletownbere because of the problem that exists off the south-west coast.  If resources are a problem, I suggest the Minister advise the European Community that our Naval vessels are patrolling Community waters and there is a responsibility on the EC to fund fishery protection.  Indeed, such funding should not be confined to the capital side; there should also be funding for current expenses.  That is why I have pointed out the difficulties that are evident in our Naval Service and if money is a problem I think there are grounds for a case to be made to the European Community for further funding.</P>
    <P>Second, the Government should lodge a formal protest with the Spanish Government.  In addition, a protest should be lodged with the French Government, who are allowing their flag to fly on the ships of these pirates.  Last week the Minister mentioned that he had written to his corresponding Ministers in France and Spain calling their attention to the serious incident that occurred last week.  Quite frankly that is not enough and I think it is necessary to have a formal Government to Government protest to highlight the seriousness of this problem.</P>
    <P>Third, I want the Government to follow up this matter at European Community level.  The Minister should call a special meeting of EC Fisheries Ministers as Ireland now holds the Presidency of the European Community and has the opportunity of calling such a meeting.  I <Col N="700" /> am asking the Minister tonight, in the light of the serious confrontation that has taken place and of the dangers of these confrontations that could lead to loss of life, that he should follow this course of action.  Indeed, I demand a special meeting of the EC Fisheries Ministers.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the Minister will have to make whatever changes are necessary to secure changes in the law as it appears the law is deficient.  If the law is deficient, steps must be taken to put it right.  I believe there are lacunae in the law, therefore the Government must move to close existing loopholes.</P>
    <P>Fifth, we must increase the penalties for illegal fishing by foreign vessels.  From the information I have it appears that most of these Spanish vessels off our coast, which can number up to 50 or 60 at a time, are fishing illegally.  I am convinced that it will be necessary to take a much stronger line with them. The Minister might take a leaf out of Morocco's book.  That country was also plagued by Spanish poachers but they introduced a law to confiscate their vessels on conviction, and that course of action might be necessary to bring home to these Spaniards that the kinds of activities they are involved in are not acceptable.  It might also bring home to them that our Government have the conviction to put a stop to this modern day piracy, thus protecting our fishermen.</P>
    <P>Sixth, I ask the Government to give whatever assistance is necessary so that our fishermen can pursue civil claims against these attacking vessels.  I believe this problem is deadly serious.  As you know, Sir, I raised this matter in a Private Notice Question last week &mdash; and there have been a number of incidents since.  It is very clear that the Spaniards are not amenable to our authority, neither are they amenable to European Community authority.  Life and limb are now at risk. The stakes are very high.  Estimates of the profits from the illegal activities of these Spanish vessels run to hundreds of millions of pounds.  It is very clear that they are prepared to take enormous risks since the stakes are so high.  It is time to call a halt.  The Government must act <Col N="701" /> now because if they do not it will be too late and the consequences will not only be huge losses in fish, and damage to fishing vessels but loss of life.  I am pleading and demanding that the Minister take action on the six points I have outlined before it is too late.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that in reply to a Private Notice Question from himself I outlined to the House last Wednesday, 23 May, the reports that I received regarding alleged interference with Irish fishing vessels by foreign fishing boats.  I indicated that a full investigation was in train and that the staff of my Department and the Navy were actively involved in follow-up action.</P>
      <P>I also indicated that I had written to my corresponding Ministers in France and Spain calling their attention to this very serious matter with a view to putting a stop to such incidents.  I indicated that I had brought the matter to the attention of my colleague, Deputy Gerard Collins, Minister for Foreign Affairs, seeking his assistance in the matter.</P>
      <P>Since then, the Deputy will be aware, my Department and the Navy have mounted an intensive fisheries surveillance operation in the area in question. Navy boats, backed up by air reconnaissance, have been deployed for this purpose.  The operation has been supported by on-shore staff from the various services involved.  Seven boats have been arrested and charged with fishery related offences.  Civil actions have also been initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that I have received a full report on the specific incident he mentioned.  It is alleged that an Irish boat, the <i>Dawn Rose</i>, was interfered with by a foreign vessel on Monday morning last, while legitimately trawling approximately 60 miles south-west of Castletownbere.  This is the same general area in which previous incidents occurred.  Follow-up operations are in progress.  I want to make it quite clear that I will not tolerate interference with Irish fishing vessels going about their <Col N="702" /> legitimate pursuits in Irish waters.  No resources will be spared in order to prevent such incidents and those involved know, from the action taken to date, that we mean business.  Irish fishing boats will not be driven off the hake grounds by any boats of any nation.  There are no problems with regard to resources.</P>
    <P>I have instructed my Department to bring together immediately, at senior level, representatives of the various State services concerned, with a view to identifying any further practical measures that can be taken in this regard.  I have also asked for a review of the adequacy of the legal provisions &mdash; this surfaced during a Private Notice Question last week &mdash; governing instances of this sort. I have furthermore asked my Department to consult fully with the fishermen's organisations on this issue.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate and accept that we are doing our utmost in this matter. As regards his specific suggestion about the location of a naval vessel at Castletownbere, the Deputy will be aware that naval vessels operate from close by, at Haulbowline, and are well able to police effectively the territory in question from that base.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you very sincerely, a Cheann Comhairle, for agreeing to have this matter discussed before the House this evening and I thank the Minister also for attending.  A decision was taken in 1983 by the then Minister, Gemma Hussey, approving the establishment of a community school in Rathkeale, amalgamating the two existing post primary schools, the vocational school and the Convent of Mercy secondary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1988 a draft plan was submitted to the Department of Education. They did not progress the issue but sat on it for about a year.  It was resubmitted in January 1990 but since then there has been no further progress.  It is imperative that the Minister moves with great haste <Col N="703" /> to build a community school in Rathkeale. The Convent of Mercy started their secondary school in the early sixties to cope with the expansion in numbers. They had plans drawn up in 1967 to build a new secondary school but the Department of Education requested them not to proceed as they had major plans for the area.  The deposit had even been paid to the builder on that occasion and was returned to them.  As a result of this school not proceeding, the Convent of Mercy secondary school, since 1970, became a grouping of eight different prefabricated buildings which are now antiquated and totally inadequate for providing a proper educational environment for the pupils.  It is a tribute to the teachers that they have managed to build up the number of pupils to over 300.  It is also a tribute to the pupils and their parents for continuing to use this educational establishment despite the difficult circumstances that prevail.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached as far back as 1983 for the community school, with the co-operation of the local vocational school and the Convent of Mercy.  The site adjoins the Rathkeale vocational school and covers 6.25 acres.  In June 1988 Deputy Gerard Collins, Minister for Foreign Affairs, introduced a deputation to the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke.  This deputation was assured that Rathkeale was one of the five schools with priority after the schools being built under the design, build and construct concept.  The Rathkeale community school would satisfy the main criteria because it serves a catchment area and would amalgamate the secondary and vocational schools in the area.</P>
    <P>The Rathkeale vocational school was established in 1962 and is a modern facility, with over 175 pupils.  It is a most respected educational establishment with a very good track record.  It is important to harness the enthusiasm of both schools for a community school which would offer a wide-ranging number of subjects. It is now time for action as there has been enough procrastinations and false promises on this issue.  The pupils of the Rathkeale area need a community school <Col N="704" /> now and the Minister has the responsibility and the power to deliver it.</P>

      <P>First I would like to thank the Deputy for his very reasoned and effective case in connection with what I accept has been a long running saga.  However, it is important that I give the background to this project.  In 1983 the Sisters of Mercy in Rathkeale informed my Department that they were unable to go ahead with the building of a permanent secondary school.  They indicated that they would, however, be prepared to participate in the development of a community school.  The VEC voted in favour of the concept of a community school.  Subsequently the then Minister authorised the provision of such a school for Rathkeale to replace the secondary and vocational schools.</P>
      <P>The schedule of accommodation was agreed by the school authorities.  A site was acquired, a design team was appointed and architectural planning commenced.  This planning has now reached stage 2 &mdash; the outline sketch scheme &mdash; of my Department's design team procedures.  However, in common with all such school buildings projects, the Rathkeale project is being reviewed in the context of demographic trends and projected pupil enrolments for both the short and long term.  The project was originally planned to cater for 500 pupils. Current enrolment in the centre is 452. The Deputy will be aware of the declining demographic pattern in every county, which has made it essential to review each project very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Limerick the annual birth rate from 1980 to 1988 decreased by a staggering 21 per cent and this decline is continuing.  When the aforementioned review is completed and the pupil numbers to be catered for in the long term established, it will be necessary to prepare a new schedule of accommodation. This in turn will necessitate some alterations to the plan and design of the project by the design team.  It will be appreciated therefore that any changes <Col N="705" /> required will arise from a careful reassessment of the future requirements.  I am satisfied that the new school, when completed, will meet the needs of the community for the foreseeable future.  A full range of facilities will be available for the course to be conducted and for the number of pupils who will enrol there.  I want to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to proceed with the reassessment procedure that is now in place.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy mentioned the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, I want to inform him that he is continually in touch with my office, the Minister and myself to try to advance this project as quickly as possible.  As the Deputy has said, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, has been assured that the project has a very high priority.  The <Col N="706" /> Deputy will appreciate &mdash; I accept that he does from the comments he made &mdash; that we must ensure we plan carefuly for the projected pupil numbers for this school and that we do not make proposals which will not be required when one takes into account the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>I would like to say that every effort will be made to have all our reviews completed as quickly as possible and to proceed without any further delay with the planning process.  I thank the Deputy for the interest he has taken.  I am sure the Deputy, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Noonan, will continue to make the case and we in the Department will attempt to respond as quickly as we can.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 30 May 1990.</P>

      <P>Under the arrangements provided for in the Social Welfare (Availability for Employment) Regulations, 1989, which came into effect in December last there are currently seven unemployment assistance applicants engaged in full-time second level education.  In addition 177 people are participating in the vocational training opportunities scheme.</P>

    <P>As the regulations only came into <Col N="511" /> effect in December last &mdash; when the academic year was already well under way &mdash; it is understandable that the number of people who have availed of them up to now is low.  I expect that this number will increase significantly when the new academic year begins in Septemper next.</P>
    <P>The regulations enable certain unemployment assistance applicants to engage in full-time second level courses of education and at the same time be deemed to satisfy the statutory condition of being available for work subject to satisfying certain qualifying conditions as follows: be in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance, be aged 21 years or over, and participating in a second-level course of education at an approved centre leading to a recognised certificate.</P>
    <P>Any claimant wishing to engage in a full-time course of education at second level must notify his or her local office in advance to be considered under the new arrangements.  The application is then referred to a deciding officer to determine whether the qualifying conditions are satisfied.</P>
    <P>Those availing of the new arrangements continue to receive unemployment assistance and are required to attend weekly at their local office or signing centre to prove unemployment.</P>
    <P>The position regarding unemployed persons engaging in third level education and in community development work is at present being examined.  Some 50 have participated in the voluntary option to date.</P>

      <P>Under section 202 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, persons in full-time employment are not, in general, entitled to assistance under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme.  The spouse of a person in full-time employment may apply for an allowance under the scheme.  In such a case, however, the health board is required, under sections 207 and 210 of the Act, to take account of the earnings of the working spouse in determining entitlement to assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 209 of the Act and the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Regulations, 1977 (S.I. No. 168 of 1977), provide for the payment of weekly supplements, including supplements in respect of mortgage interest.  Applicants for assistance towards mortgage interest are required to meet the first £3.20 of interest themselves and in determining the amount of supplement to be paid, the general practice is to leave the client with an income, after payment of mortgage interest, equivalent to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate appropriate to his family circumstances less £3.20.  The question as to whether assistance with mortgage interest can be given in any particular case would depend on whether the income of the couple, after payment of mortgage interest, exceeds this target figure.</P>

      <P>Persons claiming unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance are required to satisfy certain conditions in order to qualify for payment. They must establish that they are unemployed, capable of work, available for and genuinely seeking work.  An unemployed person is required to attend at a local office of the Department of Social Welfare or at a Garda station or other locations to sign the unemployed register, for the purposes of establishing that these conditions are met.</P>
      <P>In response to the increase in the numbers unemployed generally, signing arrangements have been relaxed at local offices in recent years to relieve congestion at the offices concerned, to reduce the pressure on staff and to facilitate clients.  However, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, there is a balance to be struck between the implementation of signing arrangements which facilitate both clients and staff and the need to ensure that adequate controls are exercised in relation to the unemployment assistance and benefit schemes.  For this reason, signing requirements may be altered at a local level where the nature of the claimants usual employment warrants it.</P>

      <P>Under EC Regulations on Social Security a person who is in receipt of unemployment benefit in this country for a minimum of four weeks prior to his/her departure may continue to receive unemployment benefit for a maximum of three months while looking for work in another EC member state.  Payment is made in the currency of and, in accordance with, the administrative procedures of the other EC state.  These arrangements do not apply to unemployment assistance.

      <P>As far as non-EC countries are concerned, the programme of bilateral agreements which is currently under way is aimed primarily at reciprocity in respect of long-term payments such as old age, survivors and invalidity.  Reciprocity in respect of short-term payments in respect of sickness and unemployment presents certain technical and legal difficulties which are complex and would slow down the completion and implementation of the agreements.  I have, therefore decided to concentrate initially in achieving reciprocity in the pensions area.  I will, however, keep the situation, as regards the inclusion of short-term payments, under review in the context of the further development of any programme of bilateral agreements with the non EC countries.</P>

      <P>In drawing up proposals for the new carer's allowance which I am introducing later this year, I was anxious that the scope of the new allowance would be considerably broader than that of the prescribed relatives allowance which it will replace.  In doing so, I was conscious of the part that a scheme of this nature can play in assisting the elderly and the incapacitated to remain in their own homes.  I was also very conscious of the role of the carers and the debt that the community owes to them for the dedication which they show in looking after those in their care.  I expect around 6,000 additional carers will qualify for payments under the scheme compared with around 1,700 people who benefit under the existing prescribed relatives allowance.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the needs of those depending on the services for which I am responsible and of the part that information has to play in ensuring that these needs are met.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the community welfare officers of the regional health boards from more than 800 centres throughout the country.  The very wide dispersal, at local level, of health centres and other outlets from which the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme is administered gives clients direct access, on a personal basis, to information on the scheme.</P>
      <P>Literature is also widely available on the scheme.  There is a leaflet giving general information on all aspects of the scheme with separate leaflets on particular aspects such as rent/mortgage supplements and allowances for children's footwear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> Posters have also been displayed in local social welfare offices, health centres and centres for the unemployed to alert the public to these additional leaflets and the additional benefits of the scheme. The leaflets may be obtained from the health boards or from my Department's information offices throughout the country.  Information can also be obtained from community information centres and many local voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>I recently announced a new back to school clothing and footwear scheme with effect from the start of the next school year which will be administered as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  A new leaflet on this scheme will be made available shortly and other appropriate publicity will be given to the new arrangements in good time.</P>
    <P>In addition health boards may, where appropriate, place paid advertisements in local newspapers giving information on aspects of the scheme and inviting applications.  The footwear and national fuel schemes have been publicised and applications have been invited in this way over the years.</P>
    <P>As part of my policy of making information on people's entitlements much more widely available, my Department have been revising and up-dating leaflets on all the services available from the Department.  New guides for the unemployed introduced recently &mdash; one on unemployment assistance and the other on unemployment benefit &mdash; specifically highlight the extra benefits available to the unemployed under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. These guides have been widely distributed through local social welfare offices and unemployed centres.  The comprehensive <i>Guide to Social Welfare Services</i> and the complementary rates booklet are currently being revised and will contain more detailed information on the various benefits available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>Special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts were introduced to give a measure of support to veterans of the War of Independence who, on account of age or incapacity, are not in a position to support themselves.  The means test applicable to the special allowance has been relaxed progressively over the years and is now far from severe.  Its abolition would confer no extra benefit on the most needy veteran with no assessable means who already qualifies for the maximum special allowance, and would tend to defeat the whole purpose of the special allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The means test is essential to ensure that the maximum benefits are channelled to those persons whose need is greatest and its abolition is not contemplated.</P>

      <P>The child income tax allowance, which was available to all qualifying taxpayers whether self-employed or taxed under PAYE, was withdrawn with effect from 6 April 1986.  Before its withdrawal, the allowance stood at £100 per qualifying child.  The cost of the allowance to the Exchequer for the 1985-86 tax year, the last year for which it was available, is estimated at about £30 million in respect of claims affecting some 734,000 children.</P>
      <P>The current value of the allowance when adjusted for inflation by reference to the consumer price index would be about £117.  The cost of restoring it at that level in the current tax year is estimated at about £26.5 million in a full year in respect of some 666,000 children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will recall, the revenue from the abolition of the child tax allowance in 1986 was used, along with other <Col N="525" /> moneys, to fund the introduction of child benefit, in place of the previous children's allowances schemes, at a rate sufficient to compensate standard rate taxpayers, then paying tax at 35 per cent, for its loss. The Government have announced that the rate of child benefit is to be increased by 5 per cent from October next; this incease will cost an estimated £10 million in a full year.  The Deputy will also be aware that in 1989 I introduced a child addition of £200 per qualifying child in conjunction with the income tax exemption limits, and increased it to £300 this year; the purpose of the addition is to benefit low-paid taxpayers with family responsibilities.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a certificate of tax-free allowances issued to the taxpayer on 9 March 1990, granting her a tax-free allowance of £5,812 for the current year i.e. £111.77 per week taxable at table R (30 per cent).  As the taxpayer's income will not greatly exceed the general exemption limit for the current year she is entitled to a measure of marginal relief in calculating her tax-free allowances for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amended certificate of tax-free allowances issued to the taxpayer on 11 April 1990 incorporating marginal relief. This certificate granted her a total tax-free allowance of £7,686 for the year i.e. £147.80 per week taxable at table T (53 per cent).  The effect of granting marginal relief is to reduce the overall tax liability. This is achieved because although the <Col N="528" /> rate of tax is higher the amount of income to which is applies is considerably less because of the increased allowances.</P>

      <P>The scheduled works of the Maigue catchment drainage scheme, which have been completed for some years now, have reduced significantly the incidence and duration of flooding in the Croom area.  However, they cannot guarantee a total immunity to flooding to the area which was vulnerable to severe flooding, often of a prolonged nature, pre-drainage.  Some flooding may therefore continue to occur especially in periods of exceptionally heavy rainfall.</P>

As indicated in the reply to the Deputy on 22 May last, Question No. 65, these problems are being resolved by the Commissioners of Public Works in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's Office and arrangements for sale are being settled with the Department of Justice, joint owners of the property. It is expected that a sale will be advertised in the near future.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the reply to a Parliamentary Question put down on 2 May 1989, column 881, No. 129, the question of the preservation of any buildings on the site will be a matter for the eventual purchasers and the planning authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together.  Sligo County Council, in a report on storm damage submitted to my Department in March 1990, estimated the cost of remedial works at coastal facilities to be £640,000.  Following discussions with Sligo County Council, my Department assessed the costs of damage caused by the recent storms to be of the order of £200,000.  My Department wrote to Sligo County Council, on 11 April, indicating that it was prepared to provide up to 75 per cent grant aid for remedial works on certain piers and harbours and up to 50 per cent grant aid towards repairs of other coastal damage.</P>
      <P>Sligo County Council submitted applications, on 9 May, for £150,000 grant aid in respect storm damage.  My Department will be contacting them regarding this within the next few days.</P>

      <P>The precise information requested is not available.</P>
      <P>The following table, prepared from the 1987 farm structure survey, gives, for Ireland and for Tipperary South Riding, estimates of the number of spouses who did some farmwork in the year ended 31 May 1989; and the number and percentage of those with another gainful activity, either as a major occupation or as a subsidiary occupation.  Estimates of the total number of farmers are also given.</P>
      <P>The farm structure survey is conducted every two to three years in accordance with EC Regulations.  The 1987 survey was based on a sample of 19,000 farms, 8.8 per cent of the total, and, thus, the results are subject to sampling and other survey errors.  Estimates at county level are subject to significantly higher sampling errors than those at State level and the results given in the table for south Tipperary should therefore be considered as providing broad indications only.</P>
      <P>The results at State level show that, of the estimated 71,800 spouses who carried out farmwork, approximately 56 per cent had another gainful activity &mdash; 46 per cent with the other gainful activity as their major occupation and 10 per cent with it as their subsidiary occupation.  The relevant percentages in Tipperary South Riding were similar to those at State level.</P>

      <P>Section 4 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986 empowers me as Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to nominate certain areas of the country as designated areas.  Industrial projects in designated areas are given preferential treatment in terms of the availability of State support.  I have no proposals at present to make any changes to the list of designated counties for the higher rate of industrial grants.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the decision of the previous Government to designate certain counties for the higher rate of fixed asset grant was based on a report entitled <i>Designation of Areas for Industrial Policy</i> produced by the National Economic and Social Council which recommended objective criteria for determining the areas to be designated. These criteria were based on labour market imbalance, which is a broadly defined measure of unemployment.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the day-to-day responsibility of the Industrial Development Authority and of other relevant State agencies to actively promote regions suffering from economic decline. I am confident that the IDA are doing everything they can to promote the development of Carrick-on-Suir and Cahir.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the fact that Dublin now has a major structural unemployment problem, he will establish, in conjunction with other Government Departments, a Special Task Force to bring forward immediate proposals to deal with this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Government action to deal with unemployment in Dublin involves several Ministers. This reply includes material supplied by the relevant Departments.</P>
      <P>The Government, in the agreed Programme for Government, 1989-1993, acknowledged the need for special measures to tackle the problem of unemployment in urban disadvantaged areas and set out their detailed plans for action to alleviate the problem.</P>
      <P>In that connection, the Deputy will be aware that the employment creation package which I announced on 27 September 1989 provided specifically for a number of special measures to be undertaken to relieve unemployment.  These measures involved an expansion of the social employment scheme through recruitment of an extra 1,000 people from urban disadvantaged areas; a stronger lead role for FÁS in initiating and organising community-based projects in such areas; and provision of £500,000 to assist towards the cost of materials for community youth training programme projects in targeted areas.  As intimated in my reply to a similar question on 23 May, 1990; considerable progress has been made in implementing these initiatives. In addition, it is now intended to expand SES numbers by an additional 5,000 to 15,000 by end-1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures are largely based on recommendations drawn up by the Ministerial Committee on Employment which is chaired by me and which includes my colleagues, the Ministers for Education, the Environment, Social Welfare, Industry and Commerce and a representative of the Minister for Finance.  The committee is exploring other possibilities <Col N="551" /> for reducing the overall level of unemployment which would also benefit inner city areas, which are most affected in this respect.  Given the large numbers of long term unemployed in Dublin city, the committee is particularly anxious to see more SES projects getting under way in that area as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>CERT, the State training agency for the hotel, catering and tourist industry, are also contributing to the process of inner city renewal in Dublin by locating their new national training centre and headquarters in Amiens Street.  Dublin-based training programmes for the hotel industry staff and for the unemployed will be centralised in the new premises which will offer purpose built training facilities.  The new centre is expected to be completed by 1991 and will be funded by the Exchequer, the ERDF and by the proceeds from the sale of CERT's former premises in Clonskeagh.</P>
    <P>The sub-group on job creation of the Central Review Committee on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has also considered the problems faced by areas of acute unemployment and has prepared a number of recommendations for dealing with the situation.  These include examining the possibilities for extending the urban renewal scheme, establishing a Dublin Inner City Renewal Authority and reviewing the contribution which housing co-operatives could make to job creation and to balance revitalisation in areas of acute unemployment.  The Deputy will be aware of the recent announcement by the Minister for the Environment extending the scope of the urban renewal scheme to additional areas of Dublin inner city.</P>
    <P>The IDA are also actively engaged in efforts to revitalise urban disadvantaged areas and to provide new employment opportunities for persons residing in such areas.  In Dublin alone, the IDA has spent over £20 million in providing modern and well designed new factory space around the inner city.  The IDA Enterprise Centre in Pearse Street have provided a 1990's work environment for over 560 people, while a similar style East Wall Road Enterprise Centre constructed in <Col N="552" /> recent years now houses 28 companies employing 320 people.</P>
    <P>The IDA are also spearheading the development of the International Financial Services Centre on the Custom House site which it is now estimated will create at least 2,000 new jobs in the 100 companies so far approved to set up there.</P>
    <P>In view of the wide range of Government initiatives currently in operation as detailed above, which are aimed at tackling the problem of unemployment in Dublin and in urban disadvantaged areas, I feel it would be unwise, at this stage, to narrow the focus of such activities by establishing a special task force to address the problems of Dublin alone.  The problem extends well beyond the confines of Dublin and needs to be, and is being, effectively tackled on a national basis, as provided for in the Programme for Government.</P>

      <P>Public servants issued at the modified rate are not covered for contributory old age pensions.  Depending on their service, persons in this situation could qualify for public service pension at a lower rate than the contributory pension. They can, however, apply for the means tested old age (non-contributory) pension.  A person who qualifies for this pension, even at a reduced rate, may also qualify for additional benefits such as the free electricity allowance, free television licence, free telephone rental allowance and for fuel vouchers during the winter months.</P>
      <P>The position of public service pensioners who qualify for a reduced public service pension because they had a mixture of full and limited social insurance cover is being examined at my request by the National Pensions Board.  Under its terms of reference the board is required to submit proposals to the Minister for Social Welfare on all aspects of a national pensions system.</P>
      <P>The overall pension arrangements for public servants and the contribution and other eligibility conditions governing entitlement to contributory pensions are among the issues being dealt with by the board.  The question of introducing <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for persons with a mixture of full and limited insurance will be considered in that context.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the board's report will be presented later this year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at the rate of £23.40 per week.  This was the rate appropriate to a married person with two children whose spouse had means of £79.76 per week.</P>
      <P>Based on his means, he was awarded a pre-retirement pension at the rate of £27.50 per week.  In addition he received £5 as a fuel allowance during the heating season which ended in April.</P>
      <P>The increase arose from the more favourable arrangements for calculating the rate payable to persons with means and to persons receiving temporary transitional supplements arising from the EC directive on equality in social security matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three books were issued in this case because of the various elements to be accommodated and the forthcoming budgetary changes from July.  He will be <Col N="555" /> receiving a total of £32.15 from July and in October, if his circumstances have not changed, he will receive an £8 per week supplement under the fuel allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>The alleviation allowance which was £5.80 before transfer to the pre-retirement allowance, will be payable at £7 per week from July 1990.  It is being paid at £8 per week in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the inconvenience that can arise for persons with more than one pension book.  Further computer developments will reduce the circumstances in which more than one book has to be issued.  Most persons now receive only one book.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>State and local authority development likely to have significant effects on the environment now require environmental impact assessment by virtue of the regulations which I made to implement EC Directive 85/337/EEC on environmental impact assessment, viz. the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 (S.I.

Other development by planning authorities within their functional areas may not contravene the relevant development plan.</P>

      <P>That position has now been altered, however, by the regulations which are made to implement EC Directive 85/337/EEC on Environmental Impact Assessment, viz. the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989 (S.I.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that animal experimentation has already been banned in the State of Bolzano in Italy because it has been proved to be scientifically fraudulent and given the large number of prescription drugs which are taken annually in this country, which may have been tested by these doubtful methods, if his Department has any figures for the number of Irish people who have been harmed as a direct result of taking such drugs.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that legislation enacted in the Province of Bolzano in Italy in July 1986 prescribes that there may not be any animal experimentation in the province even for scientific reasons unless with very specific authorisation.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental services in the Killarney area is a matter for the Southern Health Board.  I am aware that school dental services in Kerry generally had been under pressure because of the demands made for emergency adult treatment.  As the Deputy will be aware a special additional allocation has been made to each health board in 1990 to re-establish routine dental services for <Col N="573" /> adults.  I am satisfied that this should bring about a significant reduction in demand for emergency treatment with a consequential improvement in school services for children.</P>

I also decided to have the whole question of national school accommodation in the Portlaoise area examined by my Department in consultation with the authorities of the local schools.  That examination was carried out and having carefully considered its results I have decided that Knockmay national school be allowed to retain a third standard in the school; pupils transfer from Knockmay national school to Portlaoise schools for fourth class onwards; no further expansion of Knockmay national school for the present; the situation be kept under review in the light of demographic trends in the Portlaoise area.</P>
