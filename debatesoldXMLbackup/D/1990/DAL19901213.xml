      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 19, 20 and 21.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that 1, the sitting shall be suspended between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.; 2, business shall be interrupted at 9 p.m. tonight; 3, the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 19, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments include only amendments set down by the Minister for Health; 4, the Second Stage of No. 21 shall be taken at 7 p.m. and the order shall not resume and 5, the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty about the suspension, it is important that there be a break to facilitate staff and others.  However, as a result, we will lose an hour of important time for debate on the Child Care Bill, 1988.  In relation to <Col N="2394" /> that and item No. 3 as a means of ensuring that there will be at least some debate on all Parts and sections of the Bill remaining &mdash; there are over 100 amendments outstanding to be discussed on Report Stage &mdash; could there be agreement reached between the Government and other party Whips to schedule the remaining debate on these amendments so that all aspects of the Bill will be covered at least in part before we guillotine the debate at 7 p.m. this evening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the promised <Col N="2395" /> amendments to the solicitor's Acts will the Taoiseach say whether he will bring this matter forward speedily because of the plain need demonstrated in the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme last evening for adequate sanctions on professional people who become directors of banks which become involved in depriving people of their savings by means which are not legal or proper?  Will he agree that it is necessary that professional people, whether they be accountants or solicitors, be subject to proper discipline, externally accountable to the State for misdemeanours or failures in this area in regard to their responsibilities as directors of banks?  Furthermore, will he agree that we need, in the solicitors Act which is promised, and in whatever other regulatory legislation is necessary, tough, effective measures to ensure that this country does not become a haven for white collar crime?</P>

      <P>In one sentence may I say that, when the Bill has been published and circulated, I invite the Government to look at it closely.  I would say to them that this Bill not being brought forward in a party political, contentious way, that we would hope it could be agreed by all sides in the House and enacted early in the New Year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Debate resumes on amendments Nos. 119 to 124, inclusive.  Deputy Mary Flaherty was in possession.  We have a large group of related amendments which are being discussed together &mdash; Nos. 119, 119a, 120, 121, 122, amendment 1 to No. 122 and 124.  I am sure Members are conversant with precisely the stage we have arrived at.</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 119:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>24.&mdash;(1)  If in any proceedings under Part IV or section 36, 37 or 38 the child to whom the proceedings relate is not already a party, the court may, where it is satisfied having regard to the age, understanding and wishes of the child and the circumstances of the case that it is necessary in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice to do so, order that the child be joined as a party to, or shall have such of the rights of a party as may be specified by the court in, either the entirety of the proceedings or such issues in the proceedings as the court may direct.  The making of any such order shall not require the intervention of a next friend in respect of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where the court makes an order under subsection (1) or a child is a party to the proceedings otherwise than by reason of such an order, the court may, if it thinks fit, appoint a solicitor to represent the child in the proceedings <Col N="2400" /> and give directions as to the performance of his duties (which may include, if necessary, directions in relation to the instruction of counsel).</P>
    <P>(3)  The making of an order under subsection (1) or the fact that a child is a party to the proceedings otherwise than by reason of such an order shall not prejudice the power of the court under section 26 (2) to refuse to accede to a request of a child made thereunder.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a solicitor is appointed under subsection (2), the costs and expenses incurred on behalf of a child exercising any rights of a party in any proceedings under this Act shall be paid by the health board concerned. The health board may apply to the court to have the amount of any such costs or expenses measured or taxed.</P>
    <P>(5)  The court which has made an order under subsection (2) may, on the application to it of a health board, order any other party to the proceedings in question to pay to the board any costs or expenses payable by that board under subsection (3).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of Health).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have more or less concluded.  I have recorded my welcome for the extent the Minister has moved in providing their own legal representation for children, but I regret he has not moved as far as Deputy Yates wished in his amendment which was ruled out of order.</P>
      <P>One of the important issues raised by one of these amendments is the selection of judges and how we can ensure that judges dealing with child care and other family cases have sensitivity and experience.  While we are trying to touch on it in this Bill, it is clearly a matter that needs further and more direct attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the critical areas of the Bill.  We have dealt with barring orders for adults and with the <Col N="2401" /> major issue of mandatory reporting.  This is the third major issue in this legislation, the need for a proper children's court structure.  We already know that the District and Circuit Court structures are incapable of applying little more than judicial roulette to the sensitive conveyor belt type of family cases they have before them.</P>
      <P>In our amendments &mdash; which concur with amendments in the names of Deputies Howlin and Ferris &mdash; we are proposing that a new structure be established.  I bring to the Minister's attention particularly the proposal made by the Child Care Coalition that we set up a guardian <i>ad litem</i> system.  This is to allow the courts to have a panel of experts available to them who will be called &ldquo;guardians <i>ad litem</i>&rdquo;.  These are court appointed professionals who have a specific and independent role in relation to children who are the subject of court hearings.  The main purpose of these guardians is not to have a therapeutic role but rather to specifically serve the purpose of court hearings.</P>
      <P>We have an adversarial as opposed to an inquisitorial legal system and the interests of parents and children and professionals working in agencies tend to compete.  We are proposing that guardians be appointed and operate independently with the right to work with children individually and meet all relevant parties to the case.  This is the case in other countries.  Guardians first came to prominence in the UK when it was found necessary to protect the interests of children who were going for adoption because of competing interests of adoptive and natural parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago in the new Judicial Separation Bill arrangements were made to provide professionals to report to the court.  However, there are two deficiencies in this.  First, it does not take into account other child welfare cases such as the proceedings under this Bill.  Secondly, it does not cover the costs.  In amendment No. 119 the Minister is allowing for a limited provision of access to a solicitor, and I welcome that as far as it goes. However, I believe there is a strong case <Col N="2402" /> for a judge appointing a guardian to protect the interests of children in such cases.</P>
    <P>To date we have a lack of a tradition of use of guardians <i>ad litem.</i>  While there is provision where a judge can appoint a solicitor to act as guardian in very limited cases, such as a road traffic accident, it is not satisfactory.  I do not want to go on into this in depth although I could do so. But I feel this is what is aimed at in amendment No. 123 which provides that the child shall have &ldquo;at its disposal a range of professionals to give evidence on behalf of that child&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 122 in the names of Deputies Howlin and Ferris serves the same point.  It provides that &ldquo;A panel of specialist child care advisers shall be established in each Health Board area and shall be available to give expert and independent advice to justices hearing proceedings....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This coupled with the establishment of children's courts which would have specialised judges with specialised training and skills, as opposed to the present situation of a voluntary interest of judges in this area, means we will have the first development of a proper family court structure that could be extended into every other area of family law.  We will be challenging a vote on this point of guardian <i>ad litem.</i>  There is a need for a panel of special advisers because that is a critical area where expertise can be brought in.</P>
    <P>As a person who has had direct experience in two District Court hearings earlier this year as a witness, I can say that the courts are totally unsatisfactory.  I have no problems with the competence of the district justices who deal with everything from parking tickets to family cases to criminal cases.  The work they do is amazing but the facilities in the district courts where criminals have to queue up with witnesses and others is simply appalling.  As I am sure our legal friends will admit, there are many harrowing circumstances.  That is not the fault of the district justices but we need a separate structure to deal with family cases.  We will be challenging one vote on this package, but the issue is clearcut.  The Labour <Col N="2403" /> Party, The Workers' Party and ourselves have a clear picture of what we want to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how Deputy Yates is challenging a vote on these sections because these are probably the sections of the Bill in which the Minister has gone furthest.  Last night I complimented the Minister and his advisers, and I know that the Attorney General was involved in drafting these amendments to take care of some of the queries and problems some of us had on Committee Stage and here.  I referred last night to what Supreme Court Judge O'Flaherty said in a case involving the Children Act 1908, that there should be some provision for legal representation for children.  The way the Minister has achieved this is appropriate.  To give a child an absolute right to legal representation in all child care cases is probably unnecessary.  A child of from three to five years would not really need legal representation if we accept that in all cases the health board would have the interests of the child as their paramount consideration.  Where a child of from 17 to 18 would have his or her own opinion as to what was to be done in the court about him or her it is preferable that the section leave it to the judge to decide in what circumstances he sees fit that legal representation be given to the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other element of the section relates to legal costs.  I spoke to the Minister and other Members on this side of the House since the last Special Committee meeting.  If we give representation to children we have to give them the means to pay for it.  It is inconceivable that a child of 17 would be able to afford representation in court.  Some mechanism had to be devised.  I understand there was a proposal to tie this into the free legal aid system.  I can fully appreciate the difficulty there because it is a different Department.  Probably the best solution would be to make the health board responsible for the cost, or alternatively to give the justice discretion, in <Col N="2404" /> some circumstances, to charge the cost against other people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates made a point about a professional body of witnesses being available.  Amendment 119a takes care of all the circumstances that would arise in cases to do with child care.  It gives a discretion to the justice to call whatever witnesses are necessary or to ask for further reports.  That happens in most legal cases particularly in relation to children. The justices ask for and get reports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the harrowing circumstances in district courts. My experience in the area of family law and child care is that justices are well aware of the sensitivity of these cases and they ensure that the families of the children do not have to mix with the criminal element in the District Court.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment 119, it is very important to give legal representation to a child and to pay for it.  In cases where there is a single parent family and where the parent has in some way abused the child, it is very important that there should be, particularly for the older child, legal representation available because the child would not have anyone to turn to.  They would not be able to turn to the health board.  They would not even know these people, except perhaps the social worker.  They would not be able to turn to the parent because the parent would be the alleged abuser.  It is important to allow some element of legal representation for the child.  The Minister and his Department are to be congratulated for the forward step in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for submitting amendments Nos. 119 and 119a.  These amendments to a large extent address some of the problems we in the Opposition had with this section. The amendments go a long way towards addressing the concept of a children's court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Fitzpatrick's view that a children's court is not the correct name because we are not trying children.  We are trying to protect their interests.  I accept that for the purposes of a hearing <Col N="2405" /> in relation to an abused child the health board act as parents or guardians in the interim period when they have sought an order for either care or supervision. During the trial period the health board acting as parent or guardian had the power to pay for legal expenses of the child.  That is a major step forward.  It is refreshing to find a Minister at this stage of the Bill going that far down the road to ensure that children at risk and the need of legal assistance for them are catered for.  Subsection (4) of amendment No. 119 reads:</P>
    <P>... the costs and expenses incurred on behalf of a child exercising any rights of a party in any proceedings under this Act shall be paid by the health board concerned.</P>
    <P>That means that the health board are obliged to seek and pay for legal assistance.  This is a backdoor to free legal aid which takes into account the difficulties people have in seeking free legal aid because of staffing and financial problems.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 122, seeks to set up a panel of specialist advisers in the child care area.  We envisage that that would be helpful to the Judiciary.  Deputy Yates suggests in amendment No. 124 that a panel of district justices should be selected on the basis of sensitivity and previous experience.  Pending the appointment of those district justices, or indeed the formula suggested by Deputy Fennell, Deputy Howlin and I feel that there should be specialist advisers available in the event of a district justice requiring such advice or assistance.  It would not be obligatory on the district justice to call on these people but we are anxious that the panel be available.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's amendment No. 119a he provides that a court may, of its own motion or on the application of any other party to the proceedings, by an order under this section give such directions as it thinks proper to procure a report from such person as it may nominate on any question affecting the welfare of the <Col N="2406" /> child.  That is the same concept we have in mind but we are anxious to have the panel set up in the event of it being requested.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said that these experts are normally health board employees, perhaps in health board area outside the area where the case is being held.  Surely within the Department of Health or indeed in the Law Reform Commission, experts who would advise and compile reports for the Minister and make their views publicly known on these subjects.  There are people who specialise in this area and I am quite sure they would be honoured to be considered for a panel which would be available to justices.  That is all we are asking in amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 122.</P>
    <P>This would not be another bureaucratic structure and there would be no question of paying somebody who may never be asked for their advice.  It is a question of designating people who would give their services or advice, if required, and in that event they would be paid a stipend.  We want to make sure that these people are available if they are required, and I think the Minister had this in mind in his amendment No. 119a.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, as this part of the Bill is recommitted, the Minister will have an opportunity to consider our suggestions, and there may be no need for a vote on this section if we can reach agreement. The Minister has been so forthcoming up to now in other sections that he might be able to satisfy Deputies on all sides of the House, including Deputy Yates, who has a commitment to ensure that this Bill is the best possible before it is guillotined at 7 p.m. today.  We hope the Minister will be forthcoming in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important part of the Bill dealing with jurisdiction and procedure.  Section 23 requires the court to have regard to the rights and duties of parents and to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration in any proceedings in relation to the care and protection of the child. Section 24 requires the District Court and the Circuit Court on appeal to have <Col N="2407" /> jurisdiction to hear and determine care proceedings.  Section 25 provides that these proceedings will be heard in private and will be as informal as possible, and that is very welcome.  That procedure will be very important in the implementation of the legislation, but experience shows that what happens in practice is very different.</P>
      <P>Recently in my area of Cork there was a long delay in finding a district justice to hear an inquiry and there are many other cases about which one could go on at length.  There is going to be a problem in this area.  As regards the amendment proposed by Deputy Howlin and Deputy Ferris, it is inevitable that such a body, perhaps called a review body, be established by the health board.  Within each health board there are many different sections.  Again, from experience one finds there is a lack of co-ordination in health boards but we do not blame them because it is due to their volume of work. They do not have time to plan or co-ordinate the policies that should be implemented.</P>
      <P>I favour very strongly this amendment. The review body need not necessarily be a statutory body but would have functions of overseeing the problems of children in care, supervision orders and so on.  At the outset I outlined the importance of this section but without such a review body I would see major problems arising. We are dealing with a legal minefield, and a review body of that nature would help to co-ordinate the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always been an advocate of some change in the courts system, especially in relation to the very sensitive area of dealing with children. I spoke on Committee Stage about the excellent system in Scotland.  The Minister deserves great credit for the innovative amendments he has brought in and the Bill deserves more praise than it has received from the outside world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that a child would have representation is very important.  For instance, where a child of 15 or 16 years is living at home and his parents find him <Col N="2408" /> too much to handle, the health board may decide that it would be in his best interests to take him into care.  The child will see that the health board is working on behalf of the parent, although that may be a fallacy.  He may feel he has been unjustly treated and that he has had no say.  This provision will definitely go a long way towards alleviating those fears, and therefore, very important.  I know of several cases in my health board area and perhaps the problems would have been diminished if such a provision was in place.  I am glad to see that the cost factor is being considered in the Bill.  We are all aware that if people have not enough money they may be left without representation, and that is very unfair.</P>
    <P>As regards the Opposition amendments which propose the establishment of a board of advisers, we should not be too restrictive as regards a justice and his access to reports and expert advice. Amendment No. 119a covers the points raised in the amendment proposed by Deputies Howlin and Ferris in that it directs a court to give directions &ldquo;as it thinks proper to procure a report from such person as it may nominate on any question...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The court may be able to nominate experts, perhaps outside health boards.  I appreciate what Deputy Fitzpatrick said, that many experts are attached to health board areas but the courts would have access to outside advice.  There are many experts working in educational establishments and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 124 tabled by Deputy Yates, if you are not in the legal field and have not worked within the court system you might feel that it might be necessary to choose a district justice, someone who would have had experience in family and child care.  I do not know how district justices manage as they have to deal with anything from parking fines to the family courts.  I commend them for doing away with the court formality in a children's court.  Everybody is nervous going to court but, in that kind of area, the district justice has done a lot.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Yeats's point that <Col N="2409" /> a district justice should be sensitive to the issues brought before him &mdash; or her &mdash; but it is very difficult to choose someone. &ldquo;Sensitive&rdquo; could mean many things and it is very difficult to ascertain what a &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; person is.  It means different things to different people.  I know that most of the people who work within the family court system have a lot of experience in that area and most district justices are familiar with the problems and keep themselves briefed.  After all, you can be sensitive to a situation but you might also have to make a harsh decision in the best interests of the child.  A personal viewpoint cannot influence a decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I still feel as good about the Minister's amendments as I did last night.  I commend him on introducing them and I do not think there is much difference between us in what we are trying to achieve.  Deputy Coughlan said it would be difficult to select &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; district justices.  Recently, when speaking about a proposal for reform, somebody said we should emulate the American system where a Senate Selection Committee examine the credentials of various applicants.  Maybe that only applies to Supreme Court or High Court Judges &mdash; they have been men in America&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, men and women.  At any rate, their attitudes to sensitive areas are checked, maybe that is the way we should look at the problem. It is obvious that the desires of people to move towards a structured family court and children's court system will not be solved overnight.  It will be done by small reforms and changes.  We will not get another opportunity for a long time to reform and change this area and that is why it is important to give time to those two amendments to make sure that, when we pass this section, it has all the provisions we possibly need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In courts in the United Kingdom specialised people in the whole area of <Col N="2410" /> child psychology, child rehabilitation, theraphy, marriage breakdown and mediation are very effective in helping to make decisions at court level.  Given the Minister's commitment to the section and the changes he has brought in, I hope he will go a little further along the road. When we talk about changing the system we must also look at the buildings, the environment in which these cases are heard.  I will not labour the point because I do not want to hold up the debate, but resources are needed to update cour-houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock gave a graphic description of the courts in this area with people crowded in corridors in damp, grim, bleak buildings, which were more suited to Victorian times.  What is the role of the Minister for Health in this legislation?  When money is being discussed the Minister of State will not be sitting at the Cabinet table, it will be the Minister for Health.  There is a need for substantial spending in this area and there should be provision for resources in the budget.  The Minister for Health should be here listening to Members and contributing to this very important Bill.  I question his contribution and role in terms of spending needs.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister for Health has been very involved in this and Members on this side of the house had a number of meetings with him and the Minister of State in relation to this matter.  Both Ministers are fully commited to it but the Minister has the brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 119 &mdash; subsection (5) of the new section &mdash; may cause a difficulty from a practical point of view in relation to apportionment of costs in a court case where the health board are given the power to apply to the court to pass on the cost to some other party. There may be a problem in passing it on <Col N="2411" /> to one or more parties and, even in the case of one party, maybe that party would not be obliged to pay all the costs.  Perhaps the Minister could bring in something on the lines of &ldquo;pay to the board any costs or expenses or portion thereof payable by the board&rdquo;.  He should also consider the point regarding one or more parties being involved.</P>
    <P>Is Deputy Yates opposing the fact that the Minister is giving legal representation to children in child care cases and the right to costs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am motivated to speak again, although I contributed last night, on this group of amendments because the tone of the debate has altered somewhat, which is a pity.  I should like to restate my deep appreciation to the Minister of State for his approach to the attitude of, not only Opposition Deputies, but to the majority of Deputies who wanted to fundamentally change the atmosphere in which proceedings in relation to children were taken.</P>
      <P>We had hoped to achieve more dramatic results.  We wanted to establish children's courts, separate and completely different from the normal court, with a different panel of judges and justices presiding who would be expertly trained and be totally informal with none of the normal trappings of the Judiciary. We did not achieve that, but, frankly, as I stated last night, we have gone further down the road than I had anticipated we could go.  For that I am very grateful to the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 119 and 119a are extremely good and I heartily welcome them.  They give support to the child; they give independence and legal representation to the child.  There are some funding aspects included to allow for a procedure to circumvent the waiting list for legal aid.  A further amendment in the Minister's name does away with the gowns and the trappings that I think <Col N="2412" /> should be done away with in all court cases.</P>
    <P>The only argument remaining, because I think we have built a broad consensus, is for the extra couple of steps we can go towards attaining the ideal, and I think they are reasonable.  We will not have a panel of independent judges and justices who are specifically trained in this area. It is a reasonable request &mdash; and the Minister has touched upon it himself somewhat in amendment No. 119a &mdash; that at least there would be a panel of experts available to advise the justice who would be independent of the proceedings before him, who would not have a vested interest but would have an expert knowledge in the child care area to advise the justice and give direction and assistance to him in relation to his decision.  It in no way compromises his independence.  It was suggested by Deputy Coughlan that it would somehow put pressure on the judge.  The justice could have regard to the recommendations and could decide whether to have their advice taken into account at all.  That would be one further step on the road.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates's amendment No. 124 is a further step, and a welcome one.  We can build barriers if we like and say it is impossible to select people on the basis of sensitivity and previous experience. Deputy Fennell last night indicated the Task Force on Child Care considered that it was possible and that there are other mechanisms that could be found &mdash; she suggested another one this morning &mdash; if we were committed to doing that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to lose sight of the fundamentals.  We have come a long way towards achieving our goal and for that I applaud and congratulate the Minister. Let me say on a personal note that I am glad it is the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, we are dealing with and not his senior Minister because we seem to be getting more ground conceded.  I think he is approaching this debate on the basis that he is not the fount of all wisdom and that the process of making law is a collective process for this House.  Sometimes Ministers come in here with the view that they are the law-makers and <Col N="2413" /> that it is a sign of weakness if they concede.  That has not been the experience all of us have had in the many months we have been involved in this Bill and for that I am grateful to the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>In conclusion &mdash; and I hope we can bring this section to a conclusion and not go back to Committee Stage again &mdash; I am asking the Minister of State to reflect on all that has been said not only during this brief Report Stage but at the Special Committee and see whether he could take those extra few steps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the passage of this section for long.  I want to record my appreciation of the sections introduced by Minister Noel Treacy and acknowledge his openness and commitment to this Bill.  We have all found it a learning and, indeed, a pleasurable experience working in Committee and on Report Stage as a result of that sense of co-operating and working together.</P>
      <P>So much has been introduced already but we still have so much to learn from other models.  Deputy Coughlan is quite right when she said we could all learn a tremendous amount about court proceedings from the Scots.  They have a panel of professionals that the child could recognise as supporting him and not sitting in judgment on him.  That was a tremendous breakthrough.  That was then integrated into the new British Children Act, 1989, following some terrible cases where as a result of a fall down in information and co-ordination, children actually died.  People belatedly looked to find where the loopholes and the gaps were and set up a specialist panel with a guardian appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Howlin says, a specialist panel could be there to serve when needed and could be of tremendous support psychologically and emotionally because, as Deputy Coughlan pointed out, one of the greatest difficulties children have is this sense of isolation, of the whole world being against them, of the establishment being against them, and they need to know that there is somebody objective and professional there rooting for them.  That is of the utmost <Col N="2414" /> importance.  When we have reached so much agreement and have gone so far down the line on this section, it would be tragic if we could not agree to have a panel of specialist child care advisers available to give evidence on behalf of the child, as suggested by Deputies Yates and Howlin.  They will probably not be necessary in every case but it would complete all the functions and powers we are asking for in this section.</P>
    <P>Let me throw in my tuppence worth with regard to the judges because this has long been a hobby of mine as well.  The French method is to choose law students from law schools who wish to go forward to become judges and they have a three year period of training at a special college in all the specialist areas that they would like to work in after they are qualified. While we have not debated that here fully yet, it is something we should look at with regard to children's courts and the whole area of law reform as we are becoming a much more complex, sophisticated and compassionate society.  That is another way that we could find the sensitivity and the specialist skills we are asking for from judges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think brevity would be appreciated.  We have been discussing this Bill over the last 12 months.  For me it was a learning experience.  I went in thinking I knew a lot about child care and came out humbled.</P>
      <P>There were three great themes that we have debated over the last 12 months. One was in regard to central versus local control in regard to child care.  I hope we got the mixture right on that.  The relationship of the health board, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the justice who would be dealing with the legal aspects, was another.  I hope we got the mixture right.  We have come to the last great theme and it is the specialist versus the generalist attitude towards child care, especially as it works its way through the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the amendments from the Opposition come down on the specialist line of thought, that specialists would treat the cases better, more humanely and, perhaps, the child's interest would be better <Col N="2415" /> served by obtaining specialist advice. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent a justice seeking specialist advice.  In fact, I would hope that the justices handling these cases would feel free to seek specialist advice from those working in the fields.  Generally, I go for a well rounded broadly based background man or woman sitting on the bench.  My experience is that specialists normally develop tunnel vision over the years and they see only the immediate problem without drawing back and getting a full picture of the child in his environment and background.  Deputies opposite may say, &ldquo;This is your background, you come from the general practice side&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A person dealing with a case must have a broadly based education background without necessarily having specialist knowledge and the other vital component that must be brought to bear is commonsense.  We can have highly educated people, highly trained specialists, on the bench dealing with these cases but if they do not have commonsense the whole future of the child is in serious trouble.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, we are in some difficulty regarding the position in which the Whips have placed us.  We are now on section 24, there are 68 sections in the Bill and we have to conclude the debate by 7 p.m.  There will be a sos and Question Time.  I propose, therefore, with the agreement of the House, that we consider completing up to section 39 the end of Part VI, which deals with care issues by 1.30 p.m.  That would leave us to deal with supervision of pre-schools after lunch and take us up to amendment No. 159.  We are now debating amendment No. 119.  There are many important issues to be discussed.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I support what Deputy Yates has proposed.

      <P>Perhaps we should refresh and restructure ourselves when we have disposed of these amendments. I am very grateful for the warm contributions that have been made on these amendments.  We have had a long discussion, both in the Special Committee and in the House, on the composite group of amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of legal representation for a child involved in care proceedings <Col N="2417" /> was one of the major topics we discussed on Committee Stage.  I have had several consultations on this matter to achieve what is proposed here.  These consultations were personal, private, legal, public, departmental, official, parliamentary, ministerial and governmental.  After all these deliberations this is what we have brought forward.  I want to assure Deputy Fennell, and the House, of the very detailed, personal commitment given by the Minister for Health.  He was always supportive.  He met me, and some of my colleagues on a number of occasions and he met my officials on many occasions.  We had major difficulties in trying to find a legal way in which we could encompass what we have proposed.  After we had due discussion with the Attorney General and his staff, for which we are grateful, the Minister took the proposals to Cabinet and got clearance for them.  We have the full imprimatur of Government and the Minister.  As Deputy Ahern has said, I have responsibility for this legislation and I have special responsibility within the Department on a Government order. The Minister for Health is not here and that is the only reason he is not.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 119 will empower a court to make a child a party to all or part of the proceedings and to appoint a solicitor to represent the child in any case where the court is satisfied that this is necessary in the interests of the child.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that a court might exercise this discretionary power when dealng with an application relating to an older child who is at odds with the health board in relation to the board's plans for him. The court would obviously have to be satisfied that the child has sufficient understanding to instruct a solicitor.</P>
    <P>The amendment, generally speaking, gives effect to a recommendation in the Law Reform Commission's final report on child sexual abuse that a child involved in care proceedings should have a right to independent representation by a legally qualified person.  Where a solicitor is appointed by order of the court, the costs and expenses, including solicitor's fees, incurred, will be paid by the health board <Col N="2418" /> involved in the proceedings unless the court orders otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell raised the question of the free legal aid scheme.  I would point out that in my amendment No. 119 the legal representation to be afforded to children will not be provided through that scheme.  There is a technical reason for this, children under the age of 18 years are not covered by the terms of the free legal aid scheme.  What we have provided is that the cost of legal representation provided by the court under amendment No. 119 will be paid by the health board. Thus the question of the legal aid scheme does not arise here.  I am sure the House will be happy with that.</P>
    <P>Under amendment No. 119a before the House the court will be given wide powers to procure reports from any person it may nominate in relation to any question affecting the welfare of the child.  This amendment is similar to a section in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act and in my view meets adequately the point being made by Deputy Yates in his amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin raised the question of the children's courts and Deputy Yates has included it in amendment No. 120. The introduction of legislation to provide for children's courts would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice. While I can see many merits and advantages in such a development, I would not be happy to delay the passage of this much needed Bill to await the possible establishment of family courts.  If, at some stage in the future, a system of family courts were to be set in place, it would be a relatively simple matter to transfer jurisdiction in relation to child care proceedings to a family court but this would necessitate a major amendment to the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, for which I would have no responsibility.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 121 contains certain provisions which will be to prohibit the wearing of wigs and gowns by members of the Judiciary and by barristers when dealing with proceedings under this Bill. The new subsection (4) contained in amendment No. 122 provides that proceedings in the High Court arising out of <Col N="2419" /> the Bill should be as informal as possible. There is already such a provision in section 25 (2) in relation to the District Court and the Circuit Court so I am sure that this new provision will be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <P>In response to amendment 1 to amendment No. 122, which has been tabled by Deputies Howlin and Ferris, I would ask the Deputies to appreciate the significance on what amendment No. 119a provides for.  It gives the court a wide ranging power to procure a report from any person it considers appropriate in the particular circumstances of the case before it on any question affecting the welfare of the child.  Equally importantly, it gives any party to the proceedings the right to request the court to procure a report from any person nominated by that party.  In addition it will allow a party to the proceedings to call the person who prepares the report to give evidence to the court on the question at issue.  Not alone can they produce a written report which the court can consider but the court in its wisdom, or even at the request of another party, can have the professional person who prepared the report called before it to give oral evidence and verify the written report they have presented.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 119a would enable the justice to call on the services of an unlimited number of persons with expert knowledge in child care.  This is essentially what Deputies Howlin and Ferris are seeking to achieve in amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 122.  However, my amendment goes even further in that it will also allow a party to the proceedings to ask the justice to call on the services of such specialists.</P>
    <P>In line with what Deputies Howlin and Ferris are requesting I will ensure in all consultations with the health boards and in the preparation of guidelines for them that they are advised of the need to have a core of professional staff available in a District Court area and who could be called to any part of the country.  The difficulty with the amendment proposed by the Deputies is that they have not specified whether it is the court, the <Col N="2420" /> health board or the State who shall provide the specialist group.  There is a slight technical defect in the amendment.  That broad latitude will be encompassed in the guidelines which we hope to agree with the health boards.</P>
    <P>I have to say that I am astonished at Deputy Yates' attitude to this whole issue.  As I said last night, this matter was addressed at the Special Committee and at that time I was unable to meet the wishes of many Deputies.  However, as I said earlier I have consulted widely on the issue in the meantime.  Once I was convinced of the merits of the case I worked tirelessly together with my officials to ensure that children at risk, which is what the Bill is about, would have the maximum protection possible. I am satisfied that this is a major and imaginative step forward in our legislation.  I want to thank the Deputies on all sides of the House who have acknowledged this fact.  I was very gratified by their remarks.</P>
    <P>What we are debating here is one of the most caring and imaginative pieces of legislation to have come before this House in a very long time.  During the past few days the Government and I have been attacked by some Deputies for not being progressive enough in some areas of the Bill.  I do not accept that allegation. This provision has been acknowledged by most Deputies as very progressive but Deputy Yates, in particular, cannot accept it.  Instead he has put down a number of amendments, as is his right, and is calling for a vote.  I do not think his attitude reflects the consensus of shared acceptance or the warmth of the welcome which had been expressed by Members on all sides of the House for this provision.  I believe it would be better if there was agreement by all sides to accept the proposal rather than having it voted through by way of a division.  In the interest of the children of the nation and of good law there should be unanimity about the amendments we have brought forward.  They are not my amendments; they have been brought forward as a result of joint collective efforts with the best expert and legal advice available and <Col N="2421" /> with governmental approval.  In the interests of the children of the nation we should agree to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 15, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;27.&mdash;Where a child is in care it shall be the duty of the health board to allow the child maintain contact with his brothers, sisters, relations and friends and <Col N="2425" /> to facilitate visits of the parents should the child so wish.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment goes further than the Minister's proposal by providing for access to children in care by other family members, such as brothers, sisters, relations and friends.  It is important to maintain the maximum possible family and personal contact with such children who may feel isolated.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed at the Special Committee on 4 April.  At that time the Minister said he realised that the phrase &ldquo;maintain contact&rdquo; may envisage more than just access by persons to children in care.  Therefore, I am going further than what the Minister is proposing.  I believe it is very important to maintain these links.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <P>To use Deputy Yates's words, he certainly goes further than the Minister &mdash; he goes too far.  The truth of the matter is that this amendment would allow a person who may have abused a child an unqualified right of access to that child.</P>
      <P>There is no qualification in the amendment as to who may or may not visit a child.  Accordingly, it would not be in the best interests of the child and, without qualification, I would strongly oppose it because the Minister's amendment includes the qualification that the individual visiting the child would have to have a bona fide interest in the child. It is necessary to insert that safeguard without any question of doubt.</P>

I accepted an amendment yesterday in the names of Deputies Howlin and Ferris which strengthens the section by requiring health boards not just to allow access but to facilitate it.

      <P>In page 16, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;Where a justice has made an order under Part IV directing that a child be placed or maintained in the care of a health board, a justice may for the purpose of executing that order issue a warrant authorising a member of the Garda Síochána, accompanied by such other members of the Garda Síochána or such other persons as may be necessary, to enter (if need be by force) any house or other place specified in the warrant (including any building or part of a building, tent, <Col N="2428" /> caravan, or other temporary or moveable structure, vehicle, vessel, aircraft or hovercraft) where the child is or where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is and to deliver the child into the custody of the health board.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to close off a loophole which has recently come to light.  Section 13 (3) enables a justice making an emergency care order to grant a warrant to the Garda to search for the child and deliver him up to the health board.  However, there is no equivalent provision where an interim care order or a care order is being made.  The purpose of this amendment is to make good this gap by giving a justice the power to issue a warrant to enable the Garda to search for children who are the subject of interim care orders and care orders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to section 30 of the Bill which provides the health board with a range of options when deciding where to place a child.  They will have the option of either placing the child in foster care or residential care, adopting the child or making other suitable arrangements &mdash; I presume boarding out.  What I am seeking is a legal preference in favour of fosterage.  It is important that this House makes a clear statement that it believes that the family environment is the best possible setting of alternative care for children.  Many reports have indicated that this is the best option when a child is removed.  It is my view that the offending adult should be removed first, where possible, but, unfortunately, we could not reach agreement on that point. However, some statement should be made to the effect that there is a preference for foster care having regard to <Col N="2429" /> the need to promote fosterage and the excellent work being done in that area. We are all aware of the great joy and happiness that many children have found in new homes in fosterage which led to their adoption.  I feel very strongly about this issue and believe that this area is underfunded.  This issue needs to be debated and I ask for support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur entirely with Deputy Yates who said that foster care is very important and an excellent and valuable form of care.  I pay tribute to everyone involved.  However I do not believe that we should create a legal preference in favour of foster care over other forms of care.  The Bill should be equal in its acknowledgement of the need for diverse types of care.  The needs of some children can only be met in a residential setting while other children may require specialised therapeutic care which the average foster parents could not provide. We should leave the question of the most appropriate form of care for each child to be determined by the professional staff.  We are fortunate to have very caring and high quality professional staff who make judgments having regard to the circumstances and the needs of each individual child.  Consequently, I would be grateful if the Deputy would withdraw his amendment.</P>

Amendment No. 133a proposes to insert a definition of &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo; in the Bill and amendments Nos. 131a and 137a are consequential on the insertion of the new definition.  In view of the publicity given to our discussion on Tuesday I would like to clarify my position in relation to amendment No. 4 and foster care generally.</P>
      <P>I was unable to accept amendment No. 4 because it was technically defective but I want to reject suggestions made by certain Deputies that I and my Department have no commitment to foster care and do not value the work being done by foster parents or that we are in any way negative or uncaring towards foster parents.  The Foster Care Association will verify and confirm our full, positive and constant support and commitment to the wonderful work they are doing.  We have a wonderful relationship with them and salute and thank them sincerely.  We look forward to working with them for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and my Department have the height <Col N="2431" /> of respect and admiration for foster parents and the great work they do.  They provide in invaluable service to the most deprived children of the nation and I want to place this on the record of Dáil Éireann in order to set the record straight.  Consequently, I hope that these amendments can be accepted.</P>

This amendment, on top of the regulations he is going to introduce, will make sure that we have a proper code for foster care and the promotion of fosterage.  As the House is aware, the Minister has the right of reply in this truncated Report Stage and I ask him when replying to state, seeing that he is so committed to the Irish Foster Care Association and so much in favour of the related aspects of fosterage, if he is prepared to increase the resources made available to the health boards as practical proof and evidence of his good intentions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendments submitted by the Minister which clearly define &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo;.  As I mentioned earlier, if there was recourse to the law it would be difficult to define the meaning of &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo; in the absence of such a definition.  Amendment No. 133a which clearly defines &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo; should be very helpful to all concerned and I welcome that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed the need for such a definition on Tuesday last.  The Minister subsequently circulated an amendment on white paper which we were satisfied met the concern expressed <Col N="2432" /> by everybody on this side of the House. It is important that &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo; be defined in legislation and this is being done in the Minister's amendments, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>There are many foster-parents in my constituency and I know the extremely good work they do.  At times they are equal to adoptive parents in the service they give to children who in the long term may have no future.  When the occasion arises for the health board to take back the child there is much trauma.</P>
      <P>Foster-parents often love these children and it breaks their hearts when they are taken away, especially if they have cared for them from the age of three days or, perhaps, six months.  It is a heartbreak to be told by the health board to surrender a bouncing baby.  We are not able to legislate for the sensitive area of breaking the bond between foster-parent and baby.  No words of mine can adequately record the work of foster-parents.  Adoptive parents, although they may have to wait for years to be blessed with a child or have to go to Romania to find one, know that they have that child for his or her lifetime, except during the initial period when the natural mother maintains some rights.</P>
      <P>I am glad that for the first time the importance of foster-parents is being recognised.  I hope we will continue to look at their special needs and remember the understanding they need in the care they give to children.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment wholeheartedly.  The recognition of foster-parents in the Bill, and the legal definition, represent an extremely important milestone in the history of Irish family law.  Foster-parents have given a tremendous amount to the care of children over the years.  The fact that they are now recognised in statute law for the first time is an indication that this legislation is proving to be the most progressive in the area of family law, possibly this century.</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates is not correct in saying that this is the first time we have had a definition of foster-parent on the Statute Book.  There has been such a definition in our foster care regulations for many years.  I am glad now to be able to insert a definition in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates referred to resources for foster care.  The development and expansion of our foster care programme will be one of the priority issues to be addressed and funded when the Bill is implemented. I have no difficulty in giving such a commitment to the House and we will convey it to the health boards.  As soon as the Bill becomes law I, the Minister for Health and our officials will analyse and study the legal and financial implications contained therein.  I pledge to the House increased resources for childcare services in the future.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Sherlock's query, the absence of relatives from the definition can be explained if we look at section 30 (1) (d) which enables a health board to place a child in the care of a relative.</P>

      <P>Section 30 was substantially amended on Committee Stage.  It sets out the ways in which a health board may provide care for children.  Subsection (1) (d) enables a board to place a child with a relative or other suitable person.  I have been looking at this again and I think the reference to &ldquo;other suitable person&rdquo; is confusing, given that subsection (1) (a) already allows a child to be placed in foster care.  It is proposed, therefore, to delete the reference to &ldquo;other suitable person&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 134:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2435" />&ldquo;(3)  The child shall have a right of review of the type of care that is being provided if he is dissatisfied.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a very important area.  Only in the past two days Deputies will have received a submission from CARE givng their views on this weakness in the Bill.  I want to refer back to what the Minister said to Deputy Sherlock on 1 May last, as reported in the Official Report of that date at column 690:</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Sherlock, we do not propose to set up a statutory review body.  I emphasise that we are talking about exceptional circumstances.  We have the utmost confidence in the professionals to make the best judgment. We must respect the decisions of the court and adhere to them.</P>
    <P>That basically rejects the need for a review procedure in relation to care.  I feel very strongly that there is the possibility of an error in relation to a child being misplaced and it is very important that a full review procedure be allowed. The very professionals to whom the Minister adverted have made a submission to the effect that there should be a detailed, comprehensive, clear-cut review procedure so that the best interests of the child can be served.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that within 45 days of a child having been taken into care there should be an initial review.  If the child remains in care there will be a review every six months.  The purpose of each review would be to ensure that there is a long term placement plan for the child consistent with the child's interest.  At each review there would be a hearing of the health board to consider all aspects. There should be set procedures for these hearings by the health board.  This would be long after the court had disposed of the case and the child would be in the custody of the health board, in foster care, in a residential home or whatever.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there are two vital elements to these oral reviews: first, the people who would be given an opportunity to <Col N="2436" /> contribute would be the parents or guardians of the child, the provider of the care, the child if he or she is 12 years of age or older &mdash; and in all cases the child would be informed of developments &mdash; and any other person who is deemed to have a bona fide interest in the child's welfare. Those are the people who are involved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the content of the review, that would cover such issues as the child's progress in placement, the implementation of previous decisions at the earlier reviews, efforts taken by the health board &mdash; this is a very important point &mdash; to facilitate the return of the child to the home or alternative long term care if reunion is not feasible; the health board should consider all factors to ensure that, where possible, a long term reunion, if desirable, is achieved.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that the location or provision of services for the parents, where the family might be deprived would be considered in the context of the review.  Let us suppose that in the case of an alcoholic parent, efforts would be made to provide treatment facilities for the parent, if that was perceived to be the problem.  Then there should be set procedures whereby a health board, within ten days of the hearing, would notify their findings to the following people &mdash; the parent, carer, child itself, if over 12 years of age, any other bona fide person &mdash; and that all the records and information in the possession of the health board would be confidential to the participants in the review.</P>
    <P>Any party to the statutory review procedure who feels that a decision taken is not in the best interests of the child shall be provided with a hearing by the independent review committee.  This would mean that if, say, a friendly uncle, aunt, grandmother or grandfather said: &ldquo;we really believe from our discussions with the child, that the child is not happy,&rdquo; that person would have a right to a hearing at the review procedure.</P>
    <P>In view of these new powers coming on stream for the first time, giving health boards enormous capacity to review cases, all these amendments have <Col N="2437" /> brought to light the need to review the matter.</P>
    <P>I am not contending that my humble amendment No. 134 constitutes the sole solution to the matter but I am certainly satisfied that the position, as we left the Special Committee, was wholly unsatisfactory in this area.  I would ask the House to ensure that, on Report Stage, we invoke proper legislation and regulations that deal with the comprehensive details of the statutory &mdash; I emphasise the word &ldquo;statutory&rdquo;&mdash; review procedure which will confer legal rights on all parties concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I very strongly support the views expressed by Deputy Yates.  I have had the same representations made to me by the caring agencies who sent me submissions which I have had time to consider.  We are in more than a slight dilemma in that to achieve what I now believe is required would necessitate the tabling of a completely new amendment. We do not have an amendment before us which would achieve the objective just enunciated by Deputy Yates.  The nearest we can get to it is the Minister's amendment No. 142, in which there is one fundamental flaw and under the provisions of which the Minister will be required to make regulations.  One aspect that has recurred or arisen frequently in our deliberations is the fact that more and more important work is not debated or enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas but is referred to departmental officials who draw up regulations of extreme importance to the implementation of important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be much happier if we could agree on a draft &mdash; perhaps the Minister has thoughts about the regulations already &mdash; so that we could somehow formalise them by way of a ministerial amendment, even now and insert into this section, so that we would have not an enabling clause that would allow proper regulations to be introduced in the future but rather have the type of regulations spelled out in the Bill itself. This would mean we could deal with them now and reach a consensus on exactly the <Col N="2438" /> type of statutory review procedure we require.  Clearly we are devolving a huge range of new powers to health boards to interfere and involve themselves in families up and down the country.  There must be a mechanism where decisions taken are monitored and reviewed.  That should be done on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the detail of the statutory review proposed because Deputy Yates has read a lot into the record already.  I broadly support that concept.  But we have a dilemma because I do not see any amendment before us that would achieve that objective.  I appreciate that the Minister has come some distance from the position he adopted on Committee Stage when he did not see any need for this type of review.  At least he has moved significantly from that.  Sometimes we feel we are achieving something when we observe this.  But it is important to not only acknowledge the need but insert what is largely an aspirational clause that leaves it at the discretion of the Minister and his officials to draw up regulations that would meet the needs of the position. I would have been much happier had the Minister seen fit to share with us &mdash; perhaps he will yet by way of response &mdash; the ideas he has for the regulations.  I would ask him directly, if possible now, to strengthen his amendment by inserting into the Bill the need, the type and scope of such statutory review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it a step further? I am dealing particularly with the Minister's amendment No. 142 which we are discussing with Deputy Yates's amendment No. 134.  The first part of the Minister's amendment is affirmative in that it says:</P>
      <P>34.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall make regulations requiring the case of each child in the care of a health board to be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of the regulations.</P>
      <P>But it then continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations <Col N="2439" /> under this section may make provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This means that the Minister having used the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the first subsection resorts to the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in subsection (2), the effect of which will be that the Minister may well not make provision.  I will read the whole of the second part of the Minister's amendment into the record:</P>
    <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations under this section may make provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) as to the manner in which each case is to be reviewed,</P>
    <P>(b) as to the frequency of reviews, and</P>
    <P>(c) requiring the board to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child to be given into the custody of his parents.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are there a whole lot of options not sufficiently definitive for us to ensure that there is a specific built-in statutory review date and the need therefor.  One way of overcoming this difficulty would be to draft regulations that would be circulated and agreed before being implemented because, once laid before the House, they cannot be changed; all we can do is vote against them.  Some of them might be all right but we would have to vote on them as a whole.  Before reaching amendment No. 142, perhaps the Minister would strengthen it in the way Deputy Yates suggests which would be a more definitive way of doing so by way of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As others have said, this is an extremely important matter.  In a small minority of cases circumstances have arisen, in residential care centres for children, which were, to say the very least, regrettable.  Accordingly, the need for review is quite evident, and there must be such provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear to me that, at subsection (1) of the Minister's amendment, <Col N="2440" /> there is a statutory imperative on him to make the relevant regulations.  I would have thought that, at subsection (2), it was merely stated that he may take paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) into account but that he might take other matters into account as well in drawing up the review regulations.  It is a very complicated area, one in which one would need to tread very carefully to ensure that the method of review is watertight and that the watchdog-type regulations required are of the right kind.  Deputy Yates's amendment, while laudable, may be somewhat simplistic.  These matters should be left to the Minister and the Department to enable the necessary regulations to be drafted for an extremely important area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Donoghue.  Putting in the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in subsection (2) simply means that that is all the Minister can make provision for under that section.  My learned legal friend will know more about that than I, but I think it would be confining the Minister to just considering (a), (b) and (c), and there are a number of other areas in the submission made to members of the Committee by CARE groups that were mentioned.  We would be precluding the Minister from doing that.</P>
      <P>With reference to Deputy Yates's amendment No. 139, in Committee it was agreed to leave the wording &ldquo;and at such intervals as may be prescribed&rdquo; because it was felt again that people should have a discretion.  It might be necessary to review matters every month or couple of months or at varying periods, maybe every 12 months and the phrase &ldquo;and at such intervals as may be prescribed&rdquo; was to cover that eventuality.  All in all the Minister's amendment covers the points made at the Special Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment covers a great deal.  From the time we debated the issue previously it has been seen that there is a need to make provision in this regard.  Nevertheless, we need to be clearer on what is envisaged. As I have said previously, there are a <Col N="2441" /> number of legal problems across the spectrum and if the Minister has to introduce statutory regulations, a review committee and a statutory review procedure perhaps would cover more than is provided for in amendment No. 142.  Such a committee, who would include the Minister's representatives and experts working in the field, would engender confidence that a procedure can be laid down whereby the anomalies and problems that are sure to arise can be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
      <P>One of the great problems in dealing with issues is the time lost trying to bring the various strands together to get a coordinated effort.  Co-ordination is the name of the game and there will have to be a committee who will have statutory obligations under the Bill.  In his amendment No. 142 the Minister recognises the need, and that is commendable.  Perhaps he will say the regulations he will bring in giving effect to the provisions in the Bill will also provide what we are seeking here.</P>

      <P>In regard to amendment No. 134 and the other associated amendments, this amendment is similar to the one we discussed on Tuesday.  On that occasion Deputy Yates withdrew his amendment on the basis of a personal assurance from me that the question of allowing a child to initiate a review of his case by the health board will be considered when regulations to be made under amendment No. 142 are being prepared.  We have received this document from the Professional Coalition on Child Care and we have studied it in detail.  We have no great difficulty with it.  We intend to incorporate most of what is contained therein when we are drawing up the guidelines.  We have had consultations even in the last week with professionals right across the board on this whole area, and the House can be fully assured that we will take a very wide consensus view when we are drawing up the guidelines. The guidelines will also be circulated and anybody looking for a copy will be more than welcome to have them before the regulations are finally agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2442" /> I refer again to amendment No. 142, subsection (2) which provides that; &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations under this section may make provision&mdash;&rdquo;.  We are leaving wide latitude there and we are not confining it.  Any other problem or proposal that will come forward can be considered.  I assure the House that the guidelines will be broad and detailed and we will cover all the eventualities that we can.  On that basis I will be sincerely grateful if Deputy Yates will withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I am glad there is agreement in the House on all sides that a statutory review procedure is now necessary.  I do not have to quote everybody on the Special Committee saying it was not necessary.  The argument has come full circle.  It is a case of whether we accept the Minister's bona fides in this matter.  I support fully the detailed basis on which I have outlined terms for the people to be involved in the review procedure, the regularity of it and the content of the review.  If the Minister can nod in the affirmative that the regulations will encompass this as a basis, then to facilitate progress, because I am very concerned about amendment No. 159 and I may seek the indulgence of the House that we go only as far as amendment No. 158&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 143:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 12 to 25 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>34.&mdash;(1)  A health board may, in accordance with regulations made by the Minister, remove a child in its care from the custody of any person with whom he has been placed by the board under section 30.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 34 provoked widespread opposition from foster-parents who feared the arbitrary removal of foster children by health boards.  It was discussed at great length at the Special Committee and I gave an undertaking to review the matter at Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of section 34 is to enable the health board to remove a child whom it has placed in foster care or residential care.  There are many reasons why a health board might need to remove a child.  It might be to unite the child with <Col N="2446" /> his parents, to move him to more appropriate placement; it might be that the child himself wishes to move.  It could even be that there are allegations that the child is not being properly cared for in his current placement.</P>
    <P>While the health board should have the right to remove a child where necessary we must guard against arbitrary, unplanned and inappropriate removals.  Foster-parents, in particular, need to have some sense of security that their fostering placement will not be abruptly ended without very good reason.</P>
    <P>Given all the different situations that can arise, it would not be practicable to set out in the Bill the precise circumstances in which a health board should be entitled to remove a child.  I propose that these should be spelled out in the regulations which would be made by the Minister for Health under the proposed new subsection (1) to be inserted by amendment No. 143.  My other three amendments, Nos. 148, 149 and 150, are consequential on the proposed deletion of existing subsections (1) and (2) and the insertion of the new subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Let me deal with amendments No. 144 and 145 put down by Deputy Yates.  The result of the amendments would be to give the courts power to order the removal of a child from a particular foster-parent or a home.  While it is appropriate that the courts be involved in decisions as to whether children should be placed or remain in the care of the health boards, I do not think it is desirable that the courts should be involved in deciding on the exact home or the particular foster-parents with whom the child should be placed.  The amendment would draw the court into such decisions by requiring court approval to the removal of children from particular foster-parents or specific homes.</P>
    <P>As I indicated yesterday, there are many reasons why it might be considered necessary to remove a child from the persons who are looking after him.  It could be that the child is unhappy in that placement or that a place has become available in a residential centre which is <Col N="2447" /> in a better position to meet his needs. I believe that decisions about a child's placement are best left to the professional staff involved in the case.  I do not accept that it is necessary or desirable that the courts should be involved.  The changes I have proposed go a long way towards meeting the concerns of the foster-parents for security in relation to their position.</P>
    <P>In view of my amendment I would ask Deputies to consider withdrawing their amendments Nos. 144, 145, 146 and 147.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As those four amendments are in my name I have to say that I have a choice quotation from the Minister at the Special Committee that fateful day, I May.  He said: &ldquo;I cannot agree that foster-parents should be given the right to delay or frustrate such a removal&rdquo;. That was in the context of section 34 of the Bill as it is now.  I am glad to see that the Minister's discussions with the Irish Foster Parents' Association have yielded some fruit and that he and the Department have considerably changed their view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not entirely happy about amendment No. 144.  I do not think it is appropriate that the Minister should intervene in an individual case for removing a child from foster care.  In the discussion we had on this it was quite clear that the health board had the authority to remove the child.  During the Special Committee debate I asked the Minister if the health board could remove the child from the custody of a person without the consent of the Minister.  The Minister asked me if I was talking about the Bill or the present law.  I replied that I was referring to the Bill.  The Minister replied that the Bill would give power to the health board to remove a child.  I asked if that would be without the consent of the Minister and the Minister said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that the health board has a clearcut power to remove a child from foster care. I do not see, therefore, why the Minister should be involved in this.  I do not think it is suitable that the Minister should be involved.  I would ask the Minister to <Col N="2448" /> accept amendment No. 144 in return for my acceptance of the draft regulations. In recognition of that I would withdraw the rest of my amendments because what I was seeking to do was to protect against circumstances where foster-parents who could have given great care and attention for years to children would find that those children could be removed out of the blue.  That would be most unfair.</P>
    <P>I am happy now that in relation to this legislation both the rights of foster-parents and the future of fosterage is guaranteed and enshrined in this legislation.  While I have had many criticisms about the gaps in this legislation, the fact that there is no provision for adult barring orders, no proper provision for mandatory reporting and inadequacies in relation to children's courts, I will say that the Minister has done a good job in relation to foster care, that is, without seeing his regulations, provided that his commitment is genuine which I do not doubt.  I would ask, however, that he take out the role of the Minister because I do not think that is appropriate when there are ample powers for the health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct that the power of the Minister is diluted considerably by his proposed amendment? He is proposing the deletion of the lines which would include that phrase, &ldquo;if so required by the Minister&rdquo;.  If that is the case the power is devolved more to the health board, and local discretion, which is more important, comes into play.  The Minister is being very responsible. Indeed, I am delighted to hear Deputy Yates complimenting the Minister because we have here a very progressive Minister.  I want to take this opportunity to put on record my congratulations to him.  He is responding very favourably and in a very magnanimous way to discussions that took place at the Special Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that most of the Deputy's colleagues were against change.</P>

    <Col N="2449" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing his amendment the Minister paid a compliment to foster-parents and agreed that it would be unacceptable that somebody could suddenly remove a child without due reason.  The amendment recognises that we are dealing with human beings.  In the care of children, foster-parents are one of the first ports of call.  The Minister said it may not necessarily be the most desirable.  There are those of us who believe that adoption would be the best approach in the beginning if that were possible.  Foster-parents, however, fill a very vital role and I would not like to think that they would be treated with disregard by the Minister or by the health boards.  We are very dependent on them. They are very special people.</P>
      <P>There is need for consultation, and setting down regulations as suggested by the Minister will lay down the criteria for health boards to act without the Minister's personal intervention all the time. It is appropriate that there would be some flexibility at local level.  I am aware that health boards have just taken children away and created problems.  I am not saying it was not in the child's interests to do so, but it did seem to disregard the foster-parents.  We should always be careful in dealing with foster-parents that they should never believe they have a child permanently because that is what leads to problems in the final analysis.  We must take into account the line between adoption and fostering.  If fostering is to continue to be successful we must treat foster-parents in a special way.  The regulations the Minister will make will go a long way in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been prompting the Minister in the last three days about the possibility of drafting the regulations in consultation with the spokespersons in this area.  A procedure was agreed by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare that before regulations would be published we could give our stamp of approval.  I know regulations are highly technical and complicated and are not always easy to follow, but if the Minister would consider this procedure of consultation on the draft regulations it might <Col N="2450" /> go some way towards dispelling doubts we might have about what will or will not be in them.  I hope the Minister will indicate whether he is prepared to do that.  The Minister has gone some way towards addressing my concern about foster-parents and how they should be treated.  It is appropriate that national regulations be laid down so that all health boards would act in a uniform way.  There should be a consensus on how foster-parents, and of course the children in foster care, are dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed amendment refers to the custody of any person with whom a child has been placed by the board under section 30.  It very rarely happens that the foster-parents are recommended by the health board.  What is important &mdash; this is the reason I rise to speak, and it has been mentioned by another Deputy &mdash; is that the health board may, only in accordance with regulations made by the Minister, remove a child in its care from the custody of any person.  That adequately covers the point. The regulations will firstly have to be introduced and it is only in accordance with such regulations that the child can be removed.  For that reason the amendment is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to raise has been made but it is no harm to emphasise it.  Concern was expressed in the Special Committee not only by Deputy Yates but by Deputies on all sides that the Minister would have to intervene in individual cases and that he would be involved in day to day decisions.  As Deputy Sherlock has rightly said, the Minister has met the concerns of all Members by making regulations and by making it clear that a child can be removed only in accordance with the regulations.  Rather than criticising the Minister for being flexible &mdash; he accepts that we are concerned about this matter &mdash; it would be better if we praised him for being so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates for his comments.  I am delighted he is <Col N="2451" /> still quoting political scripture.  He is not correct in suggesting that individual cases would be subject to ministerial approval. That has been the position under current legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said the Minister has the power to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will clarify the matter. That is the position under current legislation but we are changing it in these amendments.  The Minister's only role in future will be to lay down regulations setting out the circumstances in which health boards may and may not remove children from foster care or residential care.  The Minister for Health will have no role whatever in individual cases. Under current legislation the Minister has a role in individual cases but we are now changing that position and referring the matter back to the health boards.  The words &ldquo;if so required by the Minister&rdquo; quoted by Deputy Yates will be deleted by my amendment No. 143; I put down a similar amendment No. 148.  Consequently the Minister will have no hand, act or part in individual cases.  His function will be to set out regulations and guidelines.  There is no need for concern.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 154:</P>
      <P>In page 19, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) by co-operating with local authorities in planning accommodation where persons over 18 years of age are leaving residential care facilities due to age.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with the problem of homelessness among young people.  Anyone who has received submissions from Focus Point and other organisations dealing with accommodation issues for people over 18, will be aware of the problem. The legal situation is that all the provisions of residential care extend until a child reaches 18 years of age.  After that they are not entitled to any protection that this legislation affords them.  These are invariably single people, unmarried mothers or young men of 19 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2456" /> I have received &mdash; as I am sure other Deputies have &mdash; submissions stating that there is an urgent need for shelter and accommodation for these young people who have no proper after-care facilities. Accommodation is a vital element of after-care and there is no liaison between the health boards and local authorities to ensure that these people are properly accommodated.  Indeed, the letting priority points system operated by local authorities means that single people would never have enough points to get a small three bedroomed house.  They are basically left to the mercy of the four winds.</P>
    <P>My proposal is not unreasonable: it seeks to include that the health board may assist a person under this section. We should include a new paragraph (e), which is not very different from paragraph (d), by arranging hostel or other forms of accommodation for them and to extend it by co-operating with local authorities in planning accommodation where persons over 18 years of age are leaving residential care facilities due to age.</P>
    <P>There is a special liaison between the health board and local authorities in regard to the elderly and handicapped, and special provision is made for them. I strongly believe there is a gap in the legislation in this regard which should be filled.  There is a lack of consultation, co-operation and planning.  Will the Minister state what proportion of the public capital programme in relation to housing accommodation is provided in terms of these young people?  I venture to suggest that it is minimal.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city children who are homeless are taken into care but, when they reach 18 years of age, they are let out because health boards are not legally entitled to keep them.  These young people are then homeless and beg for a living or turn to crime.  All the work previously done is wasted, they are adolescents and they cannot cope because they probably do not have a job. This is a very serious matter and it relates to my amendment which you ruled out of order.  The House should support it.</P>

      <P>I am sympathetic to this amendment.  Many people leave residential care and may never know what a normal home is like.  The spirit of the amendment, in social justice, must be accepted.  However, I wonder about its efficacy.  The allocation of local authority houses is a reserve function of management and, therefore, it is hard to know if the amendment has any teeth.</P>
      <P>Under the recent Housing Act, there is already an obligation to draw up a priority list in relation to those who should obtain local authority houses, which is a vast improvement.  I cannot deny the spirit of the amendment because when people come out of residential care they have, in a sense, been institutionalised.  It is extremely important to give them priority in relation to housing so that they will reintegrate into society and take their place in it.  Of course the foundation stone is a normal home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment to an important section.  I appreciate the way we are trying to deal with the problem of children at risk who are abused or badly treated at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our responsibility does not end when these people reach the age of 18.  During long debates on Committee Stage we sought to have an after care programme.  It would be a dreadful flaw in the Bill if we left this section out.  Deputy Yates's amendment strengthens the section considerably.  In our experience in our constituencies we know of individuals who have fallen into the category envisaged by Deputy Yates.  There are young people who simply do not have a prospect of being accommodated.  When we were drawing up our last priority list on Wexford Corporation we decided to draw up a separate list for young single people.  It is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;no-hope&rdquo; list.  There is a priority list for families, for single parents and the elderly and <Col N="2458" /> then there is a limbo list for no-hopers who under present conditions will never be accommodated.</P>
    <P>To overcome that problem, many voluntary organisations are being established.  They work in conjunction with local authorities to provide special purpose-built accommodation.  Thankfully that has started in my constituency of Wexford.  There is an extremely good and effective group working in Waterford and neighbouring counties.  What is envisaged is that we should not depend on a patchy service around the country, but that there should be co-operation between the local authorities and the health boards in planning structured sheltered accommodation.  It might not be completely independent.  It might be based on a unit where people can have facilities and then independent living accommodation.  All sorts of models could be devised to accommodate these young people but it would be dreadfully remiss of us as legislators not to put into this Bill a requirement that that co-operation should occur.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reflect on the case made on Committee Stage and again today and realise that this extra provision does not detract from what this Bill is about and that it strengthens and broadens the scope of the after care provision which we all recognise we need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the need for this amendment.  Section 36 (2) (d) acknowledges that there is a need to arrange hostel or other forms of accommodation for persons leaving residential care.  Even though such people at that point would have no home they would not be regarded under the Housing Act, 1988, as being homeless persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to an agreement between the health board and the county council in my area elderly people leaving residential care can be accommodated in little groups of two or three in houses which are being provided by the council in the new housing estates.  It would be a sad state of affairs if a person on reaching the age at which they would no longer be provided with residential care had now to go out into the world and find their <Col N="2459" /> own way.  Provision should be made to complete education and for maintenance during that time and for placing a person in a suitable trade, calling or business. That is very much needed in the circumstances.  We should write into the legislation a provision such as that proposed by Deputy Yates for co-operation and co-ordination between the local authorities in planning accommodation for persons who reach the age of 18 years and must leave residential care.  I support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of two local authorities I am aware of the need for consultation between local authorities, health agencies and so on.  Nowadays there is consultation.  I am glad to say that Tipperary Urban Council in consultation with the psychiatric hospital provided houses for small groups of people in psychiatric care who were ready to be integrated into the community.  This only occurred because of proper consultation and planning between the authorities.</P>
      <P>The amendment urges co-operation between the local authority and the health board in planning accommodation for persons who are over 18 and leaving residential care.  Deputy Yates has said that it is not legally possible for children of that age to be maintained by an institution unless there is planning and co-operation between all the agencies.  I do not see any reason to oppose this amendment.  It will not cause any problems.  Section 36 (2) says:</P>
      <P>A health board may assist a person under this section in one or more of the following ways&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and itemises the ways, including the suggested addition by Deputy Yates, a health board may or may not &mdash; and because of restrictions it is likely that a health board will not &mdash; assist a person. We should at least include this provision as a desirable aspiration to encourage the health boards.  The wording suggested is open and allows the authority discretion in relation to co-operation on planning. I am sure the Minister's colleague in the <Col N="2460" /> Department of the Environment would welcome that forward planning when local authorities are submitting applications to the Department for financial resources.  We should plan so that people will not be homeless.  There should be an obligation on the health board to consult with the local authority.  That would be good legislation.  The wording in this section is so weak anyway, that the least we can expect is a commendation from the Minister on this amendment, which I support fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I said that the intention of this amendment is very laudable.  It certainly deserves support.  There are some people out there, whom we all come across, who when they come out of residential care do not have the social skills necessary to enable them to integrate into society without considerable help.  One very obvious area of help which would be the foundation to launching them into society is to provide them with secure accommodation.  It gives them a sense of security and enables the process of integration into society to be facilitated in a smooth way.  In view of that I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate on this issue on Committee Stage I think every member of the committee agreed in principle, at least, with the idea of having some form of a linkage between the housing authorities and the health boards.  Despite what has been said earlier the Housing Act, 1988, contains a number of provisions which are not in conflict with what Deputy Yates is attempting to achieve.  Section 9 (1) of the Act states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A housing authority shall, within one year of the commencement of this section and thereafter not less frequently than every three years and as the Minister may, from time to time, direct, make, in accordance with this section, <Col N="2461" /> as assessment of the need for the provision by the authority of adequate and suitable housing accommodation for persons&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 9 (2) (f) deals with the type of persons that should be included and states that provision should be made for young persons leaving institutional care or without family accommodation.  It is clear from the Housing Act that there is an obligation on housing authorities, rather than health boards, to provide institutional care for young people.</P>
    <P>In addition, section 9 (4) (b) states:</P>
    <P>any health board established under the Health Act, 1970, whose functional area includes or adjoins the functional area of the authority giving the notice,</P>
    <P>In other words that health board must be consulted in relation to housing needs of different categories of people including the people referred to.  Under the provisions of the Housing Act there is a provision whereby the housing authority must take young homeless people into consideration, a group about whom we have all expressed concern.  I do not see any harm in including a similar provision in this Bill.  The only difficulty I see &mdash; and it is probably more technical than real in view of some of the cases about which we have heard and known &mdash; is that the Bill is catering for those up to the age of 18 whereas Deputy Yates' amendment refers to persons who are over 18.  I do not know whether that will present a difficulty but, if so, it is one we should be able to overcome.  The important words in the amendment are &ldquo;co-operating with local authorities&rdquo; and &ldquo;in planning accommodation.&rdquo;  I do not see any problem in including some form of an amendment to strengthen the Housing Act which would allow for local authorities to come together and to plan for people who are about to leave care.</P>

      <P>The sentiment is one I would back but I hope it is not like many pious sentiments which fall by the wayside.  There is no doubt that the people we are talking about are damaged by their experiences and by their background.  More than likely they will need continuing care, advice, assessment and help for the rest of their lives.  I cannot see any problem.  There should be co-operation between health authorities, housing authorities, voluntary agencies and any agency that can help these people.  Something I find &mdash; and I am sure this is something every Deputy finds &mdash; is that Government Departments, housing authorities, etc. often operated in hermetically sealed watertight compartments and people at risk can fall between them. In my own constitutency the officials in Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Health Board and the social workers make great efforts to provide a continuity of care for these people.  I hope Deputy Yates' amendment will be accepted.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I support Deputy Yates' amendment.  It would be a very important amendment to have in the Bill.  From time to time we all meet the particular problems which Deputy Yates refers to.  Like Deputy Fitzpatrick I hope it would not be put into the Bill for the sake of having it there.  There is a need for co-operation between the health boards and the local authorities and that down the road something concrete should be done to provide facilities for such people.  As Deputy Howlin pointed out we have major problems in the area of homeless single people.  It is important that we recognise on all sides of the House that something should be done to tackle the problem.  While we cannot possibly give them three bedroomed houses there may be a possibility of providing flatlets or other type accommodation for those people I would ask the Minister to include this amendment as part of the Bill and that down <Col N="2463" /> the road we should have another look at the scene to see how the problem might be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome my colleague, the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, who is with us.  I have observed two things from this amendment.  First, that my backing group is very strong and, second, that Wexford appears to be at one.</P>
      <P>Housing authorities have the primary responsibilty for providing accommodation for persons over the age of 18 years.  The law in this area has been updated recently in the Housing Act, 1988, which requires housing authorities to undertake periodic assessments of housing needs in their areas.  The needs of young persons leaving care would fall to be addressed in that context.  The 1988 Act requires the housing authorities to consult with the health boards in conducting these periodic assessments. Therefore, the type of linkage between housing authorities and health boards envisaged in the amendment is already legally in place.  I have every sympathy with the amendment and I would love to be able to accept it in its entirety. However, it has three defects, first, the words &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo; is incorrect &mdash; it should be &ldquo;housing authorities&rdquo; because some local authorities do not have housing responsibilities; second, persons over 18 are excluded in this Bill as it deals only with children under 18 years of age; third, the amendment refers to children &ldquo;leaving residential care&rdquo;.  What about children leaving foster care?  They would be excluded?</P>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the collective wisdom and the consensus of the House and, with the permission of the Chair and the co-operation of the House, to propose an alternative amendment which would read:</P>
      <P>(e)  by co-operating with housing authorities in planning accommodation for children leaving care on reaching the age of 18 years.</P>

I am prepared, then, to withdraw amendment No. 154.  We had an earlier agreement that we would reach amendment No. 159 before 1.30 p.m. and as we have received a submission on the matter concerned regarding a children's complaints procedure, I would like to have some discussion on the amendment while we have the opportunity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very anxious that we abide by the agreement.  I am also very anxious that this amendment be accepted.  This important amendment seeks to insert after the <Col N="2465" /> word &ldquo;motion&rdquo; in section 38 (1) the words &ldquo;following consultation with the health board concerned&rdquo;.  This might not seem necessary but it is.  Where there is an appliction before the District Court it should be incumbent on the justice to have consultation with the health board concerned.</P>
    <P>There could be circumstances where an application would be made and a decision taken without the full circumstances being brought before the court.  It is important that there would be a requirement although what I suggest may happen as a matter of routine.  It has become clear to us again and again that we should not assume anything.  We should require consultation to be made where necessary.  This amendment would strengthen section 38 (i) by providing for consultation before a direction is given by a district justice.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;40.&mdash;(1) Children who are subject to the provisions of this Act or parents of such children, may appeal decisions of Health Boards or voluntary organisations to the Minister where they are dissatisfied or where they feel injustice or ill treatment has taken place.</P>
      <P>(2) On the investigation of an appeal under subsection (1) the Minister may issue such directions to the Health Board concerned as he deems appropriate in the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>No amendment has been put forward by the Minister on this issue.  I will refer later to the proceedings of the Special Committee of Tuesday, 1 May.  My amendment proposes that a complaints procedure should be put in place whereby children who are dissatisfied with the care they are getting or who believe an injustice has been done to them would have a mechanism to have it reviewed or appealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already accepted a <Col N="2467" /> proposal he would not accept on Committee Stage, that is, a statutory review procedure.  This procedure will look at the long term placement plan for the child.  What I am proposing here has been lobbied for by the CARE organisation in the campaign for deprived children.  They recommend that an independent review committee be appointed by the Minister for Health consisting of five people, three professionals and two members with appropriate training.  They also recommend that it should not be a judicial body but should seek to investigate complaints and make recommendations in relation to the care being provided where a complaint is made.  It would not be an alternative to court proceedings but in very many cases it would avoid costly, adversarial and, at times, potentially traumatic court proceedings.</P>
    <P>This is a vital opportunity to deal with this issue.  I very much regret that the Minister has not kept his commitment to bring forward an amendment on this issue.  At the Special Committee on 1 May, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>As regards the substitute amendment, the first thing I would have to say is that I have considerable sympathy with the contention that parents whose children are in care should be able to have any complaints or grievances they might have considered and any necessary remedial action taken. Indeed, my Department have been having discussions with the health boards and the organisation called Parents with Children in Care with a view to developing such arrangements. If the Deputy is prepared to withdraw the amendment I will be happy to look at the whole question of a complaints procedure on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I dutifully withdrew the amendment.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that I am trying to establish the difference between having a review carried out by a health board under a statutory review mechanism &mdash; we referred earlier to amendment No. 134, which is an entirely different animal &mdash; and children asking for a review to be <Col N="2468" /> carried out.  I believe very strongly that an aggrieved child should have the opportunity to complain to somebody and that that complaint should be listened to and skilfully assessed.  I do not agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that children of five, six and seven years do not have a clue and do not know what is in their best interests.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief because I do not believe we should be wasting the time left.  I strongly support the amendment.  The procedure referred to by Deputy Yates is not necessarily the <Col N="2469" /> only one we can take into account.  A commitment was given by the Minister, which I think is on record, that he would take account of the case made on Committee Stage and would come back with an amendment on Report Stage.  I regret that that is not the case.  There is no alternative but to accept the amendment before us and I strongly urge the House to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would allow a child who is dissatisfied with the decision of a health board or voluntary organisation to appeal.  What decisions are we talking about?  Is it the decision of a health board to issue care proceedings in the first place or to issue proceedings for a supervision order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal was discussed at the Special Committee when I indicated that I had considerable sympathy with the idea of giving parents whose children are in care, and the children, some procedure or system which would enable them to air their grievances or complaints.  I indicated that my Department were engaged in discussions with a new group known as Parents with Children in Care with a view to developing suitable arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will be pleased to know that this process is well under way and that within the last week my Department arranged a seminar to discuss the development of complaints procedures for children in care and their parents. <Col N="2470" /> The seminar was attended by representatives of the health boards, the resident managers of children's homes, the Irish Foster Care Association, the Irish Care Workers' Association and other interested parties.  There was broad agreement on the need for a complaints procedure and the various groups are now examining how this can be set in place.  The way forward is to gain the agreement of all the parties concerned rather than imposing from above a complaints system that might be resented and misunderstood.  The House should give its backing to the efforts of my Department to arrive at an agreed procedure, in consultation with all the relevant parties.</P>
    <P>In discussing the amendment we should not lose sight of what we have already agreed to insert in the Bill under amendments Nos. 119 and 142.  Amendment No. 119 will allow for the first time a child involved in care proceedings to be joined as a party to the proceedings and to be granted legal representation.  While I would hope that a child in care would not have to go to law to air his complaints or grievances we have given the child or young person the option and the wherewithal to do so if necessary.  This should not be overlooked in the context of the present amendment.</P>
    <P>I should also like to remind the House that amendment No. 142 will require the Minister for Health to introduce regulations providing for reviews of children in care.  In earlier discussions I gave a commitment that the question of giving the child himself a right to initiate such a review will be sympathetically considered.  I am prepared to go further now by giving a commitment that we will also consider the question of giving parents of children in care a right to initiate reviews.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we have gone a long way towards providing complaints procedures and I hope that in view of all I have said Deputy Yates will consider withdrawing his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had put down an amendment on this issue I would have supported it.  There is a difference <Col N="2471" /> between a review committee and my proposal.  Therefore I will be pressing my amendment.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
      <Quest>his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is insufficient finance provided by his Department to fund headage payments in 1991 to a level of payment which would compensate farmers for the reduction in market price supports for the various sectors in agriculture; if he will outline total Exchequer funding to Irish agriculture for the years 1987, 1988, 1989; and the reason there was less Exchequer funding required to fund headage payments in the severely handicapped areas in 1990 when compared to the Estimate for 1990.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The intention is that for 1991 headage payments will be made at existing rates in all the disadvantaged areas, including those which will be designated for the first time and those which will be reclassified as a result of the submission at present with the EC.  I am pressing for an early decision on that submission so that farmers in the new and reclassified areas can benefit under the 1991 schemes.  This would mean that there would be some 18,000 new beneficiaries, as well as 11,000 current beneficiaries, who would receive increased payments.</P>
      <P>The Vote for Agriculture and Food for 1990 provided £67 million for headage payments, but as the Deputy will be aware the Dáil recently approved a Supplementary Estimate of £9.3 million for this purpose, thus enabling payments to that amount, which would normally not be made till next year, to be made in the current year.  This, in turn, reduced the requirement for 1991 by a similar amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As at present structured, the headage schemes are biased in favour of the smaller producer, since payments are modulated on the basis of the number of livestock units held.  I am, however, considering proposals for a restructuring of the payments and I will bear in mind the point made by the Deputy in that regard.  I may say that these proposals, together with the extension and reclassification of areas and the abolition of the off-farm income limit which took effect this year, will result in an increase in the cost of the headage schemes from £60 million in 1989 to around £100 million in 1992.  This will provide a major stimulus to agriculture in the disadvantaged areas. Gross expenditure under the Vote for Agriculture and Food in 1987, 1988 and <Col N="2475" /> 1989 was £355 million, £329 million and £312 million, respectively.  The figure for 1990 is expected to be £364 million. FEOGA (Guarantee) payments in each of the years in question amounted in 1987 &mdash; £909 million, in 1988 &mdash; £1,040 million and in 1989 &mdash; £886 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to enlighten the House on how it is possible to extend to such a degree the disadvantaged areas while the Estimate for 1991 shows a reduction of almost £3 million in Exchequer spending?  What Exchequer funding is to be made available by the Irish Government for the headage scheme in 1991?  Is it the case, as most farmers believe, that the Department of Agriculture and Food or the Department of Finance are substituting newly found EC funds for Exchequer funds due to the new rate of recoupment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated that one of the reasons the amount in the 1991 Estimate is less than normal is that payments of £10 million were brought forward.  If payments are brought forward into 1990 which otherwise would be paid in 1991, clearly the 1991 Estimate will be that much less.  As to how that can be reconciled, I cannot see what the Deputy's difficulty is.  The net cost to the Exchequer in 1989 was £20.6 million, in 1990 it was £41.3 million and in 1991 and 1992 it will be even more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling the 30,000 farmers who are already in severely handicapped areas that because he negotiated a new recoupment level of 65 per cent, as opposed to 50 per cent, they will get higher headage payments in 1991?  Will the Minister give a straight answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given a straight answer.  There will not be increased headage payments in 1991. That was in my original reply.</P>

      <Quest>the number of cases in which the illegal growth promoter known as "angel dust" has been detected in cattle in Ireland within the past 12 months; his views on whether the measures to prevent the use of such substances are adequate, especially in view of the potential danger to human health; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>My Department are involved in testing at factory level and at farm level for the presence of illegal substances including the use of this illegal growth promoter known as &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo;.  Random testing of carcases at factory level over the past year, under an EC approved testing plan, has yielded negative results in all cases. My Department's laboratory has the capability of testing samples from carcases to detect residues.</P>
      <P>I recently launched an intensive campaign to counteract any possible abuse by testing at farm level and this has yielded positive results in three out of the 27 herds sampled to date.  It is intended to initiate prosecutions in these cases.  The sources of manufacture of the material or methods of distribution have not been clearly ascertained, but inquiries by the Garda Siochána, the customs authorities and my Department are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2477" /> In July I introduced regulations to deal specifically with this problem and any other illegal growth enhancers or veterinary medicines which might be developed in the future.  Under these regulations the manufacture, importation, sale, administration and possession of unauthorised substances are prohibited.  I am satisfied that the measures that have been taken are adequate and indeed are more comprehensive than in any other member state.  I have been pressing for a harmonised Community approach on this issue and at the Council of Ministers meeting this week I requested the Commission to introduce Community-wide regulations along the lines that we already apply in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the action he has taken.  I am behind him 100 per cent in his efforts to wipe out this terrible scourge.  However, there are a number of facts about which farmers and consumers are very worried. One is that it has been alleged that some factories actually tout for business for cattle that have been treated with hormones.  Would the Minister say whether that has come to his notice or whether it is a myth?  Obviously, if it is true, we have a bigger problem on our hands than we thought.  So far as the technology available to detect the residue of this dreaded &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; substance is concerned, when the Minister speaks about having the technology available, can he confirm that that is used at all meat factories or is it the case &mdash; as some commentators suggest &mdash; that the use of &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; is widespread despite the fact that the Minister has identified three instances only when it might have been used?  Can he give the House any idea of the actual source of the &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo; and its distribution methods?  Can he give us any idea who is trafficking in this or who is handling it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has posed three questions there.  As far as the technology is concerned let me assure him that what we have in place at the national laboratory is the most sophisticated technology for testing, which <Col N="2478" /> can be extended to one part of a billion to detect the residue.  The Deputy can be assured that we have very advanced technology available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it being used at the factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, absolutely, that is the second point I want to mention.  As I said in my reply, which I might reiterate:</P>
      <P>Random testing of carcases at factory level over the past year, under an EC approved testing plan, has yielded negative results in all cases.</P>
      <P>Having said that &mdash; and I appreciate the Deputy's support for what I am doing &mdash; if there is any Member of the House or anyone of which Members are aware has any information of any abuse &mdash; to the effect that this dangerous, insidious substance is being used or even contemplated for use &mdash; I would be very happy to know it.  I can assure the House we will take the most rigorous action.</P>
      <P>With regard to what are the sources, the Deputy can be assured that we are co-operating vigorously and actively with the Garda and customs authorities.  The fact that there is co-operation with the customs authorities will give the Deputy some indication of some of the people we think are involved in this insidious treachery against our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>On this very important aspect of the beef industry, do I take it the Minister is referring to the involvement of subversives?  In addition, would he care to comment on the allegations that some of our meat factories are actually seeking cattle that have been treated with hormones?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not; that is what I said.  As to the source, it is a matter for the Garda and customs authorities to confirm exactly who are involved.  But let me say that those who are involved are doing, or would attempt to do, deadly damage to the interests of this country and we will not tolerate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people within the distribution network who would appear to be subjected to an undue share of the spotlight are the so-called van salesmen &mdash; the Minister will be aware of the people we see regularly.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

I do intend &mdash; as I indicated in the House &mdash; to introduce legislation very soon to regulate van sales as well.  I am not drawing any implications beyond saying that everything will be regulated and subjected to constant checking.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 10 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>While prices for poor quality animals not eligible for intervention can be low, this reflects the market value of such animals.  However, these categories are by no means representative.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I met with representatives of the meat processors and impressed on them the need to ensure that the value of the intervention support system were adequately reflected in prices paid to producers.  I am pleased to note that since then prices for all categories, including non-intervention categories, have increased and the trend continues to be upwards.</P>
      <P>The Department on my specific instructions are and have, at all times, been in regular contact with the industry to ensure that farmers get a fair price for products purchased into intervention.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, concerned that farmers should receive adequate returns for their cattle.  My Department are continuously monitoring the situation.  However, the question of any lack of competition as between meat processors is a matter to be dealt with under competition legislation which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As Deputies are aware, he will be introducing new competition legislation to strengthen controls in this area in the near future.</P>

      <P>Does that not basically mean that, despite what the Minister, his junior Ministers and the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry have said publicly, so far as the Minister's dealings with meat factories here are concerned, he is in no better position than a paper tiger and that he has no control whatsoever over them?  I <Col N="2481" /> do not want to allow this opportunity to pass without saying that, if the Minister thinks the meat factories are not perpetrating a rip-off at this stage in regard to intervention prices which they are receiving, which they subsequently pass on to farmers, then the Minister and his advisers are ill-advised.  The Minister and his two junior Ministers, know as well as I do, that this is a rip-off.</P>

      <P>Thirteen cases of BSE have been confirmed this year by comparison with 15 last year.  The animals affected were slaughtered and their carcases destroyed.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply of 14 November, extensive and stringent precautionary measures have been put in place.  These include restrictions on the herds where BSE has occurred.  To alleviate the problems which such restrictions can create, I devised arrangements where my Department will assist herdowners in the voluntry depopulation of the herds. To date, 2,604 animals have been slaughtered under these arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not quite; I think there are some further animals.  But by far the vast majority of animals in those herds have been slaughtered.  There are still some &mdash; much fewer than that <Col N="2483" /> number &mdash; still to be slaughtered, but they will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in relation to the animals that have not been slaughtered, what measures are being taken to monitor those animals to avoid the spread of the disease?  Second, is the Minister concerned that the number of cases detected in 1990 &mdash; only marginally down on the numbers in 1989 &mdash; would tend to indicate that, although the problem here is small, it is continuing at approximately the same level as it has been over the past two years and is not reducing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am glad to say the figures tend to indicate quite the opposite, that what was a mere trickle in 1989, because we do not have an indigenous problem, has been reduced further in 1990.  I am sure the Deputy and every Member of the House who has the national interest at heart will welcome that greatly.  I am sure as well that the Deputy and everyone else will see this is a consequence perhaps of some very stringent restrictions we put in place to prevent any contamination from any outside source.  We have banned the importation of meat and bonemeal from the UK.  We have banned the importation of any pedigree cattle from the UK, which was our practice over the years, because the sources we traced in 1989 and 1990 were all attributable either to imported stock or imported meat and bonemeal. In case that was not enough, we banned the feeding of even indigenous Irish meat and bonemeal.  I am satisfied that we have all but eliminated what was in any event a trickle here.  We do not have a problem and we want to demonstrate to the world at large that that is the case.</P>

      <P>I gave the figures previously in the House.  The Deputy can take it that there is a pattern in the sense that by far the biggest number has been in the northern half of our jurisdiction. There have been odd, isolated cases.  The most recent one was a very isolated case in the south-west but in each of those cases it has been traceable to imported meat and bonemeal.</P>

      <P>In all the cases that have been fully and thoroughly examined they have been traced.  We keep monitoring and checking at all times.  As I have mentioned in this House before, there has been an intensive programme of instruction for our departmental vets and our private vets, and any animal that looks remotely as if it has BSE is taken out and slaughtered.  We have already slaughtered many more animals that have proved to be positive.  The testing goes on all the time.  It is going on now on anything that looks even remotely like it, but in all instances where it is positive we have traced the source to the cases I have mentioned.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2485" /> Disposal of these products is a matter for the EC in consultation with the member states in the context of the relevant market management committees. Sales of products occur in accordance with regulations from time to time and their success or otherwise depends on the market situation.  Other disposals take place in the form of food aid, social and denaturing schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The reaction to the BSE outbreak in the UK was quite dramatic among the consumers around the world.  It is not for me to underline the significance of what happened in the UK, but beef consumption in Britain itself, which is one of our main markets, dropped dramatically by about 20 per cent.  Beef consumption throughout the EC dropped dramatically by at least 10 per cent.  Beef consumption in third country markets, some of which I will refer to in further questions today, be it Libya, Iran or elsewhere, also dropped dramatically.  As a consequence of that market contraction, the intervention system came into place.  Without the intervention system in those circumstances, Ireland would have a very serious price collapse in beef.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the possibility or probability of a great deal of this intervention storage, which must be the greatest volume of intervention we have had for many years, being hived off to the Soviet Union via whatever vehicle might be there?  What is the up-to-date position on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations are going on at this very moment in the Commission &mdash; it is a matter for the Commission as the Deputy must be aware &mdash; in relation to food supplies in the Soviet Union and the basis on which they can be put in place.  The Soviet Union is but one area that is being considered in <Col N="2486" /> accordance with established practice.  I think everyone would wish to see the intervention stocks being disposed of to the widest possible extent at the best possible price so that the cost to the European Community budget, which eventually comes back to us in any event, would be minimised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that, while the disease has affected beef and skim milk, the largest tonnage of butter in intervention was due to a number of co-operatives competing with others putting dairy spreads on the market and doing serious damage thereby?  People in other countries had to be asked to refrain from doing that because they were doing damage to the dairy industry.  Will he not agree it is time there was co-responsibility between the co-operatives and that they should revert to the sale of butter which is their primary aim and what they were set up to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with what the Deputy has said.  I am heartened to find that view expressed in support of what I have said myself.  I find it absolutely self-contradictory that co-operatives whose role it is to promote the interests of their members and their suppliers in the dairy sector have been promoting products which have no dairy content at all, against the interests of their producers.  I have conveyed that to them very directly and bluntly, and I hope their suppliers and shareholders will continue to bring pressure on them to change that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is legislation but we will have to strengthen it.  On the second point, there is another element that has to be considered.  Some claims are being made that certain non-dairy products have a very positive impact on cardiac conditions and matters of that sort.  Those claims are now being questioned, to say the least of it, even by cardiac consultants.  It is time the wholesome, natural dairy product fought back, <Col N="2487" /> and I believe there are good grounds to demonstrate to the consumer that you are always on safer ground when you take the natural product in reasonable quantity.</P>

Does he not accept that the State has not played its role in funding the various marketing agencies we have here in promoting the quality food we have?  To take him up on his last point, as an example I refer to a recent report to the effect that margarines manufactured from vegetable oil have an ingredient that is a serious cause of heart attacks and the dairy industry has not homed in on it to draw the consumer's attention to the fact that dairy products are now found to be far better for health than these products which have an ingredient similar to one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to our stocks I am glad to tell the Deputy that in the beef sector particularly, which is very much a target for the disadvantaged and the old, our programme will be very much bigger this year than last year.  We will be supplying 600 tonnes to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, 100 tonnes to the various hostels and 420 tonnes to hospitals.

      <P>Beef intervention intake for 1990 has been at record levels. <Col N="2489" /> There is no question about that, and it is as well for the Irish beef producers that it has been.  We have been the biggest beneficiaries.  The situation is similar in regard to skim milk powder and dairy products because of the downward trend in the world dairy markets.  I was one of those pressing for dairy intervention for skim milk powder.  Since the autumn of 1989 the European Community responded and reintroduced intervention tendering for butter in January 1990 and for skim milk powder in March 1990.  We have done that as a safety net and I would hope that that, combined with vigorous marketing of the wholesome nature of the product, would help us to maintain producer prices and above all else, to reduce intervention stocks.</P>

      <P>Deer farming is among the proposals for alternative farm enterprises included in the operational programme for rural development which has been submitted to the EC Commission.  I will be announcing full details when the programme is approved which I expect will be very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that deer farming is a relatively new enterprise, certainly on the scale we are talking about for the future.  Existing aid programmes under the FIP may not have had due regard to that in the past.  Naturally it is intended that under the operational programme any deficiencies in that regard could be accommodated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the earlier reply by the Minister, since the Government's commitment to alternative farming is fairly marginal, could the Minister tell us if that degree of marginality is reflected in the submission that has been made to the Commission or is it envisaged that deer farming will form a more central part of the Department's strategy?  Will it be promoted as a form of farming into which farmers could diversify having regard to the difficulties that we were discussing previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="2491" /> agree that the alternative farm enterprises to date &mdash; deer, rabbits, goats, and so on have not been altogether successful and that there is now a need to examine every other possible alternative in view of the fact that traditional areas are not now within the compass of the small farmer?  Does he agree that we will have to make an all out effort to get into areas that we have not looked at prior to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. The process is ongoing.  There are 130 producers of deer in Ireland.  In 1989 exports of venison amounted to approximately ten tonnes valued at £40,000. While those statistics might seem relatively small, obviously it is a growing figure, and on the basis of the number of inquiries in relation to it, it is an area that will grow along with the other areas that Deputy Leonard refers to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 12, 28 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that on 14 November 1990 in response to questions from a number of Deputies, I outlined in some considerable detail the Community's agriculture offer in the context of the Uruguay Round.  The offer, which was submitted to the GATT on 7 November, involves a 30 per cent reduction in internal support over a ten year period from 1986 measured by an aggregate support measurement unit.  The Community has also offered to convert its import levy system into tariffs on certain conditions and to reduce these tariffs in line with the rate of reduction in the support price.  In addition to the impact of the internal support reduction on export subsidies, the calculation of these subsidies would be subjected to certain disciplines under the Community's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community participated in the negotiations at the GATT meeting in Brussels last week on the basis of this offer.  While the Commission negotiators indicated to our GATT partners that subject to certain conditions being met the Community may be prepared to accept some commitments on minimum market access and on the volume of product to receive export subsidy, there was never any question of going beyond the 30 per cent total support reduction agreed to by the Council.  Indeed, no such proposal was made by the Commission and the Council made it clear on several <Col N="2493" /> occasions, during the week that the negotiations should continue within the confines of the mandate given to the Commission in November.</P>
    <P>From my earliest involvement as Minister in the Uruguay Round negotiations I have been most conscious of the need to ensure that the impact of the round on the Common Agricultural Policy and on our agriculture sector as a whole was kept to a minimum.  At the same time I have always recognised that the commitments entered into by the Community at Punta del Este in 1986 would entail some concessions on agricultural support and protection.  My priorities therefore, were to ensure that these concessions would be as low as possible and to secure commitments on a satisfactory package of compensatory measures to recompense producers and economies most vulnerable to the impact of the reforms. Such a commitment was essential for me in considering the Commission's GATT offer proposal.  My persistence, and indeed that of other Ministers, on this point paid off.</P>
    <P>At the Council meeting on 5-6 November when the Community's agriculture offer was adopted, there was a firm agreement that account would be taken of the particularly difficult situation of certain categories of producers and regions in the adaptations of support arrangements. The Commission also agreed at that time to submit, coinciding with the concluding stages of the Uruguay Round, concrete proposals supported by appropriate financial solidarity, to ensure a viable future for Community farmers.  In practice, these proposals will, on the one hand, involve a reorientation of support to producers taking as a basis the diversity of the structure of farmers and production, and on the other, a reinforcement of structural assistance, including production neutral income subsidies, concentrating on producers and regions which have most difficulties in adapting to changes.  Proposals are expected to be adopted by the Commission in the very near future and will then be considered by the Council of Ministers.  In the recent GATT negotiations I vigorously <Col N="2494" /> defended the mandate of the Council of Ministers to the Commission and I appealed successfully for solidarity in support of that mandate.</P>
    <P>These proposals should ensure that farmers and economies most in need will be assisted to meet the consequences of the GATT round outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the Commission's view but I am talking about the regions in Ireland that are going to suffer from a decline in income of 25 per cent in real terms by 1995.  I want to know, at least in some detail, what the Minister's strategy is for these areas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the old Latin phrase: <i>si monumentum requiris circumspice</i>&mdash; if you want to see the evidence look around you.  As has been recognised by every delegation at the GATT negotiations &mdash; well over 120 or 130 of them &mdash; the Irish Minister for Agriculture and Food was perhaps the most vigorous in defending the interest of his country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Go and find out for yourself if you do not accept what I say. I have pressed the Commission to have ready immediately a system of compensatory payments, which will be particularly targeted towards those who are in structurally disadvantaged areas &mdash; if that means the disadvantaged areas in the west of Ireland particularly, I acknowledge that&mdash;and that will be put in place. Until such time as that proposal comes through the Commission, obviously it will not come to the Council.  I take it the Deputy is not suggesting, after all our vigorous fighting to maintain the European Common Agricultural Policy, that what he wants is to reintroduce a national income aids policy which would guarantee that there will be no sustainable future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr Sherlock Mr Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if, in view of the proposed changes, he would initiate a policy for the better use of Structural Funds.  Does he support the policy of the EC Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, of favouring the smaller farmers by giving them a much greater <Col N="2496" /> share of the subsidies?  Will he publish a document to show what effect the change in policy in the redistribution of Common Agricultural Policy funds will have for this country and for small farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, as I indicated, the Commission has not yet made any formal proposals.  The proposals are expected to be considered by the Commission very shortly, and when they emerge I will certainly give them the most detailed consideration.  It would be premature for me to indicate my position on proposals which have not yet been made.  Commissioner MacSharry indicated that he felt it was wrong &mdash; he was talking about the European Community and not just Ireland &mdash; that 20 per cent of the producers were getting 80 per cent of the benefit.  He said he wanted to see that corrected in the interests of equity and particularly of protecting the smaller producer.  I share that view but I am waiting to see what the precise proposals are before commenting on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that making the offer of a 30 per cent reduction before the bargaining started in the GATT talks was a major tactical mistake for which we are now paying?  Would he not agree that the income supplement that must be granted in view of the depressed prices for agriculture will only be granted to the areas that are designated as severely handicapped?  That being so, is it not all the more important that the Minister should have sought that a larger area of the country be included as disadvantaged&mdash; all the country would come under this category when you compare our scale of farming with that of the rest of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no basis for what the Deputy has interpreted.  I take it that it is a bona fide misinterpretation on his part.  The subsidy will not be confined to severely handicapped areas, and I can assure the Deputy that it was never intended that that would be the case.  We persuaded the Commission, in giving the <Col N="2497" /> extra guarantees, to include regions or vulnerable areas particularly dependent on agriculture.  As the Deputy will know, Ireland is classified as a region in the European Community sense.  It is not just Ireland we are talking about but regions like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not reply to the first part of my question regarding the tactical mistake of offering a 30 per cent reduction before the negotiations started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When that was first hinted I indicated that the 30 per cent offer was very severe and said I could not consider it unless there were some other adjustments or compensations.  I am glad to say that the Commission did make adjustments and compensations.  Let me leave no Deputy in any doubt that at the end of the last day's negotiations there was one Commissioner, one Community of Twelve who was adhering to this offer and that was very difficult in the face of all the other countries represented in the GATT negotiations.  What we have demonstrated through our solidarity, and have proved to the other countries, is that their expectations were unreasonable and unrealistic.  Hopefully when the negotiations resume in January-February they will be much more realistic.  I think the House will appreciate that these are the most complex and difficult negotiations we have been involved in.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke about adjustments or compensation for the losses to Irish farmers as a result of the price support mechanisms being <Col N="2498" /> reduced.  Surely the Minister cannot tell Irish farmers he has been successful at a time when the French and Germans pay their farmers three times the headage payments we are paying our farmers.  Not alone has the Minister not been able to hold the line in the negotiations but he did not hold it with his EC colleagues.  In the worst year for farming in 25 years the Minister comes back here to tell the House that everything is all right.  That is dreamland.</P>

Under the cattle and equine headage and beef cow and equines headage schemes in the disadvantaged areas, the suckler cow premium and special beef premium schemes, approximately 30 per cent of applicants have been given on-farm inspections this year while the remaining applicants have had their applications cross-checked against previous year's numbers, against TB herd test reports and, where necessary, against the relevant cattle identity cards.  I am satisfied that these cross-checks are successfully preventing fraudulent applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2500" /> There is no reduction in the level of on-farm inspections under the investment aid schemes or the scheme to encourage the set aside of arable land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Who advises the Minister?  It is only a couple of months since the Minister for Agriculture and Food told the House that the figure was 80 per cent.  I am aware that, in recent months, there were scarcely any inspections carried out.  It was proposed to withdraw the inspectors and we were told that the work would be done by the administrators in Agriculture House.  I cannot accept the Minister's reply because it is inaccurate and not in accordance with the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It was intended in 1990 to give on-farm inspections to 70 per cent of applicants but, because of industrial action, the percentage automatically dropped accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Department proposed a new system of inspection during 1990 which would have the effect of reducing the number of inspections from 100 per cent?  The staff who carry out the inspections made representations to the Minister stating that what was proposed was an open invitation to fraudulent practice and that it would end up costing the taxpayer a lot of money.  Will the Minister state whether 100 per cent inspections will be carried out in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Next year it is intended to continue with 100 per cent inspections for the sheep schemes because sheep do not have identifying ear tags as cattle have under the BTE scheme.  It is intended to inspect 50 per cent of the cattle applicants on a random basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been extensive consultations at ministerial and other levels between the Irish and Iranian authorities on the sale of Irish beef to Iran.  Technical discussions are still taking place and it is hoped that these will be concluded very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that no further progress has been made since the Minister's visit to Iran and Libya.  Will the Minister agree that the fundamental problem in regard to re-establishing the market with Iran is that they do not believe our herds are BSE free?  Will the Minister further agree that there is documentary evidence in the possession of the Iranian Government, from an international veterinary organisation in Paris, which suggests that the incidence of BSE is much higher in Ireland than officially reported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an outrageous and ill-founded statement.  Indeed, the fact that the Deputy made it in the national Parliament makes it all the more serious.  I will take it step by step.  The Deputy said that there had been no progress in discussions between the Iranian and Irish authorities since October.  I regret to tell the Deputy&mdash;because it saddens him to hear good news&mdash;that the opposite is the case.  When the veterinary officials came here, as a consequence of my visit to Iran in October, at the concluding meeting with departmental officials, the head of the Iranian veterinary organisation indicated that he would be making a positive report to his Minister regarding the recommencement of exports of beef to Iran.  I hope the Deputy does not find that kind of solid good news unwelcome or unpalatable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as any reference to reports from Paris are concerned, any information in relation to Ireland at that meeting was supplied by the Department of Agriculture and Food and their veterinary authorities and was not contradictory of what we had specifically stated.  I have told the Iranians and the Libyans that I would not want them to buy one pound <Col N="2502" /> of beef unless they were totally satisfied that, as ever, it was absolutely clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the Third Secretary of the Iranian Embassy is on record as having said that the Irish Government have not convinced their Government that the herd was BSE free?  The obligation, as they rightly stated, is on the Minister's Department to prove to the Iranians that the herd is BSE free.  Because this has not been done no real progress has been made regarding the export of our cattle to Iran.</P>

      <P>The last allegation he made was in regard to some Parisian authorities.  However, when he realised that that was blatantly untrue, he moved his attention to the Third Secretary in the Iranian Embassy.  There is no foundation for the Deputy's remarks in that regard. When was the alleged statement made by the Third Secretary?  Was it months ago? I have no evidence of that and, if there was any misunderstanding, it has long since been cleared up.  The Deputy <Col N="2503" /> should be honest and not try to undermine the interests of this nation.  Will the Deputy supply that information?</P>

    <P>If the Deputy is referring to the unauthorised leaks of preliminary observations from the Court of Auditors, I would remind him that the procedures of the Court of Auditors forbid any disclosure of their observations or of the replies from the national authorities.  I and my Department have adhered to these procedures but I am free to say that my Department replied through the <Col N="2506" /> Comptroller and Auditor General to these queries and I look forward to seeing the extent to which those replies were taken account of by the court in their annual report.</P>

The Deputy would also know that by spreading innuendo and slander to imply that my failure to reply is somehow evidence of lack of readiness he is damaging the national interest.

      <P>The volume in tonnes of liquid milk imported into Ireland in the years 1983 to 1990 is as follows: 1983, 4,351; 1984, 2,645; 1985, 6,245; 1986, 438; 1987, 1,217; 1988, 333; 1989, 23,089; 1990 (January-August), 51,927. <Col N="2510" /> The rest of the information requested by the Deputy in relation to dairy products is set out in tabular statements which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The increase in imports of liquid milk in 1989 and 1990 is due to sales by dairy concerns in Northern Ireland of milk for processing in the Republic.  The increase in whey imports in 1989 and 1990 from Great Britain and Northern Ireland is due to the market conditions obtaining in relation to that product.</P>
      <P>Following are the statements:</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not absolutely shocked and horrified to think that we, a farming nation, are importing such huge volumes of liquid milk and dairy products in general?  Is it not true that we have rising unemployment here? I wonder what his Department are doing to create jobs in this area?  Surely many jobs could be created.</P>

      <P>The increase, particularly in 1989-90, in the volume of liquid milk is accounted for by the sale of raw milk by concerns in Northern Ireland for additional processing and thereby creating some additional jobs in this part of the country.  In the general area of imports of milk products the position is that we are by far an exporting country but we live in a free trade area and the consumers will decide what type and variety of products they want.  There are some imported products and I will circulate details of them with the official reply to the Deputy.</P>

Would the Minister agree by reason of the fact that the number of inspections are reduced considerably for most of the year and are not at all for another part of the year that this is leading to the complaint made against the State by the EC Court of Auditors?

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be moving this amendment No. 160 as I prefer Deputy Fennell's amendment, No. 161.  Her amendment is much the same as mine. However, it is important to state that we do not know what future developments there will be in regard to creche facilities, play schools and pre-schools groups or what the future trend will be in relation to the age at which children are enrolled in primary school.  Therefore, it is better that we provide for the widest possible coverage of all children up to six years of age.  The definition in amendment No. 161 is preferable to the definition in section 40.  We do not know what quasi-Montessori-type developments there will be in the future which might not fit into the Minister's definition which basically defines a pre-school child as a child who is not attending a national school or a programme similar to a national school.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 160 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 161:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2569" /> In page 21, to delete lines 31 to 33 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;pre-school child&rdquo; means a child who has not yet attained the age of six years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend too much time on the amendment because I believe further sections of the Bill are more relevant and important.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that the term &ldquo;pre-school child&rdquo; was cumbersome.  I do not know of any other country in the world which has managed to come up with a better terminology for the constituent group of children about which we are talking.</P>
    <P>The definition in my amendment is more general than the Minister's because we do not know what is going to happen in this area in future years.  As everyone knows, this is one of our most rapidly developing service areas despite the fact that there are no regulations, no requirement for registration and little support given to it.  The objective of my amendment is to think ahead and make sure that whatever we do in this Bill will be relevant to any developments which may take place in the next five to ten years.  I do not want to labour the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that I accepted on Committee Stage that the definition of &ldquo;pre-school child&rdquo; in the Bill is rather cumbersome.  I am aware that the term has been criticised by some of those involved in providing pre-school services.  I should like to again explain why the definition reads as it does.</P>
      <P>Under the School Attendance Acts the minimum age at which children are required to attend school is fixed at six years.  As everyone here is well aware, despite this it is a long-established practice that parents start sending their children to school from the age of four years onwards.  It has been estimated that over 50 per cent of four year olds are attending school; the figure for five year olds is over 90 per cent.  The number of children involved is of the order of 100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of this Part of the <Col N="2570" /> Bill to provide a scheme of control and inspection of services which are not subject to any form of statutory regulation at present.  However, this is not the case with regard to four and five year old children who are attending national schools.  These children benefit from the various rules and regulations laid down by the Minister for Education with regard to the conduct of national schools.  In addition, the Department of Education have a well developed and highly professional schools inspectorate who monitor all aspects of the operation of schools. In preparing the Bill the Government took the view that it would be wasteful and inefficient to duplicate the responsibilities and activities of the Department of Education in so far as four and five year olds attending school are concerned by imposing obligations on the health boards in relation to this group of children.</P>
    <P>I might add that a similar attitude was adopted by the former Coalition Government in preparing the 1985 Bill.  Under that Bill, regulations in this area were not to apply to care provided by or in any school recognised by the Minister for Education.  It seems to me that the safety and welfare of young children attending school is adequately protected through existing arrangements under the overall supervision of the Minister for Education and that we should confine this Part of the Bill to children who are attending services and facilities which are not subject to any regulation at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by the case put forward by the Minister.  I would like to have seen &mdash; hopefully this will happen in the future &mdash; the development of a comprehensive State-provided pre-school service.  I know much work was done in this area and that a special report was commissioned by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation on the facilities in other countries where the State takes on the obligation of providing kindergarten or pre-school education as an integral part of the state education service.  Unfortunately we do not have that in Ireland and some Irish children start <Col N="2571" /> national school when they are four years old while others do not attend until they are five or even older.</P>
      <P>I see the logic in the Minister's statement that once children are in the national school service they are covered by the rules, regulations and legislation governing national schools.  It should be said that one of the failings in our educational system is that we do not have a comprehensive, State-provided, uniform system of nursery or pre-school education.  This is very damaging to our children in an educational sense.  I hope in the fullness of time that we will have such a service.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 162 in the name of Deputy Fennell.  Amendments Nos. 172, 176 and 183 form a composite proposal.  Amendments Nos. 162, 175, 180 and 181 are consequential.  Amendments Nos. 173 and 174 are alternatives to amendment No. 172.  More precise minds than ours have applied themselves to informing us <Col N="2572" /> of that decision and I suggest we agree. Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 162:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;register&rdquo; means any register of pre-school service established under section 42, and in relation to a particular health board, means a register established by that board and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;registered proprietor&rdquo; in relation to a registered pre-school service, means the person whose name is entered in the register as the person carrying on the service.</P>
      <P>I know everybody starts their contribution by saying that a particular section is very important and all sections of this Bill are very important &mdash; we would not spend so much time and energy on them if we did not think they were important.  However in terms of its immediate application, this is a vitally important section and we have very high expectations for it.  I am talking here about the regulation of pre-school services.</P>
      <P>I am responsible for this group of amendments which relate to bringing in a register of pre-school services.  They would make it mandatory and obligatory for virtually all pre-school services to register.  When this amendment was moved at the Special Committee on 8 May the Minister stated, at column 757 of the Official Report: &ldquo;I do not think it is necessary to introduce a registration process with all the expense and bureaucracy that would involve&rdquo;.  I found that reply very disappointing as it gave a clear indication that money would not be up front in dealing with issues which are important, and that we should look for a cheaper solution.  To me this is a cheap solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill as it stands there are sections dealing with matters such as the giving of notice to health boards, the duty of the person carrying on pre-school services, the supervision of pre-school services, <Col N="2573" /> the inspection by authorised persons and the provision by health boards of pre-school services and information.  I suggest all these sections will be meaningless unless we introduce regulations covering them.  Since the Special Committee I have met with a number of groups all of whom expressed their deep concern to both the Minister and the Department. These groups include the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association who deserve great credit for the work they have done down the years in the pre-school and playgroup area, for introducing their own regulations, for trying to give it a status and guarantee quality but this has proved to be a difficult task as no standards are applied.  I have also met with Barnardos, the St. Nicholas Montessori Society, Cathal Brugha Street College, OMEP, the world organisation for Early Childhood Education, and a number of other groups, all of whom have appealed to us and the Minister to strengthen these sections.</P>
    <P>When we think of pre-schools we mostly focus on those pre-schools which provide a three or four hour service each morning.  Such services are provided all over suburbia and in most parts of the country as there is a demand for it and people willing to provide it.  Child care services for disadvantaged children are also provided by the health boards.  The reality is that anybody could start up a playgroup, and even though there may be very nice wallpaper and beautiful curtains, the parent who leaves their child with the person running the playgroup each morning and does not collect them until 1 p.m. needs to have great faith and trust in that person.  However, this is not enough and parents are not satisfied. Many parents have telephoned these organisations to ask which statutory organisation has an interest in this area and if they can give information on the status and quality of service provided by pre-school playgroups or on child care in general.  The point has been made that the person running the group could have a criminal record and there could be instances of child sexual abuse.  What we need to do is button this down and ensure <Col N="2574" /> that a quality child care service is provided with the health board or some other statutory organisation being given responsibility.</P>
    <P>These amendments reflect the amendments the Minister will introduce on Part VIII which deals with children's residential homes.  If there is a need to include a reference to registration in that part there is certainly a need to do so in these sections for the single reason that the children we are talking about are severely disadvantaged and will be present at the playgroup all day.  These children are entitled to the same protection as that given to the long term residents of children's residential homes.</P>
    <P>Almost every report and survey on pre-schools or day care has recommended registration.  Bureaucracy or the expense involved should not be used as an excuse for a failure to introduce this recommendation.  In their report to the Department of Health in 1985 the committee appointed by the Minister for Health to decide on the minimum legal standards and requirements for day care centres recommended compulsory registration and stated at paragraph 4.10, page 16 of their report:</P>
    <P>In the light of all the considerations, we decide to recommend the introduction of a compulsory registration procedure on a phased basis.  We recommend that, initially, any service operating on a full day basis, full day service and full day child minding service should be subject to compulsory registration.  Compulsory registration should be extended to any service providing part day care, sessional service and part day child minding service within two years of the introduction of regulations governing day care services.</P>
    <P>There is a fear that this would place a great onus on people running pre-school and day care services throughout the country, but the vast majority of them would welcome registration.  Admittedly, it would make things more difficult for them and result in many of them being brought into the tax net &mdash; I suspect that <Col N="2575" /> most are in this net at present &mdash; but at least this area would be regulated.  Most important, maximum protection would be provided for the children attending pre-schools while parents would be given a degree of security which they do not now have.  I know that in the years ahead this is an area where demands will increase and I hope the Minister will listen to the arguments which will be put from this side of the House and accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 40 &ldquo; `pre-school service' means any pre-school, play group, day nursery, creche, day-care or other similar service which caters for pre-school children, including those grant-aided by health boards&rdquo;.  That covers adequately the whole range of services provided.  The amendment is unnecessary because section 42(1) provides that a person carrying on a pre-school service on the commencement of this Part shall give notice to the relevant health board in the prescribed manner.  I would be more inclined to accept that provision than to have the register which is proposed.  I am aware of the smaller groups who do good work, smaller creches and pre-school facilities.  For that reason I have difficulty with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fennell reflects a great body of opinion when she speaks of the concern outside this House, particularly among people who have worked for years at a very high professional level to give the best pre-school education and formation possible.  One of the most disillusioning and frustrating factors with which they have to deal is that while they strive for qualifications and standards which the children deserve, there is a huge degree of freedom to set up a pre-school centre anywhere which need not comply with any standards or registration requirements. The effect of this has been to devalue the quality of educational socialising that must be incorporated in those formative years before the age of five or six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2576" /> Psychologists and researchers note that most of the formative experiences in the development of character occur in the first five years.  These are the most important five years in the life of any person. It has also been found that the greatest amount of learning and assimilation occurs during that period and it forms the attitudes we adopt to life.  We cannot exaggerate the importance of these early years.</P>
    <P>Teachers and child workers are appalled that we will not have that kind of registration and standard for those under five or six years of age.  We are proud of our educational system.  An unqualified or incompetent person would not be allowed to take charge of a class from the primary level up.  We can take great pride in the quality of our teachers who have acted as role models for our students. How can we not demand the same level of qualification and protection in the pre-school area when the evidence shows that this is the most influential time of all?  If we do not demand registration and do not ensure the highest standards through our whole educational and formation system, we devalue not just the development which takes place in pre-schools but the role of parenting and child rearing.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons pre-school facilities have been allowed to develop in an uncontrolled way is that we have never acknowledged the value of parenting and the time given by parents and pre-school staff during those incredibly difficult and demanding years.  As a person who taught in junior classes, I would claim that it is much more demanding in terms of skill, talent, patience and endurance to look after a classroom of four or five year olds than a classroom of ten or 12 year olds.</P>
    <P>The kind of standard we seek to achieve can only be brought about by registration.  From the beginning we must provide our children with the best quality care.  If we do not have registration from the beginning and allow it to be introduced at a later stage we will be leaving a huge uncontrolled area which will be detrimental to children and also to the <Col N="2577" /> high standard pre-school child care services provided by voluntary and professional groups all over the country. These people believe that the only way their work will be valued is by registration.  I remind the Minister of the calls made over the years by pre-school associations, voluntary and professional bodies for full registration and qualification. This must be accepted as the only standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fennell's amendment would bring about what I can only describe as over-regulation, which can sometimes be worse than under-regulation.  Many play groups and pre-schools are doing excellent work.  If we were suddenly to introduce registration and so on, as Deputy Fennell suggests, the criteria would be so difficult to meet that we would effectively close down many of the smaller groups.  Very few parents, perhaps none, would send their child or children to a place run by a person they did not trust.  It would be the duty of any parent to be fairly sure that an individual to whom they were entrusting the care of their child would be somebody of integrity and trust, indeed a caring person. The record speaks for itself in this regard. I am not aware of any instance in which an individual &mdash; perhaps somebody else is so aware &mdash; has been charged in an Irish court with abusing children in a play school or play group; I am not aware of there having been even one instance.</P>
      <P>If one were to accept everything Deputies Fennell and Barnes have said &mdash; I do not doubt their sincerity or interest in this area and in respect of which they have made excellent contributions &mdash; one would imagine that the Bill, as it stands, would not improve the position substantially whereas the truth of the matter is that, in Part VII, there are provisions for substantial improvements to be effected in our pre-school services. for example, in section 41 the Minister makes it clear that there will be regulations introduced in relation to pre-school services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, under the provisions of section 42 it will be incumbent on any <Col N="2578" /> person carrying on a pre-school service to serve notice of that fact to the relevant health board.  In addition, there are statutory duties now being imposed on an individual providing a pre-school service. For example section 43 reads:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of every person carrying on a pre-school service to take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and well-being of pre-school children attending the service and to comply with regulations made by the Minister under this Part.</P>
    <P>In section 44 there is a watchdog service being provided, where the Minister provides that existing services, or those to come into existence, will be supervised.  I might add there is a penalty clause included in section 48 for any breaches that might occur.  The history of pre-school services here &mdash; services which have grown substantially, in recent years &mdash; is fairly good and, in many cases, excellent.  The people who have provided such services over the years have been interested not merely in profit but in the children and, possibly, very interested in children in general.  Were they not I doubt very much they would undertake the task in the first place.  As we all know, it is no joke to take care of two, three, four or five year olds but it can be considerably more difficult if one has a substantial number on one's hands.  On balance, while acknowledging Deputies Fennell's and Barnes' tremendous interest in this section I contend that over-regulation, in the final analysis, might do more harm than good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long discussion at the Special Committee on this section also, which is a very important one.  For the first time it addresses the whole aspect of pre-school education here.  Much of what was said during the deliberations of the Special Committee might well have been more appropriately said had we been discussing an education Bill rather than the Child Care Bill.  However, we must cut our cloth according to measure. Since we do not have an education Bill or State-funded pre-school education &mdash;<Col N="2579" /> almost uniquely in Europe &mdash; we must ascertain at least how we can monitor and look after that level of pre-school education that obtains.</P>
      <P>As somebody who worked in a primary school for several years I feel very strongly we are depriving our young people of tremendous advantages by not having a State-funded, monitored, integrated, pre-school system; any progressive country in Europe has such a system already.  Instead what we have is a system of individual, private-run pre-school centres some of which are excellent, some of which do no more than mind children, as the last speaker said.  I contend there is more to it than that. Deputy Barnes indicated how important are care, attention and education within the two to six-year-old age group.  Minding is not good enough.  When most young Europeans are being formally and informally trained and brought into informal education at that stage, we do not have that and there are no proposals in this Bill to establish any such system.</P>
      <P>What is being asked in this series of amendments is that we put some order on the provision that is in existence if the State is not going to provide it.  Let us face facts, mostly it is provided on a commercial basis for those who can pay. There are a great number of children in need of this.  They are not getting it and will not because their parents are not in a position to pay for it.  There are a great number of communities which do not have any pre-school provision because such is not provided in their urban or rural area.  At least let us regulate what provision there is and try to establish some norm over a period of time in relation to training, standards and environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that the provisions of section 41 do constitute a significant advance.  It proposes a framework that can be monitored by the health boards, ensuring that minimum requisite standards of heating, lighting, ventilation and safety are adhered to.  We can all point to garages and sheds currently in use, or crèches located on the third or fourth <Col N="2580" /> floor of buildings with no fire escape that place children in mortal danger.  At least the provisions of that section address that issue.  But it is not enough.  We should address &mdash; obviously not in the comprehensive way I would like &mdash; but by way of one further step down the road, having an enforceable form of registration.  I do not believe it will have such a terrible impact on the small groups or force them out.  What we are saying is that there are a few people providing this service almost out of the goodness of their hearts and, if they have to conform to standards or register, they will be frightened away.  Is that the scale or level of provision we are laying on for our infants?  We must examine our consciences on this issue.  I said before that there was a furore up and down this country when there was a proposal to restrict intake into national schools &mdash; people will remember it &mdash; to 4½-year olds because most people felt it was the only type of free schooling children would get. They wanted them integrated into the national schools system as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>May I ask Deputy Howlin, as one teacher to another, would he agree with me that perhaps he is here pursuing, theorising and philosophising about a very urgent need.  Unfortunately, it is not really appropriate &mdash; apart from referring to the unfortunate absence of that which is desired &mdash; to make a case for it on legislation that deals solely with the care and welfare of children in the manner proposed here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an integral part because we are excluding children who <Col N="2581" /> are in the national schools system from the provisions of the section.  I do not want to take issue with you, Sir.  Having spent many months at this I contend what is at issue here is that the previous amendment specifically excluded from the provisions of this section children who were in the national schools system.</P>
      <P>Children attend national school here at four-and-a-half because there is nothing better.  We should have proper pre-school State run, education and children should not be in formal education at four-and-a-half.  They should be in informal education like the rest of Europe, but I will take the Chair's admonition and refocus my thoughts.</P>
      <P>In support of the amendment let me say our pre-school education system is woefully and painfully inadequate.  I hope at least some progress will be made in regularising the commercial, haphazard provision that exists by adopting the amendments proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back arguing whether we should have State regulation or allow a certain flexibility at local level. We are back to debating centralisation and localisation.  Anybody who knows me is aware I am always better disposed towards a local approach to these things and allowing as much flexibility as possible.  We are almost into semantics and Deputy Howlin is philosophising so I will try to avoid both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot look at any section of this Part of the Bill in isolation.  A number of requirements are laid down and Deputy O'Donoghue referred to most of them. People starting pre-schools and play groups have to notify the health board and the health board as a result have a number of obligations to comply with. The pre-schools and play groups can be visited by officers of the health board. Those officers have to be nominated.  The health board has to provide information to people who are interested in finding out what pre-schools or play groups are available in an area. For the people running pre-schools and play groups to comply with all the regulations laid down in the Bill they will have to register with <Col N="2582" /> the health board.  They have to inform the health board who will have to prepare a list of pre-schools in their area.</P>
    <P>I have been listening to some of the Deputies opposite but, like Deputy O'Donoghue, I would not question any-body's motivation.  Deputies Fennell and Barnes have spoken on this before, not just on Committee Stage but on Second Stages.  To my knowledge none of the horrendous things they suggested might happen have occurred.  I have not heard of any criminal or child abuser, or anyone else, running play schools.  Play schools and pre-school play groups are very local. We are talking of a person giving up a room, or a couple of rooms, in her house.</P>

      <P>Community play <Col N="2583" /> groups, as well as commercial play groups, run them.  The point I was making before I was interrupted was that there are still a huge number of play groups. Most of them are formed in small areas and operate in the homes of the people concerned.  The children attending them are neighbours of the people running the play groups.  I am speaking about those in particular.  I can see a major problem arising if we tie those groups up in red tape and bureaucracy, which is what a registration system being called for by the other side would give rise to.  The Irish Pre-school Playgroups Association have done excellent work in the area, setting up standards for those registered with them.  I would rather see a voluntary code such as the one introduced by that association than heavy-handed bureaucracy again being imposed on people from the centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made a contribution on this debate but I have been listening to it on the monitor and I would like to record, in most complimentary terms, my appreciation. Very few debates here have been as civilised or informative.  This aspect of the debate in particular interests me.  I take issue with Deputies Fennell and Barnes when they decry some of my colleagues on this side. I know we are only humble men&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that in itself means we are at a major disadvantage. We are also only humble fathers which means we are doubly &mdash; in my case quadruply &mdash; disadvantaged, but we have a little to contribute on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a message from the National Children's Nurseries Association on this aspect of registration.  They strike me as being a very sincere group and they have put forward some quite compelling arguments.  I am not sure everybody in the House would agree with the suggestion in the first paragraph of their letter to me.  They have requested that the Bill be halted and said we should not &ldquo;be rushing <Col N="2584" /> through the Bill in its final Stages&rdquo;.  They suggest that perhaps we should wait a few months more to finalise the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, they see registration of all day care nurseries as a pre-eminent requirement, that notification is not sufficient.  They lay down other specifics such as general acceptability, acceptable and basic standards of day care under a variety of subheadings and say these should be spelled out.  They say there should be a coding law, monitoring of standards by an authority, recognition of the supervision of child care courses available to students, registration of child minders and recognition in the Bill of their legitimacy as contributors to the workforce.  I have sympathy with those suggestions.</P>
    <P>However, if, as they suggest, we continuously put the adoption of the Bill off for a few more months, while we tease out these issues we will not get very far. We entered this debate about notification <i>versus</i> registration when we were discussing nursing homes not too many months back in this House.  It strikes me that there is a difference in this case.  I would take issue with Deputy Fennell on the scale of the institutional operation. Many of the day care centres are very small in scale; many of the day nurseries are very small.  Many of them are voluntary.  Many are operated in small housing estates, particularly when one moves away from the city.  I have experience of at least three of them in the Greystones area, just to take an example.  Two are in small housing estates and one is in a relatively large house, again, not a major institution.  I feel that we would need to take care that we do not adopt a too heavy handed approach with regard to regulation.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Fennell and Barnes that an offence or an activity against a child does not need to have taken place.  Our job, as legislators, is to try to make absolutely certain that we sew into law regulations and requirements that ensure that our children are protected.  I would make the point, going back over the Special Committee's work in this regard, that there is a danger of <Col N="2585" /> excessive regulation in this area. I am familiar with the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association's efforts and it strikes me they have done a really excellent job. I know other Deputies have referred to that too; I am not seeking to put a divide there.  It strikes me that their effort at self-regulation is an excellent one.</P>
    <P>There is a specific requirement of notification in the Bill.  Notification is not something which can be ignored.  It will become a statutory requirement and when it does, the statutory bodies, the health boards will have to guard standards and, again, they will have specific requirements on them.  I do not mean to suggest that this is simply a semantic debate, but there is not a huge difference between that and low level regulation. Listening to the contributions from Deputies Fennell and Barnes, and reading the specific report on this issue from the Special Committee, it is clear that those Deputies and others did not want crushing regulation that would damage a fairly vulnerable, under-developed and very under-funded structure.  I would not put any difference between myself and Deputy Howlin, for example, as to the desirability of this measure.</P>
    <P>Nobody is saying that these things are not desirable, but sincere people are suggesting that given that the origins of this Bill are approximately ten years old, they would appeal to all concerned persons to refrain from passing the Bill which requires further discussion and amendments and which, at worst, will take only a few months more.  I think most Deputies in this House are frustrated at how long it takes for legislation to get through here.  Notwithstanding that these people are very sincere in their request, I do not think we can actually afford to wait.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister when he is responding that it would be worthwhile if we could have some way of looking at how well the notification process works.  If there is any evidence, for example, that this is inefficient or inadequate, then we should set ourselves, individually or collectively, some sort of target to come back and look at this again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2586" /> I think the two sides of the argument have been well debated here but I would be fearful about the impact of heavy handed regulation on some of the small operators.  If, for example, we went the route we were going in the case of the nursing homes, we would then pass the cost of regulation on to the individually registered pre-school groups and nursery groups, and if we went that particular route we could do a lot of damage.  I think we could do a lot of damage if we did not go that particular route, because then we would be guilty of cross-subsidising those who can afford something from the taxes of those who obviously cannot or do not wish to afford it.  There is a balance in the argument here.  I would not be in favour of delaying the Bill on this particular issue.  I do not think anybody in the House would.  At the same time, however, I can see the two sides of the argument and it might be no harm if we had some way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before I reply to this excellent debate on this section and group of amendments I would like to say that we are not rushing through this Bill.  We are all at one on this issue.  This Bill was first published in 1988.  It came into this House for its First Reading in October 1989.  We went into all party committee in November 1989 where we had 17 meetings.  We have now come to Report Stage, which is given three full days.  I know that Members want to see a good, positive Bill passed as quickly as possible. We <Col N="2587" /> have no desire to rush it, but we have unanimous agreement on a structured way on ensuring that we complete a good Bill, and I am very grateful for that.  I have received the faxed document from the National Childrens' Nursery Association and I want to assure them that we are not rushing through but are giving every consideration to the Bill.</P>
      <P>In response to the amendments, we are committed to introducing statutory procedures for the inspection, regulation and supervision of pre-school service. However, we are anxious to avoid creating an unwieldy supervisory system which could become a major drain on scarce resources.  I am satisfied that the notification system which we proposed in this Bill meets these two objectives: it provides a system of statutory control but it does not impose a huge cost on the pre-schools themselves, or indeed on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fennell seemed to doubt that the money would be up front; she seemed to think we wanted things on the cheap. I want to assure the House that the money will be up front for the things that are important.  We want to ensure when the money is up front that it is spent on the children who are neglected and who do need and should get proper help.  We cannot and should not presume that all children attending pre-schools are neglected or otherwise.</P>
      <P>We propose that there would be a legal obligation on persons carrying on pre-school services to notify the health board of their existence.  Failure to do so would itself be an offence.  On notification the operator would be supplied with details of regulations which the Minister for Health will make following consultations with his colleagues, the Minister for Education and the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards will be required to have the services inspected from time to time and will be able to call on the assistance of inspectors from the Department of Education in the case of services which have an educational dimension.  In the event of serious or persistant failure to adhere to the regulations, the court will <Col N="2588" /> be able to impose fines and, more significantly, order that the services be closed either temporarily while improvements are effected or for a longer period.</P>
    <P>I feel that these provisions are adequate to deal with any abuses that may arise in the area of pre-school services.  I do not think it is necessary to introduce a registration process with all the expense and bureaucracy that would involve.  As Deputy Howlin said, we have come a long way.  We are bringing the pre-school services into a new system of notification under the supervision of the health boards in all the regions.  The Minister will lay down clear guidelines and I think that will be a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to all the arguments on both sides.  I would remind the Minister that he said in the House previously that, in relation to the point raised particularly by Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Howlin, he was prepared to have another look at this.  In regard to sections 40, 41 and 42 in Part VII of the Bill, the Minister has not put down any substantial amendments, but just a word here and there, a technical change here and there.  He has failed to meet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister had a look at it but he did nothing about it.  We will have to challenge a division on this amendment.  It is regrettable that the Minister could not see his way to going further than just giving formal notice.  On Committee Stage Deputy O'Donoghue raised a very valid point about people starting up in this business and the uncertainty of their position, but no effort has been made to address that matter.  I agreed with Deputy O'Donoghue at that stage and I very much regret that nothing has been done in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roche referred to the National Children's Nurseries Association.  He went as far as was humanly possible for a Government backbencher in agreeing with what they are saying while, at the <Col N="2589" /> same time, agreeing with what the Minister is doing.  On this side of the House we have greater flexibility and latitude and call a spade a spade.  This association is not satisfied with what the Minister has done.  I agree that the Bill has to be enacted, and that, in any case, it will go to the Seanad.  What the Minister is proposing is a form of notification on the cheap.  He is not prepared to put in place a proper inspectorate or a proper registration system.  The type of <i>ad hoc</i> development we have seen in this area will be only modestly improved with the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point made about crushing these play-schools with bureaucracy &mdash; I am the father of a three year old who will go to a play-school next January &mdash; there is a strong demand for this service.  Whether or not there is crushing bureaucracy, the question arises as to whether we have minimum standards.  One of the Deputies on the other side said that parents would not under any circumstances send their child to someone they did not know.  I know nothing about the person who will look after my child, and I am sure a lot of parents take these people at face value. We need to deal with the young children's critical and formative years in a strict sense and give them no less protection than we would give nursing homes.  Even if there is a cost factor involved it is better to err on that side.  At the end of the day what we are talking about are qualifications for people who mind children, pupil-teacher ratios and so on.  All these areas are important.  I support this series of amendments and we will be pressing them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave a commitment that I would look at this matter again and I have done that in as broad a way as I could.  To allay the fears of the House and to give a direct answer to Deputy Yates as regards the matter raised by Deputy O'Donoghue, a person may be fined up to £1,000 for not observing the regulations.  The regulations have yet to be drawn up and we will include a provision in those regulations where there <Col N="2590" /> will be a period between the notification the proprietor of the pre-school gives to the health board and when the fine will come into operation.  That will give people an opportunity to get their house in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who contributed, even though some of the contributions from the other side were at cross-purposes with what we are suggesting.  I want to emphasise that what we are talking about is a growing service area.  It is a business, and a very profitable one.  As somebody who represents a Dublin constituency &mdash; there are other Deputies here who represent large urban constituencies &mdash; I know there has been a huge growth in this area. I know of a couple of centres, with up to 30 children, who charge £60 a week for each child.  We should do something about these groups.  If the Minister provides in the Bill that in a year and a half or two years we will bring in a form of registration, he would be giving plenty of notice.  In the meantime this provision would be in the legislation.  Perhaps that is what should be done, I do not know, but this is a matter the Minister should seriously consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 42 provides that notice be given to the health board.  Will all existing services give notice or will this apply to new services only?  Will somebody go immediately from the health board to check out the personnel in the pre-school, or can everybody be sure that every pre-school or play centre service has been thoroughly checked out?  Section 45 refers to authorised persons &mdash; this matter also arose on Committee Stage &mdash; but what is an &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;? Section 45 states that a health board may appoint so many of its officers as it thinks fit to be authorised persons.  That does not give me any confidence and, I am sure neither would it give parents any confidence.  Will the health board decide that people who have nothing to do on a certain day should go out and check pre-school services?  I do not believe the <Col N="2591" /> format in the Bill is adequate.  It certainly does not meet the concerns that have been expressed to me by the groups and organisations involved in this area who are pleading for statutory regulation for themselves, which is unusual.  This shows how seriously they take the matter.  Perhaps provision could be made whereby notice is given that these centres are to be checked out.  We can then be sure that as this area develops and grows, there is legislative provision for it and regulations can then be made on registration.</P>
    <P>Some people have said they never heard of abuse in pre-school or playgroups, I know of one very agitated and upset parent in my constituency who phoned me constanly when she discovered that her five year old boy had been sexually abused by a son of the woman who is running the local community play group.  She knew that son had been there for a number of years &mdash; he is 23 or 24 years old &mdash; playing with the children.  The mother brought her child to the Garda station but it was very difficult to prove the case.  That woman wondered how many other children had been abused but had not told their mothers.  This does happen even though <Col N="2592" /> you may not hear about it.  I heard about it from somebody who was so desperately upset that she wanted to do something about it.  Services need to be registered and we need to know who is running them.  We need to give an assurance to parents who send their children to these centres and above all we need to protect these children.</P>
    <P>The point was raised about small groups.  I accept there are small community groups that should be assisted. When my children were small I worked in one of those groups.  Parents paid so much towards the running of the group and co-operated with the work.  Of course these groups should be in a separate category. I am not suggesting that we should come in with a heavy hand and put them out of business, but there is another category of groups who do good work and they must be regulated.  These are the groups who charge for their services and who want to be professional.  We have to make a distinction between the kind of groups we are talking about at local level and the bigger groups.  I do not want to put the local groups out of business but I would certainly like to see regulations to cover the larger groups.</P>

      <P>The House will recall the views expressed before the last division. Under section 40 the pre-school service means any pre-school, play group, den or creche, day care or other similar service, which caters for pre-school children.  Amendment No. 170 prescribes professional, educational or other qualifications required for persons carrying on that type of work.  Although I would not be very demanding about that there should be some qualification. My experience is that those who are already operating in the pre-school system have undergone courses and they are doing excellent work.  However, I put in the amendment for the purpose of having it regularised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 165 and 170 seek to include references to the qualifications of staff working in the pre-school services.  Amendment No. 169 also proposes that there be references to staffing ratios in the regulations.  The list of matters set out at section 41 (2) (a) is not intended to be exhaustive.  What are listed are some of the main items that may be dealt with in regulations, but as the introduction to the subsection makes clear, this is without prejudice to the power of the Minister for Health to impose requirements in relation to other matters not mentioned here.  There are difficulties about prescribing staffing ratios and minimum qualifications for <Col N="2596" /> staff in the pre-school area.  The fact is that there is no uniformity in staffing ratios or qualifications in the staff that exists at the moment in those services. The sudden imposition of strict requirements could throw those services into chaos.  This difficulty has been recognised by various working parties who have examined this area over the past number of years and all have urged that standards be raised gradually to avoid widespread disruption, if not the closure of existing services.  It is this gradual step by step approach that the Minister for Health intends to adopt.  Rushing in and fixing essential qualifications and minimum staffing levels could cause havoc and that is one thing we want to avoid.  It is for this reason I have reservations about imposing minimum qualifications or minimum standards, and maximum child staff ratios.</P>

That is not intended but there are people who are unsuited to run them.  What is required is that they should be pre-schools rather than child minding services.

The health boards employ a range of professional staff, social workers, nurses, doctors, health inspectors, engineers, etc. and any of them could contribute to the inspection process.  In view of this I do not think this amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Fennell is trying to achieve in this amendment is already provided for elsewhere in the Bill.  I would refer the House to section 10 which enables health boards to assist either financially or otherwise voluntary bodies who provide, or propose to provide, child care or family support services. This is broad enough to cover the provision of assistance to voluntary and community groups involved in the pre-school area.  As the Deputy is probably aware, health boards are already supporting almost 300 day nurseries and pre-school play groups throughout the country at a cost of about £1 million per annum.  It is our intention that this support would be maintained and extended to other services as resources become available.  In view of this perhaps Deputy Fennell will withdraw her amendment.</P>

      <P>49.&mdash;In this Part&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;children's residential centre&rdquo; means any home or other institution for the residential care of children in the care of health boards or other children who are not receiving adequate care and protection excluding&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) an institution managed by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board,</P>

    <P>(b) an institution in which a <Col N="2602" /> majority of the children being maintained are being treated for acute illnesses,</P>
    <P>(c) an institution for the care and maintenance of physically or mentally handicapped children,</P>
    <P>(d) a mental institution within the meaning of the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1966,</P>
    <P>(e) an institution which is a &ldquo;certified school&rdquo; within the meaning of Part IV of the Children Act, 1908, functions in relation to which stand vested in the Minister for Education;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;centre&rdquo; means a children's residential centre;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;register&rdquo; means a register of children's residential centres established under section 51 and, in relation to a particular health board, means the register established by that board and cognate words shall be construed accordingly;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;registered proprietor&rdquo;, in relation to a registered children's residential centre, means the person whose name is entered in the register as the person carrying on the centre;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the regulations&rdquo; means the regulations under section 53.</P>
    <P>This amendment is grouped with amendments Nos. 189 to 201, inclusive.  These amendments propose a radical overhaul of Part VIII of the Bill dealing with children's residential centres.  It might be helpful if I begin by setting out the present position in relation to the approval of residential centres for children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 186, 189, 191, 192, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 200, 201 and 203.  I would like to set out the present position in relation to the approval of residential centres for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under current legislation there are two <Col N="2603" /> categories of children's homes.  The Children's Act, 1908, provides for the certification of certain homes as industrial schools.  As the title suggests, these homes orginally dealt in the main with young offenders. However, for many years they have withdrawn from that type of work and they now cater for deprived and neglected children placed by the health boards.  There are some 20 homes in this category.  They include the following homes with which Members of the House may be familiar: St. Kyran's, Rathdrum, County Wicklow; St. Vincent's, Fair Street, Drogheda; St. Anne's Kilmacud, Dublin, Gracepark and May-field in Waterford and Nazareth Home in Tralee.</P>
    <P>The second category of homes are those approved by the Minister for Health under the Health Act, 1953, for the reception of children in the care of health boards.  Again, there are about 20 homes in this category which include Madonna House, Dublin; Miss Carr's Home, Dublin; St. Mura's Nursery, Fahan, County Donegal and others.</P>
    <P>While these two categories of homes have developed under two different Statutes, they all now deliver a similar service for children in the care of health boards and all are funded by the health boards. By virtue of section 55, it is intended that they would cease to be certified as industrial schools or approved homes, as the case may be, and would become children's residential centres.</P>
    <P>Under existing law there is no requirement on a religious community or other body who propose to establish a residential home for children to seek approval or recognition from a health board or from the Minister for Health. The decision to apply for approval is entirely at their discretion.  In practice, the management of such homes do apply for approval or certification in order to secure a commitment of financial support from the health board for their operations. However, in some cases, homes may be set up and operated without any direct support from the health board.</P>
    <P>At the Special Committee there was <Col N="2604" /> unanimous agreement on all sides that the Bill should be amended so that it would not be lawful for any person or body to operate a home for children unless it was registered with the local health board.  The amendments seek to give effect to the desire of Deputies that a registration system for these homes be set in place.  I might add that the registration scheme we are proposing is closely modelled on the new nursing homes legislation which was recently passed by the House and has since been enacted into law.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that these amendments will be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is taking quite a mouthful by grouping all these amendments together.  I want to refer first to my amendments.  My amendment No. 190 is the same as amendment No. 181 which was discussed on Committee Stage.  It seeks to reinforce the provision whereby the Minister may prescribe requirements as to the design, maintenance, repair, ventilation, heating and so on and the different factors relating to pupil-teacher ratio in children's residential centres.  My amendment provides that it shall be obligatory on the Minister to do this.  The Minister did not say whether this requirement would be obligatory.</P>
      <P>The same point can be made about amendment No. 193 in my name.  Section 52 refers to the withdrawal of approval and the closure of children's residential centres.  If circumstances are so serious that the Minister is dissatisfied with the condition or management of a centre or it appears the centre is not complying with the relevant provisions he should take the appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to my amendments Nos. 197 and 199 which I regard as important.  Amendment No. 199 relates to the training and qualifications of staff in children's residential centres. We are dealing with children who are likely to be the subject of care orders already, children who have obviously been deprived and are at risk.  It has to be said that there is a severe lack of these <Col N="2605" /> centres.  We all know of the celebrated cases arising out of our juvenile justice system where young female offenders, in particular, under the age of 18 have been repeatedly on remand to District Court sittings by virtue of the fact that no suitable centres could be found for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a point of substance and that is that the <Col N="2607" /> Department of Justice have not been able to provide adequate residential care centres with secure facilities.  We have now been dealing with Report Stage for three days and the Minister has not yet told us which Department of State will have the responsibility to look after the welfare and needs of children.  At Dún Laoghaire District Court a young female offender was remanded on seven different occasions because Justice Windle was not satisfied that proper residential care was available for her.  We have seen this repeated in other cases, particularly in Dublin.  Indeed, we had one spectacular case in the Minister's own constituency in Galway where, Pontius Pilate like, the health board, the local authority and the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Education all said it was not their problem but somebody else's.  In the finish the poor hapless Minister for Health had to deal with it as he was not vigorous enough and did not get rid of it.</P>
      <P>Before Report Stage concludes at 7 p.m. the Minister should assert, on behalf of the Government, which Department will be responsible for looking after the welfare of children.  It is all very fine to meet the bureaucratic point on registration &mdash; we will have no difficulty in supporting that &mdash; but it should be borne in mind that we are not talking here about people who are being neglected but rather about people who have committed criminal offences, have got on the wrong side of the law and who undoubtedly require special treatment facilities.  I want to be told who will take charge of these residential care centres and whether, for example, Lusk House on the north side of the city will be covered.  It is all very fine to abolish the workshops and change the name on the door but if we are sincere all residential care centres which deal with people under the age of 18 should be brought under the one umbrella.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I will be given only one opportunity I ask the Minister to reply to two questions. First, which Department are going <Col N="2608" /> to be responsible and will all secure residential centres be covered by this legislation? If they will not and the Minister continues to fudge the issue of singular departmental responsibility we will have failed to look after the welfare of these boys and girls.  I hope the Minister will not continue to dodge this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Yates's difficulty in dealing with this Part of the Bill.  Very simply, it has been completely redrafted since the Special Committee. I welcome this but it presents us with a great difficulty.  The new draft was circulated on white paper last Thursday. I welcome that new draft as it takes account of many of the comments made at the Special Committee.  However we do not have sufficient time to consider the implications of the five new sections to be inserted in this Part of the Bill, to take note of the views of other agencies and see if it is possible to amend it further. It is quite difficult to amend a ministerial amendment as time available is so short. Notwithstanding this I am prepared, having read the new draft, to accept that it represents a significant improvement on the Part to be deleted and to support it on that basis.</P>
      <P>The registration process is copied from the one included in the nursing homes legislation.  Most of us here dealt with that legislation so we can follow it.  I would now like to refer to the point made by Deputy Yates which I made on a previous section.  It is important before we finish to grasp the nettle.  I for one heard echoes from the past when Deputy O'Donoghue or some other Deputy on the Government side indicated that it would not be right for the Department of Health to step on the toes of the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>A view shared by all Members of the House is that we should finally decide.  Ideally the Minister for Health should have the exclusive responsibility for looking after the needs of children and dealing with any difficulties which may arise.  It is important that the Minister would clarify that point.  I heartily endorse the comments made by Deputy Yates in that regard.  Apart from that I have no difficulty with supporting the new draft in so far as I can absorb the implications of the five new sections which represent a significant improvement on the Part we dealt with at the Special Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Howlin said, they represent a significant improvement and the Minister is to be complimented.  It is fairly clear as to what exactly is a residential care centre and who has the responsibility.  In section 2 &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; is defined as the Minister for Health and, accordingly, he is the Minister responsible for child care under the Bill.  A &ldquo;children's residential centre&rdquo; is defined in section 49 as a home or other institution for the residential care of children in the care of health boards or other children not receiving adequate care and protection.  The section then goes on to exclude various other places which would not be considered to be children's residential centres.  Therefore the Bill very clearly and definitely sets out that the person who will have responsibility for looking after children's residential centres under the Child Care Bill will unquestionably and indisputably be the Minister for Health.  Therefore everybody will know exactly where they stand.</P>

Given that the Minister has made many changes that are complicated it would be of help if he published an explanatory memorandum or, perhaps, deal with <Col N="2610" /> them in a separate Bill.  If we had been given an explanatory memorandum outlining these changes we might have been able to approach them in a more professional manner.  However I compliment the Minister as they are much better than what is contained in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Lest there be any confusion, responsibility for the provision of facilities for the accommodation of young offenders under the age of 16 years has since the foundation of the State rested with the Minister for Education and the Department of Education.  It is not proposed to effect any change in this arrangement in the context of this Bill. Any such change would be properly considered in the context of a reform of our juvenile justice system, which is not the purpose of this Bill and which is not my responsibility.

The Minister for Education has responded with resources and is providing facilities in her area.  We in the Department of Health are making our contribution by way of a commitment to give extra resources for extra services, extra options to the courts and better protection for children who are neglected.  The Government will respond within the law and adhere to the decisions of the courts as they are made.  The Deputy picked one case in my great county.

    <P>&ldquo;(4)  All staff employed in children's residential centres shall be required to have suitable training and qualifications, which shall be prescribed by the Minister and shall be registered as prescribed by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment on a single issue relating to the staff qualifications for these child residential centres. I believe very strongly that the staff require special skills and special training to provide specialised care necessary to deal with the type of deprivation suffered by the children in these residential centres.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the plethora of pre-schools and playschools who might not sustain a crushing burden of bureaucracy, we are dealing here with a couple of dozen State-owned residential centres throughout the country.  We should observe international standards in regard to the training and qualifications of the staff in these centres.  This matter was discussed on Committee Stage as amendment No. 186.  It attracted substantial support and it is important that it be debated again.  Some of these residential State centres may be State-owned but they are run like public voluntary hospitals. It is important that there be uniformity between the different centres so that a centre in Donegal and another in Kerry would have the same standard of staff.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  There is no good argument for rejecting it.  The wording is clearcut.  It may initially require some modifications to ensure that existing residential centres are brought up to standard.  It is vital that there be a proper therapeutic and rehabilitative aspect to these centres.  We do not want the revolving door syndrome that we have in our prisons applied to child residential centres.  We must have a quality of rehabilitation and a quality of care that allows people to go on to have the fullest possible opportunity in life, to have a career and a family and so on.  I <Col N="2623" /> would ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 199 as something eminently fair and reasonable which will bring a new level of professionalism to a wide variety of centres which are being brought in under this legislation.</P>

      <P>Then the Minister's amendment continues to say, in sub-paragraph (2) that he &ldquo;may&rdquo; prescribe requirements as to the numbers, qualifications and availability of members of the staffs of centres. Therefore, the only real difference between what the Minister and Deputy Yates are saying is in the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  If the Minister agrees to the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; then sub-paragraphs (a) to (g) of subsection (2) become imperatives.  I have an open mind on the matter.  I am in no doubt under the provisions of that subsection that the Minister would ensure that such staff would have the necessary qualifications.  But if Deputy Yates or the Minister feel it should be a statutory imperative that is a matter for them.</P>

      <P>I want to support this amendment.  We discussed it at Special Committee at which time the Minister felt it was covered already by way of <Col N="2624" /> regulation and did not see the need for it.  It has been my experience that most staff employed in such residential centres are already well qualified; that would apply to virtually all, if not all, of the staff so currently employed.  Therefore the requirement of training and professionalism is not a new imposition; it is <i>de facto</i> the case, but it is useful to have it enshrined in the legislation.  Because it exists already it would not be a great burden on any of the existing facilities or their staffs, but it should be signalled that we require it for people dealing with children in residential homes.  For that reason the Minister should take the amendment on board.</P>
      <P>In relation to having a register, I hope the Minister will not advance the same argument in regard to the burden of bureaucracy, the difficulties, expense or whatever that would cause.  It is important, since all these centres would be State-funded, that there would be a statutory mechanism for registration.  It is a modest enough requirement, one that the Minister could well incorporate into the new section 53, to be inserted under the Minister's amendment No. 194 we have already passed.  The Minister has moved along the road we requested at Special Committee.  He has redrafted this whole Part, with four new sections.  This would represent a little extra strengthening of our case.  I do not think it would be difficult for the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>We are all aware that the skills, talents and qualifications of staff employed in children's residential centres must be of the highest quality.  What we are hoping is that such staff will replace the most fundamental loss to any child, that is the basic love, support and all that the family home normally provides.  I do not need to labour that point; the Minister knows exactly what I am talking about.  That is the type of qualification and skill needed for those people who endeavour to replace the normal quality of home life.  We must also acknowledge the value of such staff and the task they perform at that level.  If there were any <Col N="2625" /> further qualifications needed on the part of existing staff, perhaps the Minister would ensure they would be subsidised and encouraged in that endeavour.  We cannot speak too highly of the commitment and dedication of the staff employed in this area.</P>

      <P>I can go along with what has already been said.  It would be unusual in a Bill that we prescribe the requirements <i>vis-á-vis</i> food to be provided for children and not the qualifications of the relevant staff dealing with them.  My only caveat would be that not alone should the staff have academic qualifications or be properly trained but their personal qualities and choosing them will be vital to the whole exercise. The only caveat I would have is that I would hate to see somebody eminently suitable for the task, because of their personal qualities, being excluded.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment for the reasons already stated but specifically because, in the definitions section, as specified in amendment No. 186, at sub-paragraph (c) we talk about an institution for the care and maintenance of physically or mentally handicapped children.  I am aware that this is a very expensive service to provide and maintain.  There may be a temptation to cut costs and perhaps, not provide for the requisite quality of staff these children need.</P>

      <P>There are two elements contained in amendment No. 199.  The first is that staff in children's homes should be properly trained.  The second element is that they should be registered under some statutory procedure.  As regards the first matter I accept that the staff of our homes should be suitably trained and qualified.  That is the case in respect of the vast bulk of existing staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the regulations to be made under the provisions of amendment No. 194 will impose requirements as to qualifications and so on.  Therefore, I put it to the House that this aspect is <Col N="2626" /> adequately provided for in amendment No. 194, subsection (2) (b).</P>
    <P>The second aspect is the introduction of a system of professional registration. As the house is probably aware, this is to be the subject of a separate Bill to be promoted by the Minister for Health. The purpose of the proposed Bill is to provide for the introduction of statutory registration for a range of health professionals, including child care workers, social workers, physiotherapists, radiographers and others.  The preparation of the Bill is proceeding in consultation with the various staff interests.  This is also linked to the mutual recognition of qualifications post-1992.  In view of all this I would sincerely ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing his amendment.</P>

      <P>The brief has not changed. I do not have the kind of expertise available to the Minister.  I intend to press this amendment because I believe that, to await European directives, is the wrong way to approach this matter.  Of course, there is a European directive in relation to everything from radiographers to people working in pathology departments in hospitals, physiotherapists and so on; we all know that.  It is probable that that will be delayed, we will get a derogation and, eventually, introduce it in 1994.  Deputy O'Donoghue is correct in this that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; do it.  It <Col N="2627" /> is quite obvious that he will not do it until 1992 anyway according to what he has just said &mdash; whether he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do it or &ldquo;may&rdquo; do it.  It is clear that in the regulations he is not going to do this in the short term, therefore the House has to insist that this matter be dealt with.  It is very important that we have and continue to have quality people, with a proper career and pay structure for them in residential care centres.  Because we are dealing with young people in their formative years who are in difficult circumstances, probably in these centres because they are abused, we cannot tolerate anything less than the Minister pulling his finger out, making the effort and ensuring the strictest possible qualifications. I will be pressing my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 28, line 7, after &ldquo;board&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in consultation with the board membership&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This relates to a very important matter, the functions of the chief executive officer in implementing this legislation.  Against my best determination to seek otherwise, the health boards are having the sole operation of this legislation.  As we and members of health boards know, the <Col N="2628" /> chief executive officer's powers are very formidable and I am very afraid that under the present wording of section 60 the functions that should be related to the board and the chief executive officer are as one.  While I agree that there should be day to day executive and managerial control by the chief executive officer, because of the financial and other constraints and the fact that they have responsibility for community care, general hospitals, special hospitals and so many new services, I am seeking to provide in section 60 that functions relating to a health board shall be the functions of the chief executive officer of the board &ldquo;in consultation with the board membership&rdquo;. With no disrespect to the eight men involved &mdash; no women I might add &mdash; I am not satisfied that they should be given the sole prerogative.  We slip it in at the end of the day's work, having decided that all this is good and idealistic and has to be done, but at the end of the day the chief executive officer can say he has this, that or the other constraint on him.  This is the usual subterfuge we can expect from Hawkins House and we will have to amend section 60 (1).  I am seeking to insert that the chief executive officer can exercise his functions only in consultation with board membership.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about the role of child care advisory committees and other bodies, but one thing has become clear from what the Minister has said; he wants nobody, other than the chief executive officer, involved in individual cases.  We had amendments dealing with child care advisory committees and the Minister specifically rejected any role for the advisory committees and any possible role for them regarding any information to do with any individual, and that means an executive day-to-day role.  Therefore, I am seeking that one man will not have an authoritarian role.  I feel my request is reasonable and modest and will ensure that the best intentions of this legislation will be tempered by the type of democracy and consultation I am proposing.  I feel that, as we are all democrats in this <Col N="2629" /> House, we should accept this amendment. I believe it is an important improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I did not really cop on until now, when it was pointed out, what is contained in this section.  There are such things as powers vested in members and powers vested in management, but to introduce and enact legislation and give the whole range of power contained in that section to the chief executive officer would mean we would be going nowhere. Even in the matter of the functions in relation to the supervision of pre-school services, how could you involve the chief executive officer?  I am taking that as the extreme.  He would have to have consultations with his officers on the ground. We have talked about advisory committees.</P>
      <P>This is a good amendment.  To give effect to all the other provisions in this Bill it is important that this amendment be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to speak in favour of it, but I wanted to put my credentials up there, unlike Deputy Yates who suggested during this debate that everything should be taken to the centre, that the Department of Health should be making regulations for this, that and the other and that all the functions should be taken from local level. That has been the argument throughout Committee and Report Stage.  I do not come to this amendment from that viewpoint; I take an opposite view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2630" /> I am not going to question the Deputy's motivation in putting down this amendment. I can see his reasoning behind it. He felt the amendment would strengthen local democracy and so on, but can you conceive of a full health board considering taking a child into care under section 4 of the Bill or the full health board having to be consulted about any of the other things listed in section 60 (1) (a) to (h)?  The function of the health board under this Bill is to decide the policy.  The function of the chief executive officer is to implement that policy and he has to make executive decisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates may want to look at his amendment again.  With all due respect to him, what he is suggesting in this amendment will cause hardship, trouble and all sorts of problems for precisely the people we are trying to protect, the children.  If a health board chief executive officer, or somebody duly authorised by him, cannot make executive decisions in relation to taking children into care or do all the other things outlined here, then we will have to have health boards permanently in session or people will have to wait for care orders and other things until the next monthly meeting of the health board.  While I appreciate the intent behind the amendment, I think it is just not feasible, it is not workable and it should be withdrawn without futher discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, Deputy Yates's amendment looks eminently reasonable, but then we read paragraphs (a) to (e) in the section.  We are discussing children and families who are already traumatised.  Are we going to have cases discussed in public debated in the evening papers and, no doubt, on radio and TV?  This would be the effect if we adopt this amendment and let there be no doubt about it.  What we are doing is heaping indignity upon indignity on people already seriously damaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been a member of a health board for ten or 11 years, I would like to make a brief comment. The present procedure is that the chief <Col N="2631" /> executive officer makes an order committing a child to care.  This is done by order at the public health board meeting and by reference number.  Any member is entitled to get information from the chief executive officer if he so wishes. There is, therefore, some element of confidentiality. At the moment, under the powers vested in the chief executive officer, an order is made by the chairman at a public meeting but he is never questioned by the members unless they want information, and that is always available. I am not sure whether that is sufficient compromise.  The power to make the order has to be vested in somebody responsible but I take it that the chief executive officer would always be acting on behalf of the board and subject to the board's questioning, criticism or otherwise. That has been my experience up to now.  I am not sure whether that would satisfy Deputy Yates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to Deputy Yates, he has gone over the top with this one.  Aside altogether from his conversion on the worth of health boards, it is ironic that I who criticised him for his criticism of health boards yesterday would urge him to withdraw this amendment, because, to be honest, it is ridiculous.  It is ridiculous because we would have the health boards discussing a child's circumstances at their monthly meetings.  The Deputy need not tell me that even though they are discussed anonymously, people would not be in a position to identify a case in a small town or village.  They certainly would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the role of members of the health board if I, as a member of the Southern Health Board, decide that I do not agree with a certain decision taken in relation to a child in my constituency, is it open to me to raise that matter by way of a motion at a health board meeting? If I thought the dignity of the individual concerned, and confidentiality, would be <Col N="2632" /> maintained, I could certainly go privately to the chief executive officer of the health board.  Can one imagine a health board deciding whether or not a child should be taken into care?  How many meetings would the health board have to have every month to make these decisions? Can one imagine a scenario whereby a health board, under section 48, would decide whether or not an individual should be charged in relation to a given matter?</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates, on balance, is a sensible man and will now see that this amendment is just not on.  It would not be fair to the Bill, and it certainly would not be fair to the children this Bill is supposed to protect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of section 60 is to assign responsibility for certain functions to the chief executive officer and, through him, to other staff of the health board.  This is fully in keeping with the practice that has always obtained since the health boards were established whereby responsibility for individual cases rests with the staff of the health board, while the health board has a broad policy role.</P>
      <P>It is also in line with the practice that applies in local government where decisions on individual cases are primarily for the management, with the elected members exercising certain reserved functions.  Obviously, it is part of the chief executive officer's role to keep the board informed generally on the affairs of the health board and to discuss major questions of policy with them.</P>
      <P>However, what Deputy Yates is proposing would go much further than that. For example, under paragraph (f), sub-section (1) the chief executive officer would be required to consult the board about the arrangements for the care of individual children.  I am sure the House would agree that this would not be appropriate and for this reason I will not be able to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with what Deputy Ferris has <Col N="2633" /> said.  He has described exactly the situation as it obtains at the moment in the health boards.</P>
    <P>Deputies Yates and Sherlock are not correct in saying that all these functions will be performed by the chief executive officer.  That is not what we want at all. I would refer the House to section 3 (4) of the Bill.  This enables the chief executive officer to delegate any of the functions conferred under section 60 to other officers of the health board.  Obviously, decisions in relation to individual children will be taken by the social workers, psychiatrists, doctors, nurses, psychologists and others involved in a particular case.  The function of the chief executive officer and the board will be to decide an overall policy and objectives. The same arrangements apply in relation to hospital and other services provided by the health boards.</P>
    <P>I have been as broad and as positive as I can throughout the debate.  I accepted an amendment on Tuesday from Deputy Yates, amendment No. 29 (a), which confers a role on the child care advisory committees in health board areas.  We can pass all the Bills we like but unless there is accountability of operation, unless there is a chain of command to ensure that the resources of the State are disbursed in a proper manner, and unless at the end of the day people know what is going on we will be going nowhere.</P>
    <P>Under the 1970 Act the chief executive officer discharges the functions, and bestows on other officers the opportunity to discharge functions and professional duties on his behalf.  He, in turn, is responsible to the Minister for Health and the Department.  The Minister is responsible to the Parliament and any Member, on behalf of the people, can ask a question about a specific situation and get that information.  The Parliament in turn, is responsible to the people.  That is democracy at work in the broadest context we can have.  We have a very broad open democracy and there is a clear chain of command.  There is clear responsibility, clear accountability.  I would be sincerely grateful to Deputy <Col N="2634" /> Yates if he would withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>That is laid down in sub-section (2).  Any question as to whether or not a function is a function of the chief executive officer shall be determined by the Minister.  I want to give the Minister a clear message, and I believe it is the view of this House, that all aspects of planning and of the development of child care services should be done in consultation. I would go a lot further than the Minister has gone and say there should be within each health board a programme manager for child care services, especially in the initial years, to ensure that this legislation is backed up with resources.</P>
      <P>In the interests of time I will withdraw this amendment but the point is well made that we need to have clear division of responsibility between Executive action and policy considerations.

      <P>I move amendment No. 206:</P>
      <P>In page 29, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;63.&mdash;(1)  It shall not be lawful for any child to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  be remanded in custody to, or</P>
      <P>(b)  serve all or any part of a custodial sentence in,</P>
      <P>any adult prison.</P>
      <P>(2)  It shall not be lawful for any child to be held in a Garda station for a period longer than 24 hours.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these two amendments is to take out of our legislation the power of a court to commit a child to prison. Amendment No. 206 says that it shall not be lawful for any child to be remanded in custody or to serve all or any part of a custodial sentence in any adult prison.  It also states that it shall not be lawful for any child to be held in a Garda station for a period longer than 24 hours. Amendment No. 211 proposes to delete from the children Act, 1908, the two sections that deal with the powers of courts to remand and sentence children to adult prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth remembering in the context of the 1908 legislation, which is the operative legislation in this case, that a court is required as a prerequisite of its sentencing a child to an adult prison to certify that the person is so unruly and so <Col N="2637" /> depraved a character that he cannot be safely detained in custody other than an adult prison.  Those are the concepts embodied in sections 97 and 102 (3) that we are seeking to delete.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the United Nations Convention on Civil and Political Rights.  On 30 September of this year the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, attended the New York UNICEF World Summit for Children and signed the Book of Intent, indicating our country's intention to adopt the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the culmination of years of work since the International Year of the Child in 1979.  That convention places on any contracting party to the convention a number of obligations with regard to the incarceration of children.  It states in paragraph 37 (b):</P>
    <P>No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time;</P>
    <P>Paragraph 37 (c) states:</P>
    <P>Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons and their age.  In particular, every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child's best interests.</P>
    <P>None of that is being adhered to or given credence in the law as it stands under the 1908 Act.  So far this year 21 children under the age of 15 years have been committed to prison in adult prisons.  More recently, two young girls spent up to two weeks on remand in Garda stations because a suitable place of incarceration could not be found for them.  These young people are being locked up in prison without any segregation, not in their best interests as is mentioned in the convention but out of desperation because there is simply nowhere else to put them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2638" /> The Minister may say this is the responsibility of another Department but we are dealing with child care in the context of the convention, and it is important that we address it just as, for example, we have addressed the question of the death penalty.  I know he will talk about what is to be provided; he referred to this in the House last week.  We should not lose the opportunity to delete these two very invidious provisions of the 1908 Act and ensure that from now on no court will have the opportunity, for whatever reason, to send a child to an adult prison and no child will spend longer than the minimum period necessary in a Garda station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I note Deputy McCartan is present to deal with this matter and, being a law man, I am sure he can appreciate that you cannot make provision in a piecemeal way in a children Bill for something that is legally the responsibility of another Department. This Bill is primarily concerned with providing care for children who are in need of protection.  It does not purport to reform the law in relation to juvenile justice.  Such reform would require comprehensive legislation in its own right.  It cannot be achieved by way of piecemeal amendments in this Bill, and I am sure Deputy McCartan can readily accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, of course, aware of recent concern about young persons being sent to adult prisons.  I would like to briefly set out the legal position in this area.  Persons under the age of 15 cannot be sent to prison.  Persons aged 15 or 16 can only be sent to prison in accordance with the provisions of sections 97 and 102 of the Children Act, 1908.  In these cases the court has to certify, as Deputy McCartan has said, that the young person is of so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under that part of the Act, or that he is of so depraved a character that he is not capable of being so detained.  Last August my colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, Minister for Justice, made regulations providing for the detention of certain 15 year <Col N="2639" /> olds in the place of detention at Wheatfield instead of in Mountjoy, Cork or Limerick prisons.  Those regulations made possible the transfer to Wheatfield of boys who had been sentenced to prison by the courts.  The Minister considered that Wheatfield provided a more suitable environment than Mountjoy, or the other prisons, for children under 16 years, given the age structure of the population there generally and the emphasis in its regime on education and work-training for young offenders.</P>
    <P>There is a number of institutions operated by the Department of Justice which cater specifically for young male offenders aged 16 to 21 years.  The policy of the Department of Justice is to concentrate the accommodation of people under 21 years of age in those institutions. It has to be said, however, that there may be good reasons for accommodating some offenders in that age category in a prison.  For instance, young offenders from the Munster counties sometimes prefer to be accommodated in either Cork or Limerick prisons or at Fort Mitchel on Spike Island.  Their accommodation at these locations greatly facilitates visits from families and friends of offenders which are very important from the point of view of the wellbeing of inmates.</P>
    <P>The general picture as regards young persons being maintained in custody in prisons or places of detention is that the majority of young male offenders are accommodated in institutions designated for them specifically.</P>
    <P>The difficulties, which have received considerable attention in this House and in the media, relate primarily to young female offenders for whom an insufficient number of secure places are available. Deputies will be aware of the announcement by the Minister for Justice of the Government's decision to plan and build a new secure unit for female offenders.  I understand that a planning team, under the aegis of the Department of Education, are well advanced in their work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2640" /> Regarding subsection (2) of the proposed amendment, the holding of a child in a Garda station for not longer than 24 hours, it is a regrettable fact that children commit serious offences such as burglary, robbery and assault.  I am sure that Deputy McCartan, as a legal man, appreciates this.  It happens, therefore, from time to time that children must be detained in Garda stations in connection with criminal offences and the Garda must, of course, have adequate power to deal with such situations.  Needless to say, in such circumstances, it is essential that the welfare and the rights of the child must also be fully protected.  To that end specific provisions are contained in the Criminal Justice (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations, 1987, which put in place very particular safeguards on the rights of persons in Garda custody who are under 17 years of age.</P>
    <P>I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, that these provisions, in situations where detention of juveniles prove necessary, serve to ensure that children are adequately protected by the law.  Therefore, I do not see any merit in the Deputy's proposed amendment to the existing law in this respect.</P>
    <P>The reform of our juvenile justice system is a complex issue and would require a great deal of careful consideration before any changes are legislated for.  I am satisfied that such consideration is not a matter to be undertaken in the context of a Child Care Bill, it is a matter which should be considered in the context of criminal justice policy in relation to young people generally.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I cannot agree to accept these amendments.</P>

The Minister said that it was not appropriate to this Bill. However, we should very strongly signal that we accept the fundamental principle enshrined in this amendment.  I would happily have applauded the Minister if he had said that another Bill was in an advanced state of preparation which would be before the House next session incorporating these principles but, unfortunately, he has not given that commitment. It is shameful not to enact this amendment in those circumstances.</P>

      <P>A constituent of mine was sent to Mountjoy jail and his experience proved beyond all doubt that adult prisons only succeed in making juveniles better trained in criminal activities; it further pursues the question of revolving door justice instead of doing anything to rehabilitate them.  I am not spokesman for Justice but, as someone responsible for the area of child care, I feel that adult prisons are not suitable and there should be proper centres to ensure that these young people have a better future away from crime.</P>

      <P>63.&mdash;(1)  Any person, not being a child, who sells, offers or makes available to a child or young person any volatile substance in circumstances in which it would be reasonable for that person to know or suspect that the substance will be or is likely to be misused by that child or young person in a manner which is likely to cause him to be intoxicated shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2643" /> (2)  (a)  Any person who sells, offers or makes available to a child or young person a volatile substance to which this paragraph applies, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Minister may prescribe volatile substances to which paragraph (a) shall apply, whether in respect of children or young persons or both.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a person is prosecuted for an offence under subsection (1) or (2), it shall be a defence for him to prove that he took reasonable steps to assure himself that the person to whom any volatile substance was sold, offered or made available was not a child or a young person, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(4)  Subject to subsection (6), a court by which a person is convicted of an offence under this section may order anything shown to the satisfaction of the court to relate to the offence to be forfeited and either destroyed or dealt with in such other manner as the court thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(5)  A court shall not order anything to be forfeited under this section if a person claiming to be the owner of or otherwise interested in it applies to be heard by the court, unless an opportunity is given to him to show cause why the order should not be made.</P>
    <P>(6)  A member of the Garda Síochána may seize any volatile substance prescribed by the Minister under sub-section (2)  which is in the possession of a child or young person in any public place or any volatile substance (whether so prescribed or not) which is being misused by a child or young person in a manner likely to cause him to be intoxicated.  Any substance so seized may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of in such manner as a member of the Garda Síochána not <Col N="2644" /> below the rank of Chief Superintendent may direct.</P>

      <P>There is no major amendment from Committee Stage to section 63.  I raised an issue, widely publicised at the time, which took place in my constituency where two youngsters bought petrol from a garage, went down to a field, intimidated another young boy in the vicinity, threw petrol on him and set him on fire.  The boy was very badly burnt.  In the special committee I raised the possibility that this could be looked at in the light of an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that the Minister has looked at my request in the meantime and that there is a difficulty with bringing it in here.  The legislation merely deals with the inhalation of solvents.  It would be possible to convict someone for selling petrol to a child if it could be proved that the child was intending to inhale it but the reality in this instance is that the petrol was used to set the child alight.  When this incident happened I brought it to the notice of the Minister for Justice and was passed from Department to Department because there was a difficulty as to which Department were responsible for the use of these substances. It transpired eventually that it came under the Dangerous Substances Act which was the responsibility of the Department of Labour.  I am extremely concerned about the danger of selling petrol to young children.  While I fully accept that it is not possible to include it in this Bill, I would implore the Minister to make some representations to the Department of Labour to see if it would be possible to have it taken care of elsewhere, because of the fears raised by me.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Sherlock is the section that was in the original Bill proposed by the former Deputy Desmond when he was Minister for Health, and incorporated in the Private Members' Bill I circulated in 1987.  The Minister's section has a glaring flaw.  I have no difficulty in <Col N="2645" /> accepting the Minister's section with one caveat and that is why I took one section from the old Bill to insert it into this as a new subsection (7) to give the power to the Garda, if when walking the streets they see a child intoxicating himself with glue, to take the glue away from the child. There will not be that clear power in the section if we do not include the amendment in my name and the name of Deputy Ferris.  It is of the utmost importance that the members of the Garda Síochána should have the power to seize such a substance in the possession of a person in a public place, which is causing him to be intoxicated.  It is a very important power.  We have all been shocked to walk the streets &mdash; although thankfully it is now less common than it once was &mdash; to see children intoxicating themselves with glue or other substances and seemingly no one had the power to intervene.  It should be clearly spelled out and incorporated in this Bill.  I sincerely ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 209 which would enable the Garda to make those interventions.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 207 is similar to an amendment we discussed at the special committee.  There is a number of important differences between it and section 63.  Subsection (1) of the amendment is broadly similar in effect to section 63 (1) of the Bill.  It makes it an offence for a person to sell or make available any volatile substance to a child where it would be reasonable for him to know or suspect that it is likely to be misused by that child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main difference is that the amendment uses the term &ldquo;volatile substance&rdquo; but the Bill does not.  Subsection (2) of amendment No. 207 gives the Minister the power to prescribe certain products which could not be sold to children under any circumstances.  In drafting the Bill a lot of thought was given to the effectiveness of such a provision and the Government came to the conclusion that it would be of no value since all the products that are generally abused &mdash; glues, aerosols, cigarette lighter fuels, household cleaners and butane gas &mdash; are freely available in the average home and <Col N="2647" /> children have legitimate reasons for using them.  To prosecute shopkeepers, for example, for selling glue to a child building a model aircraft would not make any sense.  I pointed this out at the Special Committee.  The last major difference between amendment No. 207 and the Bill is subsection (6) which would enable the Garda to seize volatile substances from children.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the contributions in relation to amendment No. 209 and with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, and the co-operation of the House, I am prepared to accept this amendment provided we can amend it slightly to read:</P>

I sincerely thank the staff of my Department, the staff of the Office of the Attorney General, the Government and all Members of the House, particularly the members of the Special Committee, who worked diligently for the past 15 months to ensure that we brought forward a very positive and progressive Bill. To Members who participated in the Report Stage debate I am sincerely grateful. I am particularly grateful to the spokespersons from the various parties who played such a co-operative and key role in achieving this wonderful Bill.  It is an historic occasion.</P>

I would like to thank you, Sir, your colleagues, and staff, for the efficient and courteous way you assisted us in our deliberations.  This is very important legislation and it has taken up a great deal of our time.  It is a radical improvement on the Bill originally published by this and previous Governments.  There is a need for a further child care Bill to deal with the remaining issues raised in the report of the Law Report Commission and I hope that will be considered next year.</P>

I commend heartily the attitude of the Minister during the course of the debate for the last 25 hours and also during Committee Stage.  We made substantial improvements to a Bill of which we can all be proud.  The process we went through in the last 15 months will stand to us all.  I found it to be a broadening and a learning process and I am grateful for having had the opportunity of doing that.  I commend you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the staff of the House for the <Col N="2651" /> assistance they gave all of us on the Committee and Report Stages.

      <P>This is very important legislation and I am glad, on behalf of my party, to have been associated with it. The Bill places a huge statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children.  The provisions of the Bill have implications for the boards with regard to manpower resources, funding arrangements and so forth.  While the debate was taking place, and during the past year, I told the people interested in this legislation that I had no doubt about the sincerity of the Minister of State, the Minister for Health and the Department of Health to have the legislation enacted. As I said earlier, this is legislation we have been crying out for for a long time but the implementation of its provisions will require finance.  I did ask the question concerning costs in my own health board area some months ago and I was told it was estimated that an additional £2.5 million would be required.  That indicates the magnitude of the problem we are confronting.  I have confidence in the Minister, and the Department, to implement them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to fix the total number of members of Dáil Éireann in pursuance of subsection 2 of Article 16.2 of the Constitution and, in pursuance of subsection 4 of the same Article, to revise the constituencies in respect of which members are elected to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutional requirements in relation to membership of the Dáil and in relation to constituency formation may be summarised as follows: the number of members must be fixed from time to time by law; there must be at least one member for every 30,000 of the population and not more than one for every 20,000, the ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency as ascertained at the last preceding census shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country; the Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every 12 years with due regard to changes in distribution of the population; and the number of members to be returned for <Col N="2653" /> any constituency shall not be less than three.</P>
    <P>These constitutional provisions were considered by the courts in two well known cases in 1961 &mdash; the High Court case of John O'Donovan versus the Attorney General and the Supreme Court reference case relating to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961.  In neither of these cases did the courts quantify the precise degree of equality of representation which is required by the Constitution. However, in an <i>obiter dictum,</i> the judge in the O'Donovan case appeared to suggest that a departure of about 5 per cent from strict mathematical parity would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of equality of representation, the Supreme Court stated that:</P>
    <P>The sub-clause [of the Constitution] recognises that exact parity in the ratio between members and the population of each constituency is unlikely to be obtained and is not required.  The decision as to what is practicable is within the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.  It may reasonably take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the desirability so far as possible to adhere to well-known boundaries such as those of counties, townlands and electoral divisions.  The existence of divisions created by such physical features as rivers, lakes and mountains may also have to be reckoned with.  The problem of what is practicable is primarily one for the Oireachtas, whose members have a knowledge of the problems and difficulties to be solved which this Court cannot have.  Its decision should not be reviewed by this Court unless there is a manifest infringement of the Article. This Court cannot, as is suggested, lay down a figure above or below which a variation from what is called the national average is not permitted. This, of course, is not to say that a court cannot be informed of the difficulties and may not pronounce on whether there has been such a serious <Col N="2654" /> divergence from uniformity as to violate the requirments of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>To justify the Court in holding that the sub-section has been infringed it must, however, be shown that the failure to maintain the ratio between the number of members for each constituency and the population of each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachtas has not carried out the intention of the sub-clause.</P>
    <P>In each revision of constituencies effected between 1961 and 1980, the limit of 5 per cent, suggested in the O'Donovan case, was adhered to.  It would seem that the Oireachtas was not prepared to risk the possibility of a revision being upset on these grounds.</P>
    <P>In the revision of constituencies carried out in 1980, which was the first revision based on the recommendations of an independent commission, a more substantial departure from mathematical equality was adopted.  The greatest departure from the national average in that revision was 6.4 per cent.  In the revision effected in 1983, the greatest departure was 7.9 per cent.  In the scheme of constituencies proposed by the present Bill, the average per member in the case of the individual constituencies ranges from 7 per cent below the national average to 7.6 per cent above.</P>
    <P>In this connection I think it is appropriate to draw attention to the statement in regard to equality contained in the report of the Constituency Commission presented in October 1988.  At page 28 of that report, it is stated that:</P>
    <P>the Commission considered that a departure from the mathematical average of 8% or over would be unacceptable and, in all probability, contrary to the provisions of the Constitution relating to equality of representation.</P>
    <P>While interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution is ultimately a matter for the Supreme Court, it would seem prudent to give due weight to this opinion <Col N="2655" /> expressed by a commission which was chaired by the President of the High Court and to act on the basis that the benchmark in relation to equality of representation should now be taken to be 8 per cent above or below the national population-Deputy ratio.</P>
    <P>A second important question which was not dealt with by the courts in the 1961 cases was whether the Oireachtas is obliged to effect a fresh revision of constituencies once a completed census discloses substantial changes in distribution of the population although less than 12 years may have elapsed since the last revision.  This matter was, however, refered to in the 1989 case of <i>O'Malley and Hayes versus the Taoiseach and the Attorney General.</i>  In an <i>obiter dictum</i> on that occasion, the President of the High Court indicated that:</P>
    <P>... the constitutional obligation placed on the Oireachtas is not discharged by revising the constituencies once in every twelve years.</P>
    <P>Thus, the effective ground rules in relation to the revision of constituencies must now be taken to be that a revision must take place whenever a completed census shows substantial change in distribution of the population and that, in any revision, the departure from mathematical parity of representation in the case of any constituency must not exceed 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The present Bill proposes to implement the scheme of constituencies recommended by the commission established for this purpose in May last.  The terms of reference given to the commission were, in essence, the same as those given to the first Dáil constituency commission which reported in 1980 and identical with these given to the commission which reported in 1983.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Government, appreciation of the work done by the commission and to formally thank the members of the commission, Mr. Justice <Col N="2656" /> Hamilton, Dr. Whitaker, Mr. Troy, Mr. Rayel and Mr. Coughlan.</P>

      <P>The commission discharged the task assigned to them with exemplary thoroughness, impartiality and expedition.  A debt of gratitude is owed to them by the Oireachtas for carrying out this job, a job for which they received no recompense whatsoever.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to comment at any length in relation to the provisions of the Bill.  The constituencies proposed in the Schedule are precisely those recommended by the commission. The report of the commission was published in full in September last and a copy was provided to each Member of the Oireachtas together with a set of maps. An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill and a set of maps illustrating the proposed constituencies has been deposited in the Oireachtas Library.  I have also arranged to have a set of maps to a smaller scale circulated to each Member.</P>
      <P>It seems sufficient to say that the Bill provides that the membership of the Dáil will remain at the present figure of 166 and that the number of constituencies will also remain at the present figure of 41.  The boundaries of 16 of these constituencies will remain entirely unchanged.  In, perhaps, a dozen other instances the boundary changes proposed could be described as insignificant.  In the Dublin area, while there are boundary changes and some changes in seat allocation, the overall pattern of constituencies will remain very much as it is. In fact, the only area where the proposed changes could be described as substantial is the Longford-Roscommon and Westmeath area where two new constituencies are proposed.  It will be noted that in the proposed scheme of constituencies the departures from strict equality of representation ranges from 7.6 per cent above to 7 per cent below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will come into effect on the dissolution of the Dáil which next occurs after the enactment of <Col N="2657" /> the Bill.  The existing constituencies will continue in being until the next dissolution and would, for example, be used for the purposes of any by-election.  The Bill fixes the total numbers of Dáil Members at 166, which is the same as at present, and which has in fact remained unchanged since 1980.  In accordance with the relevant constitutional provision total membership could, on the basis of the 1986 census, be set at any number between 119 and 177.</P>
    <P>The body of the Bill contains the normal mechanical sections found in a constituency revision Bill.  It contains, for example, provisions for inserting the name of the new constituencies in the Register of Electors and for dealing with any polling districts which may be split by a new constituency boundary.  It provides for the repeal as from the next dissolution of the Dáil of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1983, which sets out the existing constituencies.</P>
    <P>The Bill will implement in full the recommendations made by the constituency commission who reported in July 1990.  The constituencies set out in the Schedule to the Bill are identical to those set out in the first Appendix to the commission's report.  The scheme provides for 12 three member constituencies, 15 four member costituencies and 14 five member constituencies.  The new constituencies will involve breaching four county boundaries, those of counties Clare, Kildare, Galway and Waterford. Sixteen of the constituencies are identical in area with an existing constituency. There are two entirely new constituencies, Longford-Roscommon and Westmeath.  The remaining constituencies are subject to boundary changes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to one degree or another and in some cases to changes in seat allocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin area there are boundary changes in every constituency with the single exception of Dublin South-West. <Col N="2658" /> Dublin Central, Dublin South-Central and Dublin West will each lose one seat and Dublin North and Dublin South-West will gain one seat each.  The overall pattern of constituencies in Dublin, however, will remain very much as it is.</P>
    <P>A small area of County Clare, containing part of Limerick city suburbs, will be included in the Limerick East constituency. There will be boundary adjustments between four of the five constituencies in Cork.  A part of County Galway will be added to each of the two Mayo constituencies but the part of the county at present contained in the constituency of Roscommon will be restored. Finally, an additional seat will be added to the Wicklow constituency which will be augmented by the addition of part of County Kildare.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by stating that the obligation to revise the constituencies is placed by the Constitution on the Oireachtas.  The constituency commission had no constitutional or statutory standing.  Their role was to advise on the formation of constituencies within the terms of reference given to them. Decisions in relation to Dáil membership and constituency formation are, subject to the Constitution, entirely matters for the Oireachtas.  The principle of having constituencies drawn up by an independent commission was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977 and has, apparently, been accepted by the other parties.  Inherent in this approach is the implication that the commission's recommendations would be implemented in their entirety.  Thus, the Bill before the House is, in one sense, an ordinary Bill capable of amendment in any respect should the Oireachtas so think fit.  However, to seek to change the scheme of constituencies recommended by the commission would be to depart from the principle I have referred to and introduce a new situation.  I thank the Deputies for their attention and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The bringing of this Bill before the Dáil has been unnecessarily delayed by the bizarre attempt by the <Col N="2659" /> Minister for the Environment to gerrymander the Dáil constituencies by arbitrarily conferring on the Dáil constituency commission terms of reference in the summer of 1988 which prevented the commission from conducting a politically objective review of constituency boundaries.  Those infamous terms of reference, cooked-up by a Minister who believed he was being politically cute, sought to diminish the effects of proportional representation and eliminate from all urban areas five seat constituencies. It was perceived by Fianna Fáil, and the Minister for the Environment in particular, that the elimination of five seat constituencies in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick would be to the electoral advantage of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to announcing the terms of reference of the 1988 commission the Minister denied he was trying to constrain the commission in their work, yet in the autumn of 1988 when the commission reported they proposed the elimination of all the five seat constituencies in the areas already referred to by me and proposed the retention of only five: Carlow-Kilkenny, Cavan-Monaghan, Laois-Offaly, Meath and Wexford.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party at that time made it clear that they would not support the implementation of the commission's 1988 report and would not be a party to Fianna Fáil's attempt to gerrymander the Dáil constituencies whilst that party hid under the coat-tails of a Dáil constituency commission circumscribed in their work by the politically partisan terms of reference given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as a result of the scandalous behaviour of the Minister for the Environment in 1988 that this House has not until now been in a position to meet its constitutional obligations to revise constituencies in accordance with changes in population.  The Minister was remarkably silent on this aspect of the matter in his speech this evening.  This is the first occasion on which we have had an opportunity to address in detail, and to debate <Col N="2660" /> in this Chamber, the unacceptable behaviour at that time of the then and present Minister for the Environment &mdash; a Minister who on 28 July 1988, at a time when the Dáil was in recess, in the days immediately preceding the August bank holiday, took action based on a perceived political advantage for the Fianna Fáil Party and contemptuously ignored his ministerial constitutional duties.  The Minister's action at that time was subsequently condemned by all parties on all sides of the House, including the Progressive Democrats with whom he now shares Government.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for the Environment had properly complied with his obligations on that occasion and conferred proper terms of reference on the Dáil constituency commission that accorded with the terms of reference given to them by his predecessors &mdash; in his speech tonight he referred to the terms of reference given in 1980 and 1983 but remained strangely silent about the terms of reference he gave in 1988 &mdash; the Bill we are considering today would have come before the House over two years ago. The Bill we are considering tonight should have come before the House two years ago.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had not attempted to engage in a typically Fianna Fáil piece of cute political management, the general election that took place in June of 1989 would have been based on Dáil constituencies that accorded with the changes in population as detailed in the 1986 census and which would have differed, some substantially, from the constituency arrangements under which that election was held.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Minister stands judged guilty before this House of deliberately engaging in activities which caused the election of 1989 to take place under a constitutional cloud that should never have arisen.  It is the hope of the Fine Gael Party that no future Minister for the Environment will again behave in the despicable manner in which this Minister behaved in the summer of 1988.  It is the hope of the Fine Gael Party that we will not see a repetition of such events.  It will <Col N="2661" /> be a lasting political monument to the unacceptable political standards displayed by this Minister, that the Dáil constituency commission report of 1988 will go down in our history books as the only such report produced by a constituency commission recommending changes in electoral boundaries which was not implemented by statutory enactment.</P>
    <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill before the House this evening is not based on the 1988 report but on the report of the Dáil constituency commission of 1990.  The terms of reference given to that commission corresponded with the terms of reference given on the previous occasions up until the infamous terms of reference of 1988.  The terms of reference required the commission in making their report to take into account the following: (a) the membership of Dáil Éireann to be not less than 164 and not more than 168; (b) geographical considerations, in that the breaching of county boundaries should be avoided, if possible, and that larger-seat constituencies should preferably be situated in areas of greater population density; (c) other well established characteristics in the formation of constituencies such as clearly-defined natural features; (d) the retention of the traditional pattern of three seat, four seat and five seat constituencies; and (e) the desirability of effecting the minimum changes.</P>
    <P>The commission, as the Minister stated consisted of the Honourable Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, President of the High Court, who was their chairman, Mr. Thomas Troy, Secretary to the Department of the Environment and Mr. Eamon Rayel, Clerk of the Dáil, all of whom were members of the commission which sat in 1988.  To them were added Dr. T.K. Whitaker, former Governor of the Central Bank and Mr. Kieran Coughlan then Clerk of the Seanad, since appointed Clerk of the Dáil.  I want to put on the record of this House the thanks of the Fine Gael Party to the members of the commission whose integrity and independence in the task undertaken by them cannot be questioned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2662" /> The Bill before us reflects the recommendations made by the commission in their report of 1990.  The changes proposed by them, taking into account population changes, are substantially less dramatic than those proposed in the original report of 1988.  The commission recommend the retention, with some adjustments, of the five seat constituencies in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick that would have been abolished under the recommendations of the commission of 1988 who were given peculiar terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Fifteen of the proposed constituencies recommended by the commission are identical in name, areas and representation with existing constituencies. One constituency is identical in name and area with an existing constituency but has an additional seat, that is, Dublin South West which has the fastest growing population not only in the entire country but within Western Europe.  That constituency in particular substantially lost out in representation in Dáil Éireann in the last election due to the fact that a Bill such as this did not come before the Dáil prior to that election.  On the basis of the constitutional criteria, and the court judgments referred to by the Minister, the constituency of Dublin South West should today have five Deputies representing it in this House.  With all the difficulties that constituency has, the need for employment there, housing problems and the need for additional recreational facilities, it should have had those five Deputies to press its case on this Government.</P>
    <P>The Commission in their report note that the terms of reference are &ldquo;expressed generally&rdquo; and &ldquo;may be capable of more than one interpretation&rdquo;. The manner in which to apply the terms of reference with regard to changes in population is, of course, a matter for the judgment of the commission and it is, quite properly, the commission's recommendations which are being implemented in this Bill.  However, the Fine Gael Party have serious reservations <Col N="2663" /> about the approach taken by the commission in applying their terms of reference with regard to some of the recommendations made by them which now form part and parcel of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>It seems to us that some of the recommendations made by the commission are so substantially at variance with the terms of reference conferred on them as to be open to question.  A classical illustration of this is in relation to the new proposed constituency of Longford-Roscommon. This proposed constituency defies rational explanation in the context of the terms of reference conferred on the commission.</P>
    <P>I have already noted that the commission are required under their terms of reference to take into account &ldquo;geographical considerations and clearly defined natural features&rdquo;.  They are also required to avoid, where possible, the breaching of county boundaries.  In this context the Longford-Westmeath constituency is an extremely strange form of political hybrid in that it does not simply breach county boundaries but breaches provincial boundaries, in that Longford forms part of Leinster while Roscommon is in Connaught.  Even more extraordinary in the context of the geographical criteria that the commission must apply, the constituency is split by the river Shannon, the largest natural waterway to be found in the entire country.  The only conclusion one can reach is that this particular proposal contained in the Bill, arising out of the commission's recommendations, derives from the perception on the part of the commission that Mayo should continue to retain two three-seat constituencies, regardless of the ripple impact on the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the 1986 census, the retention of two three-seat constituencies in Mayo &mdash; Mayo East and Mayo West &mdash; is no longer justifiable.  Relying on the relevant criteria, it is the view of the Fine Gael Party that the county of Mayo should have become a single five-seat constituency and that only a small change was required to bring the county of Mayo <Col N="2664" /> within the population tolerance levels for it to be a five seater.  Instead of taking such an approach, however, the commission took the extraordinary step of recommending that the constituencies of Mayo East and Mayo West be kept in being as two separate three-seat constituencies. In order to preserve these constituencies within a constitutionally permissible population tolerance level, it transferred from the existing constituency of Galway East a population of 4,443 from the Milltown area into Mayo East and a population of 3,868 from the Headford area of Galway West into Mayo West.  In making this proposal the commission not only breached county boundaries but failed to comply with the terms of reference which require them to take into account &ldquo;the desirability of effecting minimum changes&rdquo;.  In the political context, the Milltown and Headford areas of Galway are now losing their county identity and being subsumed within County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael also have reservations about the extent of the changes within Dublin proposed by the constituency commission. Some of the recommendations made in the context of the commission's own term of reference with regard to constituencies, such as Dublin West, Dublin South-East and Dublin Central, are open to serious question.  It is also curious that at a time when the population of Dublin has increased, as documented in the census report of 1986, the overall effect of the commission's recommendations is to reduce the Dáil representation for the entire city and county area of Dublin, including Dún Laoghaire, from 48 to 47 seats.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, one possible explanation for the approach taken by the commission to the Longford, Roscommon, Westmeath, Mayo and Galway areas.  That explanation may be found in the commission's report of 1988 which first contains the recommendation that two three-seat constituencies in Mayo be preserved and that the new constiteuncy of Longford-Roscommon be established.  While the Fine Gael Party have no doubts as to the integrity and <Col N="2665" /> independence of all the members of the commission, we are concerned that these recommendations, which originate in the 1988 report, may have influenced the deliberations of the commission members subconsciously, resulting in their reappearing in the 1990 report.  We are further disturbed by a suggestion which has been made that the commission in their 1990 report were not unanimous in their recommendations. We believe some of the recommendations are based on a division of views on the part of members of the commission and we regret, if this is truly the case, that the report did not disclose a minority dissent from some of the recommendations made and the reasons for that dissent.  If the commission divided in their deliberations and recommendations by 3:2 or 4:1, this House should be informed.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party believe that it is crucial that in a review of constituency boundaries upon population changes occurring, that a commission independent of politicians be asked to carry out the necessary revision on the basis of terms of reference that have general agreement from all the major parties represented in the Oireachtas and that such terms of reference be above suspicion. We wish to ensure that at no future date the scandalous events of 1988 are repeated.</P>
    <P>We call on the Government, following the passage of this Bill, to agree to the introduction, if necessary, of legislation which will require in future the Minister for the Environment of the day, following the completion of a census and prior to the appointment of a constituency boundary commission, to bring before Dáil Éireann the proposed terms of reference to be given to such commission, with a requirement that such terms of reference, must, first be supported by a vote of 75 per cent of the Members of Dáil Éireann, prior to the commission being appointed and prior to terms of reference being conferred on them.  It is possible that such an approach could be put into operation for the future without the necessity of legislation but simply by orders of this <Col N="2666" /> House.  If that is the case, Fine Gael will be asking that the matter be examined by the committee which deals with the rules of the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill affords the Fine Gael Party the first occasion by way of parliamentary vote to register our protest against the manner in which the Minister for the Environment had dealt with this issue over the past two and a half years.  We believe that a Minister for the Environment with similar responsibilities in other member states of the European Community would, if he had behaved in the manner the Minister behaved in 1988, have faced no choice but resignation.  It is indicative of the standards of political behaviour on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party that the issue did not even arise for discussion, despite that party's inability to implement the report of the 1988 commission and despite that party themselves finally having to acknowledge that matters should not have been approached in the manner the Minister approached them.</P>
    <P>In addition to registering our protest at the behaviour of the Minister during 1988, we are also concerned that the history of the events which took place in 1988 has resulted in the commission not fully complying with the terms of reference given to them in the recommendations they made.  By way of protest, Fine Gael will be voting against the Second Reading of this Bill.  We do not, however, believe that members of this House should seek to involve themselves on a party political basis in the redrawing of constituency boundaries. Therefore, if this Bill passes at Second Stage, we shall not be tabling amendments to it in any way to vary the constituency revisions and changes provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The instinct to survive is the strongest instinct of all and the attendance at a Second Stage debate on a Thursday evening would indicate that it is just as strong in politicians.  My constituency colleague, Deputy McCreevy, says that elections wonderfully concentrate the minds of politicians and I <Col N="2667" /> would suggest that constituency revisions also have that effect, more so in some places than in others.  Probably Longford-Roscommon is the area of most concentration at the moment.</P>
      <P>Given the recent history of revisions Fianna Fáil are not to be trusted in the matter of constituency revisions.  The last report, on account of its restricted terms of reference, was consigned to limbo, not because of any danger of the Tallaght strategy breaking down &mdash; the agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael supporting one another in the House &mdash; but because there was a danger that Fianna Fáil backbenchers would not vote for the Bill, would absent themselves.  Indeed, it should be remembered that we were dealing with a minority Government at that time.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to say that all politicians of whatever persuasion or hue, if allowed to draw up constituency boundaries, will do so to their advantage, whether they be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or others.  That is simply the nature of the beast.  That is why this House collectively decided there should be an independent commission to undertake this type of work for it, that the type of previous self-regulation was not acceptable or workable. Therefore, I put all politicians, no matter of what persuasion, in the same boat, as being incapable of being trusted when drawing up constituency boundaries. It is only fair to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An independent commission was established in May 1990, with enhanced numbers over the previous one and with more acceptable terms of reference than the previous one.  The purpose of this Bill is to put the recommendations of the report of that commission into practice. Of course, there will be criticism by those affected by the local geography of that report; that is to be expected.  There is other criticism that I do not entirely accept.  There are those in this House who believe that everything must start in Dublin, that Dublin is the centre of the universe and that we must work out from there.  I do not believe that Dublin is the centre of the universe.  As a Mayo man I <Col N="2668" /> would say that Mayo is as good a place for the commission to begin their work as anywhere else.  I would contend it is just as important as any other part of the country.  Indeed, I would give equal importance to Kildare which I now represent.</P>
    <P>Had the commission's work begun in Mayo the proper decision for them to have taken concerning Mayo would have been that it was suitable for two three-seater constituencies.  Since the county has a low density population and encompasses a huge geographical area, it would not be possible for any five people to endeavour to effectively represent that huge geographical area.  Here I might criticise the Minister for the Environment in one respect, that he has not provided the infrastructures in Mayo that would render it possible for five Deputies to traverse that county from one end to the other.  I can assure the Minister I am not seeking election in Mayo.</P>
    <P>I also reject the innuendo, a serious and dangerous one in the last speech, that the Minister for the Environment in some way put pressure on this independent commission.  I reject that as a slur on the commission and its members.</P>

    <P>Nearer home, in Kildare, a small change was required by the Constitution: 15 per cent of the fine people who have been transferred, temporarily I am sure, to Wicklow, voted for me in the last election and 85 per cent voted against me.  I am sure that, in the capable hands of my colleague and comrade, Deputy Liam Kavanagh from Wicklow, they will continue to be well served up to and after the next general election.  I would like to pose one relatively minor question to the Minister: is it possible to effect some changes in the Bill to deal with the problem I am about to enunciate?  Outside <Col N="2669" /> polling booths on election days there is a farce and a circus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a distinction that is not often drawn.  It is not a contest between parties; it is a contest within parties, of party workers seeking advantage for their particular favourite within the party.  That is what creates the problem. I ask the Minister to examine that internal party strife.  Mind you, it is a symptom of multi-seat constituencies, about which I want to talk later.  Perhaps he would ascertain whether he can ban or, at least limit, that circus that takes place outside polling stations, where people have to run the gauntlet of hordes of party workers in order to gain entry to vote.  That is a continuing scandal that should be dealt with if at all possible within the terms of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been argued regularly that large is beautiful for small parties.  I am not too sure of the authenticity of that argument. We have many large constituencies, five-seaters, where small parties are not represented. In large constituencies small parties need large resources to mount a campaign.  Large constituencies give rise to intense competition for votes from candidates of similar or identical politics. Competition within parties and between parties arises on this basis.  This is not useful competition, is not healthy but rather is wasteful.  The dreadful thing is that all of us must participate in this charade or perish and be banished from this House.  Whether we be frontbenchers, backbenchers or Ministers all of us have to take part in what is effectively a charade. This mind-numbing, soul destroying, enforced, useless activity reduces, and sometimes excludes Members of this House from their real and principal purpose, which is to come here to legislate, to study, research and make informed decisions and arguments.  Instead of that most of us are reduced to lobby fodder, to vote on legislation we regularly do not have time even to read but barely examine.  That does not arise because of any lack of interest on the part of <Col N="2670" /> Members of this House, or through any lack of ability; it arises because of the pressure emanating from multi-seat constituencies and the lack of time available to us as a result.  All of this arises as a direct result of multiple-seat constituencies. Practically every Deputy must be involved to survive.</P>
    <P>Must we continue to be judged by the number of letters we write rather than by the politics, principles and policies emanating therefrom or must we continue to fulfil the role of untrained social workers?  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; until such time as the nettle is grasped about the difficulty that arises for Deputies in such multi-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine &mdash; I am not certain if it can be done within the terms of this Bill &mdash; how that problem can be tackled.  It has been, and can be, argued that the advice or clinic system instructs Deputies in the realities of the world.  That is true to a point but I could not think of a more time-consuming, less efficient way of being instructed.  In so saying I am not arguing for isolation, ivory towerism for Members or for insulation from the public.  I am arguing for structures which would allow us do our job more efficiently and effectively.  I am firmly of the belief that it is not possible to do so as long as there remain multi-seat constituencies.  As long as they obtain it will not be possible to render the system effective and responsive.  The time is now right for a frank, open debate on this issue, not necessarily on the floor of this House but probably, first, within all the political parties involved in this House and, in that, I include my party.</P>
    <P>We have to look again at the merits of the single seat constituency with the single transferable vote pertaining to PR if we are to continue to be taken seriously.  Such a system I believe was last proposed in this House by a predecessor of mine from Kildare.  I believe it would give rise to real politics.  People would then be judged on the basis of support for their policies rather than a basis of support for the number of letters they wrote.  All of us who have to be involved in the letter writing business can predict <Col N="2671" /> with absolute certainty the type of replies we will get from the various Departments to the overwhelming majority of the representations we make to them.  In fact, one could write them oneself before looking for the answer.  Still this charade goes on.</P>
    <P>The single seat constituency system will give rise to a manageable geographical area where people would relate directly and immediately to their representatives.  Real politics would arise and give rise to fair and real representation, and the parties of the Left who have been marginalised by our present system of multi-seat constituencies and clienteleism have all to gain from this and often they seem to be the most in fear of change in that regard. The present system has allowed the Right to dominate Irish politics for the past 70 years.  Everybody seems to want to be in the centre now but I regard as being on the right those who consider themselves to be in the centre.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must at least start the debate.  Until we do so together we are condemned to a vicious cycle of repetitive and useless activity that changes nothing, we are reduced to the role of untrained social workers.  Such a change would enhance our democracy and would return this House and its Members to real democracy and real politics.</P>
    <P>We are supporting the Bill before us. I ask the Minister to look at the points I have made.  I regret that when the nettle was presented &mdash; I am sure it is constantly there for any Minister &mdash; the Minister did not grasp it more firmly in regard to real reform of the constituency system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill before us is to give effect to the report of the Dáil Constituency Commission.  We all know that arising from the 1986 census there is a need to revise some constituency boundaries.  Indeed, the failure to do so before now has given rise to some doubt about the constitutionality of the 1989 general election.  The report presented by the Dáil Constituency Commission is the second attempt to revise <Col N="2672" /> constituency boundaries.  The report of the first commission was widely and correctly rejected by most of the political parties in this House largely because the terms of reference given to that commission were prejudicial, would have greatly reduced the number of five seat constituencies and, to judge by the report itself, were somewhat resented by the commission.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference given to the second commission were somewhat fairer.  There are, no doubt, a number of curiosities in the report and I will return to these later.  The issue facing the House is whether we adopt the recommendations of the independent commission even though there may be some unhappiness about them, or whether the Dáil itself wishes to become involved in the delineating of the constituencies from which the Members are elected.  The Workers' Party believe that the principle of independence and impartiality must be maintained and that, therefore, it would not be correct for the Dáil to reject the report or the Bill based on it.  Therefore, we will not oppose this Bill.</P>
      <P>Before I deal in greater detail with the Bill itself and with the report I would like to express The Workers' Party's disappointment that this opportunity was not used to bring more comprehensive electoral legislation before the House. There is no good reason this amendment to the Electoral Acts should have been confined to the delineation of constituency boundaries especially as there are so many aspects of our electoral laws which need to be modernised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most obvious omission in this Bill is the failure to revise the constituencies for elections to the European Parliament. In reply to a Dáil question on 31 May last the Minister stated, as in the Official Report, column 1126: &ldquo;Section 12 of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977 requires the Minister to present to the Oireachtas proposals for the revision of the European constituencies within the period of 12 years from the enactment of that statute and at least once every 12 years thereafter.&rdquo;  Although the Minister indicated that he intended to await the <Col N="2673" /> outcome of the 1991 census before presenting these proposals, he stated: &ldquo;The proposal will be contained in an electoral Bill which I hope to introduce shortly.&rdquo; This, presumably, is the Electoral Bill and it is not in it.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, a revision of the European constituencies is now overdue.  This is particularly evident in the case of the Dublin constituency which, while well represented by the quality of its MEPs, is under-represented numerically.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to tell us when the European constituencies will be revised.</P>
    <P>A second issue which has been raised in this House and about which the Minister promised reform in an electoral Bill concerns the unsatisfactory and degrading voting system which applies to disabled persons.  As he knows, a disabled person is required to be certified as being sane before being eligible to participate in the special voting arrangements.  No other citizens are required to fulfil that requirement. It is an insulting and discriminatory requirement and it should be abolished.</P>
    <P>In his reply to Dáil questions from me earlier this year I understood the Minister was sympathetic to this reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be another Electoral Bill dealing with all those items.  I have full sympathy with the Deputy in that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. Perhaps the Minister will indicate when replying when that Bill might be presented.  I had also asked the Minister to consider favourably a submission from the Disabled Drivers Association that the same type of postal voting system should apply for disabled persons in Dáil, local and European elections as applies for university graduates in Seanad elections. The Minister was not quite so sympathetic to this idea, but I had hoped he might have reconsidered it.  He claimed there was a danger of abuse.  What leads the Minister to think university graduates are by definition more honest than disabled persons?  Why must a disabled person be supervised while voting while a university graduate can return a ballot paper provided the voting has been witnessed? Disabled people feel strongly that their civil rights are restricted by the kind of limited special arrangements provided for them.</P>
      <P>The third area which should have been addressed in electoral legislation concerns voter abstention.  In most elections in this State 30 per cent or more of those on the electoral register do not vote at all.  It would be wrong to attribute this high level of abstention entirely to voter apathy, disenchantment with politics or some conscientious objection to voting. The political right to vote has been a hard won victory for democracy both here and abroad.  Such people as the Chartists and the suffragettes as well as those of us who campaigned for votes at 18 would not have wished that such a large proportion of the electorate should be either prevented from voting or unwilling to exercise the vote.  We in this House must address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me now suggest a number of remedies which could be incorporated in an electoral legislation.  First, the method of compiling and maintaining the electoral registers must be modernised.  As recently as 1986 an ESRI survey showed there were 157,000 redundant names on electoral registers and the situation was particularly bad in Dublin.  While there has been some improvement with the computerisation of the registers we are <Col N="2675" /> all aware of serious inaccuracies arising, of people turning up to polling stations to find they are not registered and therefore not entitled to vote.  It seems that the annual revision of the register is done at the wrong time.  People will not normally over the Christmas period go to their post office to check the register before 15 January.  Let me suggest that the revision of the register should coincide with the change in the tax year in early April which is a time when people are accustomed to making documentary returns.</P>
    <P>Let me also raise with the Minister the recent Supreme Court decision in relation to double registration on the Register of Electors.  This was the decision arising in the case of a number of students who sought to be registered in their normal place of residence and in their place of study.  I ask the Minister to address this issue when he is replying in the context of any possible distortion of the size of constituencies or of the level of representation in constituencies arising from that decision.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Stagg that the intensive, unnecessary and unproductive canvassing which takes place outside polling stations on polling day is intimidating voters.  We all know that the ritual handing out of literature outside polling stations on the day of an election is a waste of time, yet no party will unilaterally discontinue it.  It should simply be prohibited.  It is a frightening experience for most voters to run the gauntlet of election workers from five or six different political parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt you.  I do so merely to remind you that on Second Stage it is given to any Member to refer to what is proposed. This legislation deals specifically with the revision of constituencies.  Obviously a reference could be made to regret that it does not provide for other matter, but the other matter that could be provided would be only that that would be appropriate to the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the Bill, which is to revise constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2676" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me mention the final regret I have in relation to the Bill before us, that is, that the opportunity was not taken to introduce Sunday voting.  The times for polling, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on a working weekday actually restricts the time available for voting for most people at work and for most people with domestic responsibilities.  Most day workers will have gone to work before polling stations open at 9 a.m. and may not be home, have eaten or changed until nearly 7 p.m. so that in reality the time available for voting is no more than two hours.  In my view this is contributing to the low polls especially in many urban areas.</P>
      <P>The somewhat controversial process which led to this Bill should give rise to some more fundamental changes in the forming of constituencies than is provided here.  Repeatedly the Irish people have shown their determination to defend the principles of fairness and proportionality in the electoral system. Attempts to drop PR or multi-seat constituencies have repeatedly been rejected.  The &ldquo;Tullymandering&rdquo; of constituencies has backfired on those who attempted it and the last Government's attempt to reduce the number of five-seat constituencies produced a public and political outcry which led to the demise of the report of the first commission.</P>
      <P>Let me say here in relation to what Deputy Stagg said that, quite apart from the possible consequences for smaller political parties of abandoning the multi-seat constituency system, there is a great danger that in a single seat constituency system large sections of the electorate are permanently disenfranchised.  If Deputy Stagg would like to consult the average Labour voter in many of the constituencies in the south of England, he will learn they are in a state of permanent disenfranchisement because given the way in which constituencies are established there they never manage to elect somebody of their own political persuasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly what is needed is a statutorily established independent system for revising constituencies.  The revision of constituencies should not be in the hands of politicians whose own political careers may be directly affected by any changes made.  It is wrong, therefore, that the decision to establish a commission in the first place should be reserved for Government whose political composition will have a vested interest in whether there should be a commission, who the members will be, what their terms of reference will be, and then whether the recommendations would be brought before the Dáil.  By extension, the Dáil itself, whose Members have a vested interest in the matter, should not be the forum where the specific delineation of constituency boundaries should be decided.  What is needed is an electoral Bill which will establish on a statutory basis a commission whose composition and terms of reference will be defined in law and which, subject to an appeals system, will decide on constituency boundaries.  This is the best way of ensuring a fair and, as far as is possible, impartial method of deciding this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, therefore, The Workers' Party, although we have reservations about some of the recommendations contained in the report, will not be opposing this Bill.  There is a principle involved here that, having had a report from an independent commission, the Dáil then should not seek to reject that report or to alter the specific recommendations contained in it.  We have, however, a number of reservations about the report and, as a consequence, a number of reservations about the Bill. Our principal reservations about this Bill and about the report centre on the report's apparent failure to comply with three of their terms of reference &mdash; to avoid breaching county boundaries, to respect clearly defined natural features and to preferably situate larger seat constituencies in areas of greater population density.  The curiosities which have arisen as a result of these departures centre mainly on the following constituencies: the Galway-Mayo county boundary is <Col N="2678" /> breached mainly in the cases of both Galway West and Galway East in order to preserve two three-seat constituencies in Mayo; Mayo East will now stretch into the town of Tuam while in Mayo West the red and green of Mayo will now fly over the Galway West towns of Cong and Headford.  Perhaps, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it is the Galwayman in me that makes me differ from the position taken by my colleague, Deputy Stagg, in relation to that matter because it seems to me that the need&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The natural boundary of the Liffey is breached.  Integrated communities like Ballyfermot, Blanchardstown and Mulhuddart are split in two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, it is remarkable that, although <Col N="2679" /> the larger seat constituencies are supposed to be in the areas of highest population, there is not a single five-seat constituency north of the Liffey.  Without doubt the curiosities in the report result from a determination to keep two three-seat constituencies in Mayo when all demographic logic suggested that Mayo county should become a single five-seat constituency.</P>

      <P>We are asked to believe that the outcome which has arisen in the report is purely coincidental to the fact that the Minister who is responsible is himself from Mayo.  I do not subscribe to the view that the commission set out to favour the Minister.  I have far too much respect for the integrity and independence of the members of the commission to reach that conclusion; but I cannot help thinking that the commission was serviced by the Minister's own Department and that the draft maps and options which would have been laid before the commission would have been prepared in his Department; and in view <Col N="2680" /> of the outcome, I cannot escape the conclusion that the Minister's hand is to be seen in protecting Mayo and his own party's political advantage in this area. The Minister will no doubt claim that this is unfair to him and to his Department, but he has a way of clearing up the matter.  He can make available to this House the Department's papers, suggestions, recommendations and options which were put before the commission, and we can then make up our own minds on whether he has used his position to influence a commission in the carrying out of its work.</P>
      <P>The doubts which have arisen in what is otherwise a generally acceptable report in relation to Mayo need to be clarified by the Minister publicly in view of the concern that he may have been involved in some way in the commission arriving at that conclusion.</P>
      <P>I would like to subscribe to the words of thanks that have been expressed and express the thanks of The Workers' Party to the commission.  I would like to state on record our respect for their integrity and independence and, notwithstanding our surprise at some of the recommendations, to state that we will be accepting the report and the Bill which has been put before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I do not agree with all the recommendations of the commission. The establishment of the constituency revision commission last May was widely welcomed, given the changes in population per TD which have emerged over the years.  The commission <Col N="2681" /> established under the Joint Programme for Government indicated that under their terms of reference some fundamental changes would emerge. However, change means different things to different people and for me, as a Deputy from the Dublin Central constituency, the changes recommended by the commission are both fundamental and far-reaching.  My future as a TD may be in jeopardy and the options available, while many, are not exactly attractive.</P>
      <P>If I was paranoid &mdash; naturally I am not &mdash; I could easily interpret the report of the commission as being purely and simply an anti-Dublin document.  Listening to some Deputies one would wonder if there was anyone representing the Dublin area.  Overall Dublin will lose one seat in this whole process.</P>
      <P>I would like to illustrate the effect of the report on my constitutncy of Dublin Central and outline my unease at supporting it but let us first look at the terms of reference of the commission.  The fundamental objective of the commission was to advise and report on the formation of constituencies for election of members to Dáil Éireann.  In compiling their report the commission were urged to take account of the following: (a) the membership of Dáil Éireann to be not less than 164 and not more than 168; (b) geographical considerations, in that the breaching of county boundaries should be avoided if possible and larger seat constituencies should preferably be situated in areas of greater population density; (c) well established characteristics in the formation of constituencies such as clearly-defined natural features; (d) the retention of the traditional pattern of three seat four seat and five seat constituencies and (e) the desirability of effecting the minimum change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The above terms of reference are clear, concise and, to the layman, reasonably straightforward.  However, I contend that not only were these terms of reference ignored when considering Dublin Central but it seems the commission decided that that constituency would be as the exception to prove the rule.  In my time I have read many great works of fiction but this <Col N="2682" /> production by Mr. Justice Hamilton, Dr. Whitaker, Mr. Troy, Mr. Rayel and Mr. Coughlan must rank among the greatest, almost akin to the Fine Gael documents of the past few days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the way the report was compiled.  While Dublin Central is the Dublin constituency most affected, I must take this opportunity to express sympathy with my friends and colleagues in Counties Clare, Kildare and Galway who now find themselves reclassified as Limerick men and women, Wicklow men and women and Mayo men and women respectively.  Of course, this is not really an adverse reflection on the latter counties, they are probably put forward as a prospect of new constituencies.  I understand the arguments of the Deputies who represent the Mayo constituencies.  I agree there is a great distance from one end of the county to the other.  It is the system that I object to.  If we take the position of Longford and Roscommon, the Deputies there find themselves in neither Leinster or Connacht.  Nobody really knows which province they are in.  The only advantage to these two counties is that they will <Col N="2683" /> have two shots at the Sam Maguire Cup, they could either play in the Connacht championship or the Leinster championship.</P>
      <P>Naturally, I am concerned about the plight of the Deputies in those constituencies and their treatment at the hands of the commission, who I am not criticising, but these areas fared a lot better than Dublin Central.  It is generally acknowledged that the carve-up of Dublin Central is totally out of proportion. The saddest thing about this carve-up is that it will tear the heart out of communities and areas with long traditions and histories.  I am privileged to represent many historic, well known areas of Dublin.  I contend there is no area in any other part of the city so steeped in history and folklore than that which I represent.</P>
      <P>Drumcondra, for example, was the site of an original settlement of an ancient Gaelic tribe, the Condraithe.  In times past there was a ridge in the area, from where it derives its name, Drumcondra, or the ridge of Condraithe.</P>

      <P>It is amazing how two seats can disappear.  I was raised in the North Strand the scene of the dreadful bombings of 1940 which resulted in many of the people in the area being rehoused in Cabra, also in the constituency.  North Strand is beside Ballybough &mdash; I am outlining these matters to show how important an area is to a city.  Ballybough, previously known as Mud Island, is famous in its own right.  It was at Ballybough Bridge, now named after a famous man, Luke Kelly, that the ancient city limits terminated.  The bridge at one time boasted a gallows.</P>

      <P>I am giving the history of the area.  There is also a suicide burial plot in the area and it is said that spirits are still in the park beside the Luke Kelly Bridge.</P>
      <P>From Ballybough we head towards the city to Summerhill.  A look at the Irish name for Summerhill reveals its ancient origins.  Crionán was an ancient Celtic god who roamed the area.  Cnoc Crionán is a very old part of Dublin.  Another part of this famous constituency is Marino with its famous Casino built by Lord Charlemont.  No. 13 Marino Crescent was the birth place of Bram Stoker who also had a very colourful history.  In Lord Charlemont's time there was a view of Dublin Bay from a house in Marino.  He had a row with a man called Ffiliot because he decided to build houses at the end of Marino in a crescent shape cutting off the view of the bay.  All these things are very important to people in Dublin Central.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>In Dublin city we do not believe in that kind of thing.  Also in that area they talk about the Battle of Clontarf but it actually took place in Marino, Ballybough, Drumcondra, Summerhill and probably on the shores of what is now the North Strand.</P>
      <P>On the far side of the constituency we can see the remains of the Viking site settlement known as Oxmantown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people think that Oxmantown got its name from the famous cattle markets in the area, but it comes from the Vikings, Ostman, meaning men from the east.  To this day, many of the streets in the Oxmantown area reflect its original Viking settlements like the Kings Sitric, Olaf and Harold. Stoneybatter is close by and it is steeped in a similar history.  Stoneybatter comes <Col N="2685" /> from the Irish for &ldquo;stoney road&rdquo; which reflects the fact that one of the five great ancient roads, Slí Culann, went through the area.</P>

      <P>I do not think so although there are Mayo men everywhere and people are always very proud to have them.</P>
      <P>Phibsboro is another famous township set up by the Phibbs family over two centuries ago.  East Wall is in the lower part of my constituency and it was once covered in sea and looked out at the mud island of Clontarf.  I could go on but suffice to say it is clear that the areas making up Dublin Central are among the most historical in our city and it is a shame that a commission chose to ignore this background.  I am not criticising the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perfectly entitled to comment on the findings of the commission.  I thought earlier, when he proceeded to name the members, that he intended to criticise them.  Having listened to his useful comments, it is accepted that he has a specific interest in the proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am like a man talking about his future which will not come and those around him always speak well of the dead.  I am not dead yet.</P>
      <P>To take an example of this carve up which is mirrored many times in the area, let us look at the township of Drumcondra. In addition to its Gaelic history, Drumcondra was, as you are no doubt aware, the first township established on the north side of the city.  This occurred all of 111 years ago which seems to have held no sway with the commission who, for some reason, decided to carve up the area into three constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some strange reason, the commission decided to ignore well established geographical, natural or other boundaries.  Drumcondra is a small, <Col N="2686" /> close-knit community and you can imagine the surprise of the residents to find that their village has been split in three, some parts remaining in Dublin Central, the west going to Dublin North-West and across the road being part of Dublin North-Central.  I very much doubt if a town like Arklow, for example, would be treated like this with so many people in the same area voting in three different constituencies.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most incredible breach of the commission's terms of reference is the recommendation that Dublin Central should now include part of the south side. Is there any more natural boundary in Dublin than the River Liffey?  Yet, the commission have ignored the connection. As a northsider, born and bred, I find this potential change of most concern. Naturally I would never advocate or encourage a northside/southside divide, that is not my way.  However, I find it difficult to understand the logic of the commission in taking this action unless, of course, their independence has been infringed and they were got at by southsiders.  I say that with tongue in cheek.</P>

      <P>I just noticed recently in the telephone directory that the Phoenix Park, Aras an Úachtaráin and the Zoo are listed as Dublin 8.  Obviously, somebody is attempting to interfere with the constituencies.</P>
      <P>If I were a cynic &mdash; which I am not &mdash; I would say that the northside is getting a 320 year old hospital, which no longer accepts patients and a 202 year old jail in Kilmainham, which no longer accepts prisoners, in return for sharing the magnificent northside landmarks such as the Customs House, the GPO and the Four Courts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that. Naturally, I fully appreciate the great role which Kilmainham Jail has played in our republican history.  I also commend and appreciate the superb restoration work on the Royal Hospital.  By speaking on the Bill in this way I am trying to indicate the way I see the changes which do not altogether go along with the Minister's suggestions.  In particular, I am talking about my own constituency.</P>
      <P>The commission should have taken it upon themselves to look closely at population shifts in Dublin Central.  The net total is a 4,168 reduction in population, and a one seat reduction in representation. That is perfectly acceptable in that the average population per Member was out of line with the national average.  Within the net reduction individual shifts outwards heve been effected by 50,000 people, which flies in the face of the commission's terms of reference.  To put this into context we should imagine a full house at Lansdowne Road cheering on the boys in green. Imagine taking all the west side out of it and moving them to Dalymount Park and moving those on the terraces in Croke Park to the other end of it.  We are moving people from one area to the other without reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference state the desirability of effecting minimal changes.  If a population of 50,000 is minimal in the <Col N="2688" /> context of a four-seater, minimal has taken on a new meaning for me.  No fewer than three constituencies are affected by these changes &mdash; Dublin Central, Dublin North-Central and Dublin West.  A population of 17,287 has been shifted from Dublin Central to Dublin North-Central. A population of 11,389 from Dublin Central to Dublin North-West and most amazingly in an effort to undo the damage 24,508 people from Dublin West now find themselves in Dublin Central. The people in the west are definitely confused about this.</P>
    <P>We always give a little and take a little. In my constituency we have given more than a little.  I do not wish to take these recommendations personally but it is widely agreed among TDs in the Dublin areas that my constituency has been most affected, and my position will be most affected.  I can consider options.  I could stay in Dublin Central which becomes a four seater.  I was elected fifth place the last time round, so I am sure the commission understood that no matter what, five into four just will not go.  I could go up to Dublin North-Central where I was born and reared, lived and went to school.</P>

      <P>Deputy Stafford, it is not given to the Chair to comment but, on the other hand in the mood prevailing the Chair could say you have convinced the House that there are reasons why you should not be happy with the legislation.

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Stafford it reminds me of the old adage &ldquo;follow that if you can&rdquo;.  It will be very difficult to follow Deputy Stafford's treatise on the history of Dublin Central which was excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank you for giving me this too brief <Col N="2691" /> an opportunity, albeit it was all too brief to express my utter contempt for this Electoral (Amendment) Bill, my utter rejection of the findings of the electoral commission and my anger that they could meander outside their fixed parameters and so ignore their brief and terms of reference.  The major terms of reference were the geographical considerations, that the breaching of county boundaries should be avoided, if possible, and that larger seat constituencies should preferably be situated in areas of greater population density &mdash; here I suggest Mayo to the Minister.  Other well established characteristics such as clearly defined natural features &mdash; a good example of this which Deputy Stafford gave us was the River Liffey which was there for centuries &mdash; were to be considered and the desirability of effecting the minimum change.  If anyone suggests to me that the changes in Dublin Central are minimal I would disagree.  How a High Court judge, a former Governor of the Central Bank, the Clerk of the Dáil, the Clerk of the Seanad, and the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, could so deviate from their guidelines and their terms of reference is grotesque and so unbelievable that one is led to the natural and justified conclusion, taking all the factors into account, that there must have been nefarious and sinister influences involved.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge &mdash; even the dogs in the street know &mdash; that there was disagreement within the commission and that they had to reach a majority decision to publish their findings.  I am afraid there were nefarious and sinister influences. The hand and the influences of that anti-feminist himself, the Minister, who cynically and sarcastically described the future President of this country in a certain way and within two hours of those remarks issued an official apology&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Excuse me Deputy.  There is no future President; There is a President, our esteemed President and it is not given to you or anybody <Col N="2692" /> here to make a comment on our President.

      <P>Far be it from me to endeavour to break the traditions of this House, which I shall not, but I would point out that this Electoral (Amendment) Bill has grave consequences for me, as for Deputy Stafford.  I beg the liberty &mdash; I do not mean to insult anybody &mdash; to express my views as I am entitled within reason.</P>
      <P>Hindsight is the most perfect political science known to man and the evidence in the Minister's case, to say the least of it, is damning.  There is no doubt in my mind, or in the mind of many others, that he used the status and power of his office to influence the findings of this commission. It has been said that when he was asked by one of his Fianna Fáil councillors, at a major sporting event why Mayo was retained as two three-seaters the Minister replied in his typical fashion with his head in the air that, &ldquo;a parent must christen its own child first&rdquo;. They were his exact words.</P>

      <P>In this case we do not need any high tech diagnostic aids to establish the seeds and the parentage of this report. It is the Minister's and it is shaming.  The jackboots of our other erstwhile colleague, the Minister for Justice, are evident throughout this report.  That there are such major dislocations of population and such clearly defined natural boundaries ignored is clearly proof of this.  Would the Minister not agree that the River Liffey is a natural boundary? Has there not been a major dislocating of population in Dublin Central?  In my view there has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of minimal changes and natural features will now have to be changed and redefined in the Oxford Dictionary. Dublin Central, for those of us who do not know it &mdash; and most of us do &mdash; will now extend from the East Wall <Col N="2693" /> on the one hand to almost the County Kildare border on the other, from the north inner city to the green fields of Kildare.</P>
    <P>The Government, in the fullness of time, will rue the day they introduced this Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  The Irish people are much more intelligent and sophisticated voters than we politicians give them credit for, and especially politicians from the Government side of the House.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to revise the Dáil constituencies as a result of the census which was taken up in 1986 and to implement the recommendations made by the Dáil constituency commission.  I take this opportunity to thank those people who sat on the commission and gave of their time for free.  Naturally, no matter how well the constituencies are redrawn there will always be those who will not be satisfied; that is the way the cookie crumbles and we will have to put up with it.  A slight change has been proposed in my own constituency of Kildare where we will be giving 10,000 voters to Wicklow. We have always had that givish nature in <Col N="2694" /> Kildare and it will not be any different this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a temporary arrangement in any event.  With the change in population trends in north Kildare it will not be too long before we will have our two three-seater constituencies in Kildare.  It will be difficult for people who were born and bred in Kildare to move into Wicklow but we will have to put up with it for the time being.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of points I would like to make and which will prove very important in the near future.  The Supreme Court judgment on 27 November last in the Waterford regional technical college case allows for multiple registration.  Up to now a person was allowed to be registered only once, that being his or her residence wherever that was.  The decision of the Supreme Court on 27 November will now allow students and people in a similar category, be they workers or people with holiday homes, or whatever, to register in different areas. As a result we are talking about thousands of people who will be able to register in different areas.  I refer to my own constituency of Kildare where we have Maynooth College.  Students at that college will be allowed register in Maynooth and also to be registered in their own constituencies.  This could have very serious consequences and I urge the Minister to take immediate action to resolve that.  I do not begrudge students their entitlement to vote, in fact, I welcome it very much, but it is something that must be resolved quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies on my left, in their contribution, referred to a few points with which I agree, one of which was Sunday voting.  This is a matter we will all have to face up to and it would be for the good of the country.  It would <Col N="2695" /> reduce costs and produce a higher percentage poll.  Although the polling stations are open for 12 hours it is not always suitable or possible for people who are working to vote.  The Sunday vote will have to be brought in and the sooner this is done the better.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by my colleague, Deputy Emmet Stagg, to the introduction of single seat constituencies.  I do not agree with the Deputy too often but I agree with him on this occasion that multi-seat constituencies lead to gross inefficiency.  Not alone is there competition between members of different parties but there is competition between members of the same party, if one is lucky enough to have a colleague in the same constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be unfair of me not to thank my colleague, Deputy Stafford, for the wonderful history lesson he gave us on his constituency. I think it was Shakespeare who said in one of his plays, &ldquo;your future is behind you.&rdquo;  I hope this is not true in the case of Deputy Stafford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Another measure I should like to see introduced is automated polling. When I was elected last year it took almost 48 hours to count the votes &mdash; I thought they were reluctant to let me in. Maybe they will make amends for it the next time, but I hope not.  The counts at the last few elections have been far too slow.  While people get a certain amount of pleasure out of this and the tallymen are able to predict the election from an early stage I believe it would be in all our interests to have quicker results.  I hope this slow procedure will not continue for much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Stagg referred to the distribution of literature outside polling stations. This is another problem which will have to be tackled.  Many people are put off voting because they are intimidated <Col N="2696" /> by the number of people distributing literature outside the polling stations. One would need a box to carry it all.  This did not happen to the same extent during the Presidential election &mdash; some of the parties were very thin on the ground on that occasion &mdash; but I am sure that when the next general election takes place we will be back to the same old story.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the farcical situation where approximately 10,000 people who worked in the polling booths at the time of the Presidential election were not allowed to vote.  This is another problem which needs to be tackled.  If we are really serious about democracy we should ensure that people are given an opportunity to cast their vote.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As I said it will not be to everybody's liking.  However, the Commission had a job to do and I believe we have a duty to accept the recommendations put forward by them.</P>

      <P>I think a previous speaker referred to the recommendation in regard to counties Longford and Roscommon as bizarre.  As a Deputy from County Longford I can only agree with that description.  I know this recommendation was first made in 1988 and on that occasion the terms of reference of the commission were put forward by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a significant event which has taken place since 1988.  When the local radio licences were being given out it was widely expected that Longford-Westmeath would receive a licence for a local radio.  In fact, some people in those two counties had collected money for a local radio station.  However, the licence was given to the Longford-Roscommon area.</P>

      <P>If one had a devious mind one could see a consistent line running through all of this.  I wonder if all Members of the House are aware of how bizarre this recommendation is.  These two counties are in two different provinces, two different Euro constituencies, two different health board areas and two different tourist board areas.  Reference was made earlier to the River Liffey which to my mind is about 20 yards wide. Parts of Lough Ree are four miles wide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet this lake is in the one constituency.  We are being asked not to criticise the advice given by the commission. I cannot stand up here and attack the members of the commission individually but as an elected Member of this House I have every right to question their advice and voice my surprise at their findings.  As I said, the 1988 terms of reference are still lurking in the background and this can be seen from the recommendations made by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is happy enough with the recommendations in regard to County Mayo.  That, of course, is a coincidence. The truth is that a Leinster county would not have to be put into Connaught if the 1988 terms of reference were forgotten about.  If Dáil seats were <Col N="2698" /> given correctly in terms of population one seat in the west would definitely have to go.  There is no question about that and, as was said earlier, it would have to go in County Mayo.  It is a coincidence that that did not happen.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out earlier, my colleague in County Longford happens to come from County Roscommon.  As Deputy Stafford said it will be confusing to have one county in Leinster and the other county in Connaught.  I can guarantee the Deputy that it will not be confusing to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, who was lucky enough to have been born in County Roscommon, to have spent half his life there and to be an elected representative now for County Longford. He will not be one bit annoyed about this recommendation.  It may be a coincidence that this recommendation suits both the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, but if we were to believe what we read in newspapers and magazines, though one cannot believe everything one reads, they were supposed to have had a row over this recommendation.  I do not know whether that is true, I only read it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Reynolds gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the progress which has been made through the Anglo-Irish Agreement on the question of the reopening of cross-Border roads between County Leitrim and Northern Ireland which have been closed since the mid-seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem has been ongoing since the Border crossings between the counties of Leitrim and Fermanagh were closed during the mid-seventies.  County Leitrim finds itself at a disadvantage in that it is the only Border county which does not have direct access to Northern Ireland.  Leitrim County Council have raised this matter on numerous occasions.  A deputation from the council met the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who indicated that he would have the matter raised at the Anglo-Irish Secretariat. That deputation met the former Minister two years ago and, unfortunately, the position has not changed since then.</P>
      <P>Leitrim County Council requested the present Minister to meet a deputation but due to a full calendar he was unable to meet them.  However, his private secretary did reply to a letter sent by the council in which he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to thank you for your invitation to visit the county but he regrets that due to a heavy schedule of commitments in the period ahead it would not be possible <Col N="2700" /> for him to take up the council's offer at this time.  However, the Minister has asked a senior official of his Department to visit the area in order to discuss with you the question of closed roads and to report back to him.  Contact will be made with you shortly concerning the detailed arrangements.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister indicate if a senior civil servant has visited County Leitrim to view the area, as it is my understanding that no such visit had taken place up to two weeks ago?  If a senior civil servant has visited the area I would ask the Minister of State to report on the situation.</P>
    <P>Two cross-Border crossings between County Leitrim and County Fermanagh should be reopened immediately, the first is Rosinver-Dooard-Garrison and the other is Kiltyclogher to Cashel Bridge. Kiltyclogher is one of the few villages in the Republic which suffered from terrorist activity and attacks.  The local vocational school was bombed in the mid-seventies and since then it has suffered from devastating socio-economic factors. The village is dying a slow and painful economic death as local business people have to depend on the population of a hinterland which has been eroded by emigration and migration.  The community has suffered in silence for long enough. The reopening of a Border crossing, which would leave the village with a much greater hinterland, would be the first step in restoring economic prosperity to the area.</P>
    <P>The Rosinver-Dooard-Garrison crossing is on the shores of Lough Melvin.  A report commissioned by the European Community, the Irish and the British Governments and carried out in 1986 states that the strategy for tourism is central to the future development of the Lough Melvin catchment area.  The closure of Border crossings in County Leitrim has affected its tourism potential in several ways, the most obvious being that people wishing to travel all the way around the lake, and more pointedly, those wishing to travel between Garrison and Rosinver only, a distance of two miles have to take a detour of some 20 <Col N="2701" /> miles.  In addition, the stark appearance of the barriers at Derryhaser and between Garrison and Rosinver is unattractive and a striking visual reminder of the Border security problem.  It is clear that the road closure is an important barrier to economic development in the region.</P>
    <P>Although we are not in a position to evaluate the non-economic issues involved in the re-opening of the road, it is imperative that I stress the damaging economic implications of the road closure. During the past number of years there has been substantial investment by Government agencies in fisheries in the Lough Melvin area by way of improvements to jetties and mooring points.</P>

      <P>First, I thank Deputy Reynolds for raising this matter.  As he is aware, I replied on a somewhat similar matter which was raised in the House last week.  I have listened with great interest to his comments and would like to reassure him that the Government are fully aware of the inconvenience caused by the closures in question to the communities on both sides of the Leitrim-Fermanagh Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to assure the Deputy that the Government have taken every opportunity under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to impress upon the British authorities the social and economic disruption caused to the people of Leitrim <Col N="2702" /> and Fermanagh by these road closures. The Government take the view that all road closures should be kept under careful review and should only be maintained where security considerations clearly outweigh the inconvenience to the local community.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the information available to me suggests that the British authorities do not consider that any of the closed roads in question can be reopened having regard to the security position. The Government will of course &mdash; and I take the Deputy's point in this respect &mdash; continue to press for a solution to this problem through the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.  We will also seek to ensure that the British authorities are at all times fully aware of the views of the local community on this issue, and Deputy Reynolds's raising of this matter tonight will help us to do that with greater force.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government are committed to furthering greater cross-Border economic co-operation and development between counties Leitrim and Fermanagh.  I need hardly remind him of the importance of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal project in this regard.  The Taoiseach, in his recent remarks on the launching of the canal restoration project, drew attention to the economic and social importance of the restoration project for the people of County Leitrim and pointed out that the Government had submitted the canal project to the European Commission under the National Development Plan as one of its flagship projects for Structural Funds support.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission shared the Government's assessment of the economic potential of the canal and have now committed, as the Deputy is aware, substantial funding from the European Regional Development Fund to the project. The two Governments will contribute significantly to the project and the International Fund for Ireland, which was established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, played a pivotal role in the early stages of the project and has made <Col N="2703" /> a very substantial commitment to the costs of the construction work.</P>
    <P>In reply to the Deputy's question concerning the letter that Leitrim County Council sent to the Minister, while the Minister appreciated the invitation he was, as the Deputy said, unable to visit the county because of a very full schedule. However, an official of the Department is visiting the area today and when he makes his report we will be in a position to inform the Deputies for the area, all of whom have an interest in this matter, what his findings are.  I reassure Deputy Reynolds and the other Deputies who raised this matter that the Government will continue to press it with the British Government and to point out the social and economic disruption that has been caused by these closures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this urgent matter.  It should be emphasised that agriculture as a percentage of our GNP is substantial &mdash; 10 per cent of our GNP compared with an average of 3.5 per cent in the EC as a whole.  Hence any reduction in price support or any agricultural trade liberalisation will have the greatest impact on countries like ours which are dependent on agriculture.  It has become a cliché but remains a fact that agriculture is still by far our single most important industry in terms of share of national <Col N="2704" /> income, exports and employment generated. It should be the objective of Government policy that agriculture make its maximum contribution to national recovery.</P>
      <P>Certain key developments must take place.  We must make a major effort to improve food quality.  There is an urgent need for integrated rural development programmes as a prerequisite for a viable rural economy.  Recent negotiations at EC and GATT level clearly show that the focus of attention is on an expansion of EC Structural Funds and the funding of programmes relating to integrated rural development which this may give rise to.</P>
      <P>I submit that the basic fabric of agriculture and rural society is now under threat in the light of the stalemate during the recent GATT negotiations.  There is a concerted attack on our most important industry.  The US has been winning the propaganda war during these talks.  Commissioner MacSharry succumbed to this propaganda during the summer when he unilaterally proposed a 30 per cent reduction in EC subsidies without any recourse or reference to the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  If this is the result of Minister O'Kennedy's achievements during his much-heralded term as President of the EC Council of Agriculture Ministers, he has been a total failure.</P>
      <P>The Government have clearly shown they have no political clout in Europe and have no political allies there.  My party, Fine Gael, through the Christian Democrats, have demonstrated their ability to make our case successfully on behalf of Irish agriculture, particularly in 1984 during the super-levy negotiations. While every other country took a reduction in the milk quota, we were getting an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commissioner MacSharry has shown great weakness following his announcement last July and he has not recovered since from that major gaffe.  Is it any surprise that the US has called for the complete restructuring of the CAP, the very cornerstone of our survival in Europe?  Immediate steps must be taken. The entire country should be declared disadvantaged.  How can we expect to do <Col N="2705" /> it under any other Commissioner if we cannot do it under Commissioner MacSharry? The mess which has been made by this Minister is a clear example of the mismanagement of our case within the European Community in relation to the designation of disadvantaged areas.  Low interest EMS loans should be introduced for specific purposes, particularly for working capital, and the social welfare code should be immediately reviewed to take account of quarterly market returns. The Taoiseach should undertake an immediate tour of the EC capitals to highlight the case of Irish farmers and emphasise our desire to maintain the basic structure of the CAP.  These are measures which can be taken immediately if the Government have the will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support my colleague.  The population of rural Ireland is totally demoralised and pessimistic about the future.  The Minister should recognise this problem and take some steps to remove this feeling of no hope in rural communities.  The position with regard to GATT will definitely hasten the movement of farmers away from the land.  It will be accelerated to an enormous degree.  This must be admitted and steps taken to deal with it.  What steps are the Government taking?  We hear from time to time rumours about increased subsidies from Europe.  The farming community are certain that many of them will have to depend on social welfare payments.  The Government have no policy to deal with the problem. Vague references have been made over the past couple of years to agri-tourism and rural development and these could have become a reality if the necessary steps had been taken.  I must ask the Minister to give us some indication of hope.</P>

      <P>Agreement at the Agriculture Council on 6 November was secured only after considerable safeguards had been built into the Community's proposals.  A major amendment was accepted by the <Col N="2706" /> Commission in relation to its proposal on border protection which should ensure that Community preference will be maintained. The Council also reaffirmed its support for the Community's global approach and made it clear that any separate undertaking on export subsidies would be incompatible with maintaining the fundamental principles of the CAP. In addition, both the council and the Commission accepted that account would have to be taken of the difficult situations of producer regions adversely affected by the GATT negotiations when adapting policies and drawing up compensatory arrangements.  In particular, the Commission has stated that it considers that the total level of assistance to the less favoured regions should not be reduced as a result of the implementation of the outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations. The Commission has undertaken to submit concrete proposals supported by appropriate financial solidarity, to ensure a viable future for community farmers based on, <i>inter alia,</i> the reorientation of support to producers, taking as a basis the diversity of the structure of farms and production; and the reinforcing of structural assistance, including production neutral income subsidies, concentrating on producers and regions which have most difficulties in adapting to changes and measures to protect the environment and to improve product quality.  I am reassured that these measures will ensure that Irish farm incomes and rural areas will continue to be supported to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Commission participated in discussions at the GATT ministerial in Brussels last week on the basis of this mandate.  The negotiations were inconclusive, however, because of the unrealistic demands of some participants.  The US and the Cairns Group in their submissions to the GATT proposed a 75 per cent reduction of internal supports over the 10 years from 1991, based on average support levels in 1986-88 and 1988 respectively.  Both proposals called for a 90 per cent cut in export subsidies over <Col N="2707" /> 10 years and wanted to convert all non-tariff measures into tariff equivalents which would be reduced by 75 per cent over the same period.  In addition, they proposed that existing access levels for products should be expanded over the period of the agreement and that minimum access levels be provided to markets where products have no access at present. both the US and the Cairns Group placed particular emphasis on securing specific commitments in relation to internal supports, border measures and export subsidies. I was pleased to note that the Community held firmly to its negotiating stance despite severe pressure from almost all quarters.  It is to be hoped that when the negotiations begin again early in the New Year other participants will be willing to negotiate on a more realistic basis and that a balanced result can be reached which will protect the interests of all participants.</P>
    <P>It has to be borne in mind that even apart from the GATT negotiations, further adaptation in current support arrangements would have been necessary anyway because of increased production and declining consumption in some product areas.  The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. MacSharry, has recently announced that he will be submitting proposals to the Council shortly on adapting support arrangements for the beef, milk, cereals and sheepmeat sectors and an outline of the arrangements to compensate producers for income losses.  These proposals will take account of the commitments entered into when drawing up the Community's offer in the GATT negotiations. The Commissioner has said that his intention is to ensure a more equitable distribution of guarantee expenditure and to provide for more direct targeting of funds to smaller-scale producers &mdash; current estimates suggest that 80 per cent of guarantee expenditure goes to 20 per cent of farmers.  While the thrust of these proposals is to be welcomed, I cannot, of course, adopt a definitive position until the detailed proposals have been received and examined.  The House can be <Col N="2708" /> assured, however, that our response to the proposals will be dictated by the need to ensure the continued viability of the Irish agri-food industry and the protection of smaller farmers' incomes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the decision of the Minister for Tourism and Transport to sanction substantial increases in bus and rail fares from Monday next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of the Minister for Tourism and Transport to sanction a major increase in Dublin Bus, Irish bus and rail fares from Monday next will further damage public transport, leading to even greater traffic chaos in Dublin. The Minister should have considered ways of increasing the income of the transport companies either by way of increased Government subvention or by measures to encourage greater passenger numbers rather than grant fare increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major problems in this area is that this Government have no commitment to public transport.  In fact the Minister appears to have no interest at all in public transport.  He appears to be far more interested in the high profile sphere of air travel which most people use occasionally, very many not at all, than in the public transport system in this capital city where Dublin Bus provide almost half a million passenger journeys each day.  I am particularly concerned about the position in Dublin where the fare increases will almost certainly lead to a drop in passenger numbers and even more cars on our already traffic-jammed streets.  The number of passenger journeys provided by Dublin Bus, unfortunately, has decreased by 6 million in the last two years because of the already expensive fares and deteriorating service. At a time when Dublin's streets are almost choked to death by traffic problems national transport policy should be <Col N="2709" /> aimed at providing an efficient and economic public transport system, encouraging more people to leave their cars at home.</P>
    <P>This latest increase will also affect those on low incomes in that a return journey for two adults and two children from an outer suburb to the city centre already costs £5, a considerable burden on working-class families, particularly those in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>Contrary to public belief, Government subvention to Dublin Bus amount to 17 per cent only of fare receipts whereas in October 1988, it constituted 22 per cent. This is well below the national subvention provided for public transport systems in many comparable European cities.  For example, in Rome the level of subvention is 80 per cent, in Luxembourg, 76.3 per cent, Brussels, 72.6 per cent and in Amsterdam 72.6 per cent.  An efficient, affordable public transport system for Dublin is essential on social, economic and traffic grounds.  It is in the public interest that the Government should provide funds to enable Dublin Bus provide an efficient public transport system. There is need to examine other means of increasing the efficiency of Dublin Bus. For example, steps need to be taken to increase the speed of passenger journeys which has deteriorated significantly since the introduction of the OPOs.  The existing bus lanes should be adequatly policed to ensure they are respected by motorists, that new lanes are created and existing ones extended.  Greater effort should be made to promote the use of pre-paid tickets to eliminate delays at bus stops. Fare incentives should be introduced to encourage off-peak travel.  Linked with that is the need for a proper management strategy for the city.  Unfortunately the Minister has no plans and, it would appear, fewer ideas, other than simply to increase fares.  We must now begin to take the necessary steps to give public transport the priority it warrants in this city if its traffic is not to slowly grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>The financial restrictions placed on Bus Áth Cliath &mdash; wherby the Minister cuts back its subvention at the rate of 2.5 per <Col N="2710" /> cent per annum &mdash; is a disgrace.  It is about time the traveling public knew why these fares are being increased at this time.  As I have pointed out, their subvention constitutes 17 per cent only of the fares whereas, in October 1988, it constituted 22 per cent.  The Minister and Government are constantly reducing their subvention.  Until the Minister controls the predominance of the private motor car, congesting the traffic of this city at the expense of public transport, Bus Áth Cliath will continue to be incapable of providing an efficient, reliable and fast service capable of attracting back to public transport those who deserted it in favour of the private motor car.</P>

      <P>Since assuming office, the Minister for Tourism and Transport has been resisting applications from CIE for fares increases. Instead, he has continually emphasised to a group the need for further cost economies within their operations and improved marketing to keep the cost of public transport to the travelling public and the Exchequer as low as possible.</P>
      <P>However, CIE recently had to bear substantial increases in their costs, notably in their fuel costs, as a result of the Gulf crisis.  As these extra fuel costs are exceptional and entirely outside the control of the group, the Minister recognised that some increase in fares, as a compensatory measure, would have to be allowed.  Accordingly, he recently conveyed approval to CIE to increase their bus and rail fares by an average of 7 per cent.  The revised fares will be applied with effect from Monday next, 17 December.  This will be the first general fares increase since January 1988.</P>
      <P>The additional fuel costs to be borne by CIE as a result of the Gulf crisis will be about £6.7 million in a full year.  This will bring the group's annual fuel bill to over £25 million.  The extra annual yield from the fare increases will be about £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated, the overall fares increase will work out at 7 per cent. <Col N="2711" /> However, because of the need to keep fares in multiples of 5p, as far as possible, the increase is greater than 7 per cent for some fares and less for others.  The denomination of fares in multiples of 5p is vital to the smooth operation of one person buses.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Transport has insisted to CIE that there will be no increase in children's fares.  He has exempted those fares from increases as he is most anxious not to add to the costs to be borne by parents whose children have to use public transport on a regular basis and particularly for school-going journeys.</P>
    <P>CIE have faced other increases in their costs recently in addition to their fuel bill. The final phase of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which was payable to some CIE employees on 1 October last and to the balance on 1 December, will increase their payroll costs in a full year by £4.6 million.  In addition, they have had to meet the general increase in costs since their last fares increase.  However, in line with the Minister's policy that such cost increases should be offset as much as possible by cost efficiencies, improved marketing and so on, the Minister would not be prepared to sanction a higher fares increase to recover these costs.  I am confident that the management and work-force in CIE will rise successfully to this challenge.</P>
    <P>The Government are strongly committed to the provision of an efficient public transport system despite Deputy Byrne's assertion to the contrary.  This is borne out by the Exchequer subsidy to CIE which amounted to almost £111 million last year.  In 1991 the subsidy will amount to £110 million.  That means over £2 million per week to CIE.  If that is not a commitment to public transport I do not know what is.  This is a very sizeable amount, particularly with the present budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>Some capital for investment is also vital to enable CIE update and renew their infrastructure and thus ensure the provision of a high quality service.  In this <Col N="2712" /> connection.  I am glad to say the investment of £36.2 million by CIE as part of the public capital programme for 1991 was recently approved by the Government. In addition the operational programme on peripherality, roads and other transport infrastructure which was launched earlier today by the Ministers for the Environment and Tourism and Transport and which covers the period 1990-93 contains proposals for EC aid of approximately £18 million for public transport, mainly in respect of rail projects.</P>

The population is composed mostly of small farmers whose average milk quota is about 7,000 gallons.  I find it inexplicable that the Kerry Head area was not included in the category of small coastal areas with specific handicap in the Government submission to Brussels, despite the fact that vast areas of coast land were submitted for other counties in this category.  For example, 13,134 hectares was submitted from Cork, 8,638 hectares from Waterford, 10,568 hectares from Wexford, 7,508 hectares from Louth, 2,087 hectares from Dublin, 3,728 hectares from Wicklow and 1,868 hectares from Meath.

      <P>On 1 July 1986 the Minister for Agriculture announced details of a scheme for installation aid for young farmers.  This scheme allowed farmers under 35 years of age at the time of first installation to be eligible for a payment of <Col N="2714" /> £5,600 provided certain conditions were fulfilled in respect of education and labour requirement.  However, it is clear that an increasing number of people are ineligible for this scheme, particularly because of the labour unit criterion.  I am calling on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to change the labour unit requirement between 0.5 and 1.5 labour units.  In addition the labour unit calculation criteria should be extended to all intensive farming enterprises.  The second instalment, which was payable as an interest subsidy under the Directive, should apply to Ireland as soon as possible. The scheme should be extended to to cover entrants under long term leasing arrangements in order to encourage greater use of land.  It is important also that a review take place immediately in relation to this scheme in order to improve land mobility.  Young farmers in the present agricultural climate need every encouragement to pursue a career in farming.</P>
      <P>The second matter I wish to raise is in respect of the Land Commission staff. In 1987 a decision to wind up the Land Commission was made by offering voluntary early retirement or redeployment to existing staff.  There were 13 people involved.  An arbitrary redeployment agreement was reached between the union and certain Departments, including Agriculture, Finance and Justice.  In fact, there was collusion between the union involved and the Departments involved in respect of this agreement and this upset the <i>status quo.</i>  A recent decision of the High Court taken on 12 December last indicated that the Minister for Agriculture and Finance had no powers of redeployment.  The decision of that court indicated a reinstatement to all former employees plus costs to the Land Commission.

      <P>The purpose of this question is to ascertain how the supermarket multiples funded their cash voucher scheme.  There are a number of methods that may have been used.  I suggest the supermarket multiples may have broken the ban on below cost selling or they may have increased prices over a period of time and then offered reductions, or the supermarkets themselves may have put excessive pressure on manufacturers or processors.  If any one of these methods has been adopted it has long term disadvantages for both the consumer and the grocery trade in general.  If they have broken the ban on below cost selling, penalties will have to be introduced.  If prices were increased over a period and then reductions offered I suggest the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade should publicise this and communicate it to the general public.  Many families at Christmas time find it difficult to understand how the supermarkets could offer 20 per cent reductions in November and now when we have economies of scale and <Col N="2716" /> increasing sales those reductions are not available.</P>

      <P>I will first deal with Deputy Michael Finucane's question in regard to the disadvantaged areas scheme appeals system.  We are asking the EC Commission to allow us to introduce an appeals procedure to deal with genuine anomalies and are seeking EC approval to be allowed to add up to 1½ per cent of the country, 255,000 acres, to our disadvantaged areas by Commission procedure without having to go to the EC Council of Ministers.  The 1½ per cent is the limit allowed under EC legislation for this purpose.  This approach is in line with the commitment given in the programme for Government in September 1989.  Until our submission is approved, however, it would not be possible to set up an effective appeals system or decide its terms of reference.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with Deputy Deenihan's question on the Kerry Head area.  The Kerry Head area of Ballyheigue is classified as less severely handicapped at present.  If, as requested by the Deputy, it was to be reclassified as a coastal area with special handicaps, the rates of payments that would apply in such an area would be less than those applicable in a less severely handicapped area.</P>
      <P>Deputy Phil Hogan asked a question in relation to the young farmer establishment aid scheme.  The question of change to the scheme of installation aid for young farmers in the light of amendments to the EC Regulation governing the scheme is under examination in my Department.  It is hoped to take decisions on the results of that examination shortly.</P>

    <P>Deputy Hogan also inquired about the staffing levels in the Land Commission. The Land Commission consist of a judicial commissioner, three lay commissioners and the following staff: 55 in the administrative, executive and clerical grades, four professional legal staff; 74 inspectors, including six on secondment <Col N="2717" /> to other areas, six surveyors and 15 in the service grades, paperkeepers, messengers and so on.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cullimore will appreciate that no useful purpose would be served by informing the Dáil of the findings of the Director of Consumer Affairs following his investigation as to how leading supermarket stores funded the recent voucher scheme.  The reason for this is basically simple.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade is, by virtue of the legislation, independent in the exercise of his functions.</P>
      <P>The situation in relation to the recent voucher scheme is as follows.  The grocery trade is subject to regulation by means of the Restrictive Practices (Grocery) Order, 1987.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has the responsibility of enforcing the order. Having received legal advice he decided that the three multiples involved in the money off voucher scheme were in breach of the terms of the order.  Accordingly, they were asked to desist from the practice.  I understand from the director that they have complied with his request and have ceased the voucher schemes. My understanding is that the investigation was directed at whether there was a breach of the order rather than how the promotion was funded.  Even if the director had so investigated and supplied the Minister with the results I could not envisage such confidential commercial information being made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Finucane, a specific promotional programme for the estuary planned by SFADCo is now being implemented in conjunction with the IDA making use, in particular, of the <Col N="2718" /> IDA's widespread network of overseas offices, facilities and contacts.</P>
    <P>As regards the promotion of the estuary for industrial development purposes I would like to assure the Deputy that the entire estuary area is being treated as a high priority location.</P>

These companies, based on market research, were perceived as environmentally suitable, were operating on a global basis and were likely to have a capacity shortage or production need for which the estuary would offer a solution.</P>
    <P>Having identified the companies concerned the next step taken was to access the key decision makers at the highest level possible.  Based on reaction to the approach a total of ten of the companies were then targeted for a further followup and within the past week, detailed presentations have been made to each of these companies.  The companies cover a wide span of interests ranging from heavy industry through to pharmaceuticals, healthcare and leisure activities.</P>
    <P>It is, obviously, much too early at this stage to assess the likely extent of interest or to predict the ultimate outcome of this particular approach.  I understand that a follow-up is planned for the new year and I am sure that we all join in hoping that these efforts will bear fruit in the near future.</P>
    <P>The next stage of the marketing strategy will concentrate on targeting potentially interested promoters in the Far East.  This will be carried out during the coming year and I would, again, hope that it will succeed ultimately in attracting some new overseas investors to the region.</P>
    <P>I would like to finish by once again assuring the Deputy that every effort will be made by SFADCo and the IDA working in conjunction and in close co-operation, to vigorously promote the <Col N="2719" /> estuary to attract suitable foreign investment as well as encouraging indigenous development to the maximum extent possible. The potential for development in the estuary is vast and it would be our intention to ensure that its largely untapped natural and economic resources be harnessed and built upon over the next four to five years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the Government decision in 1984 to phase out the activities of the <Col N="2520" /> Land Commission, there are 24 inspectors who have not been fully occupied on lands work for some considerable time. At the same time there are staff shortages on the agricultural inspectorate side of the Department.  Given the similar professional qualifications and experience of the two inspectorate groups, I am satisfied that the Land Commission inspectors should be assigned to duties on the agricultural side.  Eleven of the 24 inspectors are being assigned to headquarters outside Dublin, but the remainder must be assigned to posts in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The proposals to transfer Land Commission inspectors were discussed at several meetings between officials of my Department and the inspectors' union throughout 1990.  During these meetings the union representatives were informed that the only locations at which there is work available are those already offered. The Department had sought to minimise the inconvenience caused by seeking to locate the officers concerned near their current locations but this was not possible in all cases.  I should emphasise that removal expenses covering legal fees and other charges arising from moving house will be repaid to the officers concerned.</P>
    <P>The discussions on this subject have gone on for a long time now and it is essential to proceed with the filling of vacancies on the agricultural inspectorate side.  However, I have carefully considered all aspects of the case and I have now decided to postpone the transfers of those officers who will have to move house until the middle of February 1991.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, whose Department have overall reponsibility for the 1991 Dublin European City of Culture project, have given a mandate to Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited <Col N="2523" /> (DPOL) to plan and organise an appropriate cultural programme for Dublin in 1991.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the funds provided to my Department for cultural relations are primarily intended to provide assistance to Irish cultural events abroad.  However, I have personally conveyed to the chairman of the board of DPOL that the resources of my Department will be available to provide every practical assistance in organising the programme for 1991.  In particular my Department, who are represented on the board of DPOL, have been helping to establish contact with overseas cultural bodies and individuals, whom DPOL would wish to see participate in the programme, and our Embassies and Consulates are also actively disseminating official publicity material on the year to media and cultural contacts overseas.</P>

      <P>A very generous tax regime already applies to non-alcoholic lager.  A pint of non-alcoholic lager, that is of less than 0.5 per cent alcoholic strength by volume, attracts excise duty of 4.65p per pint compared with excise of 37.6p per pint for lager of average alcoholic strength.  When account is taken of the subsequent application of VAT, this differential increases to 40.5p per pint.  In the circumstances I have done as much as I reasonably can to favour the non-alcoholic beverage.  This beneficial tax treatment should facilitate the charging of lower prices for non-alcoholic lager by brewers and publicans.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has, as the Deputy will be aware, recently launched a pre-Christmas campaign to advise the public of the dangers of drinking and driving.</P>

      <P>At the end of last year, the Council of Finance Ministers agreed that, for a transitional period after 1992, exports should continue to be zero-rated and VAT should be levied in the country of consumption.  Tax on goods moving from one member state to another will be levied, not as now upon importation, but on acquisition by a trader.</P>
      <P>In May of this year, the EC Commission brought forward technical proposals as to how this system would work in the absence of customs controls.  After detailed discussions in technical working groups, a consensus has emerged in favour of new arrangements to replace existing import and export formalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new system, traders <Col N="2526" /> engaged in intra-Community trade will be required to submit details of their sales to their national tax administrations on a periodic basis.  Details submitted will comprise, at a minimum, the VAT number of the seller, VAT numbers of the foreign buyers and the turnover of the seller with each purchaser.</P>
    <P>These data will then be made available to the tax administrations in other member states, at whatever level of detail may be judged necessary, enabling the country of acquisition to ensure that purchases from abroad attract VAT there.</P>
    <P>It is likely that the new arrangements will be endorsed by the Council of Finance Ministers at its meeting on 17 December next.</P>

      <P>With regard to my Department, and the offices under my aegis, the Office of Public Works will contribute substantially to enhancing the status of Dublin as European Cultural Capital through its planned work programmes. The State investment in such programmes for 1991 will amount to £2.8 million.  This will cover projects such as restoration works on the Custom House, Casino, Marino, Rathfarnham Castle and Kilmainham Jail, and upgrading of the Royal and Grand Canals.  It will also cover the provision of interpretative centres in the Phoenix Park and on the Grand Canal and improvements to St. Enda's Park, Rathfarnham.</P>

      <P>The figure of £10,692,000 refers to the entire cost of capital works associated with parks, inland waterways, wildlife service and national monuments. The amount allocated for EC Structural Funds projects under the operational programme for tourism is included in that figure.  The increase arises mainly from the fact that the Structural Fund programme extends over a five year period from 1989 to 1993 and that the setting-up time for projects gives rise to lower expenditure in the early years.  The Structural Fund allocation will be expended on projects which have been approved under the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 to 69, inclusive, together in the order in which the subheads referred to in those questions appear in the Abridged Version of the 1991 Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>The details requested by the Deputy are summarised in the tabular statement below.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Tabular Statement</P>
      <P>Subhead H1 (Córas Beostoic agus Feola) &mdash;</P>
      <P>Grant in aid for general expenses £1,500,000</P>
      <P>The threefold increase on the original 1990 allocation will allow CBF to engage in an extensive promotion programme designed to increase commercial sales of Irish meat, thus enhancing returns to farmers and reducing dependence on EC market supports and volatile third country markets.</P>
      <P>Subhead I4 Payment to World Food Programme (Grant in Aid) Account £3,250,000</P>
      <P>This amount is being provided to assist third countries which have been seriously affected by the Gulf crisis.</P>
      <P>Subhead L4 Financing of the Common Agriculture Policy &mdash; Expenses in connection with market intervention and the financing of other FEOGA (Guarantee Section) measures £85,000,000.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is the designated EC Intervention Agency for Ireland and in this capacity is authorised to make purchases of intervention commodities, milk products, beef and cereals, in order to support producer prices.  The products purchased under intervention arrangements are retained in storage by the Department and sold at a later stage on the Community market or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The allocation provided is intended to cover two separate cost elements of intervention.  It includes firstly the cost of borrowing the capital necessary to fund intervention purchases.  In addition the allocation also covers the Department's costs in arranging for the necessary handling, transport, storage, etc. of intervention products.  Additional requirements are estimated under both headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC for its part makes payments to the Department in respect of these operations. <Col N="2534" /> These receipts which are also estimated at £85 million in 1991 are accounted for under subhead M21.</P>
    <P>Subhead L6 Grants for marketing and processing £800,000 (a capital service)</P>
    <P>This amount represents enabling grants in the livestock marts, horse marketing, egg packing and potato processing sectors.  On the basis of these grants Irish projects will be available for EC grants.</P>
    <P>Subhead L10 Integrated Rural Development £11,600,000</P>
    <P>This amount is to cover the cost of implementing the operational programme on rural development which is with the EC Commission for approval.  It is expected that the programme will be ready for implementation early next year. It will extend to aid for farm diversification, agritourism, horticulture, including organic production, forestry, services in rural areas, small and community enterprises and research and development in the food industry, as well as infrastructures such as road and fishery harbours which are covered by Estimates of other Departments.  It will also extend to training and promotion.</P>
    <P>Subhead L11 &mdash; Set Aside of Land £1,100,000</P>
    <P>This amount is intended to cover the cost of the existing set aside scheme under which premia are paid to farmers who forego cereal production.  In addition there is provision for the implementation of a recent EC scheme under which premia will be paid on land set aside under the scheme where cereals are grown for nonfood purposes.</P>
    <P>Subhead L13 Extensification and Conversion of Production £200,000</P>
    <P>Extensification schemes in the livestock sector on a nationwide basis are expected to get under way in 1991.  Details of these schemes have yet to be worked out.  The funds provided will meet any necessary costs arising.</P>
    <P>Subhead L14 Measures to Combat and Control Irregularities £100,000</P>
    <P>Under Council Regulation (4045/89 &mdash; Scrutiny by member states of transactions forming part of the system of financing by the Guarantee Section of FEOGA) &mdash; the EC are empowered to recoup to member states part of the cost of employing, training and equipping staff in implementation of this Regulation.  This amount is the estimated national cost of these measures in 1991.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The increase in Vote 34 subhead Q reflects the amount approved for 1991 in the sub-programme for Science and Technology in the Programme for Industrial Development, 1989-1993, under the EC Structural Funds.  The sub-programme is projected to expand over those years.</P>
      <P>The money will be spent on four main measures: programmes in advanced technology; higher education/industry linkages; technology services to industry; and regional infrastructure development.</P>
      <P>These measures are described in detail in the programme for industrial development mentioned above which is available in the Library of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £11,282,000 provided for in the <Col N="2536" /> Public Capital Programme represents the capital element of the £26,882,000 referred to above.  This will be used for buildings, laboratories and a variety of research equipment in support of the activities involved under the four measures listed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no loss of revenue from exempting medical card holders, who are employees, from payment of the employment and training levy because section 16 (c) of the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, provides that the levy arising for an employed medical card holder must be paid by the employer.</P>
      <P>Self-employed persons and persons in receipt of occupational pensions only who are medical card holders are also exempt from liability for levy.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible to estimate the amount of revenue foregone as a result but, given the criteria for qualification for a medical card, the amount involved, if any, is likely to be quite small.</P>

      <P>The increased allocation in P4 of my Department's Vote &mdash; social employment scheme &mdash; takes account of the increased costs arising from improvements in the allowances paid to participants on the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of 1990, a child dependant allowance became payable to participants on the scheme resulting in an increase in the number of married participants with child dependants.  In addition, the allowances were increased in July 1990 from £65 per week to £69 per week for participants without dependants and from £92 per week to £98.50 per week for participants with an adult dependant.  The child dependant allowance was increased from up to £10 per child to up to £11 per child.</P>
      <P>I expect the provision to fund an average participation level in the range of 10,500-11,000 during the year.</P>

      <P>The Government decided in July 1990 to introduce the State/ESB funded farm electrification grants scheme to replace the EC funded western package electrification scheme which had been terminated.  The new scheme, which covers areas designated as disadvantaged, provides 80 per cent grant aid towards the capital cost of installing new electricity supply, or increased supply where existing supply is inadequate, to farms on which agriculture is the applicant's main occupation.  Twenty per cent of the cost is met by the beneficiary, 20 per cent by the State and 60 per cent by the ESB.</P>
      <P>Five hundred thousand pounds represent the estimated cost of the State's contribution to the scheme in 1991.</P>

In the case of this client he could not satisfy this condition until 22 February 1991.  Accordingly, he does not qualify for invalidity pension at present.  However, if he continues claiming, his claim will be reviewed again in late January 1991 and he will be called for examination by a medical referee from my Department.</P>

Following investigation it emerged that the accident did not arise out of or in the course of his employment.

      <P>While his claim to occupational injury benefit was being investigated, the claimant was paid disability benefit at the rate of £48.00 per week, which is the maximum rate payable to a single person, from 1 August 1990.

Significant improvements have been made in this scheme in recent years and these are reflected in the increased allocation being made in the abridged version of the 1991 Book of Estimates.  The 1991 allocation of £9.7 million, which shows a 14 per cent increase on the 1990 allocation, includes <Col N="2550" /> provision for the full year cost of the major improvements to the scheme granted from July of this year.  These included: (1) Introduction of a minimum payment of £5; (2) Receipt of FIS no longer affects entitlement to a medical card; (3) Increases in the income limit and the maximum rate of payment increased to £77; (4) Workers who expect to be employed for at least six months, as against 12 months previously, can now qualify.</P>

      <P>Subhead L of the Vote for Social Welfare refers to the new lone parents scheme implemented from 22 November 1990.  The scheme brings together under one subhead all means-tested schemes which cater for parents bringing up children on their own.  It also brings in for the first time other categories of lone parents, namely, separated spouses, unmarried fathers and prisoners' husbands.</P>
      <P>In addition to the new categories, the allocation of £116.1 million for 1991 provides for non-contributory pensions to widows and widowers with dependent children and for social assistance allowances to unmarried mothers, deserted wives and husbands and prisoners' wives.</P>
      <P>In 1990, provision for lone parents, other than the new categories mentioned in the first paragraph, is included in subheads I (£49.1 million) and J (£93.05 million).  These subheads also provide for widows without dependent children, orphans, single women, deserted wives without children and prisoners' wives without children.  Since the new categories became eligible to apply only within the past few weeks, payments to them in 1990 are not likely to be significant.</P>

For the first time the new scheme provides a personal allowance, on a means-tested basis, to be paid directly to carers who are looking after elderly or invalided social welfare pensioners.  It also provides for payment of child dependent allowances in cases where children are dependent on the carer.  It is expected that some 10,000 carers will qualify for the new allowance. The estimate for 1991 assumes a gradual build-up to that number over the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>Schemes to make good deficiencies in existing services, including deficiencies in relation in the requirements of EC Directives, have been a priority under the water and sanitary services capital programme during the eighties.</P>
      <P>While drinking water is generally of a high standard, some supplies have not achieved full compliance with the Drinking Water Regulations, which give formal effect to Directive 80/778/EEC.  The environment action programme commits the Government to ensuring between now and the year 2,000 that statutory drinking water standards are fully and consistently met in all areas.</P>
      <P>A draft EC Directive on municipal waste water treatment is at present being negotiated.  The environment action programme already includes objectives for the next decade which are consistent with the likely requirements of this draft Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the financing of the water and sanitary services public schemes capital programme, this was based prior to 1988 on local loans fund advances, which <Col N="2554" /> involved local authorities in having to meet loan charges partly subsidised by the Department of the Environment. Since 1 January, 1988 this funding arrangement has been changed and the capital cost of providing new and improved water and sanitary services public schemes has been met by way of 100 per cent grants from my Department. Over the last three years, capital grants totalling £192.7 million have been made towards some 430 water and sanitary services public schemes.</P>
    <P>It would not be practicable, having regard to the time available and inordinate commitment of staff time and resources that would be involved, to tabulate the detailed information requested.</P>
    <P>However, extensive information on the water and sanitary services programme is contained in two publications which I am launching today and of which copies are available in the Oireachtas Library; these are the EC approved <i>Operational Programme on Water, Sanitary and other Local Services, 1989-1993</i> and a booklet entitled <i>Water and Sanitary Services in Ireland Policy and Programme for 1989-93.</i></P>

      <P>I understand that Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited are organising a &ldquo;lighting up&rdquo; ceremony at the Custom House on 11 May 1991 and I intend to support this project as far as I can.  Already this year, in accordance with the environment action programme, I paid a sum of £500,000 to Dublin corporation under the urban renewal grants scheme towards a scheme of works designed to enhance the environs of the Custom House Docks area in Dublin. This grant will support a total expenditure in excess of £1 million on these works which are now at an advanced stage.  A sum of £1.6 million has been provided for urban renewal grants in the 1991 Estimates and I hope to make a further allocation to Dublin Corporation from this provision.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I announced a major extension of urban renewal areas in Dublin city and elsewhere.  In addition, the deadline for qualifying works within the existing designated areas has been extended from 31 May 1991 until 31 May 1993.</P>

    <P>A major international housing conference is being organised for Dublin in July 1991 as a contribution to Dublin City of Culture and my Department is supporting this through representation on the programme committee.  I will be providing a sum of £35,000 towards the <Col N="2556" /> joint hosting by Dublin and Belfast of the 1991 Conference of the International New Towns Association.</P>

      <P>The question of a suitable scheme of works for the Redeemer national school, Dundalk, is being considered in the context of the available capital and the enrolments which have fallen considerably in recent years. Officials from my Department have arranged to meet the school authorities this week to discuss the matter further and I will advise the Deputy when there have been definite developments in this regard.</P>

      <P>My Department at my initiative is planning a programme of appropriate activities and events to celebrate the fact that Dublin will be the European Community's cultural capital in 1991. The planned activities and events will be focused mainly towards school children.</P>
      <P>At this stage, because of the diverse range of activities currently being considered, it is not possible to state the total cost to my Department but I am confident that the resources and funding at my disposal will be adequate to meet the needs of approved programme.</P>
      <P>Measures will be taken to encourage school authorities and teachers to make special efforts to provide special opportunities for all their pupils in 1991 to develop a greater appreciation, a greater awareness and a better knowledge of the rich cultural heritage of Dublin, its past and present contributions to many cultural activities including those in art, architecture, literature and the performing arts &mdash; music, drama, dance etc. &mdash; and its historic sites, museums, art galleries, etc.</P>
      <P>Included in the draft programme currently being planned by my Department to stimulate and encourage creative activities on the part of school children to mark the occasion are essay and art competitions.  It is also proposed to organise a number of cultural activities including an exhibition of European primary school children's art which will display 25 pictures from each of the 12 EC countries, a conference on art education, musical presentations, etc.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that my Department will work in close association and co-operate with educational institutions, cultural and other agencies and interest groups in ensuring that schools will have access to documentation on Dublin's origins and its cultural heritage, traditions and treasures.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>The increased allocation to Vote 27 subhead G reflects the extra costs arising from the recent approval of seven additional posts of child care assistant.  It also reflects the impact of a special pay award to child care assistants generally.  The total allocation under this subhead is expended on remuneratiom of child care assistants.</P>
      <P>The increased allocation to Vote 27 subhead H is intended mainly to cover extra pay and non-pay costs associated with the provision of additional places for young offenders.</P>
      <P>The total allocation under subhead H will be expended on the operation and maintenance of the special schools in question.</P>

      <P>The single largest project in the capital programme for regional technical colleges in 1991 will be RTC Tallaght.  The other major provision is for enhancing and equipping existing regional technical colleges generally throughout the country.  There are already projects under way in Dundalk, Carlow, Athlone and Waterford and these will continue in 1991.  There will also be expenditure on the College of Catering at Cathal Brugha Street and for a new college in Bishop Street forming part of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>

The bulk of the allocation will be spent on the provision of a freight-oriented service which will also cater for passengers between Galway and the islands.  I am also exploring the possibility of effecting improvements during the current winter season in the provision of passenger services between the three islands and Rossaveal.</P>
