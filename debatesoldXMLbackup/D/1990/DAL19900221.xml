      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking if the Taoiseach will consider having a statement made in this House.  Surely that is in order on the Order of Business?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, we are at this time of the day ordering the business for the day and it seems to me <Col N="3" /> this is the only, and most appropriate moment in the day when we can ask if a last-minute change can be made in the Order of Business of this House so the House can discuss something that is relevant to today.  I suggest, Sir, that it does not happen very often but you might entertain these requests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the most orderly fashion possible I suggest to you that you are being a little too rigid in your application of the rules.  This House needs the opportunity from time to time to invite the Government to say what they are doing about issues of importance.  I suggest that you would be doing no damage to the Order of this House if you would allow the Government from time to time to respond.</P>

In view of the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday at the conclusion of the meeting in relation to a trip to South Africa, will the Taoiseach inform the House when the Minister for Foreign Affairs intends to go to South Africa and if there will be the opportunity of having a debate in this House before he goes?</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 75 is consequential on amendment No. 13 and we have been discussing amendments Nos. 13 and 75 together, by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already debated amendment No. 13 at some length and I will respond to some of the statements made.  I emphasise that this is a most important provision.  It proposes an innovative way of tackling the problem of unfinished housing estates left by developers who have not met their obligations to the people who purchased houses there.  This is a problem confronting urban areas and many local authorities throughout the country.  All the houses in an estate having been sold, and the developer having been paid for them, he has then abandoned the estate without having properly completed the roads, the lighting and the landscaping of open space areas.  Residents and local authorities have in some cases been fighting for years to have the developer comply with the planning permission and conditions originally imposed.  We are not talking about the majority of developers who operate good building firms and are interested in maintaining a good public reputation.  Many excellent housing estates are fully and properly completed. A minority of developers have created major problems in different parts of the country.  As a member of Dublin County Council I am all too familiar with the difficulties within the county and I am <Col N="12" /> familiar also with problems in various estates outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>In Dublin south-west, in the Tallaght area, there has been an endemic problem of a certain developer and his subsidiary companies not fully and properly completing estates.  Ongoing litigation has been brought by Dublin County Council over many years to ensure the Kilnamanagh estate and the Aylesbury estate were properly completed.  In my own constituency in years gone by, Dublin County Council had to bring proceedings in the High Court against a number of developers for their lethargy in completing estates and not carrying out work promised not only to the purchasers of houses but required to be carried out on foot of planning permissions.</P>
      <P>Then we had what I regard as the ultimate scandal of the Grange Development Company being awarded compensation of £2 million which Dublin County Council had to pay, while that company, or the group of companies with which they were associated, were the most litigated against by Dublin County Council for failure to comply with planning conditions.  The law at that time, which will remain until this legislation is enacted, was grossly defective.  No local authority should have been required to pay compensation to a company against whom that local authority had to regularly litigate to compel them and their associate companies to complete estates. In some instances estates had not been properly completed for in excess of six or seven years.  One saga went on for 13 years and, to my knowledge, is still ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment I propose to this legislation seeks to insert a new section 6.  It is designed to provide a protection for the general public and for the consumer so that a couple or an individual who wish to purchase a house in a new estate will have a means of checking the planning record of the developer.  What I am suggesting is that we put in place a planning sin register, that each local authority maintain a register which would name those developers or development companies who have failed to comply with <Col N="13" /> planning conditions imposed on them and in respect of whom the local authority had to commence proceedings to force them to comply with planning conditions. In that way, if the developer is building another housing estate, there would be an easy point of reference for any house purchaser to discover the developer's record.  That would provide a very real protection for the consumer and would provide a very real incentive for the minority of developers who create these problems to get their act together.  In the event of the developer properly complying with the planning conditions, his name would come off the planning sin register.</P>
    <P>This is a long overdue reform.  It would provide the general public, the house buyers, with information to which they are entitled, it would enhance the reputation of good development companies who would never find themselves on this register and it would ensure that there was an incentive for developers to properly complete estates rapidly so that they would not become embroiled in the legal process.  I had hoped the Minister, having had an opportunity to consider this proposal since we last had this debate, would come to this House with a different attitude.</P>
    <P>The amendment would have another important impact.  It would mean that a developer whose company was named on that register could not make a compensation claim against a local authority on foot of any planning decision made. The scandal, in the legal and moral sense, that the law allowed such a claim to be made by Grange Developments was legally correct; as the law stood, the company were entitled to claim compensation. It was a scandal that the local authority had to make a payment without even being allowed to deduct from that payment the large expenses they had incurred over the years litigating against that company and their subsidiaries.  If the amendment were accepted and if a developer found himself on this register and sought a further planning permission, the local authority could turn down that <Col N="14" /> application and would not be liable for compensation.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the events of the last few days might have convinced the Minister of the worthiness of this proposal.  I have not had access to the report of the environment research unit of the Department of the Environment on their study of the planning processes in which it has been discovered that 44 per cent of new developments are flouting planning permissions. The Minister or his officials, in response to that report, said many of the instances of flouting planning permissions were of a minor nature.  I accept that some of them were but some were of a major nature.  I have not had sight of this report and I do not know whether any of my colleagues in this House received a copy but as Fine Gael spokesperson on the Environment, I would have expected, as a matter of courtesy, that this report would have been made available to me. However, as I have not seen it, I can only rely on newspaper reports.  It seems that this report confirms that there is a need for a new approach to deal with the non-completion of estates.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the last day that he was concerned about the non-completion of estates.  He said he was sympathetic to the idea of new legislation but that this is not the Bill in which to deal with it. Deputy Quinn very adequately dealt with the Minister's response in the context of a supportive comment on this amendment which he made last week.  We may not be able to deal with all aspects of the problem because of the limited nature of the Bill, but we can deal with the aspects of it I have detailed in this amendment. I would again invite the Minister to accept the amendment in the interests of protecting the position of the good developer and the consumer &mdash; in this instance, most often the young married couple whose major investment is the purchase of a new house.  They are entitled to this protection.  It would also protect the position of local authorities who, if this provision was in place, instead of having to waste their limited resources on continuous litigation against bad developers, would be able to divert those <Col N="15" /> resources to other uses.  It would also be in the interests of preserving the integrity of the planning process.  I invite the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>As I said &mdash; and I was supported by other Deputies &mdash; if the Minister wants to put something even more comprehensive in this area into the legislation, I would be fully supportive of him coming back to this House on Report Stage with such a provision but this provision will tackle a major part of the problem.  It makes no sense for the Minister to say he understands there is a problem and that he is sympathetically disposed towards it while at the same time opposing the amendment.  That type of approach is a return to the old style politics we get from majority Governments, which has not been the hallmark of the way the Minister has dealt with this Bill.  We should use the legislative process to bring in this reform.  I invite the Minister to accept this amendment and allow the measure to be incorporated into the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say one or two words in support of what Deputy Shatter said.  While we were discussing this amendment last week a letter arrived on my desk from a residents association in my constitutency &mdash; Blackrock, County Dublin.  It is a fairly typical letter from a residents association complaining about works that had not been completed on their estate by the developer, listing matters such as the provision of adequate lighting in the <i>cul de sac,</i> the entrance to the estate, planting trees in open spaces and the state of the entrance connecting the estate with another estate.  The letter goes on to state that this is due to the failure on the developer's part to complete the estate and to submit deeds of dedication.  The residents association sent me copies of the correspondence they had with the county council.  One of the letters states that the estate is one of a number of estates which were developed by the Brennan &amp; McGowan Group, which has been the subject of section 27 proceedings.  This is highly relevant to the <Col N="16" /> amendment Deputy Shatter has tabled because the Brennan &amp; McGowan Group were the recipients of the single largest payment of planning compensation in the history of the State, the famous £2 million payment that was made almost a year ago.  They have an incredibly bad track record for leaving unfinished estates all over Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Minister was quite negative about the amendment last week.  I hope the Minister has had a chance of reflecting on it since and that his position may have changed somewhat because this is a very good amendment, simply saying that developers like that should not in turn benefit from compensation for refusal of planning permission for another development. It has often been said that the incidence of developers who do not complete estates is very small.  I accept that there are many good developers who complete their work properly and that of the 44 per cent of developments which not have been completed, many require only minor work to be done.  However, the point that must be borne in mind is that 44 per cent of developers are not fully complying with their planning permissions. The incidents may be minor in some instances but they are often very irritating incidents for the residents who have to live there and who have paid to have the estates completed.  The fact that there is not adequate legislation to crack down on developers who do not complete estates and the fact that those developers in turn can claim compensation for refusal of planning permission in another development, is encouraging developers to be less than perfect in completing their estates.  I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My constituency is the most blighted area of the country due to this practice of not finishing estates and for that reason I support the amendment. I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position he advanced the last day. The Minister says that the Bill is about planning compensation and not about unfinished estates.  Because of the pace <Col N="17" /> at which legislation goes through this House it will take us a long time to introduce comprehensive legislation to deal with this scourge.  I appeal to the Minister to take on board the advice of his own Department if he refuses to heed the pleas of the Opposition parties on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wearing another hat I negotiated with the Minister to establish the environmental research unit in his Department. The abolition of An Foras Forbarthas was a bad decision, but the Minister has a lot of regard for the professionals who are now working under the aegis of his Department in the environmental research unit.  The information to which Deputy Shatter referred has been published since we had this discussion on the last day and it bears out in a striking way the extent of this problem.  I submit that if the Minister were to take a look at the situation in my constituency, Dublin South-West, and if the ERU were sent to do a survey in Dublin South-West, they would find that a great deal more than 44 per cent of the developments are unfinished.  I cannot adequately communicate the gravity of this problem in Tallaght and Clondalkin, where an area of great natural potential has been blighted and the quality of life undermined by the refusal of developers to finish estates. There are areas without roads, footpaths, trees or landscaping.  In a vast area like that this really undermines the quality of life of ordinary people who have made the major investment of their lives, having bought the brochure presentation of these developers and assumed that they would be living on an estate where this basic infrastructural work would have been done.  It is especially galling that in the case of Dublin South-West one company, its subsidiaries or associates who are responsible for a good number of the estates, should get £2 million of taxpayers' money in compensation while the largest housing estates in Ireland are left unfinished in my constituency. Deputy Shatter instanced the case of Kilnamanagh where 13 years later the residents' association and public representatives are trying to have the <Col N="18" /> estate finished.  In Aylesbury last summer we once again had to go to the High Court to get a distributor road put in. Kilnamanagh has 1,590 houses and Aylesbury has more than 1,000 houses.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council on almost all occasions when dealing with this developer have had to go to the High Court to get basic compliance with the planning conditions.  I put it to the Minister that if he would take on board the thrust of Deputy Shatter's amendment it would have an effect on developers.  If developers knew that the inclusion of this section had the compensation implications proposed for them, they would be more careful about leaving unfinished estates.</P>
    <P>In Dublin County Council there is now a backlog of estates to be taken in charge. I suspect that it suits the local authority to some extent, for financial reasons, to have this backlog.  We have some 40 major estates in Dublin County Council areas waiting to be taken in charge for three, five or seven years after completion, because the local authority have the excuse that the developer has not complied with the original planning conditions. As a result, there is no onus on the local authority to do the basic work for which residents associations are lobbying. They are not required by law to do it and therefore we have a backlog of estates to be taken in charge.  Residents who went in from two to five years ago expecting the basics one would expect in a living environment find that the basics are still not there and there is little they can do, because the local authorities say that original planning conditions have not been complied with.</P>
    <P>In view of the contents of the ERU report and the manifest feeling in this House about the extent of the problem, will the Minister take on board if not the precise amendment, at least the thrust of it and will he give an undertaking to come back on Report Stage with a considered amendment which would at least encourage developers to be more careful and which would improve the rate of properly finished estates?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sent for some copies <Col N="19" /> of the ERU most recent report.  The Development Control System, 1989, to be brought over today so that Deputies might have them.  I regret that the Deputies did not get a copy because I expect it will be the subject of questions next week on the Order Paper.  It is a useful document and sets out the situation that existed in the survey of 1986.  It states that, in so far as developments are proposed, about 46 per cent of the applications were sited in rural areas.  About one-third of the applications were for dwellings, 60 per cent of those rural and mostly isolated.  A further third of the applications were for residential extensions.</P>
      <P>Deputies made the point that about 44 per cent were not fully in conformity with the permissions granted.  On the 1983 figures the figure was 42 per cent.  Half the 44 per cent of non-conforming development were classed as &ldquo;significantly not conforming&rdquo;.  However, lest one would get the wrong idea about the figure the ERU survey states that half the non-conformity is not considered significant and some are very minor deviations in plan and possibly even beneficial in their outturn.  The report gives examples.  Under the heading of &ldquo;traffic safety&rdquo; it mentions that the car park of a premises was not marked or lit up to the specifications in the schedule under planning permission.  Under the heading &ldquo;effluent disposal,&rdquo; it mentioned a case where the rain-water was not separately disposed of.  These were the significant non-conformities referred to; the nonsignificant ones relate to effluent disposal in rural areas where the septic tank was off site but on applicant-owned land. Under the heading of &ldquo;traffic&rdquo; there was an example of where the recess was not as big as had been suggested in the planning permission.  That was not too serious but note must be taken of it.  As many of these were minor infringements I do not think the sin bin register should apply to the developers in question.  It would be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a full discussion on these amendments on the last occasion and I <Col N="20" /> made my position clear at that time.  I did my best to try to get Members to appreciate the measures which might be undertaken by the planning authorities to significantly reduce the difficulties which residents' associations had experienced in relation to unfinished estates.  I was very supportive of the views expressed by all concerned and I appreciated their anxieties.</P>
    <P>I see these amendments as being primarily concerned with the enforcement of planning law and I share the concern expressed by all the Deputies that planning requirements should be adequately enforced and seen to be observed.  In response to those concerns, I have offered to bring forward the new legislation as soon as possible.  That is not an idle promise; I mean it.  However, because these problems deserve a serious and systematic approach and response, I am unwilling to accept the amendments in isolation from the whole range of complementary and supporting measures required to make them work.  There must also be substantial reservations as to whether the measures proposed in the amendments would be workable, either from a constitutional or practical point of view.</P>
    <P>As well as being premature in relation to wider planning issues, the amendments would also presuppose a more developed concept of connected person if they were to apply effectively to companies.  This matter is being addressed in the Companies (No. 2) Bill which is now in special committee.  For these reasons &mdash; and because of the other reasons stated previously &mdash; I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The last time we debated the Bill I made a substantial contribution on this amendment, which I support, and I withheld my comments until I heard the Minister.  I am aware of the Minister's difficulties in this regard.  In a perfect legislative world the avenue he outlined would be the best one to travel because it would deal not only with compensation matters relating to unfinished estates but other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> In the 13 years I have been in the House our legislative world has disimproved. Comparatively speaking, there has been a reasonably productive output of legislation but in this case it is too long to wait for that kind of legislative remedy. Perhaps the amendment in the name of Deputy Shatter infringes on some constitutional rights in so far as it does not give a person proposed to be named in a register any right of appeal to a court &mdash; it also proposes that a local authority may act as judge and jury &mdash; but I am positive that there could be a further amendment on Report Stage to take constitutionallegal defects on board if they exist.  It would, for example, perhaps be appropriate between subsections (2) and (3) of the proposed amendment to insert a clause requiring the local authority to inform a person that the authority propose to put them on a register and to give them the right to appeal such an intention or such a proposed decision to the District Court or the Circuit Court, whichever is appropriate, and to allow the court to adjudicate as to whether the local authority were entitled to put that person on the register in the first place.  This would mean that a bureaucratic judicial decision could not be made without a right of appeal.  In layman's terms that is one of the ways in which a reasonable, argued objection to the legal-constitutional effect of the Fine Gael amendment could be met.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte elaborated this morning on the malign &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; refusal to listen to repeated requests, over a long period of time, by residents associations to developers to comply with planning permission and conditions.  For that reason, I am again asking the Minister to accept this amendment. It may not be what all of us would like &mdash; I am sure that applies to the Minister as well as to Deputy Shatter &mdash; but we are confined by the constraints of this Bill to focus exclusively on matters relating to compensation.  Because of that, this is the only narrow angle shot we have at a much wider problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bear in mind the failure to date of certain legislative <Col N="22" /> measures to be implemented.  I do not say this in a negative way because I appreciate the existing constraints. However, two years after useless legislation was passed in a panic measure in response to the Raglan House explosion it still does not operate.  There are about ten to 20 cases in my constituency, of which I am directly aware, of people who cannot sell or buy property because officials in the Department of the Environment have not finally arrived at an agreed form of certification in relation to the operation of that Act.  This House has completed all Stages of the building control Bill but it has yet to go through the Seanad.  I predict that it will be 18 months before the provisions of that Bill are in operation.  A building advisory committee has to be established.  The forms of certification have to be agreed and the question as to who certifies the certifiers has to be dealt with.  The method of approval and certification must be implemented.  I could go on in relation to other legislation.  For example, the Air Pollution Act must be amended and the Minister will have to return to the House with that.  I do not think we will see that before July.  The water pollution Bill is meandering slowly through the House.  It has dried up at this stage.</P>
    <P>Do I need to remind the Minister that two and a half years after his announcement of his intention to establish a national roads authority the heads of the Bill have only been cleared by Cabinet and it will be another year before that legislation will be on the Statute Book? It is against that background of clogged up legislation in the Department of the Environment that I am making those comments.  It must be remembered that the Department is a first division Department. It is long established, has excellent personnel who have a wide range of experience and had for many years the benefit of their own legal adviser.  They did not have to await delayed responses from the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The argument I am putting forward is not a philosophical one, it is a practical argument.  We made a similar offer to <Col N="23" /> the Minister's junior Minister, a person whom he rarely meets if one is to believe reports in the newspapers.  We told her she had an ideal opportunity to accept on Second Stage the Fine Gael Environment Protection Agency Bill so that it could leap frog the clogged up queue of legislation. The Minister has told us that his reason for refusing to accept the amendment was not that he does not accept the principle involved, not that he has some reservations about the constitutionality of it but that he wants to do something more comprehensive.  The Minister will probably be in Opposition by the time the Department of the Environment get floor time in the House to debate such an issue.  It will take him a long time to get to the head of the queue in the Attorney General's Office.  In the meantime, the outrageous abuses of financial power that have been put on the record will continue.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to reconsider his position in regard to the amendment. Having spoken to the Minister about the matter I accept that he is not the type of person who will try to create one impression but do the opposite.  I do not think the Minister will disagree with what I said about the legislative queue.  If the Minister can say that he will have the Bill through the House by June, or June 1991, bearing in mind the other legislation that is in the queue in his Department or wandering between the Office of the Attorney General, the parliamentary draftsman and the Custom House, then I will consider his views on the amendment. However, I do not think he can give that undertaking because of the log jam that exists.  It is because of those circumstances that I urge the Minister to consider taking on board the sentiment, if not the precise wording, of the amendment.</P>
    <P>The small number of rogue developers are not only inflicting injury, damage and hardship on those who were unfortunate enough to be conned into buying their properties, but are undermining standards in the construction industry.  They are causing a lot of internal problems for <Col N="24" /> developers who are keen to do a good job.  The latter are frustrated because while they try to comply with the law the rogues can with impunity break it.  What is proposed would be an effective warning shot across the bows, not a lot more.  As Deputy Shatter indicated the effect of it would be to create a register for consumer interest.  People would be forewarned before they buy into such estates. For the pragmatic reasons I have outlined relating to the ability to deliver legislation that will operate, I urge the Minister to reconsider his attitude to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the Minister's comments this morning. He told us about bringing other legislation before the House and I should like to make two simple points in regard to that statement.  The Bill before us was debated in the House in November 1988. On Second Stage I deliberately raised this problem in some detail and I invited the Minister to bring forward the necessary legislation to tackle it.  However, 18 months on we still do not have the necessary legislation.  The Minister did not bring forward the required amendments. If he had any drafting problems in regard to the amendment he, and his Department had 18 months to deal with them.  The Government's legislative programme, as published, to carry us through to the summer recess does not mention planning legislation other than the Bill before us.  There is no prospect of the Minister introducing such a Bill and having it passed by the House this side of the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, this is an urgent problem and it has been one for a number of years.  The Bill before us provides a vehicle for tackling a part of the problem.  As the proposer of the amendment I am not willing to accept the Minister's approach that he has good feelings about what we are at and he supports us.  He said that what we are proposing will have to be done in different legislation.  That is avoiding the issue and ensuring that for at least another two years we will continue to <Col N="25" /> have the problem.  I do not wish to rerun any old debates, but in the context of the Government promises listed by Deputy Quinn they, despite all the brouhaha about legislation and their opposition to the Fine Gael Bill last week, have not had the capacity to publish their own Bill on that topic.  To save face, to preserve some degree of credibility in the context of the so called green Presidency, one would have expected some form of a Bill to have been produced by the Government on that issue last week or this week.</P>
    <P>A Government who do not have the capacity to produce legislation of that nature in such embarrassing circumstances of voting down a Bill designed to provide environmental protection are certainly not going to regard the problem and the scandal of unfinished housing estates as a priority for further legislation.  With all due respect to the Minister, and all his aspirations for changing things, it is important to point out that there is a legislative log-jam in his Department which it appears he cannot overcome.  The Minister has committed his Department to legislation which to date he has not been able to deliver. Putting a statutory roads authority in place and establishing an environmental protection agency are different to talking about them, particularly when the Minister voted down legislation to establish the latter.  The Minister cannot produce the legislation he has promised.  I do not accept that there is any possibility that the Government will tackle this issue. The scandal of unfinished housing estates should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>While I accept that my amendment will not deal with all the problems, it will go some way towards doing so.  We must remember that this is a confined Bill. Had I drafted a broader amendment the Ceann Comhairle would have been forced to rule it out of order.  If my amendment is accepted the public will have notice of who the bad developers are.  As other speakers have emphasised, we are talking about a minority of developers. We should not lose sight of the fact that when talking about that minority <Col N="26" /> we are talking about small building companies who build three or four houses. The minority of developers include the group of companies already mentioned who have been involved in multi-million pound developments of housing estates. They have made massive sums of money. People have paid out large sums of money for houses on foot of promises that they will have a pleasant living environment with properly landscaped open spaces on which their children can play, with proper roads, with decent lighting and that they will not be left living in a concrete jungle that some developer, having taken the money for the houses he has built, has run away from.  That is a very real problem. Many difficulties have been created for young families living in urban and newly developed environments that lack the basic essentials to make their housing estates a liveable entity where they should have a pleasant environment in which to live.</P>
    <P>Buying a house involves more than buying bricks and mortar, it involves ensuring that one's children can play safely on the road, that they can kick a football on a grass area, that when one walks down the street at night lights are available so that someone from outside the area is not lurking in a dark corner waiting to assault and rob by taking advantage of the failures of developers to complete an estate.  There are all sorts of things in the essential living environment which ordinary people require but of which they have been deprived by a small group of developers.  In County Dublin one particular developing company have made millions of pounds on their developments and have failed to meet their legal obligations.</P>
    <P>We have a duty in this House to tackle that problem.  This amendment provides a vehicle by which to do so.  Deputy Quinn raised the possibility of amending some aspects of this provision.  Throughout the debate I have said that if we could incorporate this amendment I would be happy to take on board any further amendments that the Ceann Comhairle accepts are within the bounds of this legislation, on Report Stage.  I do not believe <Col N="27" /> there are any constitutional infirmities about this section because of the way in which it is drafted in the context of existing planning laws and the bringing of proceedings.</P>
    <P>We should not lose this opportunity to tackle the problem that has plagued the lives of thousands of people in this country.  Many people now living in housing estates that have not been properly finished for the first two or three years after moving into their houses suffered a great deal of stress and worry and experienced significant difficulties that were only resolved after the local authority took the developer to court.  There are other people &mdash; to whom Deputy Rabbitte referred &mdash; who many years later are still involved in litigation or on whose behalf the local authority are involved in litigation to ensure that they have a decent environment within which to live.  I intend to put this amendment to a vote.  I regret it is necessary to do so. I had hoped we could incorporate this measure in this Bill without the House dividing.</P>

      <P>One thing we have all learnt since coming into this House is the inevitability of gradualness.  One can apply that to many activities that are perpetrated here.  While the inevitability of gradualness can apply to many situations we have a reasonably good record in so far as the promotion of legislation in the Department is concerned since I became Minister.  It is also interesting to note that we still have a legal adviser there and one who is very effective.</P>

      <P>It needed some help and it was willingly given.  I am conceding the point that it was willingly given by some. In relation to the National Roads Authority, the heads of the Bill are drafted but it will take a little while longer.  We are also committed to the Environment Protection Agency before we rise in June.  I have always regarded this compensation as very important.  Many thought people would have had singed fingers getting near it but I have willingly taken it on board.  I have also dealt with the water pollution Bills.  I have a few other items of legislation that I will be introducing before long which will be of interest.  We have had a large programme.  Some of the items of legislation have yet to be finalised but it cannot be said that I have been in any way tardy in providing legislation or in promoting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are talking about here is the general question of planning law enforcement rather than planning compensation. The issue of planning enforcement is a comprehensive one and needs to be dealt with in a different way.  We are talking here about compensation and let us not <Col N="29" /> forget that.  In my humble opinion the question of compensation will be a rarity, subsequent to the planning legislation having been passed by both Houses. Therefore, much of what the Deputies <Col N="30" /> have said could not and will not arise. Consequently I ask that the question be put.</P>

      <P>6.  No person shall be entitled to make a claim for compensation who has obtained by the use of improper means another or previous planning permission or building bye-law approval.</P>
      <P>Like the previous amendment, this amendment seeks to prevent compensation being paid or being claimed by persons who have a bad track record in the planning area and deals specifically with cases where it has been shown that the people concerned improperly obtained planning permission or building by-law approval in other cases.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 31a deals with cases where compensation has already been paid and where it has been shown that the person to whom it has been paid obtained, in other cases, by improper means, planning permission or building by-law approval.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that for the past 12 months or so the Garda have been investigating alleged corruption and irregularities in the planning process in Dublin city and county.  There has always been one prosecution and it is widely reported that there may be further prosecutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Deputy will steer clear of matters likely to be <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that for obvious reasons I do not intend to comment on those cases.  However, I would like to deal with the question of irregularities in the planning area.  Unfortunately, this is an issue which has not been addressed to date in the House even though a number of attempts have been made to raise it.  It would have been in the public interest to have had such a debate on the issue in the House and for the Minister to have made a statement on the matter on which my party called for a public inquiry.  It is a matter of regret that the Minister did not see fit <Col N="33" /> to hold such an inquiry.  Therefore, we are confined to dealing with the issue in the context of the Bill before us and, specifically, in the context of planning compensation.</P>
      <P>If it is established in the Garda investigation now proceeding and in any subsequent court case that certain persons improperly obtained planning permission or building by-law approval those persons should not be entitled to claim compensation from the planning authority in the event of being refused planning permission subsequently.  I reiterate the call for a public inquiry into this matter which is the subject of a Garda investigation. There is considerable public concern that because of the complexity of the issue and the length of time the investigation has been going on there is a danger that the Garda Síochána may not be able to get to the bottom of the matter.  Therefore it is in the public interest, in the interests of ensuring that the integrity of the planning process is maintained and is seen to operate and in the interests of those who work in the planning area, that the matter be cleared up as quickly as possible.  I repeat the call for a public inquiry and I hope the Minister will use this opportunity to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a public inquiry takes place and it is found that there are cases where planning permission or building by-law approval has been improperly obtained, planning compensation should not be payable in the event of a refusal to grant planning permission in a subsequent case.  It has been alleged that a ring, involving a small number of builders, politicians and planning officials is operating in Dublin.  If the existence of this ring is confirmed and it is shown that some people have benefited then the beneficiaries should not be eligible for compensation.  In the interests of maintaining the integrity of the planning process all suspicions in this area should be cleared up as quickly as possible.  There are grounds for concern. As a member of a local authority, I have seen the close relationship between planning, property and politics.  Information brought to the attention of my party <Col N="34" /> which would give grounds for concern has been passed on to the Garda.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, within the scope of this Bill to deal with the wider issue of irregularities in the planning area but the very least we can do is prevent a situation arising whereby people who had improperly obtained planning permission would be eligible for planning compensation. Equally, if planning compensation was paid it could be recovered if it were found that those people were involved in any irregularities.  I am not suggesting for a moment that those to whom compensation has already been paid would in any way be involved in the irregularities I am talking about.</P>
    <P>If these amendments are accepted they would help to deter planning applicants from engaging in improper conduct.  I appreciate that we are talking about a tiny minority of applicants.  I acknowledge that there may be some technical deficiencies in the amendment but if that is the case I am willing to accept that and have the amendments dealt with accordingly.  We should, however, address the principle that where it is established that there has been improper involvement on the part of a person in the planning process that person should not be eligible for the payment of compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very interesting amendment which requires a lot of consideration. It is within the framework of other legislation where a person who has clearly misbehaved forfeits the right to continue to participate in certain activities for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because this relates exclusively to compensation, Deputy Gilmore has been obliged to confine himself in a manner not dissimilar to when we were debating a previous amendment.  The principle, however, is quite clear.  If it finds that an improper planning permission was granted, no court, will be able to revoke that planning permission and any particular gains or advantages that arose from that planning permission to any participants, particularly the applicant, <Col N="35" /> will be historically left in place and cannot be retrospectively repossessed.  There is little we can do now other than, as Deputy Gilmore suggests, provide that if a court finds that an applicant for planning permission had obtained that planning permission by improper means, and it is alleged that such improper means had included the corruption of individuals or the proffering of bribes to individuals, such applicants will have disqualified themselves from being eligible for compensation on foot of a planning permission refusal in the future where there were grounds for compensation.</P>
    <P>That is the intent of the amendment and the fact that this amendment is put forward reflects the considerable frustration of Members on this side of the House with the continued silence on the part of the Government in the House when the laws of <i>sub judice</i> do not apply, no court case having occurred yet.  We are not even informed as to the outcome of Garda inquiries; there are rumours as to whether it is or is not completed.  There is a separate and totally unrelated case in relation to the operation of building bylaws that has nothing to do with the allegations of improperly obtained planning permissions or refusals for planning permissions which subsequently result in compensation being paid.  As this matter is now legitimately on the floor of this House, perhaps the Minister might avail of the opportunity, when replying to the amendment, to put the facts on the record so that this House and the wider public who read about our deliberations can get an up to date official account of where things stand and not have to rely on information from the media which cannot be verified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the previous amendment we are now trying to deal with a broader problem in a confined way.  I would take the very simple view on the broader issue which is that if a planning permission has been obtained as a result of the use of improper means, such as a bribe, our legislation should contain <Col N="36" /> provisions to nullify that planning permission. We should certainly ensure that a person who so behaved does not derive any financial benefit from that behaviour.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore cannot deal with the entirety of the problem in the context of this amendment.  He is dealing with it in the context of compensation.  I do not know whether there are people who have obtained planning permissions who currently have any basis for looking for compensation. One is normally looking for compensation because one has not obtained a planning permission.  I appreciate that Deputy Gilmore has raised this as a vehicle to deal with the issue.  The point he is making is that if one does not get a later planning permission one is seeking, one should not be allowed to claim compensation on foot of that refusal if on a previous occasion one got a planning permission by the use of improper means.  I do not know whether there are people seeking to make a compensation claim against a local authority who previously benefited from getting planning permissions by the use of improper inducements but it would seem to make sense to ensure in our legislation that if someone is at some stage convicted of bribing a planning official, that person should be debarred at a later stage from processing a planning compensation claim on foot of some refusal.  Having abused the planning process they should not be entitled to use it to their own financial advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate we are having today is circumscribed by the provisions in the Bill. The Bill is about improving our planning laws and for almost 12 months now there has been a cloud hanging over the integrity of our planning processes, particularly in Dublin, because of the ongoing Garda investigation.  On various occasions in this House different Members have invited the Minister to make a statement about the course the investigation is taking and to furnish this House with the necessary information so that we and the general public may be assured that the integrity of the planning process is being preserved and the investigation is proceeding unimpeded.  I <Col N="37" /> appreciate that any statement the Minister may make will be circumscribed to ensure that if prosecutions are processed he will not say anything that could in any way prevent a fair trial taking place, or could be regarded as being prejudicial.</P>
    <P>However, I believe, considering the length of time this investigation has been going on, that there is an obligation to inform the House about where it stands at present, whether the investigation is complete or still continuing, and the numbers of people against whom charges have been brought.  We are reading reports in the newspapers, though none of us knows whether they are accurate.  There is an obligation to inform the House whether it is envisaged that there is a possibility that additional people, who currently have not been charged, may have charges brought against them.  The time has come for the Minister to break his silence on this.  He owes it to the people, particularly to people in Dublin, who are concerned about the planning process.  He owes it to some of the very excellent planners we have in Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council who carry out their work with integrity and who feel they are under a cloud they should not be under.  He owes it also to the staff working in An Bord Pleanála who carry out work with integrity.  If some individuals have behaved improperly, that does not mean that all the people who work within those areas should in any way be tarred by the behaviour of those who behaved improperly.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to clarify the position and to ensure that people know that our planning process is working properly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in the context of this amendment, which obviously is tabled to elicit information about the current position, to respond to the queries that have been raised.</P>
    <P>Finally, it should not have been necessary to raise this in the context of this Bill.  The Minister should have made a statement in this House well before the Christmas recess on the position as it pertained.  If the statement had said nothing other than that the investigation was still continuing and it would take a <Col N="38" /> further number of months for it to be brought to finality, at least Members would have known the position.  I hope the Minister will clarify it for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, like the previous one, is an attempt to deal with an issue that possibly concerns persons with a very poor record in this area and therefore it does not deal adequately with the major question under review. However, it deals with a matter, in so far as is possible in these circumstances, which I attempted to raise in this House on a number of occasions.  I feel constrained not only by the subject matter we are dealing with but by the fact that it is possible that court action is contemplated in respect of a number of persons. It would help to lift the cloud that is over the planning process if the Minister would address himself to that question and give us some facts.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Select Committee on the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 and we have been dealing now for some time with the very thorny question of insider trading.  In so far as I am competent to judge, the Bill if and when enacted will close the loopholes that exist in that area at the moment.  However, any examination of the scope for abuse and scandal offered by the extent of property speculation over the last 20 or 30 years would suggest that the real abuse has taken place in the area of land speculation and associated development rather than on the Irish Stock Exchange.  I think a great many people believe that a small number of people have become very wealthy as a result of insider knowledge on the question of land speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary that the Minister address himself to the question of whether there has been or is in existence a ring operating for the very specific purpose of subventing the planning process for enormous personal gain.  It would seem that this ring operates on the basis of people with insider knowledge in a position to purchase land in the certain knowledge that rezoning that land if necessary will be an obstacle that can be overcome, who can then apply for planning permission.  If <Col N="39" /> planning permission is not recommended by the planning managers and officials that also can be overcome and if all fails in certain cases they can expect a rather surprising decision from An Bord Pleanála.  That is the gist of the allegations that have been drawn across the public pages of the print media with no rebuttal from the Government, the Minister for Justice, or the Minister of the Environment.  Perhaps the people in the media have not put together the ring as totally as that, but I suggest that is what has been happening.  For example, the growth of the city westwards has provided several opportunities &mdash; rather than endless &mdash; opportunites for such abuse.</P>
    <P>Let me give the House an example of the kind of thing I am talking about. Information came into my possession concerning a particular house in west County Dublin which, although it had a physical existence, had no legal existence because there was no planning permission or by-law approval for the house in question.  It sat there for some 17 years and suddenly an application was made for what we call &mdash; the Minister will understand &mdash; planning retention.  Amazingly, compensation was paid on a deal concluded by the local authority on behalf of the developer &mdash; it was a private development &mdash; before the retention was granted.  On investigation it emerges that the house was or was likely to be on the route of a major motorway.  It seems to me it is stretching credulity a bit far to expect the ordinary taxpayer to believe that an application for retention should suddenly have been moved after 17 years coincidental with a motorway being planned to pass nearby.  I am now advised, but have not had an opportunity to check it yet, that it was not necessary to purchase the house for the motorway, and I intend to check that out.  However, I know, because I found out the hard way, that £136,000 was paid out and the deal concluded before the retention was granted.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that one is expected to believe that there was no insider knowledge in that case.  It is an <Col N="40" /> example of the kind of thing we are talking about.  Where the insider knowledge would come from is a matter of speculation. It seems that people involved include planning and other officials, even persons concerned with An Bord Pleanála and politicians.  That provides all the ingredients for the kind of subversion of the planning process I refer to.  This amendment may be a very inadequate way of dealing with that situation but it is about as far as is permitted by the subject matter of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is felt, without any great evidence ever having been adduced, that there are politicians, some having held or even holding very powerful positions, who have benefited from land speculation in the past.  In the absence of satisfactory statements ever having been made, it is very difficult to comment on that.  Certainly it is believed by the man in the street and it is a reason behind the cynicism very often felt by the public in respect of the practitioners of politics. Any spokesperson for any party in this House would be very foolhardy to advance himself or herself as some kind of purer than pure version of the practitioner of politics.  I am not so sure that any of us on any side of the House can say how the present investigation will end, provided it is being pursued, as I hope it is, with all the diligence, resources, conviction and commitment required in an investigation like this.  I hope the Minister can give us an assurance in this regard.  I do not think that any of us, because of the axis Deputy Gilmore spoke about between planning, property and politics, can presume what the outcome will be.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, we have an obligation in this House when the opportunity presents itself to take what measures we can to ensure at least that if it is established that there are persons abusing their position or persons who by the use of improper means or the giving of bribes have secured planning permission, they should be ineligible for compensation for any such development in the future.</P>
    <P>There is much concern in the local <Col N="41" /> authority of which I am a member, Dublin County Council.  It is not very long since the Attorney General had to prepare a file on the alleged possible conflict of interest of two politicians connected at that time with Dublin County Council.  It is really expecting an unusual degree of gullibility on the part of voters to believe that in some of the cases where planning permission was refused it could have been done in a manner that left the local authority so blatantly open to compensation claims.  There are many unanswered questions about the past 25 years of growth associated with the area of Dublin County.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter that it is incumbent on the Minister to avail of this opportunity to give the House some factual information on how the investigation is proceeding and when it can be anticipated that it will be completed.  It has now been under way for almost 12 months.  Notwithstanding the complexity of the matter, that seems to be a reasonable period.  In addition, it is entirely unacceptable that the overwhelming majority of dedicated public servants and others connected with the planning process should continue to work under this cloud, people whose integrity and record of public service is not at issue.  In their interest it is important that the Minister should give these assurances.  The public do not quite know what is going on.  The public fear that some junior officials may well become the fall guys for the real ringleaders in the alleged abuse and subversion of the planning process to which I refer.  It will be a tragedy if that is the outcome.  People want to see this matter cleared up as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the support of the spokespersons for the Labour Party and Fine Gael on these amendments from my colleague, Deputy Gilmore. Having regard to the extent of public concern, the least we can do is avail of the opportunity presented here to cause to have enacted this minimal protection for the future.  I do not think that is in any sense an adequate response to the scale of the problem which it is suggested we have.  We must accept that this will <Col N="42" /> have to await the outcome and finalisation in the courts of the current investigation before it can be dealt with comprehensively.</P>

      <P>These amendments seek to debar a person from claiming planning compensation or to make any compensation paid recoverable from him or her where that person has obtained another or a previous planning permission or by-law approval by the use of improper means.  Unlike Deputy Shatter's amendments Nos. 13 and 75 which we have just disposed of, these amendments do not relate to breaches of planning law but presumably to the commission of other criminal actions or offences.  The amendment seeks that, over and above the penalties in criminal law appropriate to such actions, the guilty person should also be penalised by depriving him of planning compensation in any circumstances.  I do not believe planning law is the appropriate place to deal with what we might call common criminal actions which can arise in a wide variety of circumstances.  It is for the criminal law to deal with such actions and, if appropriate, to impose special sanctions where these actions arise in particular circumstances.  The real consideration involved in these amendments is how common criminal actions should be penalised when they impinge on planning administration.  My view is that this consideration is properly a matter for criminal law and not for planning legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Deputies' concern that the highest standard of propriety should apply to planning administration and I will continue to insist that this should be so.  I do not consider that the amendments are appropriate to this Bill and I ask that they be withdrawn.  That seemed to be inherent in the contributions of all the Deputies on these amendments.  They recognise that this is not really the vehicle that should be used in these matters but they are taking the opportunity afforded at this time to comment on matters that are not related to the legislation, except in a peripheral way, and they are seeking <Col N="43" /> further information concerning matters on which it is not appropriate for me to comment here.  Nobody expects me &mdash; and this was inherent in some of the comments also &mdash; to comment here on the investigations that are taking place into the planning process.  It has been confirmed in the House that such an inquiry is in progress.  Questions have been tabled on this matter in the House on previous occasions.  On 14 November last year questions were answered on my behalf by the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, and on 13 December the Minister for Justice also answered a question, setting out the factual position as it was at that time.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of the content of any documentation that might be with the DPP and I have no information concerning such documentation.  I do not know of any cases of refusal where developers are seeking compensation and it would be wrong for me to speculate on any cases that might arise now or in the future.  The point made in Deputy Rabbitte's final sentence is the appropriate one, that we all have to await the outcome of these investigations, It would be improper for me to comment any further and I think that is accepted by the Deputies. For that reason I cannot offer any further information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I do not accept that it is inappropriate to have amendments on this issue to the Bill.  I accept what has been said, that by including these amendments we would be dealing in a very minimal way with what is a much wider problem.  It is regrettable that the only opportunity we have to air this matter in the House has to be in the context of this Bill and that the Minister has not come in here on a previous occasion and given a full, clear statement on the matter.  I accept he has answered questions &mdash; if my memory is correct I think some of those questions were from myself.  The amount of information which was given in reply to those questions was very scant and was certainly less than <Col N="44" /> what was already commonly known and available through the public press.</P>
      <P>We have to look at this issue in its totality.  Very serious allegations and suggestions have been made about the operation of the planning system in Dublin, suggesting that a ring has been in operation which has been described as involving a small number of officials, some politicians and some builders who have operated on the basis of providing each other with information and maximising their position.  There is widespread public concern about this.  I do not think it is acceptable that the Minister can simply say there is a Garda investigation going on and we have to await the outcome of that, in the same way as if there was a Garda investigation about an accident.</P>
      <P>There are issues raised on this whole matter which require a much clearer statement by the Minister and a much clearer airing.  We are dealing firstly with a very complex area.  The whole planning area, as we have acknowledged in the course of our discussion here, is legislated for by very complex legislation.  The procedures dealing with a planning application are very complex.  There might be several planning files involved in a particular development.  There might be a first application for outline permission, another application for full planning permission and a further application for some variation of that.  It might involve a material contravention of the development plan.  There might be a whole series of procedures and files which have to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is available to the public?  Under the present legislation all that is available is a public file which provides the public with a certain amount of minimal information such as the advertisement, the plans and basically the decision that is ultimately reached.  The material dealing with reports from technical staff and reports from individual planning officers as to what they thought of the planning application are never made available to the public, nor indeed are they made available to the members of local authorities. The members of local authorities <Col N="45" /> are presented with the same file as the public can get when they walk into the public office.</P>
    <P>It has to be acknowledged that the Garda investigators have a very difficult job to do in this case.  I do not envy them the task of trying to sift through a whole jungle of files and planning procedures in order to establish the extent to which there has been corruption or subversion of the planning process.  It is for that reason that my party and other people have called for a public inquiry into this matter.  In that way the public could see, first, whether or not there is substance to the allegations that have been made and, secondly, what is the full extent of the problem.  It does not take a great deal of imagination to see where a problem can arise.  The decisions made by local authorities to rezone property, for example, involve a benefit to the people concerned, very often in the region of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>At a recent meeting of Dublin County Council there were motions on the agenda for material contraventions of a development plan for a total of 914 houses, all of them up-market developments. In my estimation and from my limited knowledge of the property market I reckon it would have added in the region of £50 million or £60 million to the value of the properties concerned. It is not difficult to see that the public are entitled to raise questions as to the interrelationship between the planning process, politics, local politics at county council and corporation level and property. It is easy to see how the public could have grounds for concern as to whether everything is in order.  This concern was there before the publicity about the present allegations of corruption ever arose.</P>
    <P>The fact that there was concern, that there have now been widespread reported allegations of corruption, that the Minister responded by simply saying quite blandly that there is a Garda investigation going on and that we will have to await its outcome, is not good enough. We require a more comprehensive statement from the Minister as to whether we <Col N="46" /> should have a tightening of the legislation in that area, as to whether planning permission acquired through improper means should be struck out and whether legislation is required to tighten up the procedures so that the public have better access to knowledge of what is going on in the planning area.  We need to know that from the Minister and we need a decision to establish a public inquiry. Aspects in this whole area would be impossible for Garda investigators to unravel no matter how competent they were.  We need the skills of people experienced in planning law to find out whether there is substance in the allegations.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that when the Minister replied he did not say there was anything wrong with the amendments.  His only response was that they were inappropriate and that the issue could be better dealt with by some amendment to the criminal law.  However, we do not have legislation before the House dealing with criminal law which would deal with this area.  It is appropriate to deal with this in the context of planning law as the problem arose because of the way the planning process operates.  I accept that the amendment is a very minimalist approach to a wide problem and that simply making a provision in this Bill which would prohibit somebody who had obtained planning permission improperly from getting compensation is a minimum measure, but in the context of the Bill before the House, it is the only avenue open to us.  That is regrettable.  We should have had an opportunity for a much wider debate on this issue.  These amendments should be accepted as they are quite appropriate.</P>
    <P>In relation to Amendment No. 31a concern has been expressed as to the manner in which the two main compensation awards arose.  It is quite remarkable that in the SJX case in Killiney An Bord Pleanála could have given a decision which left the local authority open to the payment of compensation when the local authority in their original decision on the planning application included non-compensatable reasons which would not have allowed for the <Col N="47" /> payment of compensation.  It was An Bord Pleanála's decision on appeal, and not the local authority decision, which allowed compensation to be granted. One could say that that might never arise again, but is it not remarkable that virtually the same thing arose in the second case, in the case of Grange Developments where again the liability to compensation arose because An Bord Pleanála failed to protect the local authority by citing non-compensatable reasons for their refusal?  That may be a remarkable coincidence, but I find it difficult to accept that it is a coincidence. At the time very grave concern was expressed about how An Bord Pleanála on two different occasions could have made precisely the same mistake which left the local authorities concerned open to the payment of compensation in excess of £2 million.  That is something we need to pursue further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with this on Committee Stage for a variety of reasons, one being the public outcry in relation to a number of extraordinary decisions which led to compensation claims being lodged with the relevant local authorities. There were deeply help suspicions that although something might not be rotten in the Republic of Ireland planning and development operations, it was certainly unsatisfactory and perhaps unsavoury. That perception did not arise today or yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has read Frank McDonald's book, <i>The Destruction of Dublin,</i> or some of the stories surrounding its ultimate publication following a threatened legal case, will get the distinct impression that some people abuse their position for personal gain.  Indeed, a former city manager, Mr. Jimmy Molloy, now unfortunately prematurely retired through ill health, in his capacity as housing co-ordinator, at a controversial meeting of Dublin County Council, from which I got a comprehensive report, referred to a very controversial compulsory purchase order relating to Fortunestown. In his defence of the county <Col N="48" /> council's efforts to acquire land for Dublin County Council's massive housing list at that time, he referred to the extraordinary link between property development, politics, power and money in our society.  In a spirited defence of the local authority's right to obtain land by way of public ownership through a CPO, Mr. Molloy said there were some people at that meeting who would make more money on the basis of one single land deal than he as a public servant would earn in his life as a public servant. That is the scale of what we are talking about and everybody knows it.</P>
    <P>The figure Deputy Gilmore gave in relation to a whole raft of section 4 motions for material contravention, placed mainly on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party in Dublin County Council in order to break the development plan democratically put in place by the majority of the council, is a cause for concern.  The fact that this Bill is on the floor of the House today is a cause for concern.  The reason the Minister went away and thought again &mdash; a welcome thing &mdash; is that on Second Stage the concern we felt was heard by the Minister. He must be complimented as a Minister who listens to the contributions on the floor of this House.  I do not for one moment believe that the Minister has anything to hide and, therefore, his reticent response to this side of the House &mdash; Deputy Nealon was not in the House at the time &mdash; was very inadequate.</P>
    <P>Allegations were made in the newspapers. We do not know if the same allegations were made directly to the Minister, but if they were similar, the course of action the Minister took approximately one year ago in referring the matter to the Garda for an inquiry was the correct course.  I am on record as having commended the Minister for taking that course of action.  He did not have any other choice, but he took the decision quickly.  The sense of urgency in making that decision has not been reflected in the Minister's reply or in relation to the amount of information &mdash; through an updated report, as Deputy Shatter said &mdash; which could have been <Col N="49" /> given to the House.  I invite the Minister to give a comprehensive report to the House on what has happened.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte said there had been unease in some quarters for approximately 25 years that some people, never more than a small minority, made substantial killings by an improper use of inside information, political influence or a combination of those and other factors. The Minister should reconsider his contribution. Perhaps he did not anticipate that this amendment would have the effect of prising open the lid on something that the Ceann Comhairle has successfully clamped in this House at Question Time over a long period.  Perhaps it would not only have been clamped but sealed and nailed down if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle had been the pilot for an earlier part of today's proceedings.</P>
    <P>Let me speak specifically to the amendment and to its validity because we have used it to debate a broader issue.  There is provision in the operation of our affairs in this State that if a medical practitioner clearly abuses his or her powers, responsibility or authority in the practise of medicine as regulated and the abuses are sufficiently grievous, he or she can be debarred from practising medicine within the jurisdiction of this State for a period of time, indeed for the remanider of his or her life.</P>
    <P>This also applies in the practise of law. A solicitor who abuses his or her position in the exercise of responsibilities and trust can be struck off and prevented from earning a living using the skill acquired in that area.  In essence, the principle sought by The Workers' Party is essentially the same but, of necessity, is constrained by the provisions of this Bill.  As Deputy Shatter said, ideally, if we were less constrained, it would apply across the range of what we are talking about.  If, for example, a developer, architect, engineer, a planning official or anybody involved in the process was found guilty of grievously abusing the exercise of their skills in the pursuit of their primary trade or profession, as perhaps they would prefer to call it &mdash; I have never seen much difference between a <Col N="50" /> trade and profession &mdash; he or she should receive similar treatment to a solicitor or doctor.  It is a call for an equalisation of treatment if a case can be clearly established.</P>
    <P>The wording of amendment No. 13 (a) is trying to establish that within the constraints of this legislation.  To that extent it is a partial response to a broader issue and problem.  However, that broader issue and problem has brought this Bill back to the floor of the House with a substantially changed First Schedule which has considerably altered the grounds for non-compensatable reasons for refusal being valid for the purposes of planning permission.</P>
    <P>There are two issues in question, the one of validity and the acceptability of the amendment in question.  Objectively speaking, if the Minister made a visit to Kanturk and addressed a Fianna Fáil cumann celebratory or triumphalist meeting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Never.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would not dare to comment on the temporary little arrangement that has him on that side of the House but if he commented on his own brief in relation to the matters on hand and his aspirations for a substantial legislative record, I suspect he would find it hard to answer a query from a delegate who would ask why it was not possible to put a provision into law whereby a person who was found guilty of having corrupted an official or officials in relation to getting improper planning permission would be prevented from benefiting in future in an area related to compensation.  It would be interesting to hear the answer.  Perhaps the Minister might reply now, with the recorders on and members of the press in the Gallery. The net issue is that it has enabled us to discuss this matter perfectly within the orders of the House, something which we had been prevented from doing because of a very narrow interpretation by various people as to what it is proper to comment on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas, by their definition, in which <Col N="51" /> this section will be invoked are very limited because (a) it presumes that a conviction will emerge, which is a very big presumption and (b) it presumes that they would be applying for compensation for planning permission which had been refused.  If this law is passed we will have significantly circumscribed those provisions.</P>
    <P>We will not bring the entire planning and development programme to a standstill because of acceptance of this amendment. We will not cause confusion in the Attorney General's office because a particular section of the Bill has totally transformed the thrust of this legislation. I submit that none of these things will happen if the amendment is accepted. After all, the Minister accepted dropping the commencement date.</P>
    <P>The impact which this amendment would have on the operation of the legislation would be extremely small and conditional in the first instance on a successful conviction arising out of a court case.  The Minister knows better than I do what the prospects of a successful conviction are. Are we talking about one, two, five or 22?  In the report which the Minister circulated today we are talking about an average of 30,000 planning applications going through.  We are talking about a small number of possibilities.  The Minister's reluctance, if I can take him back, metaphorically speaking, to Kanturk, to accept the spirit of the amendment which he must concede will have little or no volume effect on the operation of this provision, has not been explained. However, the salutory message it would convey to the public to assuage the suspicions, doubts and concerns that have repeatedly been expressed in a negative way against the body politic, is not understood.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter properly referred to the planning and other officials in Dublin city and county, including Dún Laoghaire, who are being held under some kind of shadow because of the allegations repeatedly made in the press. He said they feel in some way tarred with <Col N="52" /> some kind of brush.  Allegations have been made generally against politicians of feathering their own nests and abusing their positions of power.  While, as Deputy Rabbitte said, some are not without sin, we are not all sinners.  Failing to nail this hoary old chestnut up front with sanctions that are no more rigorous than those that apply to the legal, medical and other professions, is a mistake.  When the Companies Bill is passed people will be debarred from trading if it can be established that they were fraudulent, negligent or abused their positions of power. We are asking that a long-established principle in our body of law be extended in a confined way to this area.</P>
    <P>The amendment carries a salutary message and the issue which has brought it to the floor of the House is one about which the Minister has been silent for too long.  I invite him to say when he last heard from the Garda inquiry which he requested, to give the up-to-date information he has received, if any, and to say if he is aware that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions have received a substantial file on the issue. Will the Minister say if he is aware that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions intend taking action in regard to this?  The Minister is the person who initiated this whole process against serious allegations and I should like to know the action he has taken to ensure that all due speed has been applied to the inquiry so that we can bring the matter to a conclusion.  We must bring this matter to a speedy conclusion so that the people involved in the planning and development processes, particularly in Dublin city and county, who have been tarnished by this shadow can return to the sunlight.  I invite the Minister to accept the amendment.  I do not think it is a difficult one to digest.  The Minister should respond to a greater degree to the broader issues, such as telling us at what stage the Garda inquiry is and the action he proposes to take to bring it to a speedy conclusion.</P>

      <P>As Deputies have said, this may not be a suitable vehicle for <Col N="53" /> bringing complaints about planning matters to the floor of the House but, unfortunately, it is the only way we have to highlight them.  I should like to stress that the concern being expressed is not confined to the Dublin area.  We have had a somewhat extraordinary decision, to put it at its mildest, by An Bord Pleanála in regard to a planning application for the erection of bungalows in Rosses Point, County Sligo.  That decision was granted on appeal by An Bord Pleanála.  Initially, the application was turned down by Sligo County Council, and rightly so.  It was the most outregeous planning permission I have come across.  It is beyond my comprehension how An Bord Pleanála could have granted permission in this case.  Permission was sought to erect bungalows in a scenic area in a seaside resort.  I am sure the Minister is familar with the area.  I am referring to the area overlooking the Metal Man across to Strandhill.  The erection of houses there will ruin the scenery. There is also concern that this application proceeded without the local people being aware that it had been lodged.  As Deputy Gilmore said, this matter will be better dealt with in other legislation but this is the only opportunity I have had to raise the issue.</P>

      <P>If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle had been listening to the entire debate he would have realised that the contributions were not very edifying but, unfortunately, the facts behind them were the cause of that.  The amendment, in a very limited way, seeks to insert some protection for taxpayers.  I gave a specific example of the type of abuse that is taking place.  I could give other examples but I am advised that that would not help the investigation that is still under way.  It would be wrong to do anything that would impede or damage in any way the effectiveness of that investigation.  I have given a stark example of what I believe is only the tip of the iceberg.  I have given the reasons why I consider there is such widespread public concern about this issue.  Therefore, it is regrettable that the Minister did not take the opportunity to make a more comprehensive statement to the House on a controversial matter in Irish politics.  I appeal to the Minister to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the Special Committee dealing with the Companies (No. 2) Bill and we have been dealing with analogous cases.  I am aware that very definite constraints will be imposed on, for example, the ability of rogue directors to rise up form the ashes and start up new companies overnight, having cost a lot of people their livelihoods or left many unsecured creditors unpaid.  Deputy Quinn referred to the position of professional practitioners who have voluntary codes of practice that effectively debar them from continuing to practice <Col N="55" /> in the event of being indicated for specified offences.  The amendment is a reasonable but limited one.  The Minister has conceded as much.  The amendment proposes that persons who have improperly benefited from planning permissions in the past should not be eligible for compensation in the manner described.  Its acceptance would do something to assure the public that the Government are taking this issue seriously.  There is some doubt about that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the book by Frank McDonald.  I was very tempted to go to the library and get Frank McDonald's latest book, <i>Save our City,</i> and turn to page 88, which makes very illuminating reading and which gives cause for concern about the seriousness with which the Government may be taking this matter. I do not want to over-elaborate on that at this stage but, as has been said, the main party in the House do have contacts with developers in this industry to an extent that no other party can boast of &mdash; if boast is the word.</P>
    <P>It has not passed my notice, and I am sure it has not passed the Minister's notice, that his colleague, the Minister for Energy, found it necessary to go on radio on the last day on which this Bill was being debated to claim credit for the amendments, such as they are, that have been advanced to this Bill so far.</P>

You also heard my request as a reminder to the House that even though a case can be made for any point if it is not relevant to that which is being discussed and what governs the discussions in Standing Orders, then it is not in order.  The point in respect of this amendment has been made and I am not sure that we should be attempting, through repetition or gilding lillies or any other botanical metaphor one wishes to use, to make a Second Stage speech.  The points the Deputy is making would be perfectly in order on a Second Stage debate.  I know the Deputy is new to the House and is anxious to <Col N="56" /> learn the rules and regulations of the House but a Committee Stage debate does not permit of the trawling that is being utilised in respect of this Committee Stage amendment.

      <P>In view of your advice, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will terminate my comments.  All I was seeking to do, and I think it is important in following your own botanical metaphors, was highlight the practice of farmers with mushrooms and what they throw on top of them to keep them in the dark &mdash; I would not wish that they be imported into this House because there are many people in the dark about the matters I am trying to probe.  I was merely trying to establish &mdash; in referring to the Minister for Energy &mdash; whether there was a reluctance on the part of the 13/15ths of the Government, to which the Minister for Finance was referring in Kanturk, to make a statement assuring the public on this matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte, you are out of order.  I will have to ask you to discontinue.  This is no longer a joke.  On this particular amendment you are out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard it as a joke, I regard it as very serious and in so far as a note of levity was introduced into this debate all day, with respect, Sir, you introduced it.  I shall confine myself to matters of frightening gravity if provoked. I believe that the amendment put forward by Deputy Gilmore is the most minimal measure available to us to deal with this matter.  It is necessary to remind the House that developments that have the most hideous impact in planning terms on the living environment of people have been, for one reason or another, facilitated in Dublin county.  Future generations will take a very serious view of our stewardship for allowing it to continue unimpeded.  An action must be taken in this House to disallow the combination of money, power, politics, planning, property and land speculation that has taken place during the past 25 years. People will have to live in the environment we are creating.  When one sees developments approved by my own local authority, Dublin County Council, for housing developments in the middle of the Liffey valley, surely that is not a matter for a joke; that is a very serious matter for the people of this country. For that reason, I think, this is the most minimal advance we could make in supporting this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to add except to say that in the last hour Deputies did take the opportunity afforded them to stray into an area which was not relevant to the actual amendment before the House.  I would suggest to Deputy Rabbitte that action is being taken and it is ungenerous of him not to recognise that.  This legislation which we are promoting through the House, and which was virtually unanimously agreed, deals effectively with something that has been awaiting attention for some considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> Other Deputies, before you came in a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, sought to criticise me for not commenting in some detail on matters which are the subject of Garda investigations and inquiry at this time.  The Deputies know full well that I cannot respond to that but they did take the opportunity afforded them to pursue it.  They also know that the Minister and the Government have to be bound by very strict standards in this regard.  One would expect that of me particularly as regards the possible prejudice of legal proceedings.  I must have very strict standards, even stricter standards than the public press have in this regard.  In one or two of the contributions there seemed to be the implication that I was privy to or that I was in possession of privileged information concerning that Garda investigation into irregularities.  I do not have that information.  I can only refer the Deputy to the answer given by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, who is responsible for the Garda, on 13 December in the House.</P>

In relation to the original complaint raised by Deputy Quinn, I am already on record: yes, a complaint was made and I did the honourable and proper thing, in my opinion.  I thought the Deputy might have referred to that in a more generous fashion.</P>

      <P>Apart from the fundamental considerations to which I referred previously, amendment No. 13 is, of course, technically deficient in that its intended prohibition could be circumvented by the formation of a company and the claiming of compensation on the basis of the company's interest.  Neither do the amendments make any distinction between minimal and serious offences.  Apart from whatever deficiencies the amendment may suffer, the principle is as I have stated previously.  I have nothing further to add and I ask the Chair to put the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I had a very cordial and satisfactory meeting with a delegation from the European Trade Union Confederation on 14 February.  The Social Charter was discussed. A copy of the joint statement issued following the meeting has been placed in the Library.</P>
      <P>I informed the ETUC delegation that in respect of the social dimension, the Irish Presidency assigned priority to action to reduce unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, and this will be one of the topics for discussion at the informal Social Affairs Council on 1-2 March, and for decision, if possible, at the formal Social Affairs Council on 29 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree, despite the cordial and satisfactory atmosphere at the meeting which may have had something to do with the fact that it was 14 February, that the ETUC did express some very serious disquiet after the meeting and that part of the reason for this is that substantial parts of the 1992 programme, which is designed to increase employment in the Community, are now slipping behind schedule? For example, the tax harmonisation <Col N="63" /> programme has gone behind schedule very badly, as has Community action on the technology side.  Has the Taoiseach, as President of the Council, any proposals to get those important parts of the programme back on schedule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should say that the trade union leaders were more concerned with a different aspect of the completion of the arrangements for the Single Market, that is, that economic progress towards the Single Market should be accompanied by a social dimension.  To that extent, they would be primarily concerned with the implementation of the action programme prepared by the Commission arising out of the Social Charter.</P>
      <P>On the specific question raised by Deputy Dukes, I would not agree that the programme of completion of the Single Market is slipping behind.  Of course there are difficulties, but as I said on another occasion, it is only to be expected as we come towards the end that the position will become more difficult because naturally the easier measures will be taken first and the more difficult measures will take longer to bring to completion. I would like to assure the Deputy that the Irish Presidency is awarding absolute top priority to all the different dossiers involved in the completion of the Single Market.  All our Ministers are fully engaged in their respective areas in full co-operation with the Commission and their respective Commissioners, and indeed in a fruitful partnership with the Parliament and its committees to get this programme advanced as far as possible during our Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though the Taoiseach describes his meeting with the European Trade Union Confederation as satisfactory, is it not a fact that the leaders of the ETUC expressed serious misgivings about the perceived watering down of the Social Charter?  Did the Taoiseach give any reassurances in relation to attempts to ensure that the work programme will be implemented?  Is it not a <Col N="64" /> fact that serious misgivings were expressed by the confederation leaders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not a fact. Naturally they emphasised their interest in having the social action programme implemented as rapidly as possible, and again that the social dimension should be advanced in parallel with the other aspects of the completion of the Single Market.  They indicated their concern about the implementation of the action programme and I outlined to them our priorities.  I was also able to tell them, which they were very glad to hear, that the President of the Social Affairs Council, the Minister for Labour, Deputy B. Ahern, is engaged with his colleagues in working out a Troika type of arrangement whereby they will plan a programme of work, to be agreed now and carried out by us, by the Italians and subsequently by Luxembourg, to be completed by the middle of 1991.  The idea behind this is to get away from a stop and start type situation where the Irish Presidency would do so much and then the Italians would do their bit and so on. From now on, we will work towards a specific programme which will carry us forward to the middle of 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the tax harmonisation programme, freeing up the market, is an essential part of what the 1992 enterprise can do to increase employment?  Would he agree that this is now utterly stalled? Does he not remember that the President of the Commission in his programme speech to Parliament described the framework agreement on VAT as being the bodywork of a car without the engine, going nowhere?  Would he not agree that far from being towards the end of that process, the Community has hardly got off the ground in terms of tax harmonisation? Would he, finally, not agree that the ETUC, in a number of statements going back over quite a period since we launched the 1992 initiative, have been extremely concerned about what they see as the lack of proper emphasis on the importance of training <Col N="65" /> and the Community contribution to it and the fact that we have a non-directive Social Charter which does not make the kind of progress in the training area that we all wish to see?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should recognise that we have moved on from the Social Charter.  The Social Charter is a fact and it has been adopted as a declaration by the Eleven.  We have moved on from there and the emphasis now is on the action programme prepared by the Commission.  That is the area on which the Minister for Labour, Deputy B. Ahern, and his colleagues in the Social Affairs Council are concentrating.  As I said, they are working out a specific programme. The ETUC people in their discussion with me were concerned mainly with the position of the long-term unemployed. We were in agreement on that aspect.  They were also glad to hear of the priority that the Irish Presidency is giving to that aspect of the Social Action Programme.  It is not true to say that the tax harmonisation process is being stalled.  It is not, perhaps, proceeding as rapidly as everybody would wish and that is simply because of the nature of the problem.  If it were an easier problem to deal with it would have been solved long ago.  It is, however, concerned with things of fundamental importance to the member states, that is their national budgets, and every member state has a problem with it.  Therefore it is only to be expected that it would be long drawn out and difficult.  Progress is continuing and a number of advances have been made and are continuing to be made. During our Presidency we will, to the greatest extent possible, keep up the momentum on tax harmonisation and, indeed, on all the other dossiers.</P>

      <P>The critical acclaim and commercial success achieved by the producer, the director, the scriptwriters, the cast and all those who were associated with the making of the film <i>My Left Foot</i> will be welcomed on all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more professional and commercial approach&mdash;typified by the production of the film <i>My Left Foot</i>&mdash; which has been adopted in recent years by film-makers in this country has resulted in a considerable expansion of the value of our TV and film exports.  The value of such exports is <Col N="69" /> estimated by CTT to have amounted to £12 million, £20 million and £25 million for the years 1987, 1988 and 1989 respectively. It is expected that it will amount to £30 million in 1990.</P>
    <P>Film making is taxed at a rate of 10 per cent as compared to the normal corporation tax of 43 per cent.  Tax relief is also provided for corporate investment in film production under section 35 of the 1987 Finance Act.  The maximum ceiling on relief was increased to £600,000 under section 28 of the 1989 Finance Act and the investment may be made either over three years in one or more projects or in a single film in one year.  The time limit for the qualifying investments has been extended to 9 July 1992.  In addition the business expansion scheme applies to film-making as it is classified as manufacturing and individual investors in film-making companies can get relief from full rates of income tax on dividends.</P>
    <P>The development of the Irish film industry is also being aided by a number of State agencies, including RTE, NADCORP, the IDA, CTT, the Arts Council and FÁS.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department continue to monitor opportunities for the involvement of Irish film-makers in projects brought forward in the context of the Ireland-Canada Film and Video Co-Production Treaty, signed on 4 April 1989, or European Community initiatives or the pan-European Eureka Audiovisual Project.  These measures have been of significant assistance to our growing commercial film production.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  Does the Taoiseach not share with me a certain sense of sadness in relation to the fact that the particularly successful film to which this question refers was, in fact, British financed and not Irish financed because all of the measures which he has just discribed were found to be inadequate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not British financed.  The British, as is usual, are claiming that it was British financed, but in fact it was not.  I was talking to the <Col N="70" /> producer of the film, Mr. Noel Pearson, yesterday about that very point and he expressed to me his considerable indignation that the British were not alone claiming that it was British financed but that it was, in fact, a British film.

Is minic a dhéantar neamhiontas, déarfainn, de chumas cainte an dalta nuair nach í an Ghaeilge an teanga teaghlaigh, agus cothaíonn sé sin deacracht.  An bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Roinn aon rud a dhéanamh faoin deacrach sin: caighdeán maith Gaeilge ag an dalta, ach, mura mbíonn an Ghaeilge acu sa bhaile ní éiríonn leo an deontas a fháil agus cothaíonn sé sin deacrachtaí sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>

Mar a dúirt mé cheana, níl sé beartaithe againn é a athrú i láthair na huaire.  Má tá an Ghaeilge ag na daltaí tá an £10 le bailiú acu.  Is é ceann de na coinníollacha maidir le deontais ná go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga an teaghlaigh, ach tuigim an pointe atá á dhéanamh ag an Teachta agus beidh mé sásta an cheist a scrúdú amach anseo.</P>

Ardaíodh é go dtí £5 sa bhliain 1946 agus arís go dtí £10 i 1965.  Mar a dúirt mé go minic, dá n-ardófaí é seo go dtí £15 nó go dtí £20, ní dóigh liom go gcuideodh sé an oiread sin.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the ban on the sale and distribution of bituminous coal in Dublin from 1 October, 1990, announced by my colleague the Minister for the Environment on 26 January 1990, my Department decided to survey the position regarding stocks and supplies of non-bituminous solid fuels as a matter of urgency. Following preliminary discussions with several operators in the solid fuels markets, I am endeavouring to establish with the importers that there will be adequate supplies of low-smoke solid fuels and other alternatives available by 1 October to meet the requirements of the Dublin region.  Further meetings will be held with <Col N="73" /> solid fuel suppliers over the summer to keep the situation under constant review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister looked at the price of these fuels that will become available?  Will he look at the evidence in the Eolas document published recently on the cost of heating fuels that there will be an increase of 50 per cent in the cost of winter fuels if we shift away from bituminous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is under continuous review at present in my Department and the other Departments concerned.  The Minister for the Environment has announced that £3 million will be made available in 1990 to ensure that costs arising from the burning of smokeless fuels will be minimised for low income groups.  I have no comment to make on the Eolas report at this stage.  I would like to have a look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister turn his attention to the question of prices? Will he agree that traditionally the bituminous coal industry have had very high margins that have not been available in smokeless fuels?  Will he agree there is danger of further increases in costs and that the £3 million provided by the Minister will go only a very little way to meet the needs, and that the cost will be of the order of £360 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We should all understand the scale of adjustments that will be necessary in the switching over to smokeless fuels.  There will be a shift to products which are new to the traditional coal user and it would be naive to expect there will be no difficulties in the changeover, but from the co-ordinated evidence of the Government Departments involved in this and the fuel suppliers, we will overcome these difficulties.  The money that has already been provided has been of the level of £3 million.  Discussions are continuing and the matter is being examined. It is a major step that has been taken.  It has the support of all parties here and of the community in general. <Col N="74" /> The Government will do everything possible to ensure that the additional cost burden does not fall on those who would suffer hardship trying to meet it.</P>

    <P>It is currently estimated that the <Col N="77" /> reserves from the two fields will be exhausted by the year 2002.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of building a gas pipeline to Britain, as I stated in the House in reply to Question No. 45 on 7 December last, I have given priority to the examination of long-term gas supplies, either by interconnector or as liquified natural gas, so that we will be in a position to make an early decision on the matter.  The Government have decided that now is the best time to tackle the extensive planning requirements that would precede a decision on a project of that size.</P>
    <P>A team drawn from my Department and Bord Gáis have been established and a consulting engineer has been retained to assist the group.  A number of meetings with British and continental interests have taken place and further contacts are planned.  It is intended that we will shortly have a clearer picture of which approach is best and we will then be in a position to begin negotiations for a gas supply and to start preparations for a pipeline contract.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that when planning for the project is sufficiently advanced, a formal application will be made for Community assistance.  Discussions have already taken place with the European Commission and already there is agreement in principle for EC part-financing of the necessary feasibility studies to be undertaken in advance of final decisions on the required capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; referred to in Deputy Mac Giolla's question, I assume he is referring to the gas sales agreement recently signed by Marathon Petroleum Ireland Limited and Bord Gáis Éireann.  This agreement is a confidential contract between the two parties and will not, therefore, be published. Royalty payments provided for in existing agreements with Marathon will apply to the Ballycotton gas field.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of extending the natural gas pipeline, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to the House on 7 December last on this issue.  In essence, the position is that further extensions to supply customers adjacent to the network <Col N="78" /> will continue to be undertaken only where it is commercially viable to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the Minister's statement that the known reserves may be exhausted by the year 2002, would the Minister clarify the purpose of the proposed pipeline to Britain? Is it for the purpose of exporting gas or importing gas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing gas supply network is dependent on a single gas pipeline coming from the gas head at Kinsale and Ballycotton to shore and on to Dublin, Dundalk and the various spurs.  It is a matter of crucial importance to give an assurance to gas customers that in the event of any breakdown in the pipeline there will be an alternative source of gas supply.  I consider the position of those customers to be vulnerable because of the lack of an alternative source of gas in the event of a major accident or breakdown.  If a decision is not to be made in regard to a gas interconnector to allow the import of gas in the event of its being required, or the export of gas in the event of an excess of gas being available here, then we will have to face a decision in regard to building reserve tanks in Dublin or elsewhere to hold liquified natural gas for use in the event of a breakdown.  It is a matter of ensuring continuity of supply to customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drilling programme is continuing and there are expectations of further successes. We may strike a larger gas well which would exceed the national demand and allow us to export in the future.  It is prudent to proceed with the preparation by way of design and arrangements for the construction of the pipeline as quickly as possible.  It could take four or five years before such a pipeline would be in place.  It is good, long-term energy planning to have a pipeline in place for the purposes I have mentioned and it is prudent to commence that work now.  We will also indicate to the Commission that we are proceeding with these arrangements. They are contributing financially to the feasibility study and this project <Col N="79" /> may qualify for substantial Structural Fund aid which is only available within a certain timespan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is absolutely essential that supplies be guaranteed to those who are availing of natural gas.  Has the Minister had any costings done in regard to the alternatives, the interconnector gas pipeline or the building of storage tanks for liquified gas?  Has he considered the security implications, in view of the fact that we have found it impossible to have an interconnector for electricity to the North?  It has been blown up on a couple of occasions and the matter has not been pursued since.  Does the Minister agree with the Minister for the Environment who has stated that he will allow the ESB to use natural gas as a fuel for their power stations?  In view of the shortage of supply does he think that should be continued?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether we should have an interconnector or liquified gas storage tanks is under consideration. The costings in regard to both will be carefully evaluated before final decisions are made.  These are the two options under consideration and the cost will largely determine which course of action is to be taken.  I know Deputy Mac Giolla is not suggesting that a gas interconnector between England and Ireland should be the subject of the types of attack that were mentioned.  This would be a sub-sea interconnection and it would be absolutely dastardly of anybody to consider interfering with it.  I am very concerned that the electricity interconnection between the 26 Counties and the Six has remained disconnected since about 1975.  It is a matter I am anxious to have fully considered and I arranged for it to be raised recently between ourselves and the British authorities. It is a sad reflection on the attitude <Col N="80" /> of groups living on this island that they should seek to deny people living on both sides of the Border the economic benefit that would result from such an electricity interconnection.  I hope that wiser counsel will prevail and that consideration can be given to the reconnection.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>the initiatives he proposes to take in light of findings clearly linking Sellafield with childhood leukaemia; and, in particular, if he has reconsidered his decision to abandon the proposal of his predecessor to mount a challenge in the international courts against practices of the British nuclear industry.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The recently published study by Professor Gardiner in the UK is a source of grave concern and appears to have serious and indeed tragic implications for the workers at Sellafield and for their children.  The study again draws attention to the drawbacks of nuclear energy and the risks to health and safety associated with nuclear generation.</P>
      <P>As regards legal action, I must clarify that at no time did my predecessor propose to take legal action.  His position was that if a case could be established he would take legal action.  To this end he asked the Attorney General for advice on the possibility for legal action.  The Attorney General examined the question in some detail, and came to the conclusion that at present there is no scope to take a case against Sellafield.  My position is exactly that of my predecessor &mdash; if there is a case, the Government will take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that under the directive of 1976 member states are obliged to eliminate pollution of waters by substances proven to carcinogenic?  Would he not agree that this latest study has underlined the fact that there is a clear link between leukaemia, a form of cancer, and radiation activity in Sellafield?  Would he not further agree that his suggestion that this is <Col N="81" /> solely confined to workers in somewhat disingenuous since low level radiation is continually being put into the Irish Sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is intermingling a lot of different matters.  Professor Gardiner's report did not deal with discharges into the Irish Sea; it referred to excessive doses of radiation that workers in the Sellafield plant were exposed to and the consequent medical effect on them.  His findings are being examined and they will be closely examined here.  They raise very serious questions about how much we know, or do not know, about the effect of nuclear energy and the radiation from it.  The Deputy knows there has been a very dramatic fall off in the discharges into the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>The point at issue in regard to taking a legal case remains.  Until such time that I can be satisfied a case can be taken, and that there is a case to answer in law, I would have no business taking such a case.  I have explained that here previously. Because I state the factual position, there is the political temptation to turn it around, as if I was not taking as strong a stand as anybody else on Sellafield, which of course is just not true.  If Deputy Bruton or anybody else can show me how we can successfully bring a case against the Sellafield authorities or against British Nuclear Fuels Limited, and if the Attorney General here is satisfied. I would be the first to request the Government to take appropriate action.</P>

      <P>The Government's decision related solely to Poulaphouca and was taken because of the Government's concern to ensure the maintenance of the existing good water quality standards at the reservoir which serves the greater Dublin area.  It was the Government's opinion that it was not appropriate that the ESB should continue to have intensive fish farming activities located in the major reservoir supplying the greater Dublin city area.  I understand from public reaction that there was wide scale public support for that decision by the Government.</P>
      <P>The other part of the Government's decision at that time was to establish a working group to examine all fresh water fish farming activities in both the public and private sectors.  It was arranged that the ESB would participate as members of that working group but, quite separately, they made their own decision to withdraw from other locations where they had fish farming activities.  They did not do so on the direction of Government or on any direction from me; they made their own decision in the matter.</P>

I am sure that all sides of the House will agree that there is great public concern and that the issue requires great examination so that we can put in place a proper national policy in this area, rather than allowing the present situation to continue.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that &ldquo;Euratom&rdquo; does not exist as a separate entity, and it is, therefore, impossible to refer anything to &ldquo;Euratom&rdquo;. The Euratom Treaty deals with all aspects of atomic energy within the EC.  If the Deputy is asking whether the Euratom Treaty has been examined to see whether scope for closure of the magnox stations exists within the Treaty, <Col N="88" /> I can assure him that it has been closely examined by the Attorney General's Office, and that the Treaty does not offer such scope.  The major difficulty with the Treaty from our viewpoint appears to be that it gives the Commission very limited powers in relation to individual stations.</P>
      <P>Because of this difficulty, our approach to the problem of the operation of magnox reactors to the UK has to be on two fronts: firstly, their inclusion in the nuclear safety work of the EC.  In this regard we have succeeded in getting these reactors specifically dealt with in the Commission work on technological problems of nuclear safety.  Secondly, on a bilateral level, we have put pressure on the UK to close these reactors.  Ireland is not a lone voice in this regard.  There is a widely held view that old magnox reactors cannot achieve modern safety standards.  Long term safety reviews being carried out by the UK's regulatory body have led to the closure of one magnox power station, Bradwell in Kent. I am optimistic that further closures will take place because of the difficulties associated with this type of plant and I will continue to work towards Ireland's objective of closure of all magnox reactors as soon as possible.</P>

Under Article 37, they are obliged to notify the Commission of any plans to dispose, which would have implications for other countries in the possible contamination of water, soil or air.

      <P>Every available opportunity has been taken by me since coming to office, and by my predecessors, and our efforts have been well publicised. Ministers from all parties in this Department have been active in bringing the concern of the Irish people to the attention of the British authorities with regard to these nuclear stations.  Only as recently as yesterday, at the European Parliament Energy Committee, I made Ireland's position quite clear and a fortnight before that, at a meeting with the British ambassador, I clearly expressed our Government's views in this matter.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has availed of numerous opportunities to bring the Irish Government's views to the attention of the British Government and our views are well known internationally with regard to nuclear stations.  It is only the combined pressure from ourselves and other groups in other countries that will ensure that action will be taken eventually. The best approach would be for the Commission to exercise their rights under the Euratom agreement to establish a European-wide inspectorate which hopefully would produce the evidence under which some kind of a legal case might be taken eventually.  Because of the age of some of these stations and the bad record of accidents which have been amply recorded in various surveys by British authorities, we are very concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the relatively recent development of forestry in Ireland and, more particularly, the minor role played by the private sector until the last few years, it is scarcely surprising that the market for semi-mature forests is not yet fully developed.  While I have yet to be convinced that stamp duty is a major dis-incentive for the sale of semi-mature forest, a number of people have approached me on the matter expressing their concern.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, examining the matter and would welcome any evidence which the Deputy or others may have of the adverse effects of stamp duty on this market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the Minister's reply.  At least an examination on the effect of stamp duty will be undertaken. It is a major inhibition to the establishment of the semi-mature market to which more farmers could be attracted. Would the Minister not agree that there is a need to expand this area of planting rapidly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an ever-growing interest on the part of farmers in participating in the private planting of trees. That is generously supported now by the State through forest premium payments to farmers on an annual basis and through the generous planting grants.  I am anxious to achieve the Government's planting targets and I support the Deputy's point of view that to achieve that it is important that a market in semi-mature trees should flourish here so that those in the private sector who invested in forestry could see that they had an asset which could be traded when the plantation came to its semi-mature state. If there are any matters in the taxation <Col N="91" /> field which would seriously inhibit the development of that market, as I said in my reply I will be very happy to look at them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 35, 44, 47, 50, 70 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>In November 1989 I met a deputation from the Arigna action committee who represent the Arigna miners and the power station workers where their concerns for the future of the mines and their future employment prospects were discussed.  I am fully aware of the almost total dependency of the local economy on coal mining activities.  However, it is widely recognised that the reserves of main seam coal are nearing exhaustion and the eventual cessation of mining activities is inevitable.  A task force has, therefore, been established to look into alternative employment options in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention that a permanent secretariat will be assigned to the task <Col N="93" /> force in order that they can report to me and make solid recommendations within six months.  The task force are under the chairmanship of the Roscommon county manager.  The rest of the task force comprise the Leitrim and Sligo county managers representatives from Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo county development teams, Department of Industry and Commerce, Tourism and my Department. There are also representatives from the IDA, FÁS, Teagasc, Coillte Teoranta, the Central Development Committee, ESB, Ireland West and the tourism manager and the regional manager of CTT Sligo.  The task force will be reporting their findings to me.  The question of possible State contributions and measures which may be necessary to implement the task force's recommendations can be examined at that stage.</P>
    <P>Because of uncertainty as to the quality and quantity of possible coal reserves I have instructed the Geological Survey Office to carry out an additional survey of the coal reserves at Arigna to get an accurate assessment of the usable reserves.  They will be reported back to me within six weeks.</P>
    <P>In order to give the task force the necessary breathing space to complete their job and so that the implications of the results of the geological survey's work can be evaluated, the ESB have agreed to continue to accept coal supplies from the local mines for the next six months.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has made an approach to the EC Commission arguing that a strong case exists to have Arigna included in the RECHAR programme as an exceptional case.  The Commission's response is still awaited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that RECHAR may not apply to communities where there were fewer than 1,000 workers.  Has the Minister heard that and, if so, will he comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the RECHAR programme would confine assistance to areas where there is a minimum eligibility threshold of 1,000 people for combined job losses and jobs at risk <Col N="94" /> in the area affected since 1984.  On this basis Arigna would not qualify as actual and projected job losses since 1984 amount to no more than approximately 300 between mining operations and associated electricity production.  As I said in my reply, the Department of Finance have been in touch with the Commission pointing out that a strong case exists for making an exception of Arigna but the Commission has not yet formally responded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>People employed in the State and semi-State sectors seem to be in a majority on the task force and there seems to be an absence of representation from the private sector.  Is it the Minister's intention to employ some of these people in the State sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The remit of the task force is to seek alternative employment in the region for those who it is known will, in the short or medium term, become redundant because the stock of coal will run out.  That is inevitable.  We are discussing how much usable and viable coal is left to the economics of the power station.  Coal is the main factor and we are trying to establish whether there are certain levels of usable, viable coal left.  The task force are a fairly powerful group as they comprise many State agencies who will make a major contribution.  I thought that the Deputy would have asked why there were no representatives of the workers or unions on the task force.  If there is an extension of the membership I would be happy to take the Deputy's suggestions on board. The task force are trying to identify industries which could be established in this region to create the level of employment which obviously will be required when the power station and the mine close down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given the task force any indication that Government equity might be involved because that would colour the direction of their research for alternative activities?  Did <Col N="95" /> the Minister not make earlier representations on the question of the RECHAR programme which is now agreed and in operation?  If we want to have Arigna included the Minister should have sought its inclusion last year before the programme was agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are Commission-approved guidelines.  In regard to special assistance being made available, all I can say &mdash; and I said this in the Seanad and other places &mdash; is that the Government recognise the huge social upheaval which will be caused in the Roscommon-Leitrim-Sligo area in general arising from the eventual close-down of the mine and the power station.  The Government have indicated their willingness to consider in a very generous way any worthwhile proposals that emerge which may need special assistance.  However, it is not possible to go into detail until one sees the results of the work of the task force and what proposals they will make.  Assistance could take many different forms and it would be premature at this stage to indicate anything in the line of financial special incentives other than to say that the Government are very concerned and are very willing to help any worthwhile proposals coming from the task force or indeed from any other sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to commit his Department to support <Col N="96" /> the proposed wood pulp industry as an alternative for employment in the mine in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have identified the need for a third pulp wood industry which would be a major capital investment.  It is required because of the increasing uptake from our forests, all of which we would not be able to absorb in our present factories.  There is a need for a third major pulp wood industry and the promoters of that project will largely determine where they want to locate it. This is not being handled by my Department but by the Industrial Development Authority.  We recognise that the major source of supply for such a new industry resides in the north-west region and the location preferred by my Department would be north-west.</P>

The House should offer its congratulations to the staff of the ESB on achieving the level of cost efficiencies within their organisation which have allowed over a period of two years for the imposition of a 10 per cent rate of VAT without any resulting price increase across the board.  That was a major achievement and, as Minister for Energy, I should like to extend my congratulations to everybody involved in the ESB.  They enabled us achieve that happy move.</P>

      <P>At present the only ESB power stations planned for closure are Allenwood on 31 March 1991 and Arigna on 31 December 1992.  No other stations are planned for closure at this stage and peat fired stations will continue in operation as long as stocks last and there are no major capital investments required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister's reply implying that the ESB will not be reinvesting in their peat capacity to allow peat to be burned beyond the next ten years when it is expected that their capacity will no longer be up to scratch?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that at <Col N="100" /> present &mdash; I am careful to say that &mdash; the peat fired stations will continue so long as stocks last and so long as there is no requirement for new heavy capital investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the life expectancy of peat outstrips the life expectancy of the peat burning stations and that without reinvestment by the ESB Bord na Móna will have to dramatically cut back on their activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The Deputy is being premature in making those suggestions.  The plant is in first class order, as I understand it, and there does not seem to be any need in the immediate future for heavy capital investment.  If that arises it will be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has had any consultations with the ESB regarding the post-peat era in terms of usage of that fuel by the ESB and the likely consequences for employment. Has the Minister carried out any investigations into that?  Has he had any consultations with the ESB and Bord na Móna on what is likely to happen in terms of job replacement when the station in Allenwood is decommissioned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that this is principally a matter for the ESB.  From their record one can see that they have always had great concern for their employees.  I have no doubt that if problems arise the Deputy will make us aware of them.  To date, I have not been asked to deal with any problem.  If there is one that I am not aware of I would be happy to hear about it from the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Only if I consider it to be a matter of absolute necessity.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>At about a quarter past midnight this morning the UK Coastguard at Falmouth informed MRCC Shannon that the Singapore registered general cargo vessel, the 10,000 tonne gross registered <i>Toledo</i> had sent out a distress message. The vessel was taking water and requested immediate assistance.  The vessel was positioned about 250 nautical miles south-west of Mizen Head in the <Col N="102" /> United Kingdom Search and Rescue region.</P>
      <P>MRCC Shannon arranged for the opening of Cork Airport to refuel the RAF Sea King helicopter based at Brawdy.  Two merchant vessels, the <i>Bow Fortune</i> and the <i>Lahiz</i> stood by the vessel in distress.  At 6 a.m. this morning the RAF helicopter took all 20 crew safely off the vessel and ferried them to Cork where they arrived about 7.30 a.m.  At the time of abandonment the vessel was at about 150 nautical miles south-west of Mizen Head.  Its engines were stopped but its navigation and deck lights were left on.</P>
      <P>The vessel is carrying a cargo of 14,000 tonnes standard grade potash fertiliser. It was bound from St. John, New Brunswick, Canada, to Frederika, Denmark. This is not a hazardous cargo in terms of its impact on marine life.  The vessel has 310 tonnes of heavy fuel oil and 100 tonnes of diesel.  There are no reports of any oil leaks.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service vessel, LE <i>Deirdre</i> and the tug <i>Samson</i> are making for the vessel.  The expected time of arrival of the LE <i>Deirdre</i> and the tug is early tomorrow morning.  I have asked the Air Corps to monitor the movement of the ship with its fishery patrol aircraft and this is being done.  At quarter past noon today the vessel was 135 nautical miles south-west of Mizen Head and drifting north-east at a rate of two knots.</P>
      <P>I have contacted the managers of this vessel and asked them to state their intentions with regard to it.  Unlike the recent incident involving the MV <i>Tribulus</i>, there is neither a direct risk to life nor an immediate threat of pollution from this vessel.</P>
      <P>I will consider what action should be taken in the light of developments as they emerge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Minister's reply and in view of the fact that the master of the vessel indicated on radio at 1 o'clock that he was heading for Bantry Bay at the time of abandonment, would he not agree that a cargo of potash, plus the diesel and heavy fuel oil which <Col N="103" /> she is carrying would pose a major threat to environment on our coastline?  Does the Minister not agree that Bantry Bay has now become the soft target for crippled bulk carries in the south Atlantic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the diesel is concerned, it is a pollution hazard; as far as the potash is concerned, it is not.  No decision has been taken with regard to receiving the ship in Bantry Bay.  From my point of view it is quite a different problem when no life is at risk than if life were at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the nature of the damage to this ship?  It would appear that the damage is fairly extensive as the crew had to be lifted off.  Can the Minister say if the ship is in danger of breaking up? What is the extent of the damage to the ship?  What is its condition?  Has he received any report on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the damage is a 10 metre by 3 metre hole on the port side. When the captain abandoned the ship that hole was full of water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions for the Minister, and perhaps I can put them together.  Does the Minister understand the apprehension of the people in Bantry Bay and along the south-west coast of the danger of the area becoming a graveyard for disabled ships?  He will recall the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> the <i>Bardini Reefer</i> and the more recent case of the <i>Tribulus.</i> Would he agree that such a development would be entirely unacceptable? Does the Minister see the need for new legislation to give more control over such vessels which enter our waters? Are there maritime conventions to which we are signatories which have not yet been given the force of law in this country and which, if ratified, would strengthen our hand in dealing with such situations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the apprehension, as mentioned by the Deputy, is well based.  I would like to assure the people of Bantry Bay that the greatest <Col N="104" /> possible care will be taken by my Department and the Department of Defence to protect the environment and the coast in that particular area.  In all modesty I can say that the <i>Tribulus</i> incident has been handled with great care and with great success.  Whenever there is a question of life and death we have an obligation.  I think the people of this country in general would not forgive anybody, Minister or not, if all care was not taken to preserve human life.  With regard to the question the Deputy asked about Conventions I have ready and I hope to bring before the House legislation on sea pollution in this session.  That will deal with some of the Conventions the Deputy mentioned.</P>

      <P>I would like to know if the Minister and his Department are familiar with the recent report issued by the International Maritime Organisation in which they have expressed concern about the standard of ships which are plying in the waters, many of which are described as very clapped out vessels unfit to be at sea. In view of the number of cases we have now had of ship break-ups, leaks and so on, does he consider that any international initiative, perhaps through the EC Presidency, would be justified?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) the form of notice to be served under section 14,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with the regulations which the Minister may make under the Bill. Section 14 deals with situations where local authorities can offset any claim for compensation by giving an undertaking that permission may be given to a development of a different kind.  I do not see anywhere in the Bill a provision under which section 14 notices might be served or any regulations which would govern that.  I believe this is the appropriate section under which to empower the Minister to make regulations setting out the form of notice under which section 14 notices would be served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in identifying the need to permit regulations in relation to the form of notice under section 14.  This notice would be one indication that land is capable of other <Col N="144" /> developments for which planning permission ought to be granted.  However, section 14 already takes cognisance of this point and refers to the notice being served in such form as may be prescribed. By virtue of the provisions in section 1 (3) of this Bill, section 2 of the 1963 Act, the interpretation section, applies also to this Bill.  This defines the term &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; as meaning prescribed by regulations made by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put on record my concern in relation to the capacity of the Department of the Environment to produce regulations which would give considerable substance to the intent of legislation and a delay in that capacity by the failure to have the proper, effective or conclusive consultation with the relevant bodies involved.  In this instance &mdash; it will rise also in regard to the details of the First Schedule &mdash; since we are specifically talking about the form of compensation and disputes as to the value of that compensation, for example, the antecedent value, the actual loss incurred, etc., the way in which the professions are facilitated in giving effect to this legislation will be determined by regulations written long after this House, the other House, or indeed the third House &mdash; that is, the office of An tUachtarán &mdash; have enacted the Bill.  I should like the Minister to put on the record &mdash; so that he is not unnecessarily embarrassed in a year and a half's time by questions similar to those which might be asked in regard to the Multistorey Dwellings Act &mdash; that there will not be a delay in the operation of the Bill because of a difficulty about agreement in regard to the forms which are required under regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn that we should get on with this Bill.  That was the intention in agreeing earlier to Deputy Shatter's amendment about the <Col N="145" /> bringing of the legislation into effect as soon as possible.  It is interesting to note that the question of valuation rules will not require the making of regulations.  It is useful to remember this in order to put the Deputy's point in perspective.  This is set out in the First Schedule, so the point the Deputy made in this regard is accommodated in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point the Minister made.  The rules in relation to how valuation is calculated are one thing &mdash; they are quite clear and are set out in the First Schedule, and we will deal with this when we come to it &mdash; but the precise form in which claims for compensation are to be made is another matter.  I should like to be constructive in order to facilitate the speedy passage of this Bill through the House today.  There is no reason, in principle, why we cannot finish Committee Stage today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a procedural matter. Because of what we agreed here this day week in regard to bringing the legislation into effect it necessarily means that I cannot delay when it comes to the format of claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister cannot delay but I am anxious to ensure that the final form of the regulations will be operated by a relatively small number of people.  In all probability a claim will be served in the first instance on the relevant local authority either by a solicitor or a valuer.  The form of that compensation claim and the way it is set out by regulation would be critical to the way the compensation claim will be argued.  If the relatively small number of people who will have to make this legislation are not satisfied or feel in some way inhibited by the format of the regulations and by the various forms, then our intention as legislators could be frustrated by the activities of civil servants. That is my point and I think the Minister knows the background to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment No. 72 is related to amendment No. 18.  I propose, therefore, with the agreement of the House to take amendments Nos. 18 and 72 together for discussion purposes.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18.</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) No person shall be entitled to compensation in cases where permission for the alteration or removal of a structure is refused or is granted subject to conditions and where the said structure is protected under the National Monuments Acts, 1934 to 1987, and where the payment of compensation is precluded under those Acts.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>One of the principles which the Minister has set out for this Bill is that where compensation is precluded under another Act it should not be payable under this Bill and there should be no question of any second bite at compensation.  As we know, compensation is specifically precluded under the National Monuments Acts in certain cases and it is desirable that it should be expressly written into this Bill that where compensation is precluded under the National Monuments Acts, it should not be possible to obtain compensation under this legislation.  That is the intention of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The quick answer is that there will be no double payments, even in cases where compensation might be payable under the terms of different legislation.  I think that is what the Deputy is trying to ensure.  Amendment <Col N="147" /> No. 72 proposes that development may be refused without compensation on the grounds that it would injure or interfere with a historic monument, either formally entered in the Register of Historical Monuments or situated near a designated archaeological area.  The 1963 Planning Act already gives non-compensatable status to conditions imposed to preserve archaeological features and objects regardless of whether these are formally recognised under the National Monuments Acts.  This provision is retained in paragraph 17 of the Fourth Schedule.  However up to now a refusal, as distinct from conditioning, of planning permission to preserve archaeological features has not been of itself a non-compensatable reason.  Amendment No. 72 will remedy this.  The Deputy's amendment has much the same purpose which will be achieved by the Fourth Schedule and amendment No. 72.  I prefer amendment No. 72 as it is more precisely related to the conservation arrangements provided for under the National Monuments Acts, 1934 and 1987.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to make the section more internally consistent as well as to reflect more accurately the provisions of section 72 of the 1963 Act which this section substantially restates.  It is clear from the body of section 10 (1) that a compensation statement is to be prepared only in cases involving a refusal, conditioning, revocation or modification of planning permission.  However, the preamble to subsection (1) carries a wider reference to any claim for compensation under this Bill.  This will include the several unusual categories of compensation claims provided for by Part IV of the Bill as well as the more standard class arising from the refusal of permission and so on, which are dealt with in Part IV.  It was not the intention, as the body of section 10 (1) makes clear, to include the less usual forms of compensation in this section any more than it was under the 1963 <Col N="149" /> Act.  The amendment will confirm the more limited application of the section.</P>

Amendments Nos. 28 and 30 are regarded as consequential on amendment No. 29.  I will say to Deputy Gilmore slowly what is proposed.  It is proposed to take amendments Nos. 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 together for the purposes of discussion.  Separate questions may be put.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are concerned mainly with providing a stricter and more clearcut application of the basic rule contained in section 11.  Where compensation has been paid in respect of land no subsequent gainful development may be carried out on that land without repayment of the compensation to the planning authority. Section 11, as it stands, largely reenacts section 73 of the 1963 Act.  This contains various qualifications of and <Col N="150" /> exceptions to the basic rule I have just stated, some of them involving the exercise of discretion by the Minister for the Environment.  The amendments now proposed will dispense with these qualifications and exceptions.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 will remove the 14-year limitation on the right of the planning authority to recover compensation. Instead, compensation will from now on be recoverable indefinitely upon subsequent gainful development of land.  I understand that this is supported by Deputies Quinn and Gilmore who have tabled similar amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendments No. 26, 27 and 29 will remove two discretionary powers from the Minister, the power to apply section 11 beyond the stated classes of development specified in section 14 (2) and the power to waive the clawback requirement in particular cases.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 28 and 30 are entirely consequential on these substantive amendments.  These matters were raised by various Deputies on Second Stage who asked me to include them.  I think they are now adequately covered by these new arrangements.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my appreciation that the Minister in tidying up the section has accepted that there will be no time limit on the recovery of moneys paid by way of compensation in the event of subsequent development taking place on the land.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Quinn, I welcome the Minister's amendment.  The 14-year rule under the existing legislation on planning gave rise to much public concern. People could see, even though compensation was paid, that the entire process could be restarted after a period of 14 years.  Even though the public may have paid out a very large sum of money, as they did in some cases which were <Col N="151" /> referred to earlier in the debate, this did not commit the developer or landowner for all time and it was still open to them after a period of 14 years to come back and restart the process.  I very much welcome the amendment which eliminates one area which has been the source of considerable public disquiet.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 22, after &ldquo;statement&rdquo; to insert, together with interest,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the repayment of compensation to the local authority. I am seeking to ensure that if and when compensation is repaid to the local authority, it is repaid with interest.  It seems that there is an anomalous situation at present.  On the one hand, the payment of compensation by the local authority must be with interest where that payment is delayed for whatever reason.  We have a practical example of that, the case of Grange Developments, where the compensation award had to be paid with interest which increased the total amount to about £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently Dublin County Council passed a material contravention motion the effect of which would be that a new development could take place on the <Col N="152" /> same lands and in return for that the compensation which had been paid would be repaid to the county council. However, the repayment to the country council would be without interest and, under the agreement being entered, would, as I understand it, be paid on a phased basis related to the development of the site.  In this case the new planning application for the Montgorry lands is for 508 houses.  That development could take place over a protracted period of time. The compensation, therefore, may well lose its value over that period of time.  It could be seven or eight years before the development is completed and before Dublin County Council would receive the last instalment of the repayment of the compensation.  In that situation Dublin County Council would be at the loss of the interest which would have accrued on the amount of compensation in the first place.  The irony is that they would be at the loss of that interest having already had to pay interest on the compensation in the first place.  That anomaly should be eliminated in the legislation.  It should be quite clear that where compensation is to be repaid to the State it should be repaid with interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 24 proposes to add interest to the amount of planning compensation to be repaid under the section upon subsequent redevelopment of land in respect of which compensation has been paid.  Section 11 already provides for payment of interest, in subsection (7), but only in the context of permitting the developer to discharge his liability to the planning authority in instalments.  In other words, they can get interest if the compensation is paid in instalments.  In strict justice, the amendment is warranted; but previous amendments have already strengthened section 11 considerably.  From a practical point of view, I would be concerned that this amendment on top of the other amendments could create a situation where we, the legislators, would be ensuring the permanent sterilisation of certain lands regardless of future planning merits.  The section is strong enough as it is.  To put <Col N="153" /> it bluntly, there is no interest on a lump sum, but when it is paid in instalments interest is permissible and available under existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not quite meet what the amendment is seeking.  I appreciate that in cases where the repayment is by instalments that the instalments will attract interest.  That is an improvement, but it does not deal with the situation where the first payment might not be for several years after the payment of the compensation in the first case.  Let us say that a local authority pay out compensation in 1990 and the proposed development does not actually take place until the year 2000.  Will the ten-year interval be taken account of in calculating interest?  As I understand it, the Minister is saying it would not, that all that would happen in that situation is that the second payment would attract interest over the year between the first and second payment.  There could, in that situation, be a very considerable loss to the local authority which would have paid out money and be unable to recover the real value of the money.  If the Minister's best prognosis for the economy is borne out it may not be an enormous problem over the next year or two; but if inflation were to resume at a level that we have known it to be, then it would be a very considerable problem.  If interest rates rise as expected there would be a very considerable loss to the local authority concerned.</P>
      <P>There is an issue here and the issue is that the full amount should be repaid with interest.  The principle of repayment is correct.  If the local authority pay out compensation for a plot of ground where there is a refusal of planning permission and development is subsequently allowed on that, the principle of repaying the compensation is absolutely correct.  This principle, however, is very substantially undermined if the repayment is without interest because what is repaid to the local authority might bear little relation to the real value of what the local authority had to pay out in the first place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point, but we think this will not arise ever again, so it is a hypotechical situation.  On the other hand, the local authority may get nothing at all if nobody seeks planning permission for development on that piece of ground.  That transaction would, therefore, be finished.  We are talking about a new set of circumstances and it may very well be that the developer or subsequent developers, after a change of ownership, could have disposed of that money in some other way and are not in a position to go on with the development even though the development was desirable under a new change of attitude on the part of the planning authority in regard to zoning or whatever.  We thought about this for a long time and about the equity of the thing to all sides.  If somebody wants to phase in repayments they will have to pay interest on it from day one; there is no argument there.  We felt, however, that if it is repaid in a straight lump sum some years down the road or whatever, all we could ask for was that. I had some difficulty myself with this for a while but having thought about it I consider that this is the most equitable way of doing it.</P>

      <P>Let us be clear about what we are saying.  There is a touch here of what is sauce for the goose not necessarily being sauce for the gander.  That was Deputy Gilmore's concern.  We are talking about a situation where a person owns land, applies for planning permission and is refused it for some reason that is compensatable, and gets money related to the actual loss incurred or based on some calculation of the additional value of the property had planning permission been granted.  At all times they retain ownership and use of the property.  They also get a sum of money paid in a lump sum to compensate them for that loss of additional value which, under the law of the land, they would have been refused permission by the local authority because the local authority considered that a development of that nature should not occur at that time.  That person takes that lump sum <Col N="155" /> and invests it, and it attracts interest and has the capacity to increase in value if put to prudent use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Or it goes down.  If you bank it in formal terms, in Government gilts for example, and if the rate of interest is higher than the rate of inflation it maintains its value at worst, and will possibly increase.  If at some future date there is a change in the development plan and in arrangements generally, for example, the designated area is extended to that area, and that person now wants to develop and we have removed the 14-year prohibition in relation to it, it is not unreasonable to say the person was compensated in the past, he got a lump sum of a certain amount and in order to release this land back into the development area it has now a charge on it which is the amount of the compensation plus interest.</P>
      <P>The intent of Deputy Gilmore's amendment is to give some adjustment to historic values to bring them up to contemporary values.  He has not prescribed current interest rates or prevailing interest rates.  The interest could be negotiated.  The rate of interest to be applied does not necessarily have to be the prevailing bank rate interest or the interest rate that would be used retrospectively if we were in arbitration at present.  What is being asked here is an admission of principle.  The Minister in his first intervention indicated that in subsection (7) of this section he felt this area had been covered somewhat.  Perhaps that was inadvertently misleading.</P>

      <P>It is not necessarily the same thing.  This is complex and I do not want to attribute wrong motives to anybody.  If somebody owns property and wants to add to its value by way of a planning permission, and is refused that planning permission by the local community through the local authority because in their wisdom they have decided in the greater interest not to grant that planning permission and to compensate that person by way of cash, if at some stage in the future the person is given planning permission to develop and add to the value of that property, the person should be required to pay back some form of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering it I was arguing in that direction.  Only taking the totality of equity a situation could arise where somebody was compensated for the ground and through no fault of their own invested the money the wrong way and because of the desirability in the opinion of the planning authority to have the land developed that person would not then be in a position to accommodate the demand if it included the interest.  I thought the person would certainly have to pay back what they had got but adding the extra could very well sterilise it.  It is a narrow point but I want to cover it in total equity to every situation that might arise.  For that reason I found it difficult to write it in to cover the point the Deputy made.  However, I went along with the Deputy when I said that in strict justice the amendment was warranted.  I put that on the record.  I wanted the Deputy to leave it at that.  I was sympathetic to the view but I could see circumstances where it might not achieve the equity one would expect in fair play.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue Deputy Gilmore has raised I raised in Dublin County Council when we had the recent planning application before us in respect of the lands for which Grange Developments had been in receipt of £2 million.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong. The problem we had in Dublin County <Col N="157" /> Council was apparently that the manager, on foot of a planning permission that was being granted by, in effect, the support of the Fianna Fáil majority group on the council, was taking the view that instead of requiring the entire £2 million to be paid back before development commenced, he would allow it to be paid on some unspecified instalment basis without interest attaching.  Under the current law it seemed he could not attach interest if he was agreeing instalments.  The developers purchased this land from Grange Developments, no doubt at a discount because of the planning difficulties they were going to experience but, no doubt, also aware they were going to have to pay out £2 million if they got a planning permission, which I believe they should not have got; they have got it now and so be it although An Bord Pleanála may take a different view.  It seemed ludicrous that, when the council had paid out interest on the original amount, public funds of £2 million could continue to be retained over an extended time after the permission was granted, the permission being granted automatically increasing the value of the land and possibly allowing the developers to simply sell on the land without building a single house on it.  If you were going to agree to an instalment basis system and that interest should be imposed, my view was that if the local authority were going to grant the planning permission the best approach would be for them to indicate that the planning permission would be forthcoming, having decided that it would be, planning wise, a correct decision, but the formal written grant of permission would issue only after the full compensation was repaid.  Because of the possibility of the simple sell on of lands at increased values that should be considered.  I am happy that the Minister has incorporated the interest provision here in the context of instalments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mixed views about the debate that has been taking place about this matter.  My gut reaction is that a potential developer has received compensation, the accumulated interest should be paid back to the local authority, but I am <Col N="158" /> conscious that the circumstances under which compensation awards should be made under this legislation is far more limited than has been the case up to now. I was one of the people who advocated getting rid of this 14 year provision whereby no compensation was to be paid back 14 years and one month after the original decision was made.  That seemed equally ludicrous.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with what Deputy Gilmore is saying.  Let us assume for a minute that we have a piece of land in respect of which some compensation is properly paid under the new legislation and about which none of us can raise a great issue because it appears justified that compensation is paid.  Let us assume that planning wise 30 years later there has been a very considerable change that indicates that it would be appropriate to grant a planning permission to do something in that piece of land that heretofore could not be undertaken.  If we attach interest to the compensation repayment, having removed the 14 year bar, the amount of compensation that might have to be repaid &mdash; I think one of these amendments refers to the current rate of judgment mortgages which is 11 per cent, and I am open to correction on that &mdash; could be so much away outside the values of those lands that you really would freeze the land.</P>
    <P>There is a problem here.  What goes against the grain is the idea that a local authority might lay out money and maybe two or three years later grant a permission and not be able to recoup interest.  I can see that in different circumstances two or three decades later it would be inequitable to impose an interest requirement.  I am wondering whether there is a midway between, whereby if within a limited specified period a planning permission was granted the interest would be recoupable whether the repayment was made as a lump sum or on an instalment basis.  If you go beyond an extremely long time, there could hardly be a question of people tricking around with a planning process. It is difficult to envisage someone making <Col N="159" /> a compensatory claim today in the expectation of bringing off a planning coup in 25 years' time.  Nobody operates on that basis.  Is there a middle course that the Minister might consider?</P>

      <P>We are trying to take them out successively.  I am glad we will not have to go down that road.  It was purely a matter of equity for certain individuals. Deputy Shatter has mentioned a few.  In the new circumstances where compensation can be paid at all it is really in the case of down-zoning which is deliberately done for a specific purpose of the planning authority.  We all agree that people should get compensation in those circumstances.  It will have to be something which the planning authority themselves will alter in five, ten, or 50 year's time.  I would have liked to accommodate them in some way, but how is this to be done unless it is pegged to some index? This might mean megabucks and might sterilise a development the planning authority would be demanding.  I did not want to get into any hassle by providing that if a person carried out a development within ten years, he would have to pay 8 per cent.  I was sympathetic towards the notion if it could be confined, but I decided it would not be fair when one considers the doubling or trebling of the original compensation over many years and the demand of the local authority to change the zoning to accommodate their planning purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was beginning to hope earlier that the Minister was somewhat favourably disposed towards the idea but for some reason had decided not to accept the amendment.  His opinion is beginning to harden against the amendment as the discussion goes on.  I am not sure that I share his concern.  I see the point if the development does not take place for 30 years and the land is frozen, but that is <Col N="160" /> such a remote possibility that to reject the amendment on that ground alone is stretching things a little too far, particularly when the local authority have a certain amount of discretion in the matter.  If in 30 year's time a development becomes so desirable that the local authority agree it should go ahead, there are certain options open to the local authority that could accommodate the situation.</P>
      <P>The fundamental problem is that as things stand the local authority pay out compensation with interest.  The Grange Developments award attracted interest of between £200,000 and £300,000.  If there is a delay in payment, the local authority must pay interest as well but where a development is to go ahead, permission is granted and the amount is to be repaid to the local authority, the only amount repayable is the original sum, regardless of the intervening years, and interest will only arise if it is paid on an instalment basis.  When the local authority pay out money it is paid from funds they could use for the improvement of their area and the provision of services. If they are repaid their money 30 years later, the amount will be so small in relation to what they have paid out in real terms that it completely negatives the purpose of this section and the principle of repayment.  I do not understand some of the logic.</P>
      <P>During the course of the lively debate on the question of the way in which compensation should be calculated, I made the point that it should be calculated on an actual loss basis.  The Minister stated that the compensation would be attached to the land and that the circumstances of the landowner would not be taken into account.  We must be consistent.  If that is the case and the local authority pay out a certain amount of money for land, presumably the landowner will use that money.  I do not know very many developers who stuff money into a mattress.</P>

On the question of interest, with which the Minister seems to have a certain degree of familiarity, there is no justification for leaving a period of time within which interest would not be repaid to the local authority.

      <P>I move amendment No.25:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where the planning authority decide under section 26 of the Principal Act to grant a permission they shall not make the grant until such amount (if any) as is recoverable under this section in respect of the compensation specified in the statement, together with interest, has been paid or secured to the satisfaction of the planning authority.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to the issue we were talking about, the question of the money being repaid with interest.  It also provides that permission should not be granted until the local authority has secured the repayment.  There is a danger against which the Bill must provide, although I accept that the likelihood of this arising would be remote.  We spent a long time this morning talking about strange happenings in the area of planning. We have to protect against a situation whereby a local authority would grant a planning permission and not have secured the repayment of the compensation which is due to them.  That needs to be provided for in the Bill and that is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The position up to now, which is contained in section 11, has been that compensation is recoverable not just when a new planning permission is granted but when development is carried out on the relevant land.  There is a good deal of logic in the provision.  It provides that any planning application would be dealt with on the planning merits but ensures that as soon as development is to be undertaken the planning authority <Col N="163" /> would be legally empowered to recover the compensation.</P>
      <P>The amendment is based on the distinction in section 26 (9) of the 1963 Act between a decision to grant permission and the actual granting of permission. The main purpose of this distinction is to put on hold proposed planning permissions by planning authorities pending the expiry of the period for the taking of the planning appeal.  In the case of An Bord Pleanála the distinction is a fairly nominal one since they are required to make the grant permission as soon as possible after the decision to grant.  This amendment would be technically defective in that it does not deal with decisions by An Bord Pleanála.  I cannot see that the amendment is necessary.  If, because of changed circumstances, a planning authority wished to grant planning permission for land, as long as compensation is clearly recoverable upon development the question as to who pays the compensation should not be an issue.  After all, the person who benefited from the original compensation may have died, emigrated or long since sold the land. The amendment would deprive a planning applicant of the flexibility of obtaining his full planning permission first and then negotiating with financiers or other developers about the implementation of that planning permission which would of course involve repayment of the compensation. I see no particular advantage to the amendment and I recommend that the Deputy withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to respond to a matter I raised during the course of the last amendment.  We all assume that a compensation repayment will be triggered by the commencement of a development.  I raised a different issue, that in reality, even within the confines of the new legislation, someone may look for a planning permission, let us say for land that was originally residential and was then used for agricultural zoning. The owner received compensation and ten years later he looks for planning permission to build a house and is given that <Col N="164" /> permission, thus increasing the value of the land.  If permission was given to build 20, 30 or 40 houses on a large piece of land, as opposed to a site, it would increase very substantially the value of the land.</P>
      <P>If I get such permission I may decide that I do not want to develop the land.  I now have land worth, say, £100,000 in agricultural values, I sell it for £500,000 without commencing any development and the person to whom I sell it may have to make a repayment under this legislation.  To take the point that was made a few minutes ago, interest is not accumulating on that money.  I have made my profit and have gone off the scene.  I am raising this matter because, if the Minister is not willing to consider it we may want to do something about it. It seems to make sense to have a clause in this legislation to provide that where planning permission has been granted in these circumstances, which results in an increase in the value of the land, and the person who gets the planning permission then sells the land at the increased value, the compensation that has to be repaid should be paid at the time of the sell on and not at the time of the start of the development.</P>
      <P>I expressed concern previously about freezing land if it was held for 20 or 30 years.  The public purse should not be at a loss for an ongoing situation where a profit has been made from a planning permission granted and the trigger of repaying compensation is not set off until the development starts.  If you sell off the piece of land without starting the development it makes a lot of sense that you trigger the repayment at that stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an inconsistency between what is being said here today and what was said the last day.  We had a long debate then about the distinction between the concept of reduction in value and actual loss and how compensation should be calculated.  The point was made very forcibly by the Minister that a refusal of planning permission reduces the value of a property.  Today he seems to be taking a different approach entirely.  He seems to be saying that the land owner does not recover that reduction in value until development takes place.  It is at that point that he repays the compensation to the local authority even though a repayment would not now be with interest.  I do not follow the logic of that.  If a planning refusal reduced the value of property, then planning permission at some later stage should correspondingly increase the value of the property.  Property is not sold for the purposes of development but for speculative purposes.  One site in my constituency, bought for £5 million, was sold recently for £10 million without any development having taking place.  The argument which seems to be being made <Col N="167" /> is that the unfortunate owner of the property who has just got planning permission is not in a position to repay the local authority the compensation already paid out on that land until such time as development takes place, but that is not consistent with what the Minister said the last day.  We are in grave danger of tilting the balance here in favour of the property owner.</P>
      <P>This Bill is seeking to strike a balance between the common good and the ownership of property.  In relation to the question of interest and at what point the compensation should be repaid, we are being invited to pity the unfortunate property owner who might not be in a position to pay the compensation until development has taken place.  It is important that the provisions in this Bill are consistent.  If a refusal of planning permission reduces the value of property, a grant of planning permission increases the property value.  If the property is then to be sold on it is sold with planning permission, it is at the point where the grant is made that the compensation should be repaid.</P>
      <P>Another danger is that if the compensation is not repaid at that stage, and if it is not tied to the granting of permission, an unscrupulous property owner might decide not to pay the local authority. The provisions of the Bill are clear in that the local authority can recover the money but in this instance a local authority might have to take someone to court, involving a lot of expense, in order to recover what is theirs in the first place. I do not understand the Minister's difficulty with this and I hope he will have another look at it, in which case I am prepared to withdraw the amendment until Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I have a problem with this which perhaps the Minister could clarify. There was an interaction between this amendment and amendment No. 24 but the Chair in his wisdom decided that they should be treated separately.  There is a provision in this which requires interest payments and that provision would now be inconsistent with subsection (1), as this House has not been successful in incorporating amendment No. 24 into the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is amendment No. 31 that clarifies the rate of interest payble, that is, in a case where the repayment of compensation is not paid in a single lump sum.  The 1963 Act providing for such cases where repayment should be made as a series of instalments of capital and interest combined, did not specify the rate of interest.  Amendment No. 31 provides that the rate will be the same as that which is periodically fixed by order of the Courts Act, 1981.  They treated that in the same way as judgment debts.</P>

      <P>I find the wording of the amendment deficient in relation to the idea that a grant of permission would not be made until such compensation was recovered.  If the property was up for sale subject to planning permission one could <Col N="169" /> be in a catch 22 situation.  If Deputy Gilmore wanted to introduce this on Report Stage it would have to be a condition of a planning permission that the development could not commence until such time as the compensation was repaid.  If the amendment were to say that the grant of permission could not be made by the planning authority, not even by An Bord Pleanála, that would be impractical, but one could make it a condition of the planning permission that development could not take place until such time as all compensation paid out previously had been repaid with or without interest.  I can see a technical problem in relation to the wording.  However, I have sympathy with the broad principles enunciated by Deputy Gilmore and the Minister has not convinced us of his position.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the right to claim compensation does not arise until An Bord Pleanála have given their decision on a planning application.  The idea behind that is that the applicant should be required to use the full planning procedure before being entitled to compensation. The effect of the amendment would be that the right to compensation would not arise until An Bord Pleanála had given their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would cause trouble and clog up the system because it would limit compensation claims to planning decisions given by An Bord Pleanála.  There are precedents for the proposal in the purchase notice provisions of section 29 of the 1963 Act which are limited to appeal decisions, and also <Col N="171" /> to section 58 of the 1963 Act re-enacted by section 15 of this Bill which limits to appeal cases the Minister's discretionary powers to direct payment of compensation.</P>
      <P>Despite the precedents I do not favour the amendment because its first effect would be to remove local planning decisions from all exposure to compensation. That would encourage unrealistic attitudes on the part of local planning authorities and divorce them from a proper realisation of the financial effects of their planning decisions.  It could also lead to an increasing number of decisions being made at local level which would offer compensatable grounds.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the amendment would make An Bord Pleanála the pressure point for all possible compensation cases.  While, in practice, this may largely be the case at present, I do not see any merit in formalising this fact into a fixed legislative provision.  The onus of coping with compensation in the context of planning decisions should rest equally with planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála.  I ask the Deputy to consider that as reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If someone applies to the local authority for planning permission and is refused, as things stand he can claim compensation on the basis of that refusal.  However, he has the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  I am simply seeking to require someone claiming compensation to pursue the planning application through the normal planning procedure right through to appeal, and that the right to compensation would only arise after the planning procedure had been exercised in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see the Minister's point in regard to clogging the system.  We have been debating the Committee Stage of this Bill for the last two days and we have been told that the cases of compensation which will arise as a result of this magnificent legislation will be so few that we have nothing to worry about.  However, the Minister is now saying that there will <Col N="172" /> be so many cases they will clog up the system of An Bord Pleanála if they are all processed.  I do not understand that logic, although I concede that the Bill very considerably tightens the circumstances in which compensation would be likely to arise.  Therefore, I am inclined to the view that the circumstances where appeals would go to An Bord Pleanála would not add extraordinarily to their work.</P>
    <P>The State has provided a procedure for dealing with planning applications which includes an appeals mechanism.  We are now talking about the payment of public money where there is a refusal for planning permission.  I do not agree that public money should be paid out by way of compensation to anybody until the person has fully exhausted the procedure already there, including the appeals procedure, which has been established.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the Minister's concern about the volume of appeals likely to go to An Bord Pleanála and I do not share his worry about local authorities. After all, we are talking about local authorities making decisions which would include compensatable reasons.  Local authorities, by and large, have a very fine record of making very good planning permissions and, as we know to our cost, ironically, the circumstances which gave rise to the largest compensation claims were cases which went to An Bord Pleanála.  Therefore, I do not share the Minister's concern as to what would happen at local authority level.</P>

      <P>A number of planning authorities have expressed concern that the period of one month now provided in subsection (1) might not be adequate in all cases to allow suitable notices under section 14 to be drafted.  The exact form of the notice granting an alternative permission in principle will have to be prescribed in regulations.  Depending on the amount of detail which these regulations require, there could be substance in the local authorities' concern for a little more time.  Deputy Shatter's amendment will provide for a three month period and my amendment provides for a two month period.  My preference is for a two month period and I ask Deputy Shatter to agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed concern about this section on Second Stage and I am pleased that the Minister has come back to us with an amendment.  I am anxious to try to persuade the Minister that he <Col N="175" /> should accept a three month period rather than a two month period.  The Minister talked a few minutes ago about perversity, but I did not put in a period of three months to be perverse or to have a row about it.  It is for very practical reasons.</P>
      <P>A situation may arise where if a planning authority refuses planning permission a compensation claim could arise.  The planning authority would be aware of that.  Having refused permission the planning authority may take the view that there are other reasonable developments that could take place on the particular land in respect of which the planning application was made.  Our experience of the processing of compensation claims is that it takes many months to deal with such claims.  I am anxious that the planning authority, who might be at the receiving end of a compensation claim because of something An Bord Pleanála have done as opposed to something that the authority might have done, be given a reasonable period of time to consider what other developments are appropriate.  The Minister made a point about the elected representatives of a local authority playing a role in this, and I am conscious of the fact that the officials of the planning department of a local authority notified of a decision of An Bord Pleanála which could trigger the use of this section may want five or six weeks to determine what they should insert in a notice.  Equally, the elected representatives of that local authority may require the manager to bring any such alternative development proposal before the local authority for consideration before notice is served.  A good manager, working in harmony with the elected members, will do that without being required to do so or a row developing within the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of local authorities should not be rushed into proposing alternative developments.  They should be allowed present their proposal to the elected members in good time to allow them time to consider that proposal.  For example, if a problem arises as a result of a planning <Col N="176" /> decision in the first week of July with the local authority not scheduled to have a meeting until the following September, the period of two months, while it is an improvement, will not be adequate.  The three month period would get over all those problems.  It would mean that local authorities would not be rushed or pressurised into making an alternative development proposal and it would give the elected members an opportunity to consider it, no matter what time of year it arises.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting would not in any way prejudice to any extent the land owner.  He could still, if he was intent on preparing a compensation claim, get the preparation under way or decide to wait until the end of the three month period. Those acquainted with this matter are aware that it is highly unlikely that the extra month would create any major difficulties or that within the three month period an applicant would have formulated his claim with sufficient professional advice to have it ready to proceed any earlier.  I accept that the Minister is being reasonable and helpful in tabling his amendment but I should like to ask him to accept the three month period.  Such a change will ensure that hasty decisions are not made and that elected members of local authorities will have an input into the content of any notice that may be served under the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I reconsidered this matter and I have to say that the Deputy had a point.  I was trying to concentrate the minds of local authorities on getting on with the business of giving the undertakings as quickly as possible.  If I gave them too elastic a time frame they would be doing nothing.  Planning authorities are capable of deciding on planning applications within a two month time frame and I thought it would be nice and neat when we have the two month regulation for deciding planning applications to have two months for the undertaking. When an undertaking is given it does not have to be a detailed permission, <Col N="177" /> it is only an outline.  The planning authority, subsequently, can get involved in the details of it.  I did not have any hangup about one month, two months or three months but I wanted to keep a balance with the existing regulations.  If the Deputy presses me I will not have any problem in accepting his amendment but it would be good if local authorities could see that we mean business.  They could deal with this matter within the limit outlined and they can take as long as they like afterwards to deal with the detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is good practice to set a time limit because if it is not set there will be problems.  The Minister will be aware that where there is the two month rule, and there is a complicated planning application made to a local authority, notices are often served for additional information with the result that the two month time span has to be extended.  In the context of ensuring that elected representatives have an input I do not think the three months is unreasonable or unnecessarily elastic.  It will give time for consideration of the matter.  The reality is that if this type of problem arises for local authorities there will be some degree of controversy.  It is only right that the elected members of local authorities have some reasonable time to come to terms with the matter.  I should like to ask the Minister to accept that.</P>

      <P>Section 14 has been the subject of public comment mainly because the undertakings provision in existing legislation has been seen to have been used to the detriment of good planning.  It is fair to say that in most of the cases where claims have been made for planning compensation the local authority have buckled under and granted an undertaking to the developer to carry out particular kinds of development.  One of the worst effects of the existing planning compensation law is that it has resulted not so much in the large pay-outs of money &mdash; we have noted what they are &mdash; but that over the years, particularly in the Dublin are, a whole series of undertakings have been granted by local authorities for planning permission which were, to put it mildly, less than desirable. Local authorities, faced with a developer about to claim compensation, in order to avoid having to pay would grant an undertaking.</P>
      <P>The Bill reintroduces the idea of undertakings albeit in a different way.  It introduces it in a way in which the local authority by granting an undertaking for an alternative type of development can avoid having to pay out compensation. My concern is that that will result in planning authorities giving undertakings to developers in regard to particular types of developments precisely in order to avoid having to pay.  This should not be an open-ended provision.  Certain restrictions should be placed on it.  The principal restriction that should be placed on it is the one that any undertaking given should not contravene the development objectives in the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been considerable concern about the integrity of development plans. Local authorities go through a very long procedure to draw up a development plan.  It is the major opportunity in the whole planning process where the democratically elected members of a local <Col N="179" /> authority can decide the way in which their area is planned.  It is also the principal area where the general public can have an involvement in the planning process and in the future planning and development of their area through the opportunity that is presented to them to make submissions to a development plan and to participate in the process.  The drawing up or the review of a development plan invariably takes two years or more.  It has taken more than that in the case of the Dublin plans.  Once that amount of time &mdash; and it is a democratic involvement of the people &mdash; is spent drawing up a development plan, I do not believe it should be possible for a local authority to give a developer an undertaking for a development which would contravene that development plan.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue to have this provision in the legislation which enables local authorities to give undertakings which may result in developments which are less than desirable, then at a very minimum they should not contravene the development plan.</P>

      <P>This morning, between the hours of 7.40 a.m. and 9.30 a.m., an exchange of fire took place between De Facto Forces at Haddathah Compound and armed elements firing from near Haddathah in the Irish Battalion area of operations in South Lebanon.  Throughout the firing, Irish troops remained under cover.  At 10.10 a.m., after the firing had ceased, a foot patrol from A Company, 66 Battalion, moved through Haddathah to <Col N="180" /> assess what damage had been caused and what casualties had been suffered among the local population.</P>
      <P>At the south-western edge of the village, a confrontation took place between the patrol and a number of armed elements.  The armed elements first threatened the patrol and then opened fire.  One Irish soldier was injured when an RPG anti-tank round struck a jeep. Two other Irish soldiers received gunshot wounds.  The Irish patrol was ordered to return fire.  Two of the armed elements were fatally wounded.</P>
      <P>The three Irish soldiers who had received injuries were evacuated by helicopter to the UN hospital at Naqoura. All are expected to recover.  Two other soldiers are being maintained under medical observation for shock following the blast of the RPG anti-tank round. The injured men are Private Riccardo Lucchesi, 17 Aghnameen Park, Dundalk, Private Patrick Mason, 44 New Vale, Shankill, County Dublin and Private Anthony Sheeran, 3 Tower View, Terenure, Dunleer.  Naturally I express sorrow at the incident and regret that two fatalities occurred.  I wish a speedy return to health of the Irish Army personnel involved.  I will be glad to give any further information that arises but, as of now, that is the exact situation as furnished to me.

      <P>Ordinarily announcements differ from statements in that there is no debate on them. If Deputy Mac Giolla felt there was some brief comment that should be made, the Chair would be amenable to departing from the Standing Order governing announcements.  We will take a brief comment from a spokesperson from the three major parties.  If Deputy Mac Giolla is happy with that, perhaps he will allow me call the spokesperson from the bigger party first.</P>

      <P>I thank you for the facility and I also thank the Minister for making known his knowledge of this incident in the House.  This is the appropriate place to do that.  I assume he will keep us fully informed as future developments emerge.  I think it is important, in the interest of clarity, that the facts are brought out and not something that assimilates to the facts.</P>
      <P>I join with the Minister in expressing regret that the incidents took place.  I also want to join with him in his expression of sympathy and wish for a speedy return to full health of the people who were injured.  Despite the difficulties and the danger there our Army personnel are very anxious to continue to serve in the Lebanon.  This incident should be followed up and when the full facts emerge, if required, a protest should be made to the appropriate authority.</P>

We regret very much the fatalities that have occurred, and as far as our own soldiers are concerned I wish them a speedy recovery.  I should like to say very clearly that once again this is an indication to the general public of the danger which faces our troops day in day out.  If the Minister has not got the information, perhaps he could satisfy himself and us that the Irish peace-keeping personnel were not put in unnecessary danger on this occasion.  If he is not in a position to clarify that, perhaps he would get clarification from the United Nations.  It has to go out from here that we want the Irish to continue the work they are doing, but no problems should be put in their way.  I wish a speedy recovery to our personnel who were involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment which speaks for itself.  The Minister very <Col N="183" /> courteously arranged for the speedy distribution this morning of the Environmental Research Unit report entitled <i>The Development Control System 1989 &mdash; A Survey of 1986 Planning Applications and Development based on them to 1989.</i> The section dealing with refusal reasons for planning applications states:</P>
      <P>Significantly, 81 per cent of refusal decisions included at least one non-compensatable reason, and a further 14 per cent included a reason which might possibly be found non-compensatable. This confirms the finding in an AFF survey and gives some credence to the view that planning authorities rarely refuse development unless there is a clearly non-compensatable reason, or that such reasons are `forced' into decisions to safeguard the financial position of the authority.</P>
      <P>I want to stress the last clause which refers to the forced refusal into a decision.  All of us know of such cases.</P>
      <P>The intent of this amendment is that where somebody is refused planning permission and there are compensatable reasons for doing so, the local authority would not be permitted to turn round and effectively tear up their development plan, albeit by way of &ldquo;material contravention, in order to avoid the payment of compensation&rdquo;.  There is some merit in this.  The number of reasons which would be compensatable would be severely restricted, as we will find out when we deal with the Schedules, but nevertheless the principle of the amendment is good.  Most of the planning abuse which has given rise to many of the concerns we heard this morning occurs in the Dublin area and the current development plan is effectively being written every time a section 4 motion is passed, to the extent that it is now a nonsensical document from the point of view of consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In support of the logic of the argument I wish to put on the record, as I have done, that turning refusals into decisions to avoid the payment of compensation is a well established and well documented <Col N="184" /> local authority practice and if we want to give any real meaning to the essence of section 14 the amendment proposed will reinforce it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot favour this amendment. A notice under section 14 is understood to be a holding arrangement.  It is a permissive statement of principle that the land in question is in the opinion of the planning authority capable of other development for which planning permission ought to be granted.  Section 14 (5) makes it clear that this permissive statement will not bind the planning authority or An Bord Pleanála in dealing with an actual planning application within the ambit of the notice.  It makes this clear because it directly contemplates the possibility of planning permission being refused or restrictively conditioned notwithstanding the earlier notice.</P>
      <P>The amendment, as proposed, would prevent the notice from specifying any alternative development which would materially contravene the development plan.  I do not understand why this restriction should be imposed.  Under section 26 (3) of the 1963 Act a planning authority are free, as a reserved function, to contemplate a material contravention in any case which comes before them.  A notice under section 14 will not prejudice that position one way or another since section 14 (5) already envisages that a planning authority, in the form of a manager or elected members, can draw back from the notice.  I cannot accept the amendment for those reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at what the Minister has said because what is at issue here in the first place is the status of development plans.  I sometimes wonder if members of local authorities and members of the public are wasting their time in drawing up development plans when under this legislation a planning authority will be entitled to effectively promise a developer that he will get planning permission which would contravene a development plan and as has already been said a number of times <Col N="185" /> today, the elected members of local authorities may, for whatever reason, decide to materially contravene a development plan.</P>
      <P>I counted the number of material contraventions of the development plan Dublin County Council have had since the 1985 local elections.  When I last counted, 93 material contraventions of the development plan had been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1985, 93 motions to contravene the development plan of Dublin County Council have been passed.  For the information of the Minister, on 85 of those occasions the motion was either proposed or seconded by members of his party.</P>
      <P>There is serious concern about the status of development plans.  Members of the public who have bought houses within or near an area which is zoned in a particular way and who have found out a development is going to go ahead which contravenes that plan are asking, and rightly so, how a development plan can be so easily set aside and what is the purpose of it all.  It is a great system of exercising democracy whereby elected members and the general public can participate in a very open way in drawing up a development plan for an area but the problem is that once a development plan is drawn up it is repeatedly undermined.</P>
      <P>The issue we are discussing is a form of planning blackmail.  If a developer who is refused planning permission lashes in a claim for compensation he can effectively blackmail the local authority into giving an undertaking for an alternative development to take place.  This has been a repeated problem in the Dublin area.  I mentioned the Red Rock development at Howth and Deputy Shatter will be familiar with the Farmleigh case.  All over County Dublin undertakings have been given to grant planning permission simply to avoid the payment of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Admittedly the provision in the Bill is somewhat different from the existing one but nevertheless it still boils down to the same thing; claims for compensation can <Col N="186" /> be lodged and undertakings given by a local authority.  The danger &mdash; and this has happened &mdash; is that when a claim for compensation is lodged and a local authority are in some doubt as to whether or not that claim might be sustained the temptation is to give the undertaking and err on the safe side rather than run the risk, as Dublin County Council did in the Montgorry case, of going the full distance.  This is fair enough if the undertaking prevents compensation having to be paid out but it is highly dangerous to give undertakings which would contravene a development plan.  Who will give the undertaking?  Will a county manager give an undertaking which would contravene the development plan without first bringing it to the notice of the elected members of the local authority whose function it is to decide on a development plan?  It would appear from what the Minister has said in his last reply that that will be the case but that under section 14 (5) a planning application will have to go to the elected members for a decision on the material contravention. At that stage any manager's report on a material contravention would point out to members that they are already in a way committed, and if they failed to pass the material contravention, they would leave the local authority open to a claim for compensation.  We have to stand firm on the development plan.  Earlier Deputy Quinn had an amendment which was ruled out of order and he has indicated that he will bring it in later.  I have a later amendment which deals with the importance of the development plan and the need to protect it under this legislation, but we completely undermine the development plan if the planning authority has the power to give undertakings which would contravene the development plan.  I will be pressing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is widening the scope of the debate, and he knows it. He has made his view quite clear, that planning authorities should not be permitted to grant planning permission in <Col N="187" /> material contravention of the development plan.  That is the Deputy's case and he is not just making it in relation to section 14, but in relation to any circumstances whatever.  That is a different point of view entirely.  What I am saying is that material contraventions are often initiated when the development plan is out-of-date.  The Deputy can argue all he likes in here, but what I would say is to let the planning authorities get on with their business and review their own development plans.  The County Dublin development plan is seven years old, and the one for the city is ten years old. Certain things have happened in the meantime.</P>

The Deputy cannot use this fact to argue that material contraventions should be outlawed entirely, and that is what he is pressing here.  I cannot accept this given the difference which exists between the undertakings given under the 1963 Act and what is now proposed.  The Deputy could change his mind again on that matter.  In those circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 10 subsection (3), line 24, after &ldquo;subsection (5)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or for a maximum period of five years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This subsection deals with the same issue of granting undertakings.  Under subsection (3), the provision is that the notice served by the local authority remains in force in an open-ended way until it is either withdrawn by the local authority or annulled by virtue of subsection (5).  I feel that it is undesirable that the notice should be open-ended, and I am proposing that there should be a limit of five years.</P>

I would like some legal advice on some of the implications in the terms of equity for persons entitled to pursue compensation claims.  I will instance what is giving me some difficulty.  As formulated the amendment would have the effect &mdash; I take it, entirely unintentionally &mdash; of exposing the planning authority to compensation on the expiry of the five year period.  I do not think the Deputy wants that &mdash; in fact I am positive he does not. A further provision would be needed to prevent that consequence of what the amendment provides.  If the Deputy is agreeable to that understanding of it I would like a little time to consider it further.  I was going to go against it because it had that consequence, but because the principle seems reasonable I would like to consider it further.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 40:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 48 and 49, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;he is satisfied&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the High Court may allow, the High Court makes an order declaring it is satisfied&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Second Stage I raised the issue whether section 15 was required in the Bill at all.  I still have some doubts whether we require the section.  On the assumption that the Minister would not agree to its deletion I have tabled an amendment that provides for the High Court, instead of the Minister, to exercise the powers this section prescribes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> The amendment is made to section 15 (1) but a similar amendment would be required to section 15 (3) which has not been tabled.  Nevertheless, it gives us an opportunity to discuss firstly the generality of the section and whether it is appropriate that the Minister exercise the powers the section prescribes.  In the context of all the other changes we are making in the planning laws I see no need for section 15 at all.  I would like to get the Minister's views as to why he believes it necessary to include this section in the Bill.  It is difficult to see why it should be the Minister who would make decisions, in the exceptional circumstances that would arise under the section, that a compensation payment should be made.  It seems more appropriate, if it is a question of justice or equity entering into this, that the courts should make that decision, not the Minister.</P>
    <P>I made the point on the last day we spoke on this that it would put the Minister in a difficult position.  A Minister could be put under considerable pressure to make the right decision, &ldquo;right&rdquo; being right in the eyes of particular supporters under this section.  This could create difficulties for a Minister and a Minister who acts perfectly properly in exercising the powers conferred by this section could be laying himself open to wrong accusations of impropriety.  I am not suggesting that the current Minister would in any way behave improperly, and I want to put that on the record.  I am unhappy about the question of the need for the section generally but if we are to retain it I am unhappy that the powers it prescribes should fall into the lap of the Minister for the Environment rather than a determination being made by the court whether in justice or equity a particular sum should be made by way of compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had concerns very similar to Deputy Shatter's about this section.  The Minister said a number of times that the effect of this Bill will be to limit the occasions when the issue of compensation will arise at all.  It lists the <Col N="192" /> circumstances in which compensation will not be paid.  Whereas the Bill may have closed what is commonly referred to as the planning loophole, section 15, if it does not reopen it, provides the key to reopening it in that, notwithstanding the other provisions of the Bill, it gives the Minister the right to make a decision to order compensation to be paid in certain circumstances.  I do not see the logic of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill itself is quite extensive.  It provides for the circumstances in which compensation will be paid.  We are spending a great deal of time teasing them out. I do not understand why any Minister would want to have this power in the first place.  I agree with Deputy Shatter that it would put a Minister in a very difficult position where there might be pressure on him or her to make a decision to award compensation.  There was a great deal of experience before the establishment of An Bord Pleanála of Ministers for Local Government, as it was then, coming under enormous pressure, and relenting to that pressure very often, to grant planning permissions on appeal.  I can see Ministers coming under precisely the same pressure where a permission is refused where under the terms of this Bill the applicant would not be entitled to claim compensation and would use this provision of the Bill to exert pressure on the Minister to have an award made.  That is not good.  Either we are legislating for planning compensation or we are not. To some extent having legislation which covers planning compensation is a waste of time if at the end of all that the Minister can come along and direct that compensation be paid.  Even under subsection (3) where a local authority would have issued a notice giving an undertaking that certain planning permission could be granted in a particular case, the Minister would still have the right under this subsection effectively to order that compensation be paid.  Therefore, the effect of the section is largely to negative the Bill.  It will all depend on the Minister concerned.  There is no restriction on what the Minister might do in this case. <Col N="193" /> Nothing is laid down as to the circumstances in which he could do it.  It is very open ended.  It is giving the Minister for the Environment virtually <i>carte blanche</i> to award planning compensation. That is the net effect, notwithstanding what the rest of the Bill provides for.</P>
    <P>I have an amendment to delete the section.  I support Deputy Shatter's amendment and if it is carried or the Minister is prepared to accept it I am prepared to withdraw my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the amendment but Deputy Gilmore has broadened the arguments on the amendment to take in the whole section.  I think there is great merit in this.  I cannot see why section 15 was put in in the first instance.  It may well be to provide some degree of balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how I would interpret it but then I strongly advise the Minister to take on board the sense of the amendment proposed by Deputy Shatter. If equity and justice need to be counterbalanced in some cases &mdash; and hard cases make poor law, in this case bad law &mdash; the last thing we want it to get ourselves as a Legislature, a body politic, back into the position of pressure coming on any Minister.  All of us as politicians are subject to those kinds of pressures from time to time.  In the section which Deputy Shatter's amendment proposes to amend the powers are so broad that it is really a judicial matter.  Section 15 (1) concludes as follows:</P>
      <P>...the Minister makes an order declaring that he is satisfied that it would not be just and reasonable in the particular circumstances that payment of compensation should be prevented by the provisions of section 13.</P>
      <P>That should be a matter for the court or the Ombudsman but not for an office holder who would be seeking re-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the <Col N="194" /> Deputy's concern in this.  Deputy Quinn sums it up well in that we took a lot of advice on this matter and it was to give a constitutional balance that we inserted this section.  We are going so far in this legislation that we are at the brink and to try to maintain that balance we were advised not to transfer from the Minister to the High Court the discretion to order payment of compensation in special circumstances, as provided in section 15. I understand the intentions behind the amendment.  I consider that the function involved is properly a governmental rather than a judicial one.  By tradition, the Irish courts have never been involved in planning matters except in relation to points of law.  The judgment required to be exercised under this section is not a matter of law.  The issue is whether in particular circumstances it would be reasonable to give a person access to compensation, notwithstanding the restrictions placed by section 13.  I should explain that section 15 does not involve the Minister in any way in determining the amount of compensation which a person should receive.  Under section 6 that is a matter for agreement at arbitration. That is another safeguard.</P>
      <P>As far as can be established, only two orders have been made by Ministers under section 58 of the 1963 Act, the predecessor of this section, and the second of those orders was made in 1984. Applications have been more frequent than that and a total of 21 applications have been received under section 58 since 1977.</P>
      <P>The relatively high failure rate of applications is another reason why we should be slow to introduce the High Court.  If competence in this matter is transferred to the High Court, applicants will have to take on the cost of engaging solicitors and counsel, with only certain prospects of success.  Application to the Minister involves virtually no expense. The power is exercised only in that very limited situation of justice and balance and the Minister does not finally decide the amount.  I am asking that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I fully accept the Minister's statement that it is not the Minister who fixes the amount of compensation. It is correct that it should not be the Minister or a court.  The arbitrator would have knowledge of a specialist nature which the courts would not have.  The Minister makes an order declaring that he is satisfied that it would not be just and reasonable in the particular circumstances that the payment of compensation should be prevented by the provisions of section 13.  I am not sure how any Minister can make a decision as to whether it would be unjust and unreasonable to decline compensation.  It would require special circumstances and an exceptional case for it to arise.  I take the point that the problem with the High Court is that the level of legal costs involved might be a disincentive to anyone pursuing this issue.  The Minister says that compensation has been paid in only two cases where the Minister has made the decision.  I do not know if he has the information as to the ultimate award in those two cases.  That might be of interest.  It is unlikely unless there is a major dispute involving a large sum of money, that a claim would be made under this section.</P>
      <P>The criteria by which the Minister has to make the decision are more the type of criteria that judges in the generality of dealing with the law are used to applying in practice.  What is happening here is that the Minister is making a judicial decision.  For the reasons I gave in my opening comments it would be preferable that the court would make that decision.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister took up Deputy Quinn's suggestion that it was perhaps because of constitutional reasons that this section was put in.  I am not convinced there is any constitutional reason for the inclusion of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore has told me that if the Minister accepts my amendment he will not vote against the section.  I have no difficulty in joining with Deputy Gilmore in voting the section out, but obviously with the numbers we have we will not succeed.  If before Report Stage the Minister will give further consideration to this <Col N="196" /> power being exercised by the High Court, I will not press the amendment.</P>
    <P>The danger in dealing with legislation of this nature is that we can get bogged down in all kinds of academic hypotheses that will never arise.  The section in the 1963 Act has been used on only two occasions in almost 30 years.  It could be that in the new legal situation this section would become more relevant and might give rise to more claims, being given greater attention than in the past.  The Minister of the day, instead of dealing with the broad sweep of political decision-making which should be his job, could then find himself bogged down in the examination of individual cases of planning applicants seeking compensation. I do not think that is a job the Minister for the Environment should have put on his shoulders and I believe the general public would agree.  The general public will see it as correct that the High Court should consider this matter. It does not have to be the High Court; it could be the Circuit Court to which the application would be made, if we are looking at ways of providing more simplified procedures and delimiting the legal cost impact.  Possibly the District Court would be appropriate.  I provided for the High Court primarily because when a point of law arises under the Planning Acts it is dealt with by the High Court.  The High Court Judiciary have a degree of familiarity with the Planning Acts and how they work.  That expertise and familiarity does not currently exist in the District or Circuit Courts.</P>
    <P>This is an inappropriate power to be left with the Minister of the day.  As an aspiring occupant of the Minister's Department at some future date, I have no personal desire to exercise this power. I would feel happier if it were the courts who were to exercise it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have exercised that power once or twice, and negatively for those seeking it.  The Deputy is quite right in that we do not want to get back to a situation where there would be an increase in the number of demands under the section.  I am advised that will not <Col N="197" /> happen.  It is an interesting point that section 58 has been reviewed in the courts on a number of occasions, in particular in the Grange case, and the argument the Deputy made was never raised.  That reinforces my attitude that it was seen as a very good and useful instrument.  The review has thrown up no circumstances which would suggest to the lawmakers that they should revise their opinions on it.  That weighed heavily with me when I was considering the point.</P>
      <P>The Minister can only exercise this power in very special circumstances but those circumstances have arisen in non-compensatable cases where an individual may feel he is hard done by and decides to appeal to the Minister.  Quite an exhaustive investigation is carried out before a decision is made.  I do not like putting something on the record unless I am absolutely positive but I will risk it on this occasion.  I think that in one of the two cases in the last 30 years where compensation was granted the money was never paid subsequent to the ministerial decision being taken that it was right that section 58 should apply.  Before the arbitrator had finalised his negotiations some arrangement was made with the local planning authority that did not necessitate the passing over of money at all.  I think there was only one case, a very long time ago, when a Minister decided it should be paid.  My recollection of the files, when dealing with a case under section 58 in the last three years, is that the amount of money was very small.  I do not know the figure but that is my recollection of it.</P>
      <P>I took some time considering this matter and said: &ldquo;This will be the end of this matter&rdquo;.  It comes back to the point raised by Deputy Quinn, that legal advice supported the question of balance.  What we are doing here &mdash; and I said this in my Second Stage speech &mdash; is skirting along with the Constitution at its very limit in so far as the provision for private property is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter was the first to tell me to be daring in this matter, to go beyond what is recommended by my legal advice and let the matter be tested elsewhere, if <Col N="198" /> that is necessary, and found wanting but he said I would be doing the right thing by the public in so far as compensation is concerned.  I took on board that principle and had to fight to have it accepted because legal advice is very dominating and cannot suggest anything that might in any way contravene the Constitution. Because we are at the limit here the legal advice is to retain this provision in order to ensure balance.  I am asking the House, therefore, to accept it in good faith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem of consistency here.  Again and again in the course of this debate arguments used in respect of one section were not consistent with those used in relation to another. An hour ago we debated an amendment which I put down that eligibility for compensation would arise only after a decision from An Bord Pleanála.  In his reply the Minister argued that An Bord Pleanála would be inundated with appeals from people to make them eligible for compensation.  We are now dealing with a section which effectively makes the Minister the court of appeal in cases of claims for compensation.  The point raised by Deputy Shatter that precisely the same thing would happen, that a lot of appeals would be brought before the Minister, seems to be dismissed by the Minister in this case.  He said there have been only two such cases in the history of the present legislation.  The reason there have been only two such cases is quite frankly that where claims for compensation have been lodged either the local authority caved in or, at the end of the day, had to pay the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to look exactly at what this section is about.  I do not understand the constitutional argument that is being made by the Minister.  I appreciate that I am not a legal person but from my recollection, both Justice McCarthy, when dealing with the XJS case, and Judge Walsh, when speaking separately about it, were very clear about the Constitution on this issue.  They made it clear that the present law on planning compensation is probably unconstitutional. They drew our attention to the fact that <Col N="199" /> the constitutional right to private property is qualified by the needs of social justice, common good and so on.  I do not understand the constitutional argument that the Minister is making.  I do not see that it arises elsewhere either.  There are several cases within the Minister's brief where, under various pieces of legislation, people are entitled to apply for things and are turned down.  When the case is made to the Minister his reply is that he has no discretion in the matter, a reply with which I am sure many Members of this House will be familiar. I do not understand why, in this case, a degree of discretion is being built into the legislation.</P>
    <P>We are spending a lot of time putting through legislation which lists, in the First and Second Schedules of the Bill, the circumstances in which compensation cannot be paid either for a refusal of planning permission or for conditions applying to a planning permission.  They are quite extensive and deal with a whole range of areas.  The Minister wants to give himself the power to set those aside where he feels it would not be just and reasonable.  That is wide open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  The Minister can make an order declaring that he is satisfied that it would not be just and reasonable in the particular circumstances that payment of compensation should be prevented by the provisions of section 13. That is wide open.  It is giving the Minister virtually absolute discretion to decide, on an appeal from an applicant, to award compensation.  The Minister does not have the power to set the amount of the compensation but under this section, as I understand it, he certainly has the power to state whether or not compensation should be paid in the first place. That is an excessive power for the Minister to have and is also one that could be abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spent a lot of time this morning dealing with abuses of the planning system.  I want to be very clear about this. <Col N="200" /> I would not for a moment suggest that the Minister would be a party to or condone any abuse of the planning system. It is believed that the investigation that is going on at present about planning irregularities in Dublin includes investigations of certain politicians.  Suppose it happened that a certain politician who was less than scrupulous about the application of planning procedures and planning law found himself in charge in the Custom House, what safeguard is there that this Bill, particularly this section, would not be abused and that decisions would not be made which would allow certain people to get compensation? This is a power the Minister should not have.  The Bill is sufficiently comprehensive without this section.  If the issue can be dealt with in the way described by Deputy Shatter, I would be satisfied to give way to that but if that is not possible, this section should be deleted from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision is a safety valve.  It is not proper for the Deputy to suggest that it is wide open.  I would ask him to at least consider the exclusions outlined in subsection (2) of that section. Any reasonable interpretation of that will reveal that it is not a wide open provision but rather a very restrictive one.  I know that Deputy Shatter will appreciate that in discussing the matter in 1988, Mr. Justice Keane referred to this very item, that the refusal of compensation in circumstances where it would be unjust could be met under the present legislation by permitting payment in special circumstances where the Minister for the Environment could order it under section 58.  They contemplated that this safety valve would continue to exist.  We might bear in mind for the rest of the evening that legislation which seeks to achieve the common good without treating the individual citizen in an unfair or arbitrary manner should have at least a reasonable prospect of surviving a challenge in the courts.  That is why I am asking that this stay, and I must insist.</P>

They are designated to respond to a point of interpretation which was adverted to, although not ruled on, in both the High Court and Supreme Court judgments on the XJS Investments Limited <i>v.</i> Dún Laoghaire Corporation case.  In that case, the courts were inclined to the view that the reference to &ldquo;structure&rdquo; in section 56 (1) (i) of the 1963 Act should be construed in the singular only.  This reference is to be found in the present Bill in the Third Schedule, paragraph 7, and there is also a parallel reference in section 15 (2) (b). The parliamentary draftsman is reluctant to compromise the general principle of the Interpretation Act, 1937, that the singular should normally import the plural also by expressly adding the plural as Deputy Gilmore's amendment does. However, the parliamentary draftsman has suggested amendments Nos. 40a and 70 as a means of clarifying that the terms &ldquo;structure&rdquo; also imports the plural in this case.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;17. &mdash;A person shall not be entitled to assign to any other person all or any part of any prospective compensation under section 12, and every purported assignment or promise, express or implied, to pay any other person any money in respect of any such compensation is void.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to prevent formal arrangements for the sharing of possible planning compensation between persons who may have compensation rights and persons not enjoying those rights.  In practice this situation can probably only arise in the context of paragraphs 9 to 11 of the Third Schedule, since this is the only provision which differentiates for compensation purposes between earlier and later owners.  The prohibition on sharing compensation has, however, been drafted in a general way and without particular reference to these provisions.  The purpose of the amendment is to discourage developers from seeking indirectly to benefit from compensation by optioning land and making formal arrangements for the owner to apply for planning permission with the owner's possible right to compensation as a guarantee.  The provision in this amendment should be self-enforcing in the sense that purported arrangements to share compensation will not be legally enforceable and will leave the non-owner at a risk in relation to whatever consideration he pays for the arrangement.</P>

    <P>The Air Pollution Act, 1987 provided for the repeal of sections 56 (1) and 61 (1) of the 1963 Act to the extent that these related to air pollution.  The reasoning involved was that for the future we should generally rely on the Air Pollution Act to support any necessary measures to prevent air pollution.  In particular, planning conditions, as distinct from a refusal, should no longer deal with air pollution matters.  Since we should no longer have air pollution conditions in planning permission, reference to them in this context is redundant and they were earmarked by the Air Pollution Bill for repeal.  The Air Pollution Bill does not admit of compensation. These provisions identified for repeal were inadvertently reinstated by section 19 and the Fourth Schedule, paragraph 25 of this Bill, as published.

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:</P>
      <P>In page 16, before line 1, to insert the following new Schedule:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">FIRST SCHEDULE <Col N="208" /> RULES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION</P>
    <P>1.  The reduction in value shall, subject to the provisions of this Schedule, be determined by reference to the difference between the antecedent and subsequent values of the land, where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the antecedent value of the land is the amount which the land, if sold in the open market by a willing seller immediately prior to the relevant decision under Part IV of the Principal Act (and assuming that the relevant application for permission had not been made), might have been expected to realise, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the subsequent value of the land is the amount which the land, if sold in the open market by a willing seller immediately after the said decision, might be expected to realise.</P>
    <P>2.  In determining the antecedent value and subsequent value of the land for the purposes of Rule 1&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  regard shall be had to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  any contribution which a planning authority might have required or might require as a condition precedent to development of the land,</P>
    <P>(ii)  any restriction on the development of the land which, without conferring a right to compensation, could have been or could be imposed under any Act or under any order, regulations, rule or bye-law made under any Act,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the fact that exempted development might have been or may be carried out on the land, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  the open market value of comparable land, if any, in the vicinity of the land whose values are being determined;</P>
    <P>(b)  no account shall be taken of&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> (i)  any part of the value of the land attributable to subsidies or grants available from public moneys, or to any tax or rating allowances in respect of development, from which development of the land might benefit,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the special suitability or adaptability of the land for any purpose if that purpose is a purpose to which it could be applied only in pursuance of statutory powers, or for which there is no market apart from the special needs of a particular purchaser or the requirements of any statutory body as defined in Rule 5; provided that any bona fide offer for the purchase of the land which may be brought to the notice of the arbitrator shall be taken into consideration,</P>
    <P>(iii)  any increase in the value of land attributable to the use thereof or of any structure thereon in a manner which could be restrained by any court, or is contrary to law, or detrimental to the health of the inmates of the structure or to public health or safety or to the environment,</P>
    <P>(iv)  any depreciation or increase in value attributable to the land, or any land in the vicinity, being reserved for a particular purpose in a development plan,</P>
    <P>(v)  any value attributable to any unauthorised structure or unauthorised use,</P>
    <P>(vi) (I)  the existence of proposals for development of the land or any other land by a statutory body, or</P>
    <P>(vi) (II)  the possibility or probability of the land or other land becoming subject to a scheme of development undertaken by such statutory body, and</P>
    <P>(c)  all returns and assessments of capital value for taxation made or <Col N="210" /> acquiesced in by the claimant may be considered.</P>
    <P>3.  (1)  In assessing the possibilities, if any, for developing the land, for the purposes of determining its antecedent value, regard shall be had only to such reasonable possibilities as, having regard to all material considerations, could be judged to have existed immediately prior to the relevant decision under Part IV of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  Material considerations for the purposes of the foregoing sub-rule shall, without prejudice to the generality thereof, include&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the nature and location of the land,</P>
    <P>(b)  the likelihood or unlikelihood, as the case may be, of obtaining permission, or further permission, to develop the land in the light of the provisions of the development plan,</P>
    <P>(c)  the assumption that, if any permission to develop the land were to be granted, any conditions which might reasonably be imposed in relation to matters referred to in the Fourth Schedule (but no other conditions) would be imposed, and</P>
    <P>(d)  any permission to develop the land, not being permission for development of a kind specified in section 14(2), already existing at the time of the relevant decision under Part IV of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>4.  (1)  In determining the subsequent value of the land in a case in which there has been a refusal of permission&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it shall be assumed, subject to sub-rule (2), that, after the refusal, permission under Part IV of the Principal Act would not be granted for any development of a kind specified in section 14(2),</P>
    <P>(b)  regard shall be had to any conditions in relation to matters <Col N="211" /> referred to in the Fourth Schedule (but no other conditions) which might reasonably be imposed in the granting of permission to develop the land.</P>
    <P>(2)  In a case in which there has been a refusal of permission in relation to land in respect of which there is in force an undertaking under Part VI of the Principal Act, it shall be assumed in determining the subsequent value of the land that, after the refusal, permission under Part IV of the Principal Act would not be granted for any development other than development to which the said undertaking relates.</P>
    <P>5.  (1)  In Rule 2, `statutory body' means:</P>
    <P>(a)  a Minister of the Government,</P>
    <P>(b)  the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland,</P>
    <P>(c)  a local authority within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1941,</P>
    <P>(d)  a harbour authority within the meaning of the Harbours Act, 1946,</P>
    <P>(e)  a health board established under the Health Act, 1970,</P>
    <P>(f)  a vocational education committee within the meaning of the Vocational Education Act, 1930,</P>
    <P>(g)  a board or other body established by or under statute,</P>
    <P>(h)  a company in which all the shares are held by, or on behalf of, or by directors appointed by, a Minister of the Government, or</P>
    <P>(i)  a company in which all the shares are held by a board, company, or other body referred to in paragraph (g) or (h).</P>
    <P>(2)  In sub-rule 1 (h) and (i), `company' means a company within the meaning of section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We had discussed this amendment but we did not necessarily agree with it.  We discussed the method of valuation but there is an awful lot of meat in this Schedule and, while the Minister may have his mind on other classes of meat which he would like to eat at this hour of the day, I advise him to get his teeth into an explanation of the way the rules will be interpreted and how the original Schedule, known as the First Schedule, based on the 1919 Act, has now been changed.  I have been informed that a lot of case law has accompanied standards and methods of valuation in relation to determining under the First Schedule, for the purposes of establishing the amount of compensation, the way in which the old Schedule worked.  When we were debating this matter last week I raised some questions in relation to the whole concept of antecedent and subsequent value and whether that related to existing use value.</P>
      <P>I also asked if the Minister was satisfied at this stage that the rules as proposed to be set out in schedule one &mdash; and some consequential rules in the other Schedules &mdash; would be clearly and readily understood by the group of people who will be entrusted with the task of interpreting them on behalf of the local authority or individual landowners.  I understand that a letter dated 22 March 1989, was sent to the Minister in relation to the Bill now before us from the Society of Chartered Surveyors of the Republic of Ireland in which a large number of points were made.  They referred to the First Schedule as originally published not the First Schedule now proposed.  They said:</P>
      <P>In the First Schedule the proposals to amend rule 1 and rule 2 of the 1919 Act is clumsy and ill advised.  It indicates a lack of understanding of the concepts involved.  The amendment proposed at 2 (a) is meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to respond to the thinking behind the change in the First Schedule which I welcome. However, I should like to get some <Col N="213" /> reassurance as to its operational practicality.</P>

      <P>This amendment adds two further categories of development to the Second Schedule.  Refusal of planning permission will never be compensatable where the proposed development is in a class set out in this Schedule.  This will be so regardless of the reasons for refusal in any specified planning decision.  I have already explained the background to the question of demolition of habitable houses which was dealt with in amendment No. 2.  This amendment will also make refusal of permission to demolish a listed building a non-compensatable matter.  This is consistent with the conservation status of such buildings and with the approach adopted in the National Monuments Act which has been upheld in case law.  I recommend the amendment.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Kavanagh on Tuesday, 20 February 1990:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to provide adequate resources to enable the civil legal aid scheme to be properly developed and expanded.  Noting with concern the present crisis which has led to a virtual collapse of the service Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide an additional allocation to enable all existing centres to deal with their backlog of work and to ensure for <Col N="215" /> the future the provision of a comprehensive range of services, and furthermore calls on the Government to enact the relevant legislation to place the civil legal aid scheme on a statutory basis, based on the principle that all those in need of civil legal aid but who cannot afford it will have access to it.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
    <P>notes with approval that, for the first time since the establishment of the scheme of civil legal and advice, the Grant-in-Aid to the Legal Aid Board has been increased by a significant amount; recognises that the increase in Exchequer funding of £425,000 over the grant for 1989 will enable the board to continue in operation four law centres which otherwise would have had to close and will also enable the board to recruit a substantial number of staff to fill the vacancies at solicitor and administrative levels; and acknowledges that in the context of present financial circumstances and the need to curb expenditure which is paramount in the Government's strategy, the increased resources made available to the Board is a reflection of the Government's commitment to the civil legal aid scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sharing what I understand is seven minutes remaining to me with Deputy Fennell.  The record of how the Government have dealt with the civil legal aid system is utterly appalling.  The speech of the Minister last night was not just astonishing but grossly misleading.  For the Minister to claim that the Government have put additional resources into the civil legal aid system was disingenuous.  The moneys available under the Fund of Suitors Act that had been put into the legal aid system for a <Col N="216" /> number of years ran out and the Government had to replace it from a different source.  In reality the current system of legal aid cannot cope with the demand. Solicitors working in law centres are grossly overworked and the consumer, the individual man or woman who cannot afford to pay for legal advice, is seriously disadvantaged.  Many of our law centres have, in effect, closed their doors.  They are only open and available for emergency applications.</P>
      <P>We do not have operating here a credible civil legal aid system despite the best work and goodwill of the few solicitors working in the law centres.  In effect, the centres lack essential resources and the Government are guilty of an extraordinary breach of faith with the House in regard to this.  It is in the area of family law that the centres do most of their work.  When I was putting through the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill in the House it was emphasised by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, that additional resources would be needed and that more solicitors were required.  A promise was made to Members that additional resources would be made available and that a recruitment drive for solicitors for the law centres would take place.  We were told that more than seven new solicitors, many of whom would be replacing solicitors lost under the Civil Service embargo, would be put into the centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have a two-tier system of justice. The Government have turned their backs on the battered and unmaintained wives who look to the civil legal aid system and the law centres to provide them with help.  It has been recorded that the law centres have not been operating the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act.  They are not in a position to provide legal help generally except in emergency cases.  It is not good enough for the Minister to tell the House that the position will be reassessed in 1991.  I have no doubt that the cynical abandonment of the law centres by the Government, and the misleading of the House by the Government will be seen for what it is. The Progressive Democrats, the group of <Col N="217" /> six who shed tears in the House on behalf of people who suffered broken marriages and tried to make something of a meal of some aspects of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill &mdash; at the end of the day they supported it &mdash; have also turned their backs on the people they pretended to be concerned about and to defend during the last Dáil.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that within a short period, due to the failure of the Government to provide essential resources for the law centres, the State will be disgraced before the European Court.  We are now in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government are not living up to the obligations that the European Court laid down in the Josie Airey case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me. I am very pleased that this debate has come about but I regret there is a time limit on it.  It is unfortunate that more Members cannot contribute to the debate.  I support the motion but I only wish that the support from this side of the House would make a profound difference for an essential service that is now starved of funds.  In 1980 the State was dragged screaming and protesting into providing legal aid and advice for those too poor to obtain it for themselves.  That came only when Ireland was found in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Mrs. Josie Airey was the woman who showed up Ireland's failure in this area. Prior to that the only free legal aid service was given by FLAC which was set up in 1969 and run by a group of solicitors, and also by a group with whom I was involved who gave information and facts on marriage laws, the AIM group who had branches in Dublin and throughout the country.  The Government have never provided a proper service.  We have never had guaranteed access to the courts.  At best we have had a piecemeal, ungenerous effort which broke down regularly with centres unable to cope and having to close their doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal aid service once more is <Col N="218" /> under severe pressure and with the resignation of the chairman, Mr. Niall Fennelly, SC, we know that it will never function properly until it is given political priority, money and a statute base.  We can be clinical, cynical, academic, put the issue on the record in black and white, deal in rhetoric or indulge in party point scoring, but we should ask ourselves about whom we are talking.  We should ask ourselves who is affected by Government inaction and by their callous treatment of this service.  We are talking about poor people, those on social welfare, the long term unemployed, the severely disadvantaged and those who have little or no status in society.  Without access to free civil legal aid they can go nowhere. They will not have a brother-in-law a solicitor or a first cousin a barrister who might fix them up if things go wrong.  To ignore the basic needs of that group is callous and hard hearted.</P>
    <P>In reality we are talking specifically about family law because the legal aid service deals almost exclusively with family and marriage breakdown.  The lack of that service means that couples, often with dreadful emotional marriage problems, have no means of escape or relief.  The state of civil legal aid is creating a crisis for wives in marriage breakdown. Most wives do not have an independent income and, therefore, cannot afford to consult a solicitor.  It is well known that a woman who goes to a solicitor in regard to a family law matter must be well armed with a bank draft. Her husband, on the other hand, will be in a position to buy the most expensive and expert service.  When a marriage goes wrong it is a case of the wife who is not income earning being classified as working class, even though she may have a middle class husband.  Any Member, priest, social worker or general practitioner will agree that that is the case. The women, and the children, suffer grievously in such cases.  I have women from as far away as Cork and Galway coming to my clinics in Dublin South for help.  I am not a lawyer but I have a good knowledge of family law and I help those people to some extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> I regret that there are still hundreds of present day Josie Aireys about.  They carry out a futile search for legal relief. Not only are they abandoned by the Government in terms of a programme of reform in the law in regard to nullity and matrimonial property, but they are abandoned when it comes to having access to the courts.  What is needed is a place where people can get legal aid but also legal advice and where they can have a consultation on their rights and the options available to them, particularly in family law.  Ideally, of course, a network of community law centres should do this. I realise that will not come about today or next month. In the meantime, why not have a system such as that which existed in the UK a few years ago &mdash; and which may still exist &mdash; of a type of green card which entitled those qualified for legal aid to go to any solicitor for an initial consultation up to a spending limit of the order of £50 or £60.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to some of the speeches that were made last night and, indeed, tonight.  The motion before us falls into the category of the many complaints we have heard voiced in recent times about various services, <Col N="220" /> whether provided directly by the Government or funded wholly or partially by the Government.  The complaints being made would, in my opinion, carry a great deal more credibility if they were not being made by people who are complaining simultaneously about the lack of money for legal aid, lack of money for the Land Registry and lack of money for everything else one can think of under the sun, complaining that taxation was not reduced sufficiently in the budget and that social welfare was not increased sufficiently, and, of course, they agree with all the responsible economists who have advised that borrowing is too high.</P>
      <P>The civil legal aid system was established by the Fianna Fáil Government in December 1979.  It was preceded by a report under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Pringle which dealt with the introduction of a comprehensive system of civil legal aid and the introduction of a comprehensive system of legal aid and advice in civil matters.  The Pringle Committee did not envisage that the Government of the day would be in a position to introduce a comprehensive system immediately.  That is demonstrated in the body of the report in which they suggest an interim legal aid system &mdash; a stop-gap measure &mdash; which went on to outline a blue print for a more comprehensive system.  Perhaps the Government of the day were wrong in their approach.  Perhaps they should have gone for the interim system proposed.  Instead of that, they opted for the more comprehensive system with, of course, very substantial exceptions.</P>
      <P>In 1979 the Government did not decide to introduce a comprehensive and all-embracing civil legal aid system in Ireland.  Neither did the Government who took office in 1982 make such a decision.  It would be most unusual that any social service, such as this, would be all-embracing and comprehensive &mdash; whatever that might mean &mdash; from the inception.  The reality is that successive Governments have decided on a system of civil legal aid and advice which is far from comprehensive.  That is the reality which is demonstrated by the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> Various minor improvements to the civil legal aid and advice scheme have been made from 1980 onwards.  Unfortunately, the increasing demands on the system, because of various reasons, have far outstripped the improvements that have been made.  The result of the increasing demand versus inadequate improvements &mdash; this side of the House are not running away from it &mdash; means that more people are unhappy with the civil legal aid system today than in 1980. There are various reasons for the increasing demands on the civil legal aid system, a number of which have been adverted to in contributions from the opposite side.  I welcome the introduction of new legislation, the gradual and growing awareness of the availability of civil legal aid and advice and the various social groups, but the reality is that the demands have outstripped the supply in terms of increased funding and in terms of the improvements which were made.</P>

      <P>Deputies on the opposite side spoke last night about the closure of the law centres.  That matter is dealt with in the 1986 report of the Legal Aid Board. The board refers, rather delicately, to this phenomenon as a temporary restriction of services.  It does not mean that the law centres are actually closed.  It means, in effect, that for a certain period new clients will not be given appointments unless there is an emergency.  Before anybody intervenes, I know that those waiting periods have run into months in the various centres, including the centre in my own city.  The definition of what an emergency is can vary from centre to centre although there are reasonably clear guidelines.  Deputy Kavanagh referred last night to an article by Mr. Timothy Dalton in the April 1989 issue of the Gazette of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  I note that in the concluding part of his article, Mr. Dalton, referring to the contention that no service is being provided, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> that would be very far from the truth. Thousands of clients are in fact, provided with services each year.  According to the board's most recent annual report the number of people provided with legal advice only was 5,274 and the number provided with both advice and representation was 1,317.</P>
    <P>I will not stand here tonight and pretend the system is perfect.  In his contribution Deputy Flanagan referred to the operation of a newly established centre in his own constituency.  The centre in my own constituency has been there from the inception of the scheme.  I am not happy with how that operates.  Nevertheless, we cannot come in here and have an L and H type point-scoring debate across the floor totally divorced from the economic reality outside this House.  The question must be asked, if the civil legal aid scheme deteriorated steadily from the early eighties onwards, and it did &mdash; and the Opposition admitted that it did &mdash; why did the Government who took office in November 1982 not provide the necessary funding year by year, to improve the service?  Why did that Government decide not to introduce a comprehensive civil legal aid and advice scheme?  A partial or an attempted explanation, which I suggest is misconceived to some extent, is contained in the 1986 report at paragraph 3, section 4 where the legal aid board states:</P>
    <P>The Board fully appreciates that the inadequacy of funds to run essential public services is nothing new at the present time and that many would see it as part of the price that has to be paid for putting the public finances in better shape.  The legal aid service came into being just at the time when pressure on public funds became acute. It has not, therefore, been a question of cutting back on an existing provision which was deemed overgenerous but of having a completely underdeveloped service cut up in a general policy of public expenditure containment.</P>
    <P>That statement is factually correct except that it overlooks one very essential detail <Col N="223" /> and it is this: the policy of public service containment only began in reality in 1987 when the minority Fianna Fáil Government took office.  That was when the real policy of public expenditure containment was put into effect.  Therefore, that explanation for the inadequacy of the present civil legal aid and advice scheme can only apply to the scheme as it has existed and has been funded from 1987 onwards.</P>

      <P>Certainly we heard talk about public expenditure containment in 1982.  We heard more talk about it in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986.  What happened in the meantime?  The fact is that between November 1982 and 1987 when they left office the Coalition Government borrowed £12 billion and doubled the national debt.  I have the figures for the provision for the grant-in-aid, year by year, here.  They provided less than £6 million of that borrowed money to the civil legal aid and advice scheme, less than one half of 1 per cent.  I can give another statistic which will not suit them. As a result of that borrowing, the additional interest which the Minister for Finance has to meet every year in his Budget Statement is £1.2 billion.  One per cent of that £1.2 billion would provide a comprehensive system of civil legal aid and advice each year.  That is the reality.</P>

    <P>The scheme in Limerick is not operating as I would like and the system in Portlaoise is not operating as Deputy Flanagan would like, but the reality is that we have to get the system operating smoothly first.

      <P>The Opposition certainly will not win the vote tonight.  I want to read some figures into the record.</P>
      <P>From 1982 to 1983 the Coalition Government only provided an extra measly £90,000 of taxpayers' money for the civil legal aid and advice scheme. Between 1983 and 1984 they increased the grant-in-aid by the magnificent sum of £72,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 1985 and 1986 they increased the provision by a measly 4 per cent &mdash; I will not shame them by giving the actual figure.  Between 1986 and 1987, when the policy of public expenditure curtailment took effect, the grant-in-aid was dropped by £95,000, but between 1987 and 1988 it was increased by 18 per cent.  There was another marginal drop between 1988 and 1989 but between 1989 and 1990 the grant-in-aid was increased by 25 per cent.  In terms of the taxpayers' money being provided, the grant-in-aid now stands 25 per cent higher than it did when the Fine Gael dominated Government left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various points have been made by Members from the Opposition benches but I have given the facts.  Some of the Opposition speakers who spoke about inadequate funding, etc., have been damned by the reports from the Legal Aid Board which show that the situation has been allowed to go right into the ground.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, on having persuaded the Cabinet, at a time of real public expenditure curtailment, to <Col N="225" /> increase the grant-in-aid by a massive 25 per cent between 1989 and 1990.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion overlooks the fact that there is another legal aid system in operation, the criminal legal aid system.  That system cost the State £2.5 million in 1989 and will cost £2.75 million in 1990.  The total allocation by the Government for legal aid in the current year will slightly exceed £5 million.</P>
      <P>Many complaints have been made by Members from the opposite side about the inadequacy of the allocation on the civil legal aid side, but I would say to the Minister that there has been a waste of money on the criminal legal aid side.  I have seen people who have availed of criminal legal aid coming back for the umpteenth time to the courts in Limerick to avail of this scheme.  Some of these hardened criminals depend constantly on the taxpayers to defend them when they are in trouble.  I have read the Supreme Court decision in the case of the State, Healy v. Donoghue, 1976, and I say to the Minister for Justice that I do not see anything in the judgment of any of the members of the Supreme Court in that case which would prevent him from looking at that sort of situation to see if he could deny those people legal aid when they come back after a certain number of times.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the public service embargo.  In their 1983-84 report, the Legal Aid Board stated, in relation to the public service embargo:</P>
      <P>The embargo has not been lifted in so far as the Legal Aid Board is concerned and still stands as a threat, therefore, to the Board's ability to maintain services at their present inadequate levels.</P>
      <P>That should dispel any illusions that all the problems started in 1987.  I was delighted last night to hear the Minister for Justice saying, having acquired the approval of the Government, that all the solicitor vacancies and most of the administrative vacancies would be filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> Now that the end of the public service embargo is in sight due to the resolute action of the Government between 1987-89, I want to draw the Minister's attention to the particular needs of the civil legal aid and advice scheme in this regard. Reference was made by Members from the opposite side of the House to extending civil legal aid to other tribunals.  That is a good point but I would point out &mdash; Deputy Kavanagh made a very good point in this respect last night &mdash; that the present civil legal aid system is not reaching a great many people and the people in rural areas in particular, who are the furthest from the law centres, are discriminated against.  If we extend the increased funding we propose to give to the civil legal aid and advice scheme to other tribunals, we will only fortify and enforce the discrimination which already exists against those people.  Our first priority must be to get the present system operating smoothly, then expand it and finally extend it to other tribunals.  I strongly believe it should be extended to other tribunals.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the informality of certain other tribunals, but I do not think this applies to the Unemployment Appeals Tribunal or to the Social Welfare Appeals Tribunal in some cases.  The intention may be that these hearings should be informal but they can have very profound consequences on the people who appear before them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the 25 per cent increase in funding at a time of continuing public expenditure curtailment. Our priority should now be &mdash; and the Government have already embarked upon this road &mdash; to get the present system operating properly, as a next step to expand it and as a final step to extend it to other tribunals to take account of the present social, economic and legal reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Dea for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Dea said the problems in our civil legal aid system are not new.  If we read any of the reports which have <Col N="227" /> been published from day one, it will be obvious that this scheme has been starved of funding.  I was never a fan of the civil legal aid system and I believe that the concept and the way it has been handled are wrong.  There is a crisis in the system and the Minister should look at this concept again.  I will refer to this matter later.</P>
    <P>It ill behoves the Opposition, particularly Fine Gael and Labour, to castigate the Minister in view of their abysmal record in regard to the funding of the civil legal aid system.  It is obvious that the funds of suitors mechanism was used by them to start a number of new centres around the country.  Unfortunately, they had no forward planning and they spent money without any commitment for Exchequer funding in later years.  It was obvious that once they had spent the money under the Funds of Suitors Act there would be no more funds for a considerable time and some Government would face problems in the future.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister increased this allocation by 25 per cent in this year's budget.  It is nonsense and very unfair to say that the Minister had done nothing. Given that there has been a hold on public finances, an increase of 25 per cent is sizeable.  I congratulate the Minister on providing this extra funding.  The extra staff who will be employed as a result of this allocation will help to improve the present system.  This will be a stop-gap and will help to get the scheme back on the rails for the time being.  As I said earlier, the Minister should consider revamping the scheme completely. Something in the region of £2.16 million is allocated to this scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea referred earlier to the criminal legal aid scheme which I believe is working very well.  A sum in the region of £2.75 million will be spent on that scheme in the current year which has been designed to deal with the problems which face disadvantaged people when they have to appear in court on criminal charges.  The scheme on those lines should be considered.</P>
    <P>There are a number of criticisms that I have to make about the present system. <Col N="228" /> The vast majority of our population are not aware that this scheme exists and quite a number are not aware of their legal rights.  Despite this no attempt is being made to inform people of their legal rights by way of this scheme.  This is a matter which should be looked at when we come to consider the question of funding in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The scheme as presently drafted only covers financial inequality.  There are other types of inequality which should be covered, such as inequality of access.  As Deputy O'Dea pointed out, people who have to attend law centres live quite a distance away.  This is another matter which should be addressed in the future. There is no doubt that the scheme has laboured because of limited resources and unless there is a massive injection of cash into the scheme, with centres located in every major urban settlement, it will never function properly.</P>
    <P>No provision is made for the taking of test cases on various items which come up from time to time.  This is one of the major flaws in the scheme.  Our laws can impinge upon the rights of the less well off and disadvantaged who do not necessarily have access to the legal system because of financial constraints.  This is impinging on the working of the scheme and one of the reasons it is not meeting people's needs.</P>
    <P>Some criticism should also be levelled at the board because of the way in which they have handled their affairs in recent years.  I understand that they have not issued reports or audited accounts for the last number of years.  They should be made to answer for this and should bring out detailed audited accounts so that we will be able to see where money is being spent.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made of the fact that there are people who cannot gain access to the legal system.  This is slightly unfair to the legal profession and I make no apology for saying so.  I am a member of the legal profession, but in my experience solicitors have on occasion provided their services free of charge.  I do not agree that they should be provided on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  If people provide <Col N="229" /> their services they should be paid but the reality is that disadvantaged people are afforded the facility of visiting a solicitor free of charge.  In 1969 the younger members of the legal profession established FLAC, the free legal advice centres. In fact I was a member of the one in Dundalk when it was first established. These have worked well but, unfortunately, they do not have the capability to bring actions to the courts.  The Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, this year and in previous years, have requested each solicitor to make a voluntary subscription of at least £10 towards the cost of running the free legal advice centres which are staffed by barristers and solicitors on a voluntary basis.  There are a number of these around the country, including one in my home town of Dundalk.</P>
    <P>When discussing a possible solution to the problem we should take as a model the Coolock Law Centre which is now distinct and separate from FLAC.  During the years this has been built up to be a very efficient advice and law centre.  I understand it is working very well.  I was in contact with it quite recently and have been led to understand that it is meeting the needs of the community in that area which is probably one of the biggest urban areas in the country.  It is providing a very valuable service in Coolock.  This centre has been to the forefront in the campaign to have some of our legislation changed and has taken a number of test cases. This is to be lauded.  One of the flaws in the present scheme is that test cases cannot be taken.  The Coolock Law Centre was funded down through the years by the Department of Social Welfare by way of grants but I understand for the past four years it has been funded in full by the Combat Poverty Agency. Its staff is made up on one solicitor and quite a number of administrative staff. This is the model the Minister should look at.</P>
    <P>While this would not represent the ultimate solution it would represent a far better one than the one before us.  It would act as an interim solution until a final solution could be found.  The Minister adverted to this in his speech when <Col N="230" /> he referred, in relation to access to solicitors, to off-the-street solicitors.  This is akin to the criminal legal aid system which all practitioners are free to avail of.  Initially they had a difficult time when such a scheme was introduced in Britain. When they found it was too liberal they put strictures on it.  We would need to ensure that expenditure on such a scheme would be curtailed.  Ultimately the only way disadvantaged people in every corner of the country will be able to gain access to the legal system is to pay solicitors on a case by case basis.  Such a scheme would have to be along the lines of the present civil legal aid scheme with people being means tested.  Regardless of what Government are in power such a scheme will have to be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that the Minister worked wonders in obtaining a 25 per cent increase in the funds to be made available to this scheme which will help in getting it back on the rails and keeping the various centres open.  A solicitor visits the centre in my own home town once every two weeks.  This is not adequate in a town the size of Dundalk which has a population of between 30,000 and 35,000 people.  It needs a centre and it was promised one way back in 1982.  However it did not get it.  As I said, this scheme will not work and the Minister will have to consider putting in place a better system which of necessity will have to be akin to the one being operated in Britain at present.</P>

      <P>I would like to speak to our amendment which expands on the idea contained in the Labour Party motion.  It seeks the establishment of a comprehensive range of services and highlights some aspects which need to be addressed.  It reads as follows: <Col N="231" /> to appoint adequate staff to deal with future workload; to enable the establishment of a nationwide network of legal aid and advice outlets; and to provide for the establishment and development of community law centres in major urban areas.</P>
      <P>I have been led to understand by the Labour Party spokesman that they have no difficulty with this amendment as it is merely an expansion of their amendment and highlights some of the central features which need to be dealt with when it comes to considering the allocation of funds and how they should be added.  I welcome the initiative of the Labour Party in taking up this very important matter for debate in Private Members' time to advance the issue on a very comprehensive motion.  Having said that, I regret the circumstances in which this House has been forced to consider and debate the provision of civil legal aid.  It arises directly from the resignations of three eminent members of the Legal Aid Board, the current Chairman of the Bar Council, Mr. Niall Fennelly, Senior Counsel, the President of the Law Society, Mr. Ernest Margetson and a barrister member Ms. Fidelma Macken.  The very definite action taken by these members should merit the support of every Member of this House.</P>
      <P>Even if we do not agree with the whys and wherefores of the Motion before the House, we should respect the fact that three long serving, conscientious and eminent lawyers took a very hard decision, after long and hard deliberation, to highlight the fact that they could not continue with the job that has been asked of them because of the disarray in the service.  It is important that we acknowledge that what they did was entirely correct and fully deserving of our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally it should be stated from this House tonight that we would hope no member of the professions in particular or of the public would assume their places on the Legal Aid Board on an opportunistic basis if invited to do so.  I would <Col N="232" /> suggest that any potential appointee or invitee to the board would take up such a position only at a time when he or she is satisfied that the Government are prepared to meet their commitment to the legal aid service in the way this House would expect.</P>
    <P>I would address those wavering members of the Legal Aid Board who I know are looking for a lead by saying bluntly to them that in view of the Minister's response, as read on his behalf by the Minister for Social Welfare last night, it is incumbent upon them to stand square with their colleagues who have departed the Legal Aid Board and do likewise.  I would certainly welcome such an action because it would help to accentuate, on behalf of those working in the field, that the Minister's response last night was a derisory, appalling and mealy-mouted effort which does not deserve the continued support and respect of those people who work, in large part on a voluntary basis, on the current Legal Aid Board.  Let them resign and let the Minister face squarely the situation he has created.</P>
    <P>The debate that has gone on here over the last couple of hours, and indeed last night, is rapidly losing sight of the central issue in this debate.  We have listened to tit-for-tat remarks about inaction flying backwards and forwards across the floor of the House.  We have listened to copious quotations from the annual reports of the Legal Aid Board &mdash; the last one available was in 1986.  Just imagine that a national agency does not have the money to keep us up to date.  The last time that they could find the resources, time and energy to report to this House, to which they are obliged to report, was in 1986. Is that not a sad reflection indeed?</P>
    <P>We are beginning to lose sight of the central issue, that legal aid as an institution and as a right is essential to the fight against poverty in this State.  The issue was best put in an article by Gerry Whyte, an academic in Trinity College writing in 1986 in the <i>Dublin University Law Journal.</i> I borrowed this quotation from a submission from the then Senator Robinson when this debate took place <Col N="233" /> three years ago in the Upper House.  The speech delivered by the Minister last night was, in all respects, similar to that delivered by Deputy Dukes when he was Minister for Justice.  The words may have changed slightly but there was not a jot of difference between the words and sentences. Speaking on the central role that legal aid as a right and as a facility plays in combating poverty and in aiding those afflicted by poverty to challenge their situation, Mr. Whyte said at column 67, volume 114 of the Official Seanad Debates:</P>
    <P>It is submitted that one of the ways in which the problem of poverty can be tackled is through the use of the law on behalf of the underprivileged.  In this context, the law can operate at a number of different levels.  At a very basic level, individuals need access to the law in order to vindicate existing income-generating rights, e.g. right to redundancy pay, right to monetary compensation for injuries suffered in road accidents, etc.  Obviously an award of money following on legal intervention can alleviate poverty in individual cases, and the impact of the law at this level can be enhanced through the use of class actions and test cases on behalf of underprivileged litigants sharing a common problem.</P>
    <P>But the law is also capable of tackling the problem of poverty at a more profound level by redressing the imbalance of power which exists between the haves and the have nots through the creation of substantial rights for the underprivileged.  One of the most subtle, and yet most disturbing, aspects of poverty is the powerlessness of the victims, the manner in which their plight deprives them of any control over their destinies.  Legal aid will allow such people to vindicate such rights as they already have under the law.  Furthermore an effective legal aid scheme should be able to identify those areas where reform is needed to build up a corpus of rights inhering in the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>I do not think the case could be put more <Col N="234" /> strongly.  We are talking here not about increasing the numbers of lawyers employed, not about squandering taxpayers' money, but of enhancing a scheme that would help the under-privileged fight their condition through the courts and other tribunals.</P>
    <P>A second central feature of the scheme of legal aid is that it is an element to help us work towards democracy in our society and to give real meaning to that concept. The former Attorney General of America, Mr. Robert Kennedy, could not have put it better when, in an article written in 1966 shortly before he died, he said &ldquo;Justice denied is democracy delayed&rdquo;. Our so called democratic system recognises the right of legal redress as central to the method of solving civil and community disputes.  If we deny equality before the law, it would deny people the right of access to the courts, the right to equal treatment before the law and of rights and advice about those rights, and we are attacking the very democracy that we say is so important to our society.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that, if nothing else, we are talking about the fact that this country was found in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  We are in breach of this convention in the area of legal aid.  The Airey case established that.  In regard to rights of access to the court under Article 6 we were found to be in breach; under Article 8, on the protection of family life, we were also found wanting because Mrs. Airey could not get adequate redress under the law as it existed and under the system of access that was available here.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a lot more in this debate than simple pounds, shillings and pence.  The scheme was implemented not simply in response to the Airey case; we have to recognise that there was a substantial campaign up to the commissioning of the Pringle report.  FLAC had been in existence since 1969 as a student cum professional organisation campaigning and working in the field. Law students' Union for Action, a group in UCD, the socialist lawyers' group I was associated with as a student and as a practitioner, all campaigned with the <Col N="235" /> community groups Deputy Fennell and others mentioned, including AIM.  All these organisations recognised the need for a system that would help to achieve a fair hearing for all.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to listen yet again to the Minister and to others who attempt to write off in the history of legal aid the importance of the Airey case, to write off the fact that we are a party to an international Treaty on Human Rights and that we have duties and obligations in the context of that treaty.  We will find ourselves back in Europe very quickly unless the Government act along the lines this motion demands because there is no other effective resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>We do not have to go to the 26 Counties or to the 18 of them that have no service whatever, no office opened, no solicitor practicing under the limited schemes, to find cases that would lead us directly back before the European Court and to be condemned by the international community.</P>
    <P>Within the system itself an example brought to me from one of the Dublin centres recently is of a woman who had been taken on as qualified for legal aid and entitled to all the services available and who spent upwards of three years with a law centre here pursuing those rights through the tortuous family law procedures.  What then happened?  The solicitor assigned to her case in the centre took up employment elsewhere, departed and was not replaced.  All that solicitor's workload was abandoned, dropped, until the Legal Aid Board with the union representatives and the solicitors could sit down and decide how a three-person unit, now back to two solicitors, could hope to carry the extra workload.  When they were up to their proverbial necks themselves in their own work they were expected to take up this workload.  As a result that woman waited until, after a year and a half, a further solution was followed on her behalf.  In the meantime her husband, who had been judically separated from her by the courts and had gone off to lead a separate life, managed to register £13,000 of a debt on the family <Col N="236" /> home because she was not able to get back into court to have the house passed into her own single name.  If that woman gets no satisfaction from the High or Supreme Courts on appeal will she disgrace this country before the European Court of Human Rights, as she is qualified and eligible for and is supposed to be currently enjoying the services of the legal aid scheme?</P>
    <P>The issue comes down to two things. The first is the embargo.  The Minister has called that into play, saying that every other area of the Civil Service has had to suffer the cutting knife of the embargo. The embargo was totally inappropriate and should never have been visited on the civil legal aid scheme.  Just when the scheme was being instituted and put on its feet and the Minister of the day said we were going simply to set up a pilot scheme, get it working smoothly, and then we would go on with the other things that needed to be done such as setting up the statutory basis and setting up the community network as a back-up, what happens?  They come in with this blunt embargo and say that should anyone become ill, should anyone depart the service, for whatever reason, to other employment, on a career break or whatever or should the board themselves want to expand into areas of urgent need, it could not be done because of this embargo.  In some long-standing State agencies where, units and services were overstaffed, it was perhaps appropriate and could have worked in this cause of efficiency, but in the legal aid service which had been only started and we were feeling our way, this blunt instrument has wrought havoc and was wholly inappropriate and ill-advised.  How do you deal with what I have described where one day we have two or three solicitors and the next day none or one fewer?  You cannot tell courts or clients or people in need that they have to wait.  Court lists go on, actions continue, rights have to be vindicated, and the embargo simply could not be implemented without causing the injustices we have talked about.</P>
    <P>The second item in this issue is the question of cost.  We are told we cannot <Col N="237" /> afford more money, but £5 million as the overall amount to be spent by this Government in any one year on legal aid for people who cannot afford to pay for it is remarkably good value.  In every court in every dispute where legal aid is an entitlement at every level, in every county you can get criminal defence and civil legal aid as it works currently for £5 million.  Compare that to the so-called eradication of bovine TB which has cost the State since its inception £1 billion and will continue to be a cost to the State. Consider that this Government are proposing to spend on the hiring of a jet for their own convenience over the next six months more money than they are prepared to spend in the same period in the civil legal aid scheme.  What price justice and how can any Deputy suggest that we are spending too much money on vindicating the rights, of the under-privileged and those who cannot afford access and equal treatment before the law when facts suggest we are prepared to lease a jet for £1.5 million for six months and we begrudge spending an equivalent amount over three years for legal aid?  This Government must abandon this argument about the cost elements and recognise that they are getting remarkable value, draining every ounce of flesh and blood from those people who are working and expected to continue to work in the law centres around the country.  What the Government are doing is a disgrace.  They are abusing people's rights and privileges. That should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I cannot conclude without passing a remark on the absence of the Progressive Democrats Deputies who in Opposition in this House a short time ago made political careers shedding crocodile tears on behalf of the workers and people employed in the law centres.  We have not heard from them and, seeing their vacant seats here tonight, I do not suppose we will see them before the end of tonight's debate.</P>
    <P>The Government projected themselves as a Government of new things and a new economic environment.  Let them forget this argument of reproaching Fine Gael and the Labour Party when in <Col N="238" /> Government for not having done what the Legal Aid Board had to do.  They say they are a Government of new departure, that the tide is rising, all boats will rise together.  Recently the Minister for Social Welfare suggested that perhaps the raft upon which poverty stricken people find themselves does not rise as quickly as the boats of others who are well off.  It is time to recognise that under-privileged people who need aid in the social area should get particular attention and the argument that because the Coalition Government did not do it is inappropriate to the Government's posturing as a Government who claim to care, who say there is a change in fortunes because of their own good management, so called.  They cannot stand back and say that the hair shirt imposed previously is the one they are going to continue to wear.</P>
    <P>In regard to the motion and the amendment, there is need for adequate staff now and for future needs and an end to the stop-gap mechanism of employing one here and another there.  There is a need for the establishment of a national network to ensure that at least every county has an outlet for the provision of legal aid and service, and ultimately the community law centre is the only scheme that will deliver cost-effective and meaningful legal services to the community.</P>
    <P>I cannot avoid remarking on Deputy Ahern's suggestion that the Coolock Law Centre is the model.  I pay the greatest regard to that centre, but let me tell the Deputy they asked this Government for £120,000 to run their centre for the current year.  They deliver incomparable service to the people of north Dublin.  For no accountable reason they were given £70,000, a little over half of what they looked for.  That reflects the mealy-mouthedness shortsightedness and totally unexplained attitude of this Government to legal aid as a fundamental right. Having listened to Deputy Ahern I say to him and those like him in the Fianna Fáil group that they could not in the face of their remarks vote against the motion proposed by the Labour Party here tonight.  I urge support of it from everyone in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Like my colleague Deputy McCartan, I see the civil legal aid scheme as a method of formulating an attack on poverty.  Too many people who are poor and underprivileged encounter the law only when it seems to be working against them.  The law, like the Ritz, seems to be open to all if you have the ability to pay for it, and a great many people in our society do not have the ability no matter how low legal costs are &mdash; and they are not low &mdash; to pay for them.  People caught in a poverty trap find themselves in incredible numbers being penalised in court for not having a television licence, not being able to pay car tax or whatever, matters that the privileged and wealthy in our society can sign away to petty cash. For someone who has to pay £60 for not having a television licence it could mean not having food on the table at the end of the week.</P>
      <P>The civil legal aid scheme is designed to allow the law to be used on behalf of the under-privileged, first through giving them access to the law, access to justice, and secondly by redressing the balance of power between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; by creating substantial rights for the underprivileged.  It is a question of the redistribution of the taxes which the rest of us are paying.</P>
      <P>The last piecemeal development in the scheme was the establishment of four new centres, one in my constituency in Tallaght.  Tallaght has a population in excess of 80,000 people and, believe it or not, until quite recently there were virtually no solicitors of any kind there, presumably because the pickings were not rich enough for solicitors.  That situation has improved somewhat, if &ldquo;improved&rdquo; is the term.  The law centre opened in 1987 has been providing an excellent service, although the staff are grossly overworked.  It would have gone out of existence were it not for the provision of £400,000 last autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest that the extent of the problem in my constituency is greatly different from that in many other constituencies. There is no exaggerating the extent of problems and the very scope of <Col N="240" /> this scheme is so limited that many of those problems cannot be dealt with anyway.  In so far as they can be dealt with, employment could be provided for twice as many solicitors and the necessary administrative and back-up staff.  At the moment one cannot tell people with any confidence to go to the law centre in Tallaght at any given time because it may not be open and providing a service because of the workload of cases being handled.  It does little good to tell people in Tallaght that if they go to Ormond Quay they may get attention.  That is how hard pressed the Tallaght centre is.  There is a desperate need for additional staff. The fact that social welfare and other such cases cannot be taken is a serious blow to people in my constituency, where many areas suffer an unemployment rate of 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>The number of cases related to marital problems and marital breakdown is enormous. In a country that does not admit of the existence of marital problems, the provision of the law centres is a necessary Godsend, yet in many parts of the country there is no such facility.  People coming with marital problems are already under serious stress.  The pressure on the centre in Tallaght is such that they cannot be guaranteed a service without at least an inordinate delay.</P>
    <P>It is entirely wrong that the embargo should be adduced as a reason for not supplying adequate staff to such law centres as currently exist.  The embargo has completely outlived its usefulness.  It was originally a blunt instrument which had no regard to where vacancies would occur in the public service, whether people were doing productive, necessary jobs or, as in this case, providing an essential service.  No price can be placed on access to justice.  It is a disgrace that it is being suggested in this House that a price should be placed on such access.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support The Workers' Party amendment because it is specific on the question of adequate staffing.  The Labour Party motion is a good one and this is a matter of which one has most <Col N="241" /> experience in one's area.  The fundamental principle of equality before the law is established in our Constitution.  In order to uphold the principle it is essential that every person should have the opportunity to assert his or her right.  In practice, however, many people are deprived of awareness of and advice regarding their rights and of skilled representation before courts and tribunals.  The £425,000 over the grant for 1989 do no more than provide for the replacement of staff who have left the service over the past ten years through natural wastage or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I am very surprised, although I suppose I should not be, that the Minister of State and all the other Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches can defend the indefensible in this case.  They must all be well aware of the problems resulting from lack of finance and lack of manpower.</P>
      <P>The law centre in the North Mall in Cork was unmanned last year for almost six months because the person who works there was on maternity leave or annual leave.  The South Mall centre was also out of action for some time.  A person came from the Cork centre to work in the Mallow centre just once every month for three months.  That centre was obviously not adequately covered.  Is that providing a service for the people who are crying out for civil legal aid?  Great work is being done by the solicitors involved in the service and their workload is increasing rapidly as a result of new legislation dealing with family law reform, judicial separation and adoption.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party motion is timely. The Workers' Party amendment calls for the appointment of adequate staff to deal with the present and future workload of those involved in the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  This is urgent due to the lack of finance and the lack of awareness of the rights of the people who are depending on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the Minister's amendment to the Motion, it is very important that we look back to the period when the committee on civil legal <Col N="242" /> aid and advice were established and when they presented their report.</P>
      <P>The committee were appointed on 10 June 1974 by the then Minister for Justice, Patrick Cooney.  Their function was as follows:</P>
      <P>To advise on the introduction at an early date of a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice in civil matters, and to recommend on the form, nature and administration of the scheme and on the legislation necessary to establish it.</P>
      <P>To consider whether, pending the introduction of a fully comprehensive scheme, it would be desirable and possible to develop, as a matter of urgency, a system of legal advice centres and legal aid in certain categories of cases, which the committee considered merited immediate consideration.</P>
      <P>To estimate the cost of the scheme or schemes proposed and advise on the manner in which such scheme or schemes could be financed, including the possibility of contribution from legally aided persons and from persons having a legal objection to provide for or to compensate such persons.</P>
      <P>In December 1977, Justice Pringle presented to the new Minister for Justice, Deputy Gerry Collins, the report of the Committee on Civil Legal Aid and Advice.  The civil legal aid scheme was introduced two years later, on a non-statutory basis and while many of the rules in the scheme are in line with recommendations contained in the Pringle report, quite a number of the recommendations were omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the scheme was to allow persons of limited means to avail themselves of legal services.  There is evidence to suggest that even the Pringle committee recognised that, although civil legal aid and advice was necessry, the cost of the scheme was of vital importance.  It was proposed that contributions should be payable because it would tend to deter people from attempting to use the scheme to pursue frivolous cases.  Contributions would help to reduce the cost <Col N="243" /> of the scheme and it would also extend the scheme to persons in higher income groups.  If the committee, which was set up to examine the civil legal aid and advice scheme, could recognise that the cost of the scheme was of vital importance, is it not a terrible pity that the Opposition parties cannot show the same type of understanding?</P>
    <P>I listened last night, and again tonight, to Deputies putting forward proposals as to how we might improve the scheme and, of course, money was no object.  It sounds great, a party calling for additional resources for all existing law centres. There are a number of Deputies in the House who are very vocal when it comes to spending money but remain very silent when we are looking for ways of collecting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy ways of collecting it in his own constituency, for example, take a few bob from the farmers.</P>

It is about time that these Deputies copped themselves on and realised that the gates to Tír na nÓg are closed.  There is general agreement throughout the country that we must continue to exercise restraint in regard to public expenditure.  The reality is that the Minister has made a 25 per cent increase in the grant for the coming year.  This increase amounts to £425,000 and we must acknowledge that it is a very substantial increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not for one minute <Col N="244" /> say that this grant will solve all the problems of the civil legal aid scheme.  The chairman, in the board's annual report for 1983-84, stated that the central problem was inadequate funding.  Is it not peculiar that the Government who were in charge then and had an opportunity to amend the situation did nothing but now that they are on the other side of the House they are full of ideas?  Let us not fool ourselves or anyone else and admit that it will be a number of years before this or any future Government will be in a position to provide the type of funding that would allow the legal aid scheme to provide the type of comprehensive national service that was envisaged at its introduction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh suggested last night that local private solicitors should be employed where there are no legal aid offices and I feel that his suggestion deserves serious consideration as it could save money and time.  Eventually, I would like to see the civil legal aid scheme run along similar lines to the criminal legal aid system.  Is it not ironic that we are prepared to provide legal aid for the criminal while a citizen who may be attempting to vindicate himself or herself may be denied access to the courts?  This is certainly not a case where justice prevails.</P>
      <P>To answer the question that was thrown at me, coming from a county where there is no civil legal aid centre, I have seen numerous cases where the people involved are entitled to civil legal aid but because of the inconvenience in travelling to Dublin they refuse the aid and try to come to some arrangement with their own solicitor.  More often than not, the solicitor provides the aid or advice for little or no charge.  I would take this opportunity of paying tribute to the solicitors and barristers who provide this type of service to the less well off in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the amount of funding going towards the provision of legal aid and advice is not as much as most of us would like.  However, it must be acknowledged that this year's grant increase of £425,000 will prove to be a major boost to the <Col N="245" /> civil legal aid scheme and enable them to recruit an extra seven solicitors and 13 administrative staff.  While I would like to see some changes in the present scheme, I look forward to an expansion of the service which in turn should benefit the whole country and not just the major urban areas which it serves at present.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Spring for giving me a few minutes of his time.  I have not come into this House to cause trouble or to disrupt the debate but I would be lacking in my sense of duty and responsibility as a public representative if I did not say that this is a timely Bill and point out some glaring injustices in our society and in our legal system as a whole.  The motion is nothing more than a response to widespread suffering and distress in our community. As in so many other areas of life, money guarantees access to privilege and to the law.  People with money can hire the best legal brains in the country but without money, it is a matter of catch as catch can and every Member of this House knows that very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experiences in Limerick are worth detailing.  My office in Limerick is a very busy one.  It is a few minutes walk away from the Free Legal Aid Centre in O'Connell Street but despite that fact I have been there only about six times since the office was opened some years ago.  My experiences there were most unhappy. I went there usually with poor and old people who needed immediate legal help but had no money to pay for it.  On all the occasions I went there I never met one solicitor and that might sound odd.  I could meet the Taoiseach any day and he would give me a hearing but I could not see a solicitor in my own city despite the fact that I have been a public representative and a senior alderman on the corporation for a long time.  On one occasion <Col N="246" /> the person with me was told by the receptionist to come back in three, four or six months' time.  Some of the people who go there are old and might not be alive in six months' time but that does not matter.  The receptionist told me that the waiting list was so long that the solicitor could not meet the people and neither could he meet me.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago I was in the Dáil when a woman was evicted from her house in Limerick.  When she went to the Free Legal Aid Centre she was told that nothing could be done for her because she was not on the list.  My fellow councillor in Limerick from the DSP, Councillor John O'Sullivan, had to go to Sixmilebridge Court to have the case adjourned because there was nobody to represent the woman.  I am not blaming the staff of this office &mdash; I am sure they are over-burdened &mdash; but that is my experience of dealing with that centre in Limerick, and I challenge anybody to say otherwise.  I have seen many other examples of people suffering in the city of Limerick and sometimes I have taken them to solicitors and helped to pay for the service because that was the only alternative open to me.  I will not go into other case histories because I have not got the time to do so.</P>
    <P>We all know that this scheme has not worked and that it should be reviewed immediately.  Indeed, the entire legal system needs to be radically reformed and restructured.  There is no good for any Government not doing so.  I know there will be powerful obstacles in the way because there are very powerful and influential people with vested interests in this area.  Unfortunately, there is a good deal of freemansonry among members of the legal profession which does not always work in the interests of the ordinary people, and more is the pity.  Essentially laws are enacted to protect people's rights and property, nothing more and nothing less.  The job of the legal profession is to serve people but unfortunately this service does not always meet the needs of the people.  It is often forgotten that members of the legal profession owe a good deal to the community <Col N="247" /> at large, particularly the taxpayers who subsidise their education and indeed the education of other professions also. Unfortunately, the members of the legal profession give little or nothing back to the community when they become successful.</P>
    <P>Without running down solicitors, sometimes many of them do not find it worthwhile or profitable to practice in the courts.  They are into buying property and so on.  How often do we see young solicitors becoming almost like stock brokers, buying property in different places? They have very little commitment to social justice.  We certainly need more solicitors but we need those who are committed to social justice.  In this debate the legal profession can stand aside and say they will leave the matter to the politicians but surely they have a right and a duty to provide solutions to these problems before us.  I would like to see more commitment to social justice by solicitors and barristers in our society.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have not more time to relate some aspects of my experience in this regard.  I have a lot of experience representing people before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Perhaps I have had more cases before the tribunal than anybody else in this country and I have won about 60 per cent of them, although I am not a lawyer, a legal eagle or a barrister.  There is no reason a person with common sense cannot be an advocate and represent people at certain levels.  One would not need to be an Einstein to represent somebody before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I am not against solicitors and barristers going there.  It has become a very lucrative field for them too.  Ordinary people can also go there.</P>
    <P>It would be a good idea for ordinary people to get involved in the family courts system because there is no reason people should be mystified or overawed by the legal profession or by any profession. Common sense will carry one a long way. With the reform of our legal system there is no reason clergymen, social workers, trade union officials, community leaders <Col N="248" /> and public representatives should not represent people at certain levels.  The legal system is too much of a closed shop. As night follows day it follows that a solicitor must engage a barrister sometimes unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>I see a former member of the legal profession becoming impatient with me so I had better desist before my time runs out.  When I get time from Deputy Spring or anybody else I come to this House to call the shots as I see them and to speak the truth.  I hope my words are reported and heard.  There is a lot more I could say about this matter but I will let it go at that.</P>

      <P>In winding up this debate on behalf of the Labour Party, I thank Members who contributed to this debate which has been universally welcomed and which has been accepted by all sides of the House as being timely.  I thank Fine Gael for their support for the motion and in relation to The Workers' Party amendment which complements the motion, I have no difficulty in accepting it.  I thank Members of the Fianna Fáil Party for their contributions most of which were, to say the least, ambiguous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, including the last speaker, said they wanted to see an expansion of the service. They accepted that the service is faltering and is in chaos, and then we had lectures about fiscal rectitude.  The reality is that most of the Government speakers outlined the difficulties they have experienced in relation to the service.  We are having this debate because the service is in a shambles.  I had hoped for more enlightenment in the Government's attitude but unfortunately their attitude to this service is the same as to the health services.  I wonder how bad things have to be before somebody on the Government side stands up and admits there is a crisis. Despite the fact that in the health area people are hanging from the rafters, the Minister says there is no crisis and he continues to say it despite the overwhelming perception of all the people that there is a crisis.  Likewise this evening the Fianna Fáil line is that there is no <Col N="249" /> problem, that the Minister is giving more money this year &mdash; a sum which he claims is substantial &mdash; but which is really a Mickey Mouse sum when one takes into account the fact that the Funds of Suitors money which has been available over the last number of years is not available this year.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed on the Adjournment last November.  I raised the matter on the Adjournment because of the warnings given by the Chairman of the Legal Aid Board.  Unfortunately that discussion did not achieve any results. The chairman repeated his warning early this year and then had no choice but to resign, a decision which has been respected.  His resignation has been followed by other resignations and it appears that there are more resignations to come.  Like a previous speaker, I believe the others should resign in principle because the Government are not honouring their responsibility.  They are not providing an adequate legal aid service for the people who need it.</P>
    <P>We should also remember the people working in the service, the solicitors with vocations.  They could make more money more easily in private practice but out of a sense of public commitment they are soldiering on trying to provide a service despite innumerable obstacles and a continuing lack of support from the Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil want to have it both ways. They come into the House or go to Kanturk to announce that the economy is booming.  For whom is it booming?  The Minister for Finance comes into the House and gives £3.5 million for horses and dogs, and we cannot give an extra £1 million for the legal aid service.  We are denying people access to a service and recommending that they go to the races. They cannot afford to go anywhere.  They cannot afford to go to private practitioners and we are now ensuring that they will not have access to a legal aid system.</P>
    <P>This is a very important area of life somewhat on a par with the health services. The service is not something people go looking for because they wake up on <Col N="250" /> a sunny morning and decide that since it is a nice day they will go for legal aid. People do not look for legal services, particularly the least well off, as a matter of choice and certainly not as a matter of casual choice.  Usually people go looking for civil legal aid in desperation and they are told to come back in three month's time to be interviewed.  If they are lucky they might get an interview within six months, and even at that they have no guarantee of getting a service.</P>
    <P>I only wish that the Fianna Fáil Party and the substitute for the Minister for Justice could have accepted that the service is in crisis and is not in a position to provide a comprehensive nationwide range of services.  The budget of the legal aid scheme is about £4 million to cater for the needs of 1.5 million people.  We should compare that to the scheme in Northern Ireland where there is a budget of over £4 million to meet the needs of far fewer people.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kavanagh pointed out last night, the scheme employs 28 solicitors compared with 3,500 solicitors in private practice who would be available.  It is no wonder that there is a long waiting list and that the scheme is in crisis.  The Minister in his speech last night made great play of the amounts of money available. It is worth straightening out some of those figures.  In 1986 the sum provided was £1.562 million.  In 1987 the estimate was £1.745 million, which was underspent by £300,000 by the new Fianna Fáil Government. In 1988 the estimate represented a cut in real terms to £1.75 million.  In 1989 it was further cut in cash and in real terms to £1.738 million.  Only this year with the Minister's commitment is some attempt being made.  The earlier figures do not take account of the additional money which was provided to open the new centres and expand the service throughout the country.  Neither do the figures take account of the fact that the workload in these centres has increased dramatically. Every Deputy must know from his own experience in his clinics that the number of people now looking for the service is great and that the potential demand on the service as a result of the Judicial <Col N="251" /> Separation Act will be enormous.  It is also recognised, as stated by the Legal Aid Board, that 90 per cent of the existing workload arises in the area of family law.</P>
    <P>Leaving the figures aside, Members of this House would not deny that access to the courts and equality before the law is one of the bedrocks of our society, one of the bedrocks of our Constitution.  If we allow, as is happening, the Legal Aid Board to sink further into crisis we are simply saying that access to the law has been redefined as a privilege and not as a right.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing about the effect of this debate and the attitude taken by the Government is that we will be back here within six months because nothing will have been done.  I hope that somebody on behalf of the Government will communicate with the Minister for Justice on his return and let him know the views of 15 per cent of the Deputies of this House in relation to the service.  The <Col N="252" /> Minister for Justice and his colleague are not listening and refuse to recognise the serious problems that exist.  I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to introduce the scheme on a statutory footing but it does not go far enough.  It is one aspect of the motion before the House, unfortunately, it is being offered as a solution, but it is only a sop.</P>
    <P>I said that a sum of £1 million is needed. I do not understand how the Government can acknowledge the fact that the economy is booming, that there are millions of pounds available for horses and dogs but £1 million is not available to help the weakest in our society, people who need access to a legal aid scheme because they are desperate.  Unfortunately, the Government are turning a blind eye to their plight.  It is a disgraceful decision by the Government and one they will come to regret.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 62:</P>
    <P>In page 17, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.  Any development that is in material contravention of the development plan, adopted under Part III of the Principal Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Gilmore.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of amendments are being taken with amendment No. 62.  These amendments deal with whether or not compensation should be paid in cases where a development contravenes a development plan.  Amendment No. 62 proposes the insertion of a paragraph which would provide that any development which is in material contravention of a development plan would not be eligible for the payment of planning compensation.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the Minister's position under the original Bill has now been modified.  It seems the Minister is saying that planning compensation will not be paid if a development contravenes a development plan but with a number of provisos.  This is what I am worried about. The first proviso is that if a development complies with the development plan at any time within the five years previously it will be eligible for compensation.  There is a further proviso to that which relates to the point in time when a person acquires their interest in the land.  While this improves the position under the original Bill, which provided that land acquired after 20 October 1988 would not come under the scope of this Bill in so far as eligibility arising from a refusal because of a contravention of a development plan was concerned, it also leaves it open to some escape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal escape I see is in section 11 (b) which deals with the situation <Col N="258" /> where a person acquired his interest in the land after notice had been published about possible variations of the development plan.  I have put down a separate amendment to this which is a fall back if the Minister is not prepared to accept my first amendment which proposes that where a development contravenes a development plan there should not be a payment of compensation.  I believe there are very good reasons for this.</P>
    <P>The development plan is the principal democratic instrument used to decide on the planning and development of an area. The adoption of a development plan involves the elected representatives of the local authority and the public; it is on public display, it is a procedure which can last in some cases for a number of years and it is where the public come together to decide the planning priorities, and the zoning and development objectives of their area.  If a developer can claim compensation because planning permission has been refused which would contravene that development plan that process will be undermined.  There are very good reasons why a development plan and the process which leads up to its adoption should be strengthened.  There should not be any circumstances in which somebody can claim compensation because a development contravenes a development plan.  I have also put down an amendment to the Minister's amendment with which I will deal with after I have heard the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Gilmore has said.  I would confine such contraventions to those which had been obtained by way of section 4 in order to bring it back into line with the amendment which I tabled but which was ruled out of order.  It is possible that developments could be granted by way of material contravention which had general planning support.  In view of what Deputy Gilmore has said about such planning developments so obtained not being eligible for compensation, even the requirement under section 4 is an addition which may not be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point being made is that there are <Col N="259" /> far too many contraventions of development plans going on at present.  Dublin County Council, who have been referred to earlier, are an absolute disgrace in terms of the way their development plan is being written every day.  I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the merits of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to replace paragraph 9 of the Third Schedule as it was originally circulated.  This is one of the most important provisions in the Bill and is the most publicised one. The earlier paragraph 9 would have prevented access to planning compensation only where an applicant's interest in land was acquired after 20 October 1988, the date of publication of the Bill, and where the proposed development would have materially contravened a development objective which also applied to the land at the time it was acquired by the applicant. The earlier paragraph 9 also made exception for future land acquisitions arising through inheritance or family settlement. The restriction on planning compensation proposed by the earlier paragraph 9 was therefore limited in three ways.  First, it could only apply to persons who acquired their interest in land after 20 October 1988.  Second, it could only apply in so far as the development objective relating to the land remained the same between the time the land was acquired and the time the planning decision was made.  Third, it had to be waived for inheritance and family settlement cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new provisions will have much wider scope.  The amendment in principle will apply to all landowners and it establishes the general rule that refusal of development which would contravene a current zoning objective will be non-compensatable. However, the absolute application of this principle will create a position where planning authorities could in theory at least arbitrarily change the zoning of land without having regard to the financial implications for landowners <Col N="260" /> who might have made a recent investment on the basis of an entirely different zoning.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for one moment that planning authorities would wish to procure such unjust consequences.  Equally, I do not think that the legislation should leave open the possibility of such consequences and for this reason the amendment embodies the safeguard that compensation will not be excluded on zoning grounds where, first, the land had a zoning in the previous five years with which the development proposal would have been compatible and, second, the person claiming compensation acquired his land interest before the new restrictive zoning came into operation or was formally notified in draft by the planning authority.  Both of these conditions have, of course, to obtain together.</P>
    <P>The amendment, therefore, upholds the general principle that developers should not be able to press for compensation where development would contravene current zoning.  It makes exception in only one circumstance for landowners whose lands have been zoned, that is, from development to nondevelopment zoning.  The amendment deals with this matter, as I said, with a view to checking any possibility of the unfair use of this provision in the future. It will also provide a very substantial and comprehensive defence for planning authorities against compensation claims. Taken together with the improved provisions the Bill is making in many other areas, it should greatly strengthen the position of planning authorities in administering planning control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 62, would give effect to the principle that contravention of current zoning should exclude compensation but without the qualification contained in amendment No. 73.  As I have explained, this would leave the way open to arbitrary action by the planning authorities which we should not even in principle comtemplate.</P>
    <P>It would be open to a planning authority, for example, to rezone for amenity or an open space, a site previously zoned <Col N="261" /> commercial in which a developer might have made a substantial investment in assembling.  Changes in zoning are not subject to any statutory check by the Minister for the Environment.  The developer could in this way be refused planning permission for his project without compensation even though the development plan was giving a strong signal only a short time previously that the planning authority favoured a commercial development on the land.  It is this and only this circumstance for which my amendment makes exception.  I consider this exception to be both reasonable and necessary.  I could not, accordingly, accept amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to amendment No.73 which have exactly the same purpose.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 73 seeks to go behind the publication of a draft development plan or a draft variation.  It refers instead to a development objective being indicated in draft in a review of the development plan or in consideration of a proposed variation. There is no formal procedure, however, for indicating a new development objective at these stages.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the 1963 Act sets out the procedure for communicating draft plans or variations to the public and paragraph 10 to the Third Schedule can only be based on this.  It is for that reason that I ask Deputy Gilmore and those who have an interest in this matter to recognise the one circumstance, which I have made public and have now reiterated, where a claim for compensation can be enterained in a fair and equitable way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to a number of the points made by the Minister. First, he used the word &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; on several occasions when speaking about the possibility of a local authority down zoning land.  It is my experience that the development plan process is far from arbitrary.  There is probably no other procedure in the affairs of this country which is as open to the public takes as long to carry out, or has as many safeguards built in as the procedure leading to the adoption or variation of a <Col N="262" /> development plan.  The Minister will be aware that some local authorities take years to review their development plan. They go over it again and again with their planners before even publishing a draft. Following this the public are given the opportunity to comment on it.  It then goes back to the council but there is always the possibility that it could go back to the public before eventually being adopted.</P>
      <P>Under that procedure any person faced with the possibility that their land in which they have invested their money could be down zoned has the right to make their case to the local authority that this was an unreasonable proposal.  My experience in local government, short though it may be, is that a submission of that kind would most likely find favour with the local authority concerned.  It is also my experience that the views expressed by landowners invariably find favour with the authority concerned. What the Minister is concerned about is something I do not see arising in practice. In any event there are considerable safeguards built into the development plan process which would protect against it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has to be complimented on taking on board the criticisms of the original version of this part of the Bill relating to the 20 October 1988 deadline and on going some of the way towards meeting the criticisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Minister's amendment No. 73, I have already talked about the situation where the zoning would have been changed in the five years prior to the making of the application.  I would like to deal, for a minute, with my own amendment No. 3.  Under the Minister's proposal the acquisition of interest in the land would take place after a notice has been published in accordance with section 21 of the 1963 Act of a proposed new development plan or proposed variations of a development plan indicating in draft the development objective referred to in paragraph 9.  As I understand it &mdash; perhaps the Minister can correct me &mdash; what the Minister intends there is that that would be the point at which the draft development plan goes out to the public. <Col N="263" /> I do not think that that should be the cut-off date for the acquisition of interest in the land because what happens in practice is that the review of the development plan may be going on for two or three years before the publication of the draft. The zoning intentions of the local authority would be well known, particularly to members of the local authority, and perhaps fairly well known outside it, long before the draft development plan could actually be published.  One could have a situation where somebody would acquire an interest in the land knowing full well that there was to be a rezoning of the land.  Dublin City Development Plan is going on for the last four years; the review of Dublin County Development Plan is going on over two years now.  There could be somebody who is aware that there is a view in the local authority that a particular parcel of land is going to be zoned in a particular way, who would anticipate that and purchase the land and qualify for compensation under paragraph 10 because they had acquired the land at a time when different zoning had existed within the five years prior to their application being made.</P>
    <P>The reason, therefore, that I have proposed amendment No. 3 is to prevent that arising and to make the cut-off date the point at which the review of the development plan takes place.  There will, however, be no need to get into the tortuous area of dates and limitations and all of that if the Minister were to accept amendment No. 62 which is reasonable.  A lot of concern had been expressed that development plans are being systematically undermined. Deputy Quinn talked about the situation on Dublin County Council, and we talked about it here earlier today, where repeatedly there are material contraventions to the County Dublin Development Plan. Repeatedly members of the public wonder what is the point at all of having a development plan if planning permissions can be granted which contravene it.  We talked about arbitrary decisions.  The only arbitrary decisions that I have come across are decisions made by the <Col N="264" /> members of local authorities who decide to materially contravene development plans.  They are the arbitrary decisions that take place.  The arbitrary decisions are going in the opposite direction to the direction the Minister anticipates.</P>
    <P>I would again, at the eleventh hour, appeal to the Minister to reconsider this situation.  The development plan has to be underpinned and secured.  If we allow a situation, albeit in the limited circumstances that the Minister is talking about, in which a refusal of permission, where the development would contravene the development plan, will open the door to compensation, that will have the effect of undermining development plans.  The people who have found so many holes in the existing legislation on planning compensation may well find the same in relation to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak in the absence of Deputy Shatter who will be back.  I have a certain sympathy for his amendment. There is no doubt that if this Bill is to operate as effectively as we would all like, we will have to get to grips with the great numbers of material contraventions, particularly in the Dublin region &mdash; and that is understandable because that is where most of the development is going on.  There has been a series of material contraventions some, quite acceptable, but the vast bulk of them making major changes to a plan that we are about to put on display in the next six to nine months so that the public will have a chance to decide if they themselves would like to see changes in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to something that Deputy Quinn said, although I think he changed his mind before he sat down.  He said that he would like to include any section 4 development.  That would not really cover the problem we have certainly in Dublin County Council because at the moment a material contravention of the plan can be processed without going next or near the section 4 mechanism.  It can be processed at what we call the district committees where a councillor or councillors on a district committee can decide <Col N="265" /> by a simple majority to ask the manager to proceed with a material contravention process, put the advertisement in the paper etc., and it does not have to go through the section 4 process.  Once this action is taken at local level the advertisement goes in the paper and the first opportunity the rest of the councillors from throughout the county get to deliberate on that material contravention is when it actually comes up for a vote at the council.</P>
    <P>The other snag in confining this to section 4 is that a section 4 motion can be tabled and again the manager is obliged, under the Act, to immediately implement the material contravention process, so a vote is not taken on whether the section 4 should proceed before we get to talk to him about it; the advertisement has already gone into the paper and the procedure has already started.  The section 4 process is just a way, if one thinks one will not get it through the local committee, to get it through.  In my experience of ten years on Dublin County Council, most of the material contraventions have come from the local committees and not through the section 4 process.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister I would have thought that this amendment was one that would copperfasten what the Minister is doing, and I would have thought that it is not in conflict with anything else in the Bill and that it would actually do what we want it to do, that is to prevent, through political patronage, somebody getting planning permission because he happens to have a majority on a local authority.  I would have thought that this would have just endorsed and copperfastened the Minister's many good amendments in other areas, such as getting rid of the October 20 date, etc.</P>
    <P>We discussed this under section 5 when Deputy Gilmore's earlier amendment was in and all of us accused him perhaps of trying to get rid of the concept of compensation where somebody has been unfairly rezoned.  I thought that at that stage the Minister assured us that that mechanism still existed in the Bill.  I <Col N="266" /> cannot see how this amendment would remove that.  The Minister might clarify this for me again as I am not quite as familiar with the process of the Bill as some of the other Deputies; I was not in the House when the Second Stage went through and have only had a chance to read through the speeches recently.  This amendment would copperfasten the Minister's intentions and would not rule out compensation in the few instances where the county council would decide to rezone land or take some land for some other kind of development that was less beneficial to an owner than the zoning which it had when he bought it.  I am inclined to think the Minister is looking too far into this amendment and maybe getting a meaning out of it that is not intended. If I understand Deputy Gilmore, he is trying, as we all are, to stop the haemorrhage of material contraventions which are making an ass of all development plans.  Coming near the end of the life of a development plan there is always a flurry to get in material contraventions because people feel they will have to wait for a process of a year or two years to get their new zoning in.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Gilmore's other amendment and the commencement of the development plan procedures, I am not so sympathetic in the sense that in Dublin certainly it took nearly five years to review the last development plan.  At the rate we are going on this one, it may well take the guts of another five years to review it.  The mechanism of having 78 councillors on Dublin County Council and all of us wanting our say on almost every item on the reports we get will mean it will take a very long time.  Other sections of the Bill would probably prevent somebody claiming compensation if the person acquired the land even in the early stages of the process just because he or she got a hint from someone that it might be rezoned.  So far we have not much indication of any rezonings the manager is recommending but we do not know what councillors might recommend.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us why <Col N="267" /> he says amendment No. 62 would rule out the possibility of somebody whose land was rezoned getting compensation. That is the kernel of what I would like clarified before we come to a decision on this.  If it rules out the possibility of people getting compensation because their land is rezoned, we do not want to do that in this Bill.  I do not think Deputy Gilmore necessarily wants to deprive somebody of the benefit of land bought at a certain zoning which is then rezoned.  We had this argument previously on another section. I do not believe this amendment is doing that.</P>

      <P>Before inviting the Minister to comment, let me suggest that it strikes me, bearing in mind that we are on Committee Stage, that there might be an over-concentration on weaknesses, real and alleged, in the planning and other legislation and that where we should be homing in here on the whole question of compensation, maybe we are dwelling to an unnecessary extent on the weaknesses we see in respect of section <Col N="268" /> 4 contraventions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not.  I say to Deputy Gilmore, and I do not mean to be hurtful in any way, that he has preached one philosophy throughout the whole of this discussion today and last week, that he does not want compensation to apply in any circumstance whatever.  We had this argument and I said that in virtually every situation I do not wish compensation to apply, but I named one circumstance and that is the circumstance of down-zoning.  I thought we had cleared that last week, but the Deputy is seeking to get back to the very same situation.  Having been defeated on that issue last week, he is seeking by this mechanism to bring about the same result where there would be no compensation ever, in any circumstances.  I do not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> When development plans are being renegotiated or reviewed certainly a land owner has the right to appeal against any suggestion of rezoning his property.  He gets obvious notice, advance notice, and it is published and all that goes with it, but it does not guarantee that local authority members in reviewing their development plan will react in a positive way to the wishes of the appellant.  They never do. In down-zoning, the only situation where I say compensation can be paid and in very tight circumstances even in down-zoning which I have outlined previously is particularly when local authority members are deciding to down-zone deliberately a piece of ground for amenity, leisure or open space purposes.  Such members might feel compelled to pursue their objective in full knowledge, but in my opinion they cannot sterilise that piece of land without paying for the privilege. The person who has ownership of that land in the circumstances of ownership that I have set out is entitled to compensation.  Deputy Gilmore does not agree with that and I cannot convince him.  Consequently he is not going to accept my point of view as stated now.</P>
    <P>Once an objective has been published &mdash; this is very important &mdash; in draft in any form, then purchasing land by any speculator, developer or anybody else after that date is useless in qualifying for compensation.  Whatever way the information is made known or officially signalled in the first draft, even though that draft is subsequently changed a thousand times, renders compensation impossible from that date.  That is as tight as any legislative framework can go.</P>
    <P>I also accept that local authority members are entitled to pass material changes to their own plan.  I regard that as their democratic right.  It was local authority members who decided on their plan in the first instance, so they are entitled to change it in the democratic way.  Many material changes have taken place, particularly in the jurisdiction around this administrative area and a great many of them are simply because local authority members did not give sufficient time or had not the time to do an <Col N="270" /> early review of their development plan, because this is like language, it keeps developing and there should be pretty constant reviews of their plans to accommodate what they, the local authority members, feel collectively is the right requirement for the development of their own area.  Therefore, I am not condemning material changes out of hand. If I were to accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment I am virtually making it impossible to keep control on that in the local authority members' own interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn has referred to the possibility of material contravention of the development plan being obtained by means of a section 4 process and resolution, and Deputy Nora Owen has a good understanding of this.  In point of fact section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, cannot be used to procure a material contravention.  The procedure for effecting such a contravention is governed by the special provisions of section 26 (3) of the 1963 Planning Act as amended.  While the procedure involves voting requirements similar to those in the section 4 process, it is still a separate procedure. Section 23 (3) provides that where section 4 purports to effect a material contravention the procedure of section 26 (3) must instead be set in train.  Material change cannot be effected by the section 4 process and must be subordinated to the other section of the other Act.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to convey the message to Members except to summarise it.  I only want compensation to be available in the one circumstance of down zoning in certain special circumstances and I think the landowner is entitled to that under the Constitution.</P>

      <P>If that was the case, then it would meet my amendment No. 3.  I am not sure it is the case under the Minister's amendment.  As I understand the Minister's draft, it refers to a notice being published, in accordance with section 21 of the Principal Act, of the proposed development plan.  That is the formal procedure which starts after the council have considered the variation.  In the normal proposal to vary or to contravene a development plan the period between the making available of the proposal to the elected members of the council and its publication to the general public may be very short, but in cases where the development plan is under review the period may be very long.  In Dublin County Council we have already received maps and drafts in respect of the <Col N="272" /> new development plan but these have not yet been made available to the public, except perhaps through us.  If it is the case that as soon as the maps and the draft statement come from the manager's office to the councillors that is the cut off point, then I am happy.  I seek clarification on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not get to a situation where we can penalise a landowner on account of something he has not seen. It is reasonable and prudent that authorities should indicate publicly what they propose doing, even if the councillors have not considered it at all.  Subsequently the members may decide to go whichever way they wish in their consideration of what is proposed by the official side.  The official side propose certain things and quite often they are not taken on board by the members in the review of their development plan.  Once the official side have indicated publicly that they are going to do a certain thing, a stop comes to the compensation elements that would be applied thereafter by way of subsequent transfers of land or purchase. It cannot penalise the humble landowner for something he has not seen. God bless him, he has gone through a fair torment here for the past couple of weeks.</P>

      <P>This is essentially a technical amendment to make good a drafting omission.  Paragraph 1 (b) of the Third Schedule, in dealing with the preservation of water capacity, mentions prospective developments covered by planning permissions or by a planning permission in principle given by notice under section 14 of the Bill.  Logically, there is a third possibility here and this is development covered by an undertaking under section 57 of the 1963 Act.  While this category is unlikely to be very important in practice, it is better that the drafting should cover it at this stage and therefore I recommend the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 64:</P>
      <P>In page 18, paragraph 1, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following new subparagraphs:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(e) any existing deficiency in the road network serving the area of the <Col N="275" /> proposed development, including considerations of capacity, width, alignment, or the surface or structural condition of the pavement, which would render that network, or any part of it, unsuitable to carry the increased road traffic likely to result from the development,</P>
    <P>(f) any prospective deficiency (including the considerations specified in subparagraph (e)) in the road network serving the area of the proposed development which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Would arise because of the increased road traffic likely to result from that development and from prospective development as regards which a grant of permission under Part IV of the Principal Act, an undertaking under Part VI of that Act or a notice under section 14 exists, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  would arise because of the increased road traffic likely to result from that development and from any other prospective development or from any development objective, as indicated in the development plan, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  would render that road network, or any part of it, unsuitable to carry the increased road traffic likely to result from the proposed development.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to amplify and refine the reasons relating to road capacity and road planning whereby planning permission may be refused without liability to compensation.  Private development can entail significant external costs, notably in the area of impact on the public road network.  It is proper that planning authorities should be able, through the refusal of planning permission, to decline, on behalf of the community, to accept these costs without liability to compensation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 64 articulates the various possibilities whereby development may be considered premature by reference to the state of the road network. <Col N="276" /> Essentially this amendment reiterates for roads the various considerations already set out for water and sewage services by subparagraphs (a) to (d) of paragraph 1.  Amendment 65 is a more accurate reflection than the original paragraph 2 of the Schedule whereby a road lay-out is determined.  An Bord Pleanála have no functions in this matter, contrary to what was provided in the 1963 Act, as amended.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 66 provides that, independently of any question of the pre-maturity of development <i>vis-á-vis</i> roads, planning permission may be refused without compensation where development would adversely affect the use of an existing national road or other major road by traffic.  An example of this could be ribbon development along a major route which could diminish the rate of feasible vehicle flow along the route.  This reason will be applicable whether the adverse effect on road use would come from the particular development by itself or by the precedent which it could set for similar development.  Again, this provision is justified on the basis that compensation should not obtain where development would compromise the effectiveness of public expenditure on major roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very welcome addition to the Bill.  I would just seek clarification in relation to a reason for refusal of planning permission.  Again, turning to the book that was circulated today, the ERU <i>Development Control System, 1989</i>, it states that planning permission was refused in 52 cases by a planning authority because it would create a traffic hazard.  Can I take it that refusal of planning permission for egress onto a national primary road system is non-compensatable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this addition to the Third Schedule.  It will solve some of the difficulties in refusals of planning permission. Obviously the provisions in the main Schedule regarding the capacity of water and sewage are very welcome indeed, as is the fact that compensation will not be paid if one can prove there is still capacity.  I am particularly interested in subparagraph (f) (ii) of the amendment whereby a local authority might have already granted planning permissions that have not actually been implemented because the capacity on the road is already spoken for.  My understanding of what the Minister is doing here is that we cannot pay compensation if we refuse planning permission on the basis of road capacity because obviously a developer could say there is capacity on the road. If that clause existed already we would not have given the planning permission that was given recently for a very large development between Swords and Malahide, because undoubtedly that road is unable to take the added burden of traffic.  This provision will tighten the legislation very much.  There is another claim for £2 million in the Portrane area. The reason An Bord Pleanála took out the non-compensatable clause &mdash; which the council had put in &mdash; was deficiency of road infrastructure.  Unfortunately in taking out that clause, An Bord Pleanála left the way open for a compensation claim.  It is good to know that that will not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have forgotten, in the conversations that have gone on, about the down-zoning situation. There is a whole raft of reasons for refusal with non-compensatory clauses over and above that particular one and we are inclined to forget those.  The question of roads capacity, services and so on, can also be applied.  To my way of thinking, this is the tightest legislation to restrict compensation that was ever contemplated.  I made the comment during the day that it was as close as one could sail to the constitutional wind and I still think I am right.</P>

I presume this will apply in relation to An Bord Pleanála.  The most controversial developments which have been rejected in the greater Dublin area in recent years were rejected on the basis of a deficiency in the road network.  At present most of them could be turned down on the basis of the inadequacy of the road network. This is due to a lack of finance and a lack of plans for the roads.

      <P>In page 2, line 30 and in page 3, lines 1 to 19, to delete subsections (5) and (6) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Board may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) not offer preferential loans to its wholly or partially owned subsidiary companies;</P>
      <P>(b) not provide any subsidies, nor provide goods and services on preferential terms to its wholly or partially owned subsidiary companies;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) guarantee, in such form and manner and on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, the due repayment by a company of the principal of any moneys (including moneys in a currency other than the currency of the State) borrowed by the company or the payment of interest of such moneys or both the repayment of the principal and payment of the interest and any such guarantee may include a guarantee of payment of incidental expenses arising in <Col N="285" /> connection with such borrowings and may be a guarantee of payment of a promissory note made by a company or a bill of exchange drawn or accepted by a company.</P>
    <P>(6) (a) The exercise of the Board of any power conferred by this section shall be subject to consent of the Minister and where the value of the capital funds committed, or the value of any longterm contracts entered into by the Board exceed £10 million, shall be subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(b) The Minister shall refer any proposed company trading in the home market to the Fair Trading Commission to establish Fair Trading Rules, if the Minister has reason to believe the proposed company might take a dominant position in the market liable to conspire against the public interest.</P>
    <P>(c) The Board shall publish each year a full set of accounts in respect of the ventures established under this section.</P>
    <P>(d) The Board shall present the Minister every five years with an assessment of each venture established under this section outlining the return on capital achieved and the justification of retention by the Board of its shareholding.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes a number of changes to section 2.  The purpose essentially is that where the board set up subsidiary companies they would be at an arm's length basis.  It is not appropriate that there should be a system of preferential loans made to subsidiary companies because many of these would, perhaps, be in competition with other businesses which would not have the advantage of a preferential loan.  In any event, for the purpose of transparency as to what is going on, the purpose of setting up the subsidiary and hiving off a business to give it that sort of independence would be defeated if the board were allowed to <Col N="286" /> have a system of hidden subsidies available to them.  The purpose of subsection (5) is to ensure a certain arm's length basis in their operation with subsidiary companies which they would establish.</P>
    <P>We take the view that in establishing these companies there should not be a necessity to get the dual consent of the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance except in cases where the sums involved are very large.  It seems to be defeating the purpose of giving Bord na Móna a certain degree of discretion in organising their business affairs if duplicate sanction has to be sought and obtained from the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance.  A level of £10 million should be set beyond which the Minister for Finance &mdash; as well as the Minister for Energy &mdash; will be brought into play.  After all, the sums involved in establishing a company are not directly from the Exchequer; this is a company set up by statute to operate on a commercial basis independent of the Exchequer. Therefore, they should not be policed in this very bureaucratic way by having to seek dual sanction for their commercial decisions.  The principle we should seek to apply to our State agencies is that they are held responsible for the results they produce but they should not be policed and overseen in the heavy-handed way which appears to be suggested in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In subsection (6) (b) I suggest that where the Minister feels the company might be getting into a business where they would be in direct conflict with some existing operations in Ireland, he should, if he feels there might be a danger of the Bord na Móna subsidiary taking a downward position or in some way conspiring against the public interest, refer the matter to the Fair Trading Commission for sets of fair trading rules.</P>
    <P>The reason I suggest this is that in the recent past where a similar provision was put in for the ESB to set up trading in coal and other substances there was quite a degree of public unease that the ESB, with their commercial might, would swamp others who were legitimately trading in the sector they chose to enter. It does not mean that Bord na Móna &mdash;<Col N="287" /> or any State company &mdash; should not be diversifying but it would at least protect them if they were entering a business and there was a danger that they might assume a dominant position.</P>
    <P>The other element in (c) and (d) is the suggestion that we should have clear accounts published for any company which the board would seek to establish so that there would be transparency.  It goes hand in hand with our suggestion that they should have more commercial freedom and be more accountable in presenting their accounts.  In (d) the suggestion is that if a company are established the board should, at the very least, have a five year review where they look at the operation of the company and produce for the taxpayer and the Dáil the reasons for them continuing to trade in this business. It is important to have a five year review of the success of the business in the same way as the Government are now looking for a five year programme for the future of boards, companies and subsidiaries.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding further I wish to draw the attention of the House and the Members to the following printers' errors in the list of Committee amendments to this Bill dated 21 February 1990.  In the fifth line of paragraph (c) of amendment No. 2 to section 2, in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton, &ldquo;interest of such moneys&rdquo; should read &ldquo;interest on such moneys&rdquo;.  The section heading for section 5 should be inserted before amendment No. 14 in the name of the Minister.  In the first line of amendment No. 2, in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton, to amendment 18, in the name of the Minister, to section 7, &ldquo;sixth and seventh lines&rdquo; should read &ldquo;fifth and sixth lines&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  Why not put the restrictions on all companies which Deputy Bruton wanted to put on Bord na Móna?  Have restrictions been put on the debate on the Companies (No. 2) Bill which is before a Special Committee? Everything contained in the <Col N="288" /> amendments amounts to restrictions on Bord na Móna and they reflect the attitude generally of the Government, and the main Opposition party, to the semi-State bodies.  That is the only comment I wish to make on the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherlock reflects the time of night in his contribution.  He must be tired if he thinks he heard Deputy Bruton asking the House to put restrictions on Bord na Móna.  Deputy Bruton wants the board to have the freedom to operate a five year plan but, on the question of finance, he does not want one company put against another.  What is wrong with asking Bord na Móna to set up subsidiary companies in such a way that they will be able to operate independently and will not be liable to sink with what is the colossus of Bord na Móna?  The Minister admitted that today he received a major report about the finances of Bord na Móna and that he is studying it.  The dogs in the street know that things are ominous financially for Bord na Móna, that they cannot be expected to trade out of the financial position they are in.  Is the Deputy suggesting that a subsidiary company that may be carrying on a successful operation should be allowed to sink because of the mismanagement of the parent company?</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton seeks to give independence to the subsidiary companies from the bureaucracy of the Department. He wants such companies to be given an opportunity to set targets and operate within their own budgets.  They should be allowed to operate to a five year plan or, if necessary, to a three year plan.  The Minister should see merit in giving the management of such subsidiary companies an opportunity to expand without being inhibited due to the financial difficulties a parent company may find itself in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Sherlock that what Deputy Bruton is proposing would place many statutory restrictions, indeed, severe restrictions, on the new subsidiary companies Bord na Móna will have power to establish <Col N="289" /> following the passage of the Bill.  I do not think it would be in the interests of the new companies that they should be restricted in the manner Deputy Bruton is proposing.  Certainly, they should not be restricted under statute.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to give commercial freedom to Bord na Móna and to allow them to operate in many respects in the same way that private companies operate. It is my intention, and the intention of the board, that sound business practices should obtain in relation to subsidiary companies.  It is not considered necessary to set this out in statute.  If it is considered that the relationship between Bord na Móna, the parent company, and the subsidiary company should be subject to certain controls along the lines suggested, there is ample provision to do that and to deal with it administratively under section 2 (6).  I should like to direct Deputy Bruton's attention to the powers given in that section.  I suggest to him that that is the most appropriate way to proceed in establishing these powers for Bord na Móna which are designed to allow them to create subsidiary companies to undertake new developments and restructure their operations.</P>
      <P>The extensive powers under section 2 are being provided to help them found new subsidiary companies, to help them participate in or take a share in other companies or, indeed, to take over companies. There is power given to them in the Bill to enable Bord Na Móna to lend to or guarantee loans for a company. It is only right that the consents of the Ministers, as proposed in section 2 (6), should operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious, as far as possible, to give commercial freedom to these new companies.  Deputy Bruton will have to accept that what he is proposing does not apply to every other commercial company operating in the State.  In that sense, what he is proposing is an added restriction.  It has been normal practice in regard to commercial semi-State bodies that the consent of the Minister, and the Minister for Finance, is required in regard to certain matters which can be laid down in administrative arrangements, and in statute in regard to other matters.  That is the normal practice and I do not see the sense in the proposed subsection (6) (a) where the intention is <Col N="291" /> that only amounts over £10 million would have to be referred to the Minister for Finance.  As we know, in practice there could be several transactions up to that figure which would amount to vast sums in excess of the £10 million and the suggestion is that they should pass without the permission of the Minister for Finance.  I do not think there is any great merit in the suggestion and I do not think the House sees a lot of merit in it.</P>
      <P>While the section and the amendment relate to financial limits it will be noted that apart from marketing at home or abroad activities being opened up by the Bill in foreign countries are generally subject to the Minister's control.  The Minister for Finance has guaranteed all Bord na Móna borrowings and with total borrowings of £186 million, as was mentioned in the House today, I am sure the House will agree that the approval of that Minister must be sought before the board can make any commitments under that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's proposed subsection (6) (b) refers to the Fair Trading Commission. I should like to tell the Deputy that they have wide-ranging powers under the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.  If the Fair Trade Commissioner feels that Bord na Móna are operating in an anti-competitive manner he may initiate an investigation of their practices.  He has the same powers in relation to other companies and I am sure the House will agree that it would be discriminatory for the Minister to single out Bord an Móna in the manner proposed in the amendment.  In addition, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to ask the Fair Trading Commission to carry out an investigation into any company who he suspects is operating in an anti-competitive manner. Why should Deputy Bruton ask the House to make it a statutory obligation in regard to Bord na Móna when the Fair Trade Commission powers already cover that in relation to all commercial companies? The House should seek as far as possible to allow Bord na Móna and the new companies to operate in the <Col N="292" /> commercial environment.  He is proposing that the board should publish each year a full set of accounts in respect of the ventures established under this section. The statutory framework, section 59 (1) of the 1946 Act, is already in place to enable the Minister to direct Bord na Móna as to the form of its accounts.  In addition under the provisions of section 2 (6) of this Bill the power of the board to set up subsidiary companies is subject to the approval of the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance.  Suitable conditions concerning the accounts of subsidiary companies may be attached to this approval if so required.</P>

      <P>It came as a great shock to the people in the Cahirciveen area to find that barriers had been erected closing access and exit from Renard pier. Having regard to its condition over a period it may not be entirely unexpected. The apparent neglect in having the pier maintained at an acceptable standard is now water under the bridge and no purpose would be served by referring to it. The important issue for the Minister and the Department at this stage is that the essential repair work be undertaken without further delay.  The closure caused frustration and worry to those who are actively involved with the pier and its value to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an indication of its value over the last 12 months from 1 January 1989 to 31 <Col N="293" /> December 1989 &mdash; even when the pier was functioning at substandard levels and incapable of taking much of the traffic that, had it been up to standard, would be visiting there and bringing substantial contributions in wealth &mdash; 134 ships in excess of 30 metres visited and discharged at the port.  Fifty thousand boxes of fish were delivered at an estimated value of £3 million.  The sum of £270,000 was spent on transport to and from the pier mainly by Kerry hauliers.  A sum of £225,000 for the oil which serviced the ships was paid to a Kerry supplier and involved a minimum of three jobs, £30,000 worth of ice was taken out from the local fish processing centre through the pier.  Approximately £35,000 was spent on foodstuffs by those coming to the pier and approximately £30,000 was spent on other services.</P>
    <P>Of the 134 ships visiting, taking the minimum of 15 persons per crew and an average expenditure of £10 &mdash; which is exceptionally small in the case of seamen &mdash; it would have enriched the community by £40,000.  This, for an area like Cahirciveen, even on a reduced basis, is a very substantial income that it can ill afford to lose.</P>
    <P>In addition there is a very considerable tourism spin-off from the use of the ferry crossing from the point to Valentia Island, which is widely used and appreciated by those who go from the pier to Skelling Rock and those who go on the fishing trips etc.  It is important to remember that Cahirciveen is at best a disadvantaged area in regard to industry and its earning capacity.  To deprive it for any length of time of the use of the pier would be a total disaster for the area.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister and his Department tonight that there is no use in having regrets over the neglect of the pier, the important thing is that the renovation work is undertaken without delay.  While I appreciate that the Minister will have to get some engineering advice and expertise in that field there is no doubt that having regard to the existence of this pier over a long number of years a substantial volume of such engineering advice and other expertise <Col N="294" /> could readily be available through the county council and through the Office of Public Works who have responsibility.  I appeal to the Minister, in respect of the speedy development that the people of Cahirciveen would welcome and, indeed, would expect, to give a guarantee that, once the engineering and expert investigations are concluded, the necessary moneys will then be available.  This is the crunch issue.  In relation to the moneys I am assured that Kerry County Council will provide 25 per cent, and I am sure they will not renege no matter where it comes from, because the development is so vital to the area and the nature of the services conducted there are so traditional that it is absolutely essential that they are restored at the earliest possible date.  In summing up I would ask the Minister to say to the people of Cahirciveen that, once the engineering and the expert investigation is completed at the earliest possible date &mdash; which should not take too long &mdash; the necessary moneys will be available through the co-operation of his Department with Kerry County Council and that the work of restoring this valuable pier will be commenced without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank my colleague, Deputy Moynihan, for allowing me to share his time on this very important issue.  Valentia harbour contains four important fishing ports situated at Portmagee, Cahirciveen, Knightstown and Renard.  The case for major development works at Portmagee to service the local fleet is undeniable.  Emergency works to restore Renard pier to its previous condition are urgently required.  The present position is that the pier is severely debilitated from the structural point of view and is liable to collapse.  Due to its dangerous condition Kerry County Council have closed the pier until improvement works sought are carried out.  Immediate structural repair work to the existing pier is necessary in the interests of stabilisation and preservation. This work will consist of extensive concreting and the provision of fendering.  Dredging works would also <Col N="295" /> need to be carried out adjacent to the pier to facilitate mooring.  The Kerry county engineer estimates the cost of this work at £160,000.</P>
      <P>Valentia harbour is one of the most natural deep water harbours in the country; one could go so far as to say that it is the most natural deep water harbour along the west coast.  It is the nearest harbour to the Porcupine Bank.  It is, of course, grossly under-utilised due to the lack of a proper infrastructure.  A major development at Portmagee and the restoration of Renard pier would provide a major boost to the local economy of south-west Kerry and the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Renard Pier, which is adjacent to my home town of Cahirciveen, was one of our major fishing ports and harbours during the forties but due to neglect down the years and a lack of proper infrastructure, the fishing industry today is not what it was.  Nonetheless everything Deputy Moynihan said about the pier is correct.  It is of crucial importance to the economic life of the south-west Kerry area which has suffered so much from emigration and unemployment for so many years.  Renard Pier is the shortest link to Valentia Island and its closure means that those living on Valentia Island are no longer able to cross the half mile or so by sea to the mainland and are obliged at all times to travel by road a distance of about 14 or 15 miles to the main town.  In addition it is an important port because people visiting the famous Skellig Rock utilise this pier regularly.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the Marine for visiting this pier and Portmagee during his recent visit to the south-west Kerry area.  I have no hesitation in saying that these two piers are of crucial importance to the life of the people of the area.  The prolonged closure of this facility will have a devastating effect on the economy of the area.  Kerry County Council are willing to put up 25 per cent of the moneys required for this work.  I urge the Minister to deal with this matter urgently and to provide the necessary funding to enable works to commence.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I have been aware of the position in relation to Renard Pier for some time.  As Deputy John O'Donoghue said, I had the advantage of inspecting Renard Pier within the past month.  At the same time I visited Portmagee which has also been referred to.</P>
      <P>As has been said, Valentia Harbour contains four landing places &mdash; Cahirciveen, Renard Point, Knightstown and Portmagee, where there is a very strong locally based fishing fleet.  In 1983 a major development scheme was completed at Cahirciveen at a cost of £500,000.  Since then local attention has been focused on the development of Portmagee and Renard Point.</P>
      <P>The existing pier at Renard was erected in 1965-66 to cater for the then existing fleet and an allowance was made during the erection of the pier for an increase in its size.  It was not designed to cater for severe berthing blows from large steel hulled fishing boats, coasters and cargo boats, In fact, the night I visited Renard one of those steel hulled boats was banging against the pier and obviously inflicting severe damage.  As the Deputy is aware responsibility for the repair and maintenance of Renard Pier rests with Kerry County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputies Moynihan, O'Donoghue and O'Leary are members of Kerry County Council but I regret to have to say that the council were requested to undertake the necessary maintenance work in 1981.  Subsequent reports indicated ongoing deterioration of the pier because no repair work was carried out.  It is significant to note that the fendering was being continuously damaged by berthing blows from large fishing boats which caused the tie rods to <Col N="297" /> become exposed.  Some of these tie rods were cut and this has been a major factor causing the subsidence.</P>
    <P>An estimate of the cost of restoring the pier was given at £115,000 in 1986. Failure to carry out this maintenance work has resulted in a continuing deterioration of the pier to its present state where, as we heard from Deputies, its closure on safety grounds was announced by Kerry County Council on 1 February this year.  It is estimated that £200,000 will now be required for the restoration of the pier.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present updating their five year fishery harbour development programme and local authorities, including Kerry County Council, have been invited to provide a formal input into the programme.  Consideration of proposals for harbour developments at Valentia will be made in the context of the programme of harbour development priorities to be submitted to my Department by Kerry County Council.  I appeal to the Deputies concerned to urge Kerry County Council to send me their prioritised list as soon as possible.  When Kerry County Council's response is received it will be examined and a decision taken in relation to Renard Pier.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by emphasising that the south Kerry region has benefited considerably in recent years from investment by my Department.  As I already mentioned Cahirciveen Pier was the subject of major development in 1983 and very substantial funds are at present being invested in an imaginative scheme to upgrade Dingle Harbour.</P>

      <P>The Maharees Peninsula, in common with the rest of Kerry <Col N="298" /> and the county as a whole, suffered greatly during the past few weeks from the unusally inclement weather.  The Maharees Peninsula is an area richly endowed with natural amenities and has considerable potential for agriculture, fishing and tourism.  The future of this peninsula is now seriously threatened by continuous coastal erosion, caused especially by the recent storms.</P>
      <P>At two locations &mdash; Fahamore and at the northern end of the peninsula on the way to Scraggane Pier &mdash; the main road was covered with boulders thrown up from the sea and damage was caused to the shore embankment.  Kerry County Council have made these areas passable again but it is obvious they will have to carry out some works to prevent further damage to the roads and watermains at the Maharees.</P>
      <P>Over the past ten years Kerry County Council have been compelled to expend moneys on protecting services from coastal erosion in the Maharees Peninsula.  It is estimated that over the past ten years Kerry County Council have spent £100,000 on this type of work.  The damage caused by the storms of the past few weeks means that Kerry County Council will have to expend funds at a far greater rate than heretofore in order to preserve their services.</P>
      <P>I should like to describe the conditions on the coastline of the peninsula from Trench Bridge along the eastern coastline of the peninsula to a point opposite Trench Bridge on the western coast. Some protection work has been carried out already by Kerry County Council north of Trench Bridge by the placement of large rocks on the cliff side of the public road.  This work should be extended towards Bealgeal, just north of Trench Bridge, in order to prevent further erosion as this area was seriously encroached on during the past winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kerry County Council purchased property to be used as a car park at Maherabeg. This area has suffered much erosion, with the consequent loss of ground, over the past two years.  It is now highly desirable to carry out coastal protection works at the council car park to prevent <Col N="299" /> further erosion.  Going north along this coastline there is a good deposit of gravel and stone which seems to be holding up pretty well.  Erosion from the car park towards Kilshannig was minimal during the past winter.</P>
    <P>Just before reaching Kilshannig Point, for a distance of about 500 yards, the gravel gives way to sand with the result that resistance to erosion is much less. Consequently, there was a further loss of ground during the past winter.  The coastline from Kilshannig Point to Kilshannig village is mainly a rocky outcrop which is resistant to erosion.  Immediately south of Kilshannig village, where the level of land is rather low, there is the distinct danger that the tide could cut across south of the village of Kilshannig thereby creating an island of the village and the land around it to the north.</P>
    <P>The public road at this location is often blocked by deposits of land material and it is imperative that protection works are carried out here as a matter of urgency. The section of the coast from Kilshannig village to Candiha is subject to erosion and the good grass margin which existed between the road and the sea two years ago has all but disappeared at this stage. This means that protection works will have to be carried out at this location also, in order to protect the road and the piece of the sand dune which remains.</P>
    <P>The area from Candiha to Scraggane, which is private, suffered the loss of at least ten feet of land during the past winter.  As a result, some houses at this location are being threatened as, indeed, are houses at Kilshannig village.  Scraggane Point is a rock outcrop which is resistant to erosion.  However, it must be stated that some minor damage to the area near Scraggane pier was done during the recent storms.  The coastal area near the junction on the Fahamore road has been undermined and needs further protection as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The coastline from Illaunanoon to Fahamore is mainly a rocky outcrop and no great damage was done here.  The area just north-west of the village of Fahamore suffered the loss of nearly ten <Col N="300" /> feet of land during the last winter with the result that houses at Fahamore village are in some danger.</P>
    <P>The sea adjoins the road just south of Fahamore village and pours onto the road regularly.  This usually results in damage being caused, as happened this winter. The existing protection works need to be strengthened and extended southwards as a matter of urgency.  The county council road, 300 yards south of Fahamore village, is not in danger from the sea and erosion at present.  However, this section of the coastline down to a point almost opposite Trench Bridge was the biggest casualty of the recent storms.  Some 40 feet of land has been washed away since the beginning of December and the two surface water sluices were damaged. These are adjacent to an occupied house. The main sluice and 40 feet of piping were broken.  The high sand dunes in this area are easily eroded by the wind and rain and should be the subject of a coastal protection programme.</P>
    <P>Kerry County Council engineers estimate that it will cost £51,000 to remedy the damage to council property. This figure includes the cost of repairing the sluices and providing protection for the roads at various locations.  It is obvious from the examination carried out that the damage done is extensive and if protection works are not undertaken as a matter of urgency it is possible that the rate of damage will be accelerated.  The county engineer at a recent council meeting suggested that funds in the region of £750,000 should be made available for a proper coastal protection scheme for private property on the Maharees Peninsula.</P>
    <P>The Minister assumed responsibility for coast protection in January and I would remind him that under the Coast Protection Act, 1963 no scheme has been carried out in Kerry.  Six have been carried out throughout the country.  I appeal to him, and to the Taoiseach in particular, who has a special affinity with this area, to take immediate action.  If he fails to do so much of the land which he viewed at the Maharees last summer will have <Col N="301" /> disappeared when he goes back there next summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deenihan for sharing his time with me. The need for coastal protection works at the Maharees was first highlighted 30 years ago.  Kerry County Council submitted a list of priority works to the Office of Public Works 25 years ago but not one of these schemes was ever touched.  The seriousness of the problem at the Maharees is underlined by the fact that on one night in recent years a property owner lost 46 feet of his land to the sea leaving his house within 40 feet of the sea.</P>
      <P>Unless urgent remedial action is undertaken at least parts of the Maharees Peninsula will become an island.  Kerry County Council's services in the area were seriously damaged in the recent storm and the repair cost is estimated at £51,000.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope that the transfer of responsibility for coast protection from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine will lead to a coherent coastal protection programme for this country.  It is ridiculous that as an island nation we have never had a coherent policy for coastal protection works and the Maharees serves as an ideal example of the level of neglect in this area down through the years.  I urge the Minister to save the homes and property of the Maharees Peninsula.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>Coastal protection works have to be carried out at the Maharees Peninsula which juts out to the sea at Castlegregory.  There is a well known island off the Maharees called <Col N="302" /> O'Leary's Island.  I can assure the Minister that we will have another island in County Kerry if coastal protection works are not carried out at the Maharees in the very near future.  I would like to remind the Minister that there is a full prohibition order in place in respect of the Maharees and I ask him to seek a special grant from the Minister for Finance to carry out coastal protection works in this area.</P>
      <P>I was present at a meeting at the Maharees when the storm was in full force.  The waves were 20 feet high.  Kerry County Council, since I first came into politics 21 years ago, have carried out protection works on the road.  If this action had not been taken the people living in the area would not now be able to get down to the Maharees.  The Office of Public Works' engineer complimented Kerry County Council for the protection works they have carried out.  I do not want to detain the House for too long but let me point out that it is small farmers who grow onions and vegetables who mainly make up the population of the Maharees.  There are also many fishermen. It is God's own country and a great place to go to on holidays.  I appeal to the Minister for the Marine to help us and to seek a special grant from the Minister for Finance to carry out protection works in the Maharees.  If he fails to do so we will have an extra island in County Kerry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions on this very serious problem. The recent storms have heightened public awareness of the problem being experienced on this historic peninsula.  I am aware that the problems of coast erosion and the removal of sand were linked together but I do not think the removal of sand, although a long-standing complaint in the area, was particularly significant with regard to the present damage.  An order prohibiting the removal of beach material was obtained recently.  Beach removals have aggravated erosion at this peninsula as is recorded in the files I obtained from the Office of Public <Col N="303" /> Works.  As the Deputies have already stated, houses are in danger.</P>
      <P>I assumed responsibility for coast protection in January of this year when I was given the princely sum of £150,000, all of which had been committed in 1989.  In response to parliamentary questions on 13 February, I outlined my policy to the House.  Essentially, I will be arranging for a review of coast protection procedures in conjunction with the Department of the Environment but I am already satisfied that my Department's primary role in the matter will be to facilitate the underpinning of permanent coastal protection schemes designed to give long-term relief.  As the House is aware, such schemes are very costly and cannot be put in place overnight.  Furthermore, the causes of any particular case of coastal erosion &mdash; in this instance it was a storm &mdash; can seldom be judged without close study and observation over a period of time.  Remedial measures sometimes involve trial and experiment.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will also be aware that as an emergency measure, following the persistent bad weather of recent weeks, the Government set up a Cabinet subcommittee to report urgently on storm damage.  I am a member of that committee and the Deputies can be assured that it will be pressing for special funding to deal with damage to our coast, which was referred to by Deputy McEllistrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to make promises tonight but I can assure the Deputies that <Col N="304" /> the Government are determined to deal with the storm damage problems as equitably and as speedily as possible.  As the Deputy said, Kerry Council Council have spent a considerable sum of money already on this area.  I listened with interest when he spoke about the depositing of large rocks as the rock armour protection method seems to be the most effective way to protect coasts and prevent rock and coastal erosion.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the 1963 Act. In fact, this Act refers to the Office of Public Works, and it is generally agreed that it is not a very effective Act as it is very difficult to apply.  Since 1963, only six schemes have been put through. These were carried out at The Murrough, County Wicklow, Youghal, Moville, Strandhill, Rossnowlagh, and Enniscrone. I am at present reviewing that Act. I am aware that the Maharees area is of particular significance to very many people and that the Castlegregory region, as indicated by Deputy McEllistrim, was the only effective region for onion growing for a long time in this country.  I also know that Bill Dillon came from there and that is another reason why it should get particular attention.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Deputies who raised this matter that it will receive the special attention of the Special Committee which has been set up to examine this problem and, if possible funds will be provided.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.5 p.m. until 10.30 a. m. on Thursday, 22 February 1990.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 25, 46, 56 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 4, 47 and 55 of 7 December last.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that investment contemplated by Bord Gáis Éireann in relation to extension of the gas grid to any particular area should be assessed on a commercial basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assessment of individual projects is a matter for the board itself.  In the event of it wishing to proceed with a project <Col N="109" /> the board will, of course, require my consent before undertaking any construction on pipe-laying work.  In these circumstances, I do not intend to commission independent studies of individual projects.</P>
    <P>The situation in Dundalk is that BGE assessed the possibility of running the town gas grid on a commercial basis and found that it would not be viable.  Closure of the private owner was imminent. Accordingly, it has arranged the orderly shutdown of the gas system and former consumers have been supplied with alternative appliances.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The RECHAR programme is intended to offer European Community assistance in the form of loans and grants to certain coal-mining areas in the Community which have been or are likely to be hardest hit by problems of industrial restructuring, and because they have special difficulties in adjusting rapidly to changing economic circumstances.</P>
      <P>Specific criteria have been laid down by the Commission for eligibility under the programme, most notably that the total number of coal-mining jobs lost since 1 January 1984 and the number of jobs at risk equals or exceeds 1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that job losses in the Irish coal-mining industry, including Arigna, will not reach this level, Ireland has asked the Commission to examine our case with a view to obtaining any assistance which might be available.

      <P>Career breaks are available in the Civil Service for child rearing and certain other domestic purposes &mdash; e.g. care of a sick relative &mdash; as well as for educational reasons.  It has been decided to extend the scheme's scope to include career breaks for purposes of travel abroad as soon as sufficient resources are available to replace staff taking career breaks.  The availability of replacement staff is dependent on the completion of competitions for the major recruitment grades currently underway or planned.  It is envisaged that this recruitment process will be sufficiently advanced to permit the extension of the scheme to take effect in the autumn of this year.  Career breaks are available to all civil servants who have completed their probation and have not reached the minimum retirement age other than certain specialist groups &mdash; e.g. computer staff &mdash; from whom career breaks are withheld because of the needs of the work.</P>
      <P>The other main conditions of the scheme are as follows.  A career break is a period of special leave without pay and may be granted for between one and five years; a career break may be extended in six monthly periods or in periods in excess of six months provided the total period of the career break does not exceed five years in all; and officers wishing to return from career breaks are guaranteed reemployment in a relevant grade within the Civil Service &mdash; but not necessarily within their existing organisation &mdash; within a period of 12 months of the date on which they planned to return to work.</P>

      <P>Investment by its very <Col N="124" /> nature generally involves an element of risk-taking and as Minister for Industry and Commerce I cannot insulate life assurance proposers from whatever risk may be attached to the investment element of life assurance policies.  The decision on whether to take out such policies, and hence to participate in the reward and the risk, including decisions as to what may constitute a fair return on their investments, must ultimately rest with insurance proposers.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned that insurance proposers should be given the fullest information possible to enable them to make informed decisions on the taking out of life assurance policies which have an investment element.  There has already been significant progress in this regard.  In response to calls from my Department and the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, the insurance industry introduced in January 1988 a code of practice which provides for a cooling-off period during which the proposer can withdraw from a life assurance policy without financial loss.  Under this code, insurance proposers also receive a document explaining the pros and cons of assurance policies, including the risk element involved.</P>

Arrangements have also been made for consultant neurosurgical cover at St. Vincent's Hospital until such time as a final decision is made on the recommendations of Comhairle na nOspidéal on the future arrangements for the cover to be provided by Beaumont to the other major Dublin hospitals.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the centralisation of the neurosurgical service is the best and most effective way of providing the service for those who need it.  I very much regret that the facts relating to this very desirable rationalisation of a key service have not been accurately reflected in the letter referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="134" /> am aware of the developments in other countries regarding alarm systems for elderly and disabled people.  In 1986 my Department commissioned a study of the potential of technological systems available to meet the communications needs of elderly people in an Irish context.  The report entitled &ldquo;Communication Networks and the Elderly&rdquo; has been used as a guide by health boards and voluntary bodies involved in the provision of services for the elderly.  Copies of the report are available from my Department.</P>
      <P>Health boards and local authorities have co-operated in the installation of alarm systems.  Alarm systems have been installed in sheltered housing complexes or where an elderly person has been assessed as being at a medical or social risk, for example, living in an isolated area or living alone.</P>
      <P>The health boards are examining the extension of these emergency communication systems.  The North Eastern Health Board is proposing to develop an alarm scheme in an isolated area.  In Dublin, plans are at an advanced stage for the installation of a system for the vulnerable elderly in the south inner city area.  The North Western Health Board is planning to assist a further 12 elderly persons with alarm systems.</P>
      <P>The use of alarm systems in the care of the elderly is likely to grow in the future as the technology develops and people gain confidence in its use.  As announced in the budget and in my speech of 6 February, I will be making £5 million available to health boards shortly to strengthen home and community support for ill or disabled elderly people.  The provision of home alarms is an option open to boards to maintain an elderly person at home if they would otherwise require institutional care.</P>

      <P>Tá tionchar nach beag ar theagasc na Gaeilge ag an modheolaíocht agus ag an gcur chuige nua-aimseartha atá á gcleachtadh i gcás na nuatheangacha.  Tá an cur chuige cumarsáideach á chur i bhfeidhm ar an nGaeilge (cosúil leis na nuatheangacha) sna siollabais don teastas sóisearach; beidh trialacha cluastuisceana mar chuid dílis den scrúdú don Teastas sin.</P>

      <P>Chun spreagadh a thabhairt do dhaltaí scoile an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a chothú tá leasú bunúsach á chur i bhfeidhm agam ar an siollabas Gaeilge sna ranganna sóisearacha de na scoileanna dara leibhéal; leasú a chuireann an bhéim ar Ghaeilge chumarsáideach.  Tá leasú idir lámha ar an siollabas do na ranganna sinsearacha chomh maith. Maidir leis an siollabas Gaeilge sna bunscoileanna tá an Coiste Athbhreithnithe um Curaclam na Bunscoile ag déileáil le cúrsaí siollabais sa Ghaeilge chun deimhin a dhéanamh de go mbeidh leanúnachas idir Curaclam na bunscoile agus an Curaclam sna hiarbhunscoileanna.

    <P>Tá mé ag féachaint le tuismitheoirí agus daoine fásta i gcoitinne a spreagadh chun na Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim i gcomhthéacs foghlaim na Gaeilge sna scoileanna. Chuige sin tá tacaíocht á tabhairt ag mo Roinn-se do dhá scéim phíolótacha. Tá scéim phíolótach tosaithe i gceantar Dhomhnach Míde (Baile Átha Cliath) ina bhfuil An Roinn Oideachais agus Bord na Gaeilge comhpháirteach. Tá an scéim seo dírithe ar an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn sa bhunscoil, sna blianta tosaigh iar-bhunscoile agus imeasc an phobail i gcoitinne.  Tá eagraí ceaptha chun an scéim a riaradh agus tá roinnt <Col N="137" /> bunscoileanna agus iar-bhunscoileanna páirteach sa scéim.  Glactar leis mar bhunphrionsabal go bhfuil tacaíocht na dtuismitheoirí agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge imease an phobail an-tábhachtach d'fhoghlaim na Gaeilge sa scoil.  Mar sin féachfar le gnó an phobail a fhorbairt céim ar chéim leis an obair scoile.</P>
    <P>Tugann An Roinn Oideachais tacaíocht chomh maith don scéim &mdash;&ldquo;Tiobraid Árann ag Labhairt&rdquo;.  Tá an scéim seo ag feidhmiú i mbunscoileanna agus in iar-bhunscoileanna áirithe i dTiobraid Árann Thuaidh le dhá bhliain anuas.  Tá anbhéim á leagan ar labhairt na Gaeilge agus ar chothú an dá-theangachais sa phobal i gcoitinne.  Tá deiseanna curtha ar fáil do dhaoine fásta chun an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.</P>
    <P>Tá réimse scéimeanna eile ann, faoi réir na Roinne agamsa, Roinn na Gaeltachta agus eagraíochtaí Gaelacha, le daoine fásta a spreagadh chun an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a chothú, agus leanfar ag tabhairt tacaíochta dóibh.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a system of approval of textbooks for national schools and through this approval mechanism the content of school textbooks is monitored.</P>
      <P>As the publication and sale of school books are in the hands of private companies it is not open to me to influence their pricing policy.  The syllabus planners try to avoid over-frequent changes and are conscious that they should avoid any unnecessary increase in costs.  However, textbooks must be changed from time to time if teachers are to keep their work educationally stimulating, and if content and methodology are to be kept reasonably up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as second level education is concerned, textbooks are prepared and <Col N="138" /> published by commercial publishers on the basis of the programmes prescribed by my Department for each subject. Formal approval of the published texts is not required but they are expected to conform to the officially prescribed programmes. The suitability of textbooks in use is monitored by the Department's inspectors in the course of school inspection and, as required, in consultation with publishers.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware of the financial strain placed on parents of school pupils in providing school textbooks for their children, and has drawn the attention of school authorities to the desirability of changing non-prescribed textbooks as infrequently as possible, in order to save parents undue expenditure.</P>

      <P>At present there are 279 caretakers employed in national schools under my Department's scheme of grants.  The decision to phase out the scheme was taken in connection with the preparation of the 1983 Estimates for Public Services, and was part of the strategy of reducing the numbers employed in the public service.  Of the 97 caretaker posts which have fallen vacant since the phasing out began, 57 were in schools which still meet the original appointment criteria.  It was decided some years ago that schools would not lose their caretakers should their teacher numbers fall below the level required to qualify them for a caretaker post in the first place; therefore no posts have fallen vacant in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> In conjunction with the introduction of the social employment scheme in schools in 1985, the then Government decided, as an exceptional matter, to reinstate all 29 caretaker posts which had fallen vacant up to April of that year.  No exceptions to the phasing out policy have been granted since that time.</P>
    <P>In 1989, three caretaker posts fell vacant in schools where the original criteria governing the establishment of the post are still satisfied.  It is not possible to predict the number of caretakers who will retire during 1990 as there is no compulsory retirement age laid down for these staff.  In addition to the appointment of caretakers under the above scheme, many schools would have the services of a caretaker under the social employment scheme.</P>
