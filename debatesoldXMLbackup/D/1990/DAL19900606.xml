    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985, removed the requirement for persons aged 18 years and over to have a doctor's prescription for the purchase of contraceptives from pharmacies.  It also extended the range of outlets permitted to sell contraceptives. Outlets now include pharmacies, registered medical practitioners, employees of health boards when the sale is made at a <Col N="1272" /> health institution, licensed family planning clinics, and employees of hospitals providing maternity services or services for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases when the sale is made at the particular hospital.  I am satisfied that the existing approved outlets adequately cater for public demand and the necessity for amending legislation does not arise. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the outcome of the recent court case involving the Irish Family Planning Association Limited as notice of appeal has been lodged by the association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Republic of Ireland is the only country in Europe that now has restrictions in relation to the outlets selling condoms? In view of the very serious public health risks attached to the spread of the HIV virus and AIDS, will he now consider exempting condoms from the Family Planning Act in view of the fact that they are medically inert?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, under the 1985 legislation a number of new outlets were established for the provision of all contraceptives including condoms. My information from around the country is that condoms and contraceptives are available on a regular basis to people who wish to use them.</P>
      <P>In relation to the case to which the Deputy referred, I might add there are 300 pharmacies in Dublin and a number of family planning clinics, many of them within 100 yards of the premises referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>Let me bring in Deputy Brendan Howlin whose Question No. 3 refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the most recent report indicates a very significant increase in sexually transmitted diseases in the Western Health Board area, that the rate of increase in HIV infection is significant this year and that one eminent AIDS expert has said condoms are the only antidote we know <Col N="1273" /> of to prevent the spread of some of these infections?  In the light of that information does he not feel it incongruous that anybody will be prosecuted in the courts for providing what is seen in most countries now as a life-saving device?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that condoms reduce the risk of AIDS but, as I have said, throughout the country condoms are available to people who need them and in all the health board areas there are outlets available within easy reach of people who want to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the World Health Organisation's regulations to member states are in favour of no restrictions on the sale of condoms?  Is he aware that his own Department's health promotion unit's literature in relation to HIV and AIDS promotes the use of condoms and that in that context it is totally wrong to have restrictions?  Will he further acknowledge that there was substantial demand by young people for the use and purchase of condoms from a reputable organisation, the Family Planning Association who have been there for 21 years and also from the Virgin Megastore and other places?  In view of this, will he consider bringing proposals before the Government as a result of a rethink on the grounds of public health and especially in view of the fact that his own AIDS coordinator is predicting a level of 20,000 people with HIV infection before the end of the decade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>These are Priority Questions.  I am anxious to dispose of the four questions involved.  I shall need co-operation.  Brevity will be the keynote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not agree that it is wrong to have restrictions on the sale of condoms.  I am sure everybody would agree that there should be quality in the variety of condoms available and that they should measure up to some standard.  When I came into office I made <Col N="1274" /> a regulation that they must have some European standard of quality control before they can go on sale in this country. It would be wrong to have no restrictions whatever.  As a means of preventing or reducing the risk of AIDS, condoms are available throughout the country.  Of course there is a responsibility on the Minister for Health to see that they are available.  I am satisfied from the information available to me that there is a sufficient number of outlets.  There is no public demand for a change in the law. Regarding the premises which gave rise to the Deputy's question, there are a number of outlets where condoms are sold within very easy reach of that premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the increase in sexually transmitted diseases which is now documented, will the Minister accept that he has a responsibility not just to look at existing measures but to consider how matters can be improved in the light of a worsening situation?  He should seek now to review measures which obviously are not working satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is necessary to keep reviewing all measures in our fight to combat AIDS.  That is being done.  The next questions deals with that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>A final and very brief supplementary. Does the Minister not consider that the only restrictions which should apply in relation to the sale of condoms are age restrictions, not outlet restrictions?  Would he reconsider this on the grounds of public health since failure to do so is a dereliction of his duty?</P>

      <asker>Mr. Yates</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that adequate care and support is being provided to patients with HIV and AIDS; if he has any specific proposals to provide specialist services for their needs; and if he will set out the Government's plans in relation to control of the AIDS epidemic.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>AIDS Strategy in Ireland is being developed in line with the epidemiological situation related to AIDS in this country and in line with the recommendations of international agencies such as WHO and the EC and strategies being implemented elsewhere. In line with these recommendations the emphasis on the provision of AIDS related services is community based, in so far as this is appropriate, with the necessary input from the hospital services. Also as part of general policy persons suffering from HIV/AIDS are treated in the same way as persons suffering from other diseases so as to avoid discrimination.</P>
      <P>The Government's AIDS Strategy consists of the following key elements:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">Monitoring Cases of, and Deaths from AIDS and trend in HIV Infection</P>
      <P>Cases of AIDS are monitored by the Department of Health under a confidential reporting system.  An AIDS antibody service is available on a voluntary basis, throughout the country. The level of HIV infection is monitored, as far as possible, by the Department of Health through the reports of the virus reference laboratory, UCD, where confirmatory testing is carried out.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Prevention through the Protection of the Blood Supply</P>
      <P>All blood donations are screened for the AIDS virus, and only heat-treated blood products are used in Ireland. Ireland is the only EC member state not to have had a transfusion related case of AIDS or HIV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1276" /> Prevention through Information and Education</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health and the Department of Education have developed materials for an AIDS programme for second level schools.  Pilot testing of the materials began in September 1989 in various schools throughout the country and pending completion of the evaluation currently in progress, the programme will be available nationwide. In the meantime, DCC MOHS of the health boards are co-operating with local school authorities to ensure that information on AIDS is provided to pupils in second-level schools.</P>
    <P>At the level of the general population, a public information programme started in May 1987 through television, radio and newspaper advertising and a booklet and freephone service. A revised up-to-date booklet on AIDS was issued in January 1990 and is available through pharmacies, health boards, the EHB's AIDS resource centre, voluntary agencies and the Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health.  The personal worries and queries of individuals are also being addressed through a confidential telephone service.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Care and Management of Persons Suffering from AIDS and from HIV</P>
    <P>As I stated in the outset, it is my policy that persons with HIV/AIDS are treated and managed in the same way as persons suffering from other diseases so as to avoid discrimination. Towards the end, persons with AIDS are treated in general hospitals by the appropriate consultant depending on the nature of the symptoms from which the individual may be suffering.  General practitioners also provide a source of care and counselling for people who wish to be tested and who have a positive test result and community care teams of the health boards, together with the voluntary agencies, play a central role in the provision of necessary services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> Also, the following have been provided as part of the development of the Irish AIDS Strategy: a capital grant of £380,000 has been given by the Department of health towards the further development of the virus reference laboratory, UCD; the participation by Ireland in an EC study of paediatric AIDS towards which a grant of £30,000 was made by the Department of Health to the AIDS fund; allocations totalling £1 million approximately have been made to date from the national lottery towards the funding of statutory and voluntary agencies involved in the provision of services for persons with AIDS and HIV. These include the Eastern Health Board's Outreach Programme &mdash; which is aimed at one-to-one contact with IV drug abusers &mdash; St. James's Hospital, Dublin, the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Anna Liffey Project, the Ballymun Youth Project and Cork AIDS Action Alliance; a drop-in AIDS resource centre run by the Eastern Health Board is providing preventative and risk reduction services for IV drug abusers with HIV &mdash; the services provided include syringes, methadone and condoms, all of which are done on an individual basis supported by counselling; the Eastern Health Board are currently developing a similar facility on the north side of Dublin city at an estimated cost of £80,000; a grant of £250,000 from national lottery funds was made available to the AIDS fund for the care and relief of distress in AIDS sufferers and £1 million was granted to the Haemophiliac Trust Fund, and training in the care and management of persons with AIDS and HIV has been provided for health care staff.</P>
    <P>In view of the changing AIDS situation worldwide, the Irish AIDS Strategy is continuously under review and being adapted as circumstances require.</P>
    <P>I recently reviewed the care and management element of the AIDS Strategy and as part of this process I am consulting with the Eastern Health Board, in whose area the main concentration of the incidence of HIV positive and AIDS cases is, with a view to the further integration of <Col N="1278" /> community and hospital based services progrmmes of which domiciliary support services is a major component.</P>
    <P>I have also asked the advisory council on health promotion to consider as a matter of urgency the contents and direction of any further programme of publicity in this area.</P>
    <P>As the epidemiology of AIDS is such that the virus can be contacted up to 15 years prior to the development of full AIDS, it has to be borne in mind that the cases currently being notified to the Department of Health are the result of infection acquired in the past and well before any of the measures taken here were necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again remind you, a Cheann Comhairle, that some seven minutes had elapsed prior to the commencement of Question Time.  Is the Minister aware that for over three years there has been a demand for the appointment of a second genital urinary consultant, together with Dr. Mulcahy, to deal with the problems of AIDS?  Will he sanction such an appointment in either the Mater Hospital or St. James's Hospital? Will he explain why the report referred to during the debate on AIDS and haemophilia a year ago &mdash; which was prepared by his then Minister of State, Deputy Leyden &mdash; has not been published and acted on?  Does he have any proposal to introduce a national screening service for people attending A and E departments throughout the country on an anonymous basis in order to assess the exact level of prevalence of HIV in the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of anonymous testing is under review in conjunction with other member states.  No <Col N="1279" /> final decision has been made on this issue as of yet &mdash; there are views for and against it.  With regard to the appointment of a second physician, it was suggested a number of years ago that there should be a second physician and a second major unit established in Dublin.  I have no particular problem with this suggestion if it is the correct way to go.  There was a view that everybody who suffers from HIV and AIDS should be treated in one major unit.  As I said in my reply, there has now been a change of view.  The situation is changing on a regular basis and the view now is that patients, in their own interests, should be treated in the community where possible by the family doctor or in the local hospital by the general physician, dependent on the complication they have &mdash; for example, pneumonia, psychiatric illness or whatever.  It is not necessary to have these high tech units and a single unit which everybody would attend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to proposals concerning the opening of 15 day beds at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my visit to Tralee General Hospital last November, I was informed by staff of the hospital of the needs of the hospital, including the arguments in favour of opening 15 day beds.  As <Col N="1283" /> promised, I conveyed the comments made by the staff to the chairman and chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board.  As the Deputy is aware, the provision of services at the hospital is primarily a matter for the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister is washing his hands of the problems in the health services in County Kerry.  Over the past two years 60 beds have been lost in this hospital and there are now only 229 acute beds, which are not sufficient to cater for the needs of County Kerry and outside areas.  If 15 five day beds were provided in this hospital a number of elective cases could be dealt with so that some of the longest waiting lists in the country could be reduced.  In the present circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said.  I am not wiping my hands of the problems in the health services in County Kerry; I am very conscious of the needs of County Kerry. Indeed, this was reflected in the additional allocation which was made to the Southern Health Board in 1989 &mdash; £180,000 was provided for Tralee General Hospital.  That allowed 50 extra hip replacement operations, the employment of an ENT surgeon to treat additional patients at Tralee General Hospital and the purchase of ENT equipment.  The Southern Health Board had proposed the closure of further beds on 1 September 1989 but this was avoided by the intervention of the Government.</P>

The undertaking he gave was in fact that he would ensure that the 15 day beds would be reopened as soon as possible.  It is rather farcical for him to say that he will communicate that to the health board because the health board are well aware of the problem.  I put it to the Minister given that the health board are at present short £3 million this year, that unless he provides additional funding, communicating with the chairman or the chief executive officer of the health board is a farcical exercise.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 129 together.</P>
      <P>The Council for Social Welfare's call for a White Paper on the Health Services is contained in its response to the Report of the Commission on Health Funding.  I have already announced a wide series of measures to develop and improve the efficiency of the health services as the first phase of the Government's response to the commission's report.</P>
      <P>I have also indicated that the Government will announce their proposals on the future administrative arrangements for the health services in the near future. Further decisions on funding and eligibility issues covered in the commission's report will be announced when the Government have had an opportunity to consider the forthcoming report on the conditions of employment of consultants.</P>
      <P>The Government's plans on the future direction of the health services are, therefore, proceeding.  The question of the format in which Government policy will be announced will be considered at the appropriate time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not perhaps refer to the discussion that took place on the previous question but it is a fairly good indication of what is happening in the health services and the urgent need for a white paper.  All we have experienced over the last four or five years are health services on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as has been stated time and time again.  In view of the Minister saying earlier this year that he had to provide an extra £3 million for one section or another, it is being <Col N="1286" /> done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis whether it is in the acute hospital services system, dental, ophthalmic, community care or psychiatric services, and consequently there is an urgent need for a white paper on the health services.  The question of administration is not the major issue but the delivery of services.  Would the Minister agree that that is urgent and that he should bring in a white paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on whether there should be a white paper.  I would remind the House that in February I announced a number of initiatives, many of which are already in place.  These include an efficiency review of the health agencies beginning with acute hospitals conducted by Mr. Noel Fox, an initiative on hospital services and the delivery of services, hospital services and procedures in the Dublin area, including an examination of admissions policies and patient arrangements and discharge arrangements for patients who require community support or long stay care after hospitalisation that is the David Kennedy co-ordinating group.  Also included are initiatives to improve patient care and the introduction of an effective appointments system, a hospital code of conduct and a patient feedback mechanism in each hospital, the establishment of a formal appeals procedure on eligibility for medical cards, the introduction of measures to develop and improve health services management including the development of better information systems and the strengthening of the management role of consultants through a pilot exercise on departmental budgeting.  These are some of the initiatives that are in place.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he would explain to the House what he meant when he said that in a couple of weeks he would make major announcements on the future reorganisation of the health services of the country?  Will he confirm that on the same occasion he stated that there will be no change in the structures of the health boards?  Has he any proposals other than commissioning more reports and making <Col N="1287" /> further announcements?  Has he any proposals to make in this session of the Dáil regarding reorganising the health services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from those remarks that Deputy Yates is not in favour of a white paper which he would probably see as another report.  What I said at the association of health boards meeting was exactly what I said in the Dáil in February, that I would be making a statement before the end of the session about our view on the structures by which the service should be administered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister is now over three years in office, that he has established the best part of 30 committees of investigation in those three years and that the only action he has taken has been to reduce the quality of service significantly, I would suggest that what is required is a white paper outlining a set of proposals and legislative measures on the funding and structures of health authorities that the Government will now implement.  When can we expect to hear from the Minister on that? The Minister indicated what he has done in relation to the commission on health funding so far.  He has established two more committees and an appeals mechanism which has yet to see the light of day.</P>

      <P>I established a small working group to look at the system of computerisation in the health service which was in a mess in the four years when the Deputy's colleague was Minister for Health and not a thing was done about it I suppose, again, because the wisdom was there but there was no expert to look at it.  I had the computerisation of the health service looked at by an expert group.  Within six weeks they reported to me and I adopted their recommendations immediately.  I am <Col N="1289" /> glad to say this year, for the first time, we have a special subhead for computers and also we have a policy on computers which is acceptable to all the agencies and keeps us in line with the most modern thinking on the subject.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other two groups the Deputy mentions, the David Kennedy co-ordinating group and the Noel Fox group who are looking at the efficiency measures in hospitals, these are not committees making their report.  I have explained this in the House time and time again.  If the Deputy would take the time to inquire what they are doing he would realise that they are action groups.  Mr. Noel Fox is a professional management consultant who is being paid to do a job. Mr. David Kennedy will see that action is taken in the Dublin hospitals and I am sure all Members will agree that action is needed in regard to them.  They are five major and totally independent agencies providing services but there was no co-ordination and his group are there to see that there is co-ordination and not just preparing reports as the Deputy alleges.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their <Col N="1290" /> dependants.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility but these guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the statutory criterion which I have mentioned is met.  However, the Deputies will appreciate that in assessing the merits of an individual medical card application, the chief executive officer concerned must take note of income from all sources as well as other factors such as capital available.</P>
    <P>I can asure the House that all persons who meet the statutory requirement for entitlement to a medical card will receive one.  If Deputy Howlin has a specific applicant in mind I would suggest that he write to me giving details of the particular case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he intends, as he indicated to me in the course of a reply to a parliamentary question on 1 May last, to exempt people who are in receipt of family income supplement from determination for medical card eligibility on income grounds.  Will the Minister say if he intends to invoke section 45 of the Health Act, 1970, to do that and if that will disadvantage people whose incomes are identical but derived from normal working?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister find it acceptable that a person who has an income of £X derived from work plus family income supplement is entitled to a medical card while a family with the identical income from working alone is excluded from that entitlement?

      <P>It has been the policy of successive Ministers for Health to take and recommend whatever measures are necessary to reduce the level of smoking. We have been singularly successful here in that the number of people smoking has reduced from 47 per cent in the mid-seventies to 27 per cent now.  I understand that we have the second highest price for cigarettes in the European Community. We continue to monitor the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The second question is primarily one for the Minister for Finance. My answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is that I am aware of the increase in the number of young women smoking.  A number of measures have been taken over the last couple of years to try to make the public more aware of the dangers of smoking.  I hope that the introduction of the tobacco regulations will have a major impact in drawing attention to the dangers of cigarette smoking.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that advertising on the electronic media is not allowed here.  There is advertising in the print media, with restrictions. For example, advertisements cannot glamorise tobacco smoking and 15 per cent of the advertisement must contain a warning.  Successive Ministers, back to 1978 when the first legislation was introduced, have been committed to reducing the incidence of disease caused by the use of tobacco.  One of the reasons there is not a total ban on the print media here is that so much of the media read here comes from countries that do not have restrictions.  I am glad that we went a step towards a joint European approach at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Brussels on 17 May.  I hope that approach will come if not in the next Presidency certainly in the Presidency that follows.</P>

      <P>In 1985, a report &mdash;<i>Planning For The Future</i>&mdash; by a working party on the psychiatric services was published and its recommendations are being implemented in each of the eight health boards as they determine the order of priority.  However, I do not accept that there is an inadequate service for patients who suffer from psychiatric illness and there is no evidence that the rate of suicide has increased through any deficiency in the service.  There has been an increase in the number of suicides and one of the reasons given is that there is a more accurate reporting of such cases now than formerly.  We have moved a long way from the time when people were locked up permanently and, unfortunately, that in itself may lead to an increase in the number of suicides.</P>

There are 36 occupational therapists employed in the mental handicap services and 31 in the psychiatric hospitals.  We are trying to standardise the position in the health boards, particularly in the area of community care, which takes priority.</P>

      <P>I recently met representatives of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul on this matter.  Discussions between officials of my Department and the Eastern Health Board are taking place to consider possible arrangements for funding the project.  As the Deputies will be aware, I approved a grant of £100,000 from the health allocation of the national lottery proceeds for this service last December.

Of these, 119 died peacefully having been very well cared for by the home care service.  Will the Minister accept that a whole section of people living north of the Liffey are being denied hospice care because the Minister has not made the necessary arrangements to provide funding?  Will he give us further information about his meeting with the Daughters of Chairty of St. Vincent de Paul in which they got the impression they had received a commitment from him for home care service from January 1991 and a 50 per cent capitation grant for the new hospital to be built?

      <P>I agree with everything the Deputy said about the merits and value of the hospice service provided in Dublin and indeed throughout the <Col N="1298" /> country.  I see a need for a hospice centre in Dublin because it complements the home care service.  I already pointed out to the Deputy that when the Sisters decided to build a hospice we allocated £100,000 from the national lottery.  We have been in discussion with the Eastern Health Board and I understand that the Sisters will also consult them about the provision of a hospice centre on the north side of the city.</P>

Deputies are probably aware that, at one stage, the health board thought they would locate the hospice in St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park. However, there is now general agreement that the hospice should be located further north in the city.  As I promised the Sisters, we will keep the situation under review in regard to funding directly from the Exchequer.  We will be sympathetic to them but it would be wrong of me to say, in the middle of the year, that I will provide funding when it is not available to me.</P>

What I am asking about is the quality of the cover being provided and its cost; whether it is costing more under the GMS scheme to treat fewer people, because I understand the percentage of people who are fully eligible has dropped from approximately 39 per cent to 32 per cent?</P>

My understanding is that their annual report has not yet been completed and will not be available until the month of August; that it will take account of two months during which <Col N="1302" /> the old scheme was in operation and ten months during which the new scheme has been in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the change in the GMS from the fee per item to the capitation system of payment of doctors, is the Minister aware of the increase in the number of admissions to accident and emergency departments of hospitals because of the allegation that general practitioners, particularly at night &mdash; since they are no longer being paid for visits at night &mdash; are advising people to go to hospital instead, and that this involves the health services in a spiral of extra cost in respect of people who do not necessarily need to go into hospital? As part of the review in train would he have this matter thoroughly investigated, or does he have any information on it to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  In Dublin where very detailed surveys have been undertaken my information is that the number of people who turn up at accident and emergency departments without a note from their general practitioner is 60 per cent, and that that has not changed in hospitals where a survey was conducted before the changes took place.  My information is that that pattern <Col N="1303" /> did not change from what had been the case heretofore.  There is a particular problem prevailing in Dublin &mdash; to which I have referred on many occasions in this House &mdash; in that, in some areas, there is not continuity of general practitioner service.  Throughout Dublin generally I understand there is a tendency on the part of patients to by-pass their general practitioner and go straight to an accident or emergency department.  But there is no evidence to suggest there has been any increased use of the accident and emergency services since the change over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware of the extreme concern among the medical profession at the operation of this new capitation system of payment of doctors.  Looking realistically at its economics &mdash; in regard to overhead costs, retention and so on &mdash; would the Minister agree that the amount of money that eventually finds its way to doctors is so little that, in order to provide a continuous service throughout the year, there is a tendency for them to refer patients to casualty departments?  For example I am aware that in the mid-west alone, at the Limerick Regional Hospital, the number of casualties have risen recently from approximately 1,100 a week, that is up 40 per cent on the previous year.  Would the Minister agree that there is a tendency in that direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the point the Deputy made.  In fact there was quite a substantial increase in the amount of money made available to doctors, both directly and by way of a number of support mechanisms, such as the provision of support towards practice premises and in the provision of secretarial and nursing help.  Indeed the doctors themselves voted substantially to accept the new arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister does not have any real, hard information for the House today, would he include in the survey an opinion as to whether there has been an increase in the <Col N="1304" /> use of medical bureaus, when general practitioners resort to a telephone answering service and people are referred elsewhere?  Such detail might give an indication of whether the system is operating satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>With regard to acceptance of this capitation system of payment by doctors, has the Minister fulfilled all the commitments he agreed with the Medical Union on its introduction, such as pension rights and so on, agreed with the medical profession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have access to the information the Deputy seeks in regard to medical bureaus because that is a private arrangement between them and general practitioners.</P>
      <P>With regard to the agreement, I should say I do not have details of every aspect of it that was implemented.  In regard to pensions I should say the State honours its commitment and provides 10 per cent towards doctors pensions, the doctors themselves providing 5 per cent, which money has been lodged.  I would not know whether doctors have arranged a pension scheme at this stage.  That is a matter for the doctors themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to point out that the majority of people suffering from withdrawal symptoms due to drug abuse do not require psychiatric treatment.  There are, however, a range of specialist facilities available for these people.  These include in-patient detoxification services at Beaumont Hospital, out-patient services at the Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre, <Col N="1305" /> Trinity Court and a drop-in centre for intravenous drug abusers in Baggot Street Hospital.  A number of voluntary agencies also provide services for persons suffering from drug abuse.  These agencies receive State financial support.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the demands being made on existing facilities.  I am keeping the level of service provision under constant review.  I might add that plans to provide additional services for drug abusers are at an advanced stage.  These plans involve the provision of a new drop-in centre, similar to that in operation in Baggot Street Hospital, on the north side of Dublin.  This centre is expected to open this year.</P>
      <P>Apart from these specialist services for persons suffering from drug abuse, a full range of psychiatric services is also available to those who require psychiatric treatment.  Psychiatric services are being developed in community settings and are therefore more accessible to people who need to avail of those services.</P>

Would he agree that what is needed is decentralisation, by way of out-reach programmes, bringing those social workers into deprived communities where there is drug abuse?  Will the Minister of State, as a matter of priority, seek to review the services with a view to decentralising them?</P>

      <P>I am committed to the implementation of the recommendations of &ldquo;The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo; which has been accepted in principle by the Government.  Five million pounds has been made available this year to develop services for the elderly and to implement &ldquo;The Years Ahead.&rdquo; The developments will be concentrated on: home nursing and home helps; community facilities such as short term care and day care, and additional places in nursing homes.  The effect of these developments will be to improve local community services and to support the carers of elderly persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree with me that generally carers work a seven day week all the year round and despite the recent improvements carers need regular breaks from their work?  While the Minister's reply gives some information, the Minister has not specifically stated what additional help will be available at various times of the year which would allow carers to take weekend breaks or a short holiday away from the very tiresome and heavy work they do, which is a great saving to the State in keeping people out of hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kavanagh about the need to consider the position of carers, and the Government did that by introducing for the first time a new carer's allowance in the budget. This development will be a significant improvement for carers.  In addition, over the past three years I have been advocating that the health boards provide more respite care and this will be done as a result of the allocation of £5 million, so that as the Deputy suggested people who are looking after their own elderly will be able to have a break.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the introduction of the new carer's allowance but does he not accept that carers are not allowed to continue <Col N="1308" /> with stamping arrangements while they are doing this job and this will take away from the benefits that may be given to the elderly?  Usually, it is a family member who has another job who decides to give it up to take care of the elderly person, and if they take up the carer's allowance they are no longer eligible for social welfare credits.</P>

Will the Minister give a commitment to the House that the specific recommendation to establish panels of part-time district nurses &mdash; general nurses available on a part-time basis &mdash; will be established in each health board to ensure that nursing services will be available other than on a nine to five, five-day week basis from now on and especially during the coming winter?</P>

      <P>In relation to promised legislation &mdash; the Broadcasting Bill &mdash; which was published last week may I ask at this juncture if the Taoiseach would accept that he owes the House an explanation why the Communications portfolio, since 1987, has been dragged through three other Departments &mdash; Energy, Industry and Commerce and now Justice?  Does he accept that this was a fundamental error?  Given the debacle in which the Minister landed himself because of the publication of this Bill last week, does the Taoiseach now accept that a separate Ministry for Communications should be established?</P>

The Taoiseach had a meeting with Mr. Brooke on 28 May and I submitted a question to him for reply on 6 June asking if he would indicate to the House what matters had been discussed and if he would make a statement to the House on the matter.

That question was also transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs by the Department of the Taoiseach although it related specifically to a meeting the <Col N="1392" /> Taoiseach had with Mr. Brooke.  May I ask the Taoiseach at this point if he intends to make a statement to the House on the discussions which have taken place between himself and Mr. Brooke or, if he believes the matter is too sensitive to be dealt with on the Floor of the House, would he take up the suggestion I made previously at Question Time that he brief the party leaders here on the issues concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very confined debate, perhaps too confined.  I want to reiterate my position on nursing homes that come under the scope of this legislation. The difficulty arises in regard to the categories which would be exempt. My party are opposed to section 2 (1) (a) which refers to institutions managed by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board.  We feel that an exemption should not be conferred on them.  Section 2 (1) (b) contains the words &ldquo;by or under the supervision of a person <Col N="1409" /> whose name is entered in the General Register of Medical Practitioners&rdquo;.  That should not be referred to.  While I agree that acute general hospitals and acute care should not be included, I can see homes being established by general practitioners. Section 2 (1) (g) refers to homes run by the religious and I do not see why they should be exempt.  Section 2 (2) refers to subsequent decisions by a Minister regarding a class of institution which would be taken in or out.  In effect classes could only be taken in and none could be taken out.</P>
      <P>That basically summarises the type of changes we wish to see.  I support the Minister's amendment to allow the exemption of Cheshire Homes.  It is very important that all institutions which care for the elderly on a residential basis should be included.  I said that mental handicap institutions should not be exempt.  Having discussed this with the National Association for Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, NAMHI, and others, I have concluded that perhaps they should be dealt with by way of separate legislation.  I am happy such institutions are being exempted in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this section in considerable detail on the last occasion.  In light of the time constraints imposed on us I do not propose to repeat anything I said then except to state, as a matter of principle, that the Bill before us proposes to improve the conditions and have standardised conditions for all people being cared for in nursing homes or similar institutions.  As a matter of principle, the Bill should apply to the maximum possible number of institutions unless there is a particularly good reason for excluding an institution.  Clearly from the case made by all Opposition parties on the last occasion the exclusions proposed by the Minister are far too broad.  I hope the amendments put down to curtail those exclusions will, on reflection, be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put down a <Col N="1410" /> number of amendments to this section. The Workers' Party are concerned at the number of institutions which are not covered by the Bill.  I question whether it is right for the Minister and this House to be concerned only about standards and conditions in private nursing homes.  Do we not have every right to be concerned about the standards in many public hospitals and homes?  The standards in some of these institutions, particularly psychiatric hospitals, may not always be up to the level required.  We cannot always blame the health boards for this; because sufficient funds are not made available to the health services standards in some of these institutions may fall.</P>
      <P>Why should institutions managed by or on behalf of the Minister or a health board be excluded from the provisions of this Bill, as is proposed in section 2?  Why should maternity homes, mental institutions, homes for children or premises in which the majority of the persons being maintained are members of a religious order be excluded?  Are these people not entitled to independent monitoring of these institutions to ensure that the highest possible standards are maintained? I am particularly concerned about the exclusion of old persons' homes or retirement homes from the provisions of the Bill.  There has been a growth in such institutions in recent years and while they are not technically regarded as nursing homes they are nursing homes in every sense of the word.  The people in these homes may not be suffering from any illness or disability but they are unable to look after themselves.  Consequently, I feel strongly about the exclusion of so many institutions from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the institutions which are being excluded under section 2, particularly under section 2 (1) (a).  When we last debated this Bill the Minister said the reason institutions managed by or on behalf of a Minister or a health board are not included within the scope of this Bill is that &ldquo;they have already been subjected to a statutory and <Col N="1411" /> publicly accountable system of management&rdquo;. I ask the Minister to spell out to this House the statutory provisions he was referring to.  Can he give us an assurance that these provisions are of a similar standard to those proposed in this Bill?</P>
      <P>Beyond a general reference in the Health Act, 1970, I have failed to locate any specific statute dealing with this matter.  I ask the Minister to clarify this point.  Has he brought in regulations regarding the standards in health board nursing homes and if so, what are they? Are these standards comparable with those proposed for the private sector in section 6 of this Bill?  Who enforces these standards?  Are they enforced by a body independent of the health board?</P>
      <P>The Minister said this Bill is about accountability but I should like to know where the accountability is regarding health board homes.  The Minister can hardly be said to be an independent party.  Budgetary considerations must weigh largely on his mind.  This question has been referred to time and time again. The authority of the Minister to send an inspector into a health board institution is not sufficient assurance that standards will be maintained.  When we are dealing with cost cutting factors, budgetary considerations are uppermost in any adminstrator's mind.  We have seen this happen time and time again.  On the basis of my experience, the Minister is unlikely to appoint an inspector to inquire into the consequences of his cost cutting measures.</P>
      <P>The whole system of accountability in the Bill is not good enough.  I have been informed by people working in the system that the standards in health board nursing homes have been falling in recent years due mainly to budgetary considerations. If we want to have uniformity in this area, which is vitally important, standards must be maintained right across the board and must be monitored by an independent body.  At present the health boards supervise private nursing homes but who will supervise the health boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to visiting committees. From my experience, not alone <Col N="1412" /> in this area but also in the psychiatric area, it is unacceptable that health board nursing homes should receive many weeks notice in advance of a visit by a visiting committee.  This means that every effort can be made by the nursing home to ensure that everything is spic and span and running smoothly.  The Minister should have included a provision in the Bill which would provide that a visiting committee can visit such homes anytime they want to make their reports.  If this is relevant in the case of the private sector it is even more relevant in the case of the public sector, given the constraints on finances.  I ask the Minister to consider this point with a view to including such a provision in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 in Deputy Yates's and my name deals with the exclusion of homes run by medical practitioners from the provisions of section 2.  I am disappointed that the Minister does not seem to be in favour of accepting this amendment, which we will have to press to a vote.  I should like to take this opportunity of saying how impressed I am with the Cheshire Homes.  I am very pleased the Minister has decided to exempt these homes from the requirements of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been rightly said by Deputy Yates and Deputy Howlin, we spent some time on 7 March discussing section 2.  We discussed amendments Nos. 10 to 17 which list the homes and institutions excluded from the provisions of the Bill and define the Minister's power to include or exclude classes of homes from the scope of the Bill.  Amendment No. 15 in my name excludes homes such as those run by the Cheshire Foundation.  These homes care for dependent people but their ethos is to promote the greatest level of independence possible.  Amendment No. 17 proposes removing the power of the Minister to exclude classes of homes from the scope of the Bill.  Deputy Yates put forward a similar amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the exclusion of voluntary mental handicap homes was raised earlier <Col N="1413" /> in the debate.  Voluntary mental handicap homes are excluded from the present nursing home legislation and I see no good reason to bring them within its scope.  I am glad that Deputy Yates agrees that it would be more beneficial to deal with this under different legislation, which we will look at.  I have the power under section 2 to include profit making homes for the mentally handicapped should the need arise.  I am aware of the need for legislation to deal with the protection of the mentally handicapped generally and I will be putting forward proposals for new legislation to protect the mentally handicapped in the context of a discussion document on legislation on mental health.  The registration of mental handicap homes should be dealt with in the context of the wider mental handicap legislation.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of homes run by religious communities where the majority of the dependants are priests or members of a religious order was also raised in the earlier debate.  This relates to section 2 (1) (g).  I will be moving an amendment on Report Stage to allow such homes to come within the scope of the legislation if they so wish.  This will meet the requirements put forward by the Opposition in the earlier debate but will avoid bringing homes such as Carmelite Monasteries within the scope of the Bill which I am sure the House would agree, would not be appropriate.</P>
    <P>On the questions raised by Deputy Ryan in regard to section 2 (1) (a) &mdash; the exclusion of an institution managed by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board, for example &mdash; if we were to exclude that section prisons would have to be included.  On the question of accountability by the health boards, they provide a high standard of care and I am very disappointed to hear Deputy Ryan say that the standard of care for the elderly has dropped in health board institutions.  That is certainly not my experience when I visit many of them around the country.  I could not be more impressed by the high standard of care which is rightly provided for the elderly in <Col N="1414" /> our society.  There has been an improving standard all the time as older buildings are replaced and other buildings refurbished. There is also the commitment and dedication of the staff; I could not accept that the standard has dropped.  The health board institutions have a system of accountability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a statutory one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>They do have a statutory system of accountability.  I was a member of a health board for 17 years and members can, if they feel it necessary, raise the issue of improvements that might be made in the services.  The Deputy referred to visiting committees and made the point that if the hospital knows that a visiting committee is to visit they may do something different. Members of health boards who are on visiting committees, however, also regularly visit homes for the elderly in their areas to visit neighbours and perhaps relatives of their own.  Even if it the hospital were to do something extraordinary on the day the visiting committee were coming, that would be obvious to members who visited the hospital at other times.</P>
      <P>In terms of public accountability, there is an opportunity for Deputies to ask questions of the Minister.  Also under section 83 of the Health Act, 1970, I have the power to institute an inquiry and to ask an inspector to call to a particular insitution and I would have no hesitation in doing that.  I cannot agree with Deputy Ryan that a Minister would not institute such an inquiry because it might be looking at the Minister's own policies.  Successive Ministers have been more than careful to ensure that the very highest standards are maintained in all our health board institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me preface my remarks by saying I do not wish to extend the debate on this section unduly as we have two other sections to get through in the next hour and a half.  I want to comment briefly on a few of the Minister's remarks.  On the previous occasion <Col N="1415" /> the Minister went through each of the categories to be excluded and gave the reason he felt they should be excluded. Basically the criterion was that they were already accountable under existing legislation. Certainly in some instances that would be accepted.</P>
      <P>I am a little concerned about the amendment the Minister is now proposing to introduce on Report Stage to rectify the obvious anomaly in subsection (2) (g) in relation to religious institutions because many Deputies felt that religious communities should be afforded the same standards and the same rights as any other citizens.  The Minister now indicates that he will bring in an amendment on Report Stage to allow those who wish to be included under the terms of the legislation.  I wonder who exactly will do the wishing?  Will it be the managements of the institutions, the convent, the monastery, the retirement home, or the people actually living there?  Perhaps the Minister would circulate the terms of the amendment he proposes to introduce so that at least we will be aware of that before we reach the existing amendments before us on that section?</P>
      <P>I welcome amendment No. 17 which is also taken in this grouping although I am still a little concerned about the broad power.  I do not like broad enabling powers being given to the Minister without proper monitoring by the Oireachtas and we will reach other amendments dealing with that subsequently.</P>
      <P>All in all, other than the views I have expressed now, this section has got a good thrashing out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome what the Minister said about introducing an amendment to paragraph (g) on Report Stage, but in line with what Deputy Howlin said I feel it should be at the request of the residents of the religious home that it be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make some other comments arising out of what the Minister said in relation to paragraph (a), the exemption for an institution managed by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board and leaving aside <Col N="1416" /> the Minister's reference to prisons &mdash; that was a very unfortunate example because, according to what I hear, their lack of medical facilities is appalling &mdash; would it be possible to consider adding on Report Stage the words &ldquo;other than a geriatric home run by a health board&rdquo;?  There must be some element of trying to level the playing field here, to use a current cliché, where in public geriatric homes could be entitled to the same protection. One of the homes I always hear about is the Sacred Heart Home in Castlebar, which is very understaffed and has all sorts of problems.  Not wishing to be too specific, however, I think it is important that there is a basic level of nursing care and so on at night.  While we do not want every category and every State institution brought in under this, the Minister might consider not exempting certain compatible geriatric homes.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to make relates to paragraph (b) to which I do not think the Minister responded.  What is proposed to be exempt is an institution in which the majority of the persons being maintained are treated for acute ailments and/or under the supervision of a person whose name is entered in the general register of medical practitioners.  I take it that if a general practitioner sets up a home which is providing, say, post-convalescent care, he could argue that he is exempt from the regulations under paragraph (b) here.  I feel this is badly worded.  I am not satisfied that this would not allow general practitioners to front nursing homes and gain exemption.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to specifically ask the Minister whether some Jewish homes that are seeking exemption, broadly under the same category as the Cheshire Homes, will be exempt.</P>

      <P>The Minister told us that there are ways and means available to him, such as under the Health Act, 1970, to deal with this matter but it should not be necessary for him to refer to other Acts when he is enacting legislation to set standards for nursing homes.  It seems ridiculous to exclude so many institutions, particularly institutions managed <Col N="1417" /> by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board.  The legislation should cover all aspects of nursing care.  We are not suggesting that there should be an imposition on health boards but we want the standard outlined in the Bill.  The Minister should reconsider his position on this and include the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there will be sufficient accountability to ensure that the highest standards are maintained by institutions under the control of health boards or of a Minister of the Government. We debated this issue at length on the last occasion.  I should like to tell Deputy Howlin, who raised a question about giving religious orders the right to opt in or out, that such a decision will be taken by those in control of religious orders.  Deputy Yates raised a question about Jewish homes and I should like to tell him that we have not received any representations from them.  I am not making a commitment at this stage but I will consider any case the Deputy has in mind.  Obviously, we have to ensure that we maintain a certain thrust throughout the Bill.  It would be unreasonable to permit some homes to opt out and insist on others being retained.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates raised a question about paragraph (b) which deals with an institution where people being maintained are being treated for acute ailments. It is clear that that means an acute hospital. It will be a matter for a health board to interpret whether a hospital is an acute hospital or a home where people are convalescing and as such should come within the scope of the Bill.  If it is a nursing home it will have to come within the scope of the Bill.  While the wording appears clear I should like to tell the Deputy that we will, between now and Report Stage, take advice on this.  We want to ensure that acute hospitals looking after patients with acute ailments are not included and that homes which are nursing homes are included.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), line 42, after &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, provided such amending regulations be approved by Dáil Éireann within twenty-one days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am always concerned when sections in any Bill are broad enabling sections which devolve to a Minister power to take actions which are of a legislative nature.  Under section 2 the Minister has the power to extend the provisions of the Bill to categories not already covered. Before the section was amended the Minister had power to exclude categories. That was a more serious power and caused me more concern but I am glad that we have limited the power of the Minister to extend the provisions of the Bill to categories not already included. Generally, I do not think the Minister will have any difficulty with that but, as a matter of principle, all regulations should be brought before the House to be copperfastened.  My amendment seeks to have amending regulations approved by the Dáil within 21 days.  That will enable the House, if it sees fit to express a view on a regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remember that the Whips agree each week to take motions without debate if there is no controversy about them but, as a matter of fundamental principle, on all matters the final decision should be in the hands of the elected Members of the House.  Motions should not be allowed through by stealth.  It is impossible for Members to follow the huge number of statutory instruments that pour out of all Government Departments. I was a member of the Committee on Legislation in the last Dáil and we studied the volume of statutory instruments emanating from Government Departments.  It was a staggering experience for most of us to realise the volume of real legislation that was being introduced outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That was taking place because the Oireachtas had devolved to Ministers the power to make those important decisions.  Important issues <Col N="1420" /> should have to come before the House for approval.</P>
    <P>This is not a difficult issue and, if there is no controversy about motions, the time of the House will not be taken up.  Umpteen motions are agreed on a regular basis by the Whips and they go through the House without debate.  The Minister, in an effort to make the institutions of Government, particularly his Department, more accountable to the House should accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 in my name, an alternative to amendment No. 18, states:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, a draft of each regulation shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and the regulation shall not come into effect until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) states that if the Minister becomes of opinion that this Act ought to apply to a class of institution for the care and maintenance of persons that it does not apply to, or that it ought not to apply to a class of nursing home to which it applies, he may by regulation amend the definition of &ldquo;nursing homes&rdquo;.  A draft of each regulation should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations should not come into effect until a motion approving the draft has been passed by each House.  When Bills are going through the House we deliberate on each section and highlight differences between the Government and the Opposition.  The least that might be done, following such debates, is to bring regulations before the House for approval.  We must remember that a large number of institutions have been excluded.  It seems likely that the Minister will bring in regulations and I am disappointed that he will not accept the amendment.  However, any regulation the Minister proposes to make should be <Col N="1421" /> brought into the House before it is put into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments. The net issue is whether this legislation is accountable to the Dáil or to the Department of Health civil servants.  I marginally prefer amendment No. 18 because it requires the approval of the Dáil as opposed to laying it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, they are both worthy of support and I hope the Minister will accept them on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>There are sufficient safeguards in the legislation and I do not propose to accept the amendments. Deputy Yates said it was a choice between being accountable to the Dáil and the Department of Health and he said he would prefer the legislation to be accountable to the Dáil.  The fact that regulations have to be laid before the Dáil means that the legislation is accountable to this House which has 21 days to annul the amended regulation if it so requires.  Section 15 provides that every regulation made under it shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and, if a resolution is passed by either House within a specified period, the regulations may be annulled.  This approach is satisfactory and the regulations extending the scope of the Bill should not have to be specifically approved.  Indeed, the arrangement in the Bill is standard practice for legislation for regulations passed by this House.  Very rarely is this type of section not included in a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that this is ordinary and standard practice but we should not accept it.  I hope the Minister will see his way to changing what is normal and standard.  Deputy O'Hanlon will not always be a Government member and all elected Members share a common view that the elected representatives should take the final decision in matters of this kind.  As I said, I served on a committee which looked at the whole area of statutory instruments and the <Col N="1422" /> Minister knows, from his Department, how many such instruments he is required to sign.  A huge volume of legislation &mdash; greater than the total volume which goes through this House &mdash; is enacted without reference to the elected representatives of the people.  This is not good enough and the procedure of annulling regulations should not be acceptable.  Can any Member of this House name every statutory instrument and report which are laid before the House, which means there is a copy in the Library?  I defy anyone to name them all; we can only see those referred to on the day's Order Paper.  Basically, it is impractical for people to monitor all that and be in a position to bring in annulling regulations. If there was a procedure whereby an affirming order had to be brought before this House it would at least require us to glance at it and to know what sort of legislation was being passed.  It is secondary legislation and as binding as any law passed in this House.  We should bring that power back to ourselves and, for that reason, I will be pressing amendment No. 18.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments before the House.  The section says that the Minister may, by regulation, amend the definition of &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo;.  That would empower the Minister to make tremendous changes in the Bill if he chose to take that option.  For example, he could change the definition of &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; which means an institution for the care and maintenance of more than two dependent persons to &ldquo;dependent persons&rdquo;. Indeed, he could amend that section to read &ldquo;ten persons&rdquo;, &ldquo;15 persons&rdquo;, or whatever number he decided on, which would not be in the spirit of the debate because it would vest far too much regulatory power in the Minister.  The important safeguard that regulations would have to be brought before the House must be enshrined in this legislation. Perhaps the Minister will consider this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>The arrangements <Col N="1423" /> which apply at present to most legislation, that regulations are laid before each House of the Oireachtas, are adequate.  I do not believe that successive Governments would go out of their way to introduce amending regulations which would be unacceptable to the general population.</P>
      <P>That has not been the case in the past and, while everybody might not agree with them, the regulations generally respond to the needs of the people at the time.  The Minister of the day, the Government, the Department of Health and &mdash; above all &mdash; the Dáil and Seanad are safeguards because these regulations must be laid before each House.  Deputy Howlin referred to the fact that the regulations appear in the Order Paper and I have no doubt that Deputies in Opposition read the Order Paper assiduously every day.  If they are perturbed about something they may ask a question or, if they want to raise regulations in the Dáil, they have a period of time within which they can object to them, debate them in the House and if they are defeated the regulations are annulled.  I am satisfied that the traditional method in this House is a sufficient safeguard to ensure that the legislation is in accordance with the wishes of the Members of this House and the people.</P>

      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3. &mdash;(1)  A person shall not carry on a nursing home unless the home is registered and the person is the registered proprietor thereof.</P>
      <P>(2) A person shall not be in charge of a nursing home unless the home is registered.</P>
      <P>(3)  Subsections (1) and (2) shall not apply during the period of one year beginning on the commencement of this Act to a person who is carrying on or in charge of a nursing home in any premises if, immediately before such commencement, a nursing home was being carried on in those premises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of courtesy to the House I <Col N="1425" /> should like to explain the background to a number of additional and substitute amendments which I tabled since Committee Stage began.  Amendment No. 20 proposed the insertion of a new section dealing with the prohibition of unregistered nursing homes.  If that amendment stood all nursing homes would automatically be illegal the day the provisions of the Act became operative.  I have tabled a substitute amendment to provide that nursing homes in business on the day the Act becomes operative will have a year in which to comply with the registration procedures.  This will allow health boards to spread the inspection and registration procedures over 12 months, rendering the Act easier to administer in its first and subsequent years of implementation. Of course, new nursing homes will be expected to comply with the registration procedures before opening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this substitute amendment No. 20.  It deals with a point discussed at some length here, which was the interim procedures involved in these new regulations, it satisfactorily clarifies the issue and constitutes a substantial improvement.  I hope there will be adequate staff made available to health boards to ensure that all nursing homes are brought up to date.  One of the great anomalies obtaining is that, for financial reasons, no new nursing home has been approved since 1980 because, once a nursing home has been approved by the Department of Health, a subvention can be paid to its patients who are eligible; even though some superb nursing homes have opened since then they have not been sanctioned.  As I said, I hope staff will be made available to deal with the backlog of nursing homes and to ensure that they are up to standard so that their owners will not have to wait longer than 12 months and will not be left in that type of limbo.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we will be supporting amendment No. 20.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the new amendment which constitutes an <Col N="1426" /> improvement on the old section 3.  It will allay many of the fears expressed earlier in relation to the interim procedures because there are so many nursing homes now in existence, and so many people are excellently cared for in the vast majority of them.  The position seems to have been clarified to their satisfaction.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Yates' concern that, despite the fact that there has been a significant increase in the number of nursing homes recently, for financial reasons, there are many people who still cannot gain access to them.  I shall be dealing with this matter later.  I am concerned that adequate resources be made available to enable all those in need of nursing home care to avail of it.  If that is deemed to be the most appropriate form of care for an elderly person, it would be most unacceptable that such would not be available to them for financial reasons.</P>
      <P>I also welcome this new section which incorporates one of the fundamental objections the nursing homes organisation had to the Bill at the outset, which was the term &ldquo;licence&rdquo;.  That has been changed, getting away from the whole notion of licence to one of registration, which is a more acceptable term to them.</P>
      <P>For those reasons I welcome amendment No. 20 and will be supporting it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>1.  In the first line of subsection (3), to delete &ldquo;a health board&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Department of Health&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment echoes a point made by Deputy Ryan earlier.  I am very concerned that there be uniformity in the operation of the provisions of this Bill &mdash; from Donegal to Kerry, from Dublin to Galway.  I contend that the implementation of its provisions should be undertaken by the Department of Health not by the health boards.  This matter has been discussed previously.  I have fears with regard to every aspect of health board services, whether it be dental, community care, the level of occupational therapists &mdash; with which we dealt at Question Time today &mdash; because there are variations in the development, quality and quantity of health board services.  I have no doubt that if I table a parliamentary question to the Minister in, <Col N="1433" /> say, two years time he will reply: &ldquo;It is a matter for the individual health board to determine what they see fit.&rdquo;  I contend that would not not be good enough.  The Department of Health should play a more central role in the operation of the provisions of this Bill.  It is for that reason I seek to delete &ldquo;a health board&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Department of Health&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  I consider it would be inappropriate for the Department of Health to take on the responsibility of being the registration authority for nursing homes.  The Department of Health are concerned primarily with policy formation, financing and reviewing the performance of those agencies which deliver services.  The health boards are statutorily responsible for the provision of health and personal social services in their areas.  They have a statutory obligation to determine who is eligible for health services and for the maintenance of standards in private nursing homes. The statutory position on the practical working arrangements has been recognised in the Bill, in proposing that health boards will act as regulatory, monitoring and subventing authorities in relation to private nursing homes.  The staff of health boards have the expertise, local knowledge and integrity to discharge these functions.  Therefore, it would not be either efficient or helpful to involve the Department, as is proposed in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates about the need for uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of this Bill. Indeed, it is my intention that its provisions will be implemented uniformly throughout the country.  The regulations, which have been circulated, and the code of practice, which will be prepared, will encourage greater uniformity of approach on the part of health boards and nursing homes.  There is a great deal of goodwill on the ground to ensure good standards of care.  Indeed the provisions of the Bill have been welcomed by the owners of nursing homes.  In my view it <Col N="1434" /> is more satisfactory under the provisions of this Bill to leave the regulation, monitoring and subvention of nursing homes to the health boards.  As I have said, local expertise and knowledge are important in carrying out these functions.  I do not believe it would be helpful to involve the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  Will he give the House a commitment that on such matters as staffing levels, procedures to be applied with regard to inspections, notifications &mdash; other than the bare regulations &mdash; he will issue guidelines to each health board on all the operational aspects of the Bill, as opposed to the regulations which are to be complied with?  I feel very strongly about this issue and I would not raise it unless I had solid experience to suggest that different health boards can have different practices and different levels of interest.  It is also true to say that a town like Bray has far more nursing homes than a town like Letterkenny.  Nursing homes have mushroomed in some areas in comparison with other areas.  Therefore, there is a need for uniformity and an overall guideline at a minimum.  I will certainly be pressing the matter unless the Minister is prepared to give a commitment that the operational aspects as opposed to the legal framework of regulations are uniformly applied by way of guidelines throughout all eight health boards.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that the position of the Minister and that of Deputy Yates are so far apart.  We all seek to have common standards so that there will not be a disparity between the quality of nursing homes available to Irish citizens whether they be in Cork, Donegal, the midlands or the east coast.  I think the way to go about it is not necessarily to standardise it in the Department of Health, and there are good local reasons that it should be in the hands of the local health boards.  The Minister's position is quite acceptable on that matter. However I take Deputy Yates's view very strongly on board and all of us who deal <Col N="1435" /> with health boards come in contact with gross differences in standards in relation to a whole range of issues.  Perhaps the Minister could undertake &mdash; I think this is his ambition &mdash; to have an overview of standards, in terms of the quality of service to be provided, laid down by the Department.  It is assumed that once the standards have been laid down, the health boards will implement them on the ground.  That would be an acceptable arrangement where both Deputy Yates and the Minister's positions could be easily accommodated.</P>

Of course, the ambition of everybody in the House is to ensure that the very highest standards are maintained.  On the last occasion we were on Committee Stage, I promised the House that we would prepare a code of practice which would be circulated before Report Stage.  We have drafted a code of practice and I think Deputies will be very happy with it when we publish it and circulate it before Report Stage.  There are 26 sections and a number of subsections on the philosophy of care, and it then goes on to section 68 on the guide to nursing home legislation and there are a number of subsections as well.  It is quite a comprehensive document.  I believe it will meet the requirements to ensure there is uniformity throughout each health board area.</P>

      <P>This is not an academic matter.  I have received a great many complaints from those who operate nursing homes on for example, the code of practice for inspections, whether there should be notification of inspection or not; how often an inspection should take place; whether one or two officers of the health board should carry out the inspection.  I am happy to withdraw this amendment if the Minister will give an assurance that it is his intention to stand over the code of practice and ensure that people in varying parts of the country are subject to the same standards, so that the Private Nursing Homes Association can advise their own members of what to expect.  We do not want a handbook that is gathering dust and has no meaning. The Minister, as Deputy Howlin has said, has an opportunity to bridge the gap and clearly show his commitment to enforcing the code of practice.  I accept the code of practice but I hope it will be enforced and that it will deal with the day-to-day executive and administrative operational aspects of nursing homes so that the law will not mean different things in different parts of the country.</P>

      <P>In the second line of subsection (3) (b), to delete &ldquo;2 years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;5 years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the period should be three, four or five years before registration is reviewed.  Two years is somewhat too regular.  However, if it comes to the attention of the health board or the Minister for Health that a particular nursing home is in breach of the regulations, it would lose its registration and the process of sanction would apply.  In the normal course of events I think it is important for the smooth operation of the nursing home that there would be a degree of permanence so that people could make substantial investments in their nursing homes, that they would know what the minimum standards are and that they would build up to that.  I would not like to see a stop-go situation, that every second year there would be a question mark hanging over the future of the nursing home.</P>
      <P>I think that every two years is too often to reapply for registration.  I am not desperately opposed to Deputy Howlin's amendment for every four years.  I feel that two years is too narrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is identical to Deputy Yates's in so far as it seeks to broaden the period of registration, the difference being that Deputy Yates <Col N="1438" /> chooses a period of five years while I favour a period of four years.  Clearly we both hold the view that two years is too short a period.  Deputy Yates has rightly instanced that should there be a recognisable difficulty with the operation of any nursing home, the generality of the legislation provides that action will be taken, so what we are talking about is the normal, good, acceptable nursing home having to reapply for registration.  A two year period is rather confined and will run around very quickly for a successful nursing home.  I think they should be given a reasonable period of registration once they are found to be suitable and comply with the regulations drawn up under the legislation.  I suggest a period of four years and I wonder whether, in the interim period between the initial Committee Stage and now, the Minister has had time to reflect on this issue and whether he will move away from the rather narrow two-year registration which he envisaged originally when the Bill was first distributed.</P>

      <P>There should be consensus on the compromise.  One could argue for hours what the period should be but I think three or four years would be reasonable.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that two years is a sufficient period for the duration of registration.  The working party report on the elderly, <i>The Years Ahead</i> recommended annual registration.  That is a splendid report and a very good representative group were involved in producing it.  I felt that one year would be too frequent and therefore I have provided for two years in the Bill.  In my view that strikes the right balance as it provides an incentive for nursing home owners to maintain consistently good standards without burdening homes with red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  He should reflect <Col N="1439" /> upon the view of this side of the House. We should try to work together on this legislation.  There is a view, certainly among the operators of nursing homes, that an annual registration would be too frequent and too demanding on them. Should there be no complaint and no difficulty with them, I wonder why the Minister seeks registration on a biannual basis.  I do not know what we can do to persuade the Minister, if he is adamant not to yield on this matter, except press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter must be seen in the context of section 6 (3) which lays down all the different regulations that must be operated in relation to the standards in nursing homes.  It states: &ldquo;Where, in relation to a nursing home, there is a contravention of a provision of the regulations the person carrying on the home and any person in charge, or taking part in the management, of the home shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that at any time within the period laid down, the full sanctions of the law will apply.  Therefore, there is no question of trying to slip something through or that a person once registered will relax and not maintain standards.  If for any reason there is a complaint or there is dissatisfaction, the powers are there to deal with it.  The question arises therefore as to the permanence of registration.  If we want quality homes we are talking about very large investments, and the least the Minister can do is meet us half way and say he will consider introducing an amendment on Report Stage to provide for a three year period.  I would ask the Minister to avoid having this matter pressed to a vote and bringing about 160 Deputies in here but rather to accept three years as a compromise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy is saying but one has to take account of what the working party recommended, that there should be annual licensing, and we have extended the period to two years.  With practically every licensing system, registration takes place each year.  I believe a two-year <Col N="1440" /> registration system is right in this case. we all want to ensure that we protect the interests of the people who use the nursing homes while at the same time not making it too inconvenient for the nursing home owners.  It is my view that under a two-year registration system the owners who are maintaining very good homes will continue to do so.  I think they would not disagree with a two-year registration period.  It would certainly be better than the one-year period recommended by the working party.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister is so immovable on this point and I do not know why.  The report of the working group is an excellent one in virtually all aspects.  We are talking about good operational nursing homes against whom there is no complaint.  This provision will put an extra imposition on health boards in relation to the bureaucratic monitoring of applications every two years.  The staff involved would be better employed in a general monitoring of the standards which, as I have said, could be checked at any time.  The Bill should provide that any nursing home in breach of the standards or the regulations could be taken before the courts at any time.  We will withdraw the amendment if the Minister agrees to think about the period of time between now and Report Stage.</P>

I consider that the fitness of a person to carry on a nursing home should be related to conviction for offences, as indicated in subsection (4) (a).  The amendment proposed would give too great a discretion to the health boards and could undermine the positive approach to the Bill expressed by all interested parties.  The subsection as drafted will achieve the objective sought by the Deputy, to prevent unsuitable persons from carrying on a nursing home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with <Col N="1442" /> my party colleague in expressing reservations about subsection (4) (a) as proposed by the Minister.  I would argue in favour of The Workers' Party amendment. It is stated quite clearly that a health board are obliged to provide a written statement of suitability to a person who applies for registration.  The only people the health board can refuse are those who have been convicted of an offence under this Bill or the 1964 Act. The Bill goes on to state: &ldquo;or of any other offence that is such as to render the person unfit to carry on a nursing home&rdquo;. I disagree with the point made by the Minister, that The Workers' Party amendment would give too much power to the health board.  As the Bill is drafted health boards have no power except to refuse the written statement of suitability in very limited areas, that is to those people who have already been convicted. I am sure there are a large number of people who might wish to run a nursing home.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest, what the Bill is trying to cater for are regulations to control what is essentially a private profit making business.  There is nothing to prevent all sorts of businessmen and businesswomen, companies, limited companies, banking institutions or whatever, getting involved in running nursing homes.  A large number of people are eligible to apply to run nursing homes who may be known to the health boards and the formula in the Bill to process the applicants is not sufficiently strong.  We must work on the basis that health boards are responsible bodies and, frankly, we would be entrusting a lot of authority to the health boards if we gave them the right to proceed the background of those applicants.  In many cases in their opinion the applicant may be considered a suitable person, irrespective of whether they had a conviction.  If our amendment which reads &ldquo;or is in the opinion of the Board, for any other reason, a person unfit to carry on a nursing home&rdquo; was accepted, a greater degree of trust would be placed in health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons listed which would give a health board authority to refuse the <Col N="1443" /> written statement of suitability are much too narrow.  I would like to see a broader interpretation and greater trust in a health board to be able to use criteria other than the fact that somebody has already been convicted of an offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the point made by both Deputy Sherlock and Deputy Byrne.  Certainly, we will have another look at it before Report Stage. It is a question of balance because we do not want to give too many powers to the health boards in terms of individual rights.  It is very important that we protect the rights of the individual and that we would not give the health boards too much discretion as to the circumstances in which they would refuse to grant a licence to a individual because for some reason they found that reason unsuitable. It is important that we have safeguards not only to protect the people who would be using the nursing homes but also the individuals who apply for a licence.  We will have a look at it before Report Stage to see if the wording can be tightened up in some way and if it can be improved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's intervention because I am a little concerned about Deputy Sherlock's amendment. In the event of any irregularities, complaints, or untoward behaviour in a nursing home we have the power under the section to monitor the nursing home. With that as a backdrop I am concerned about giving too sweeping a power to health boards to prevent individuals from establishing a nursing home in the first instance.  Notwithstanding our positive view of most health boards and most health board officials, on occasion peculiar decisions have been made by individual health board officers in relation to applications.  The core should be the protection of the right of the individual who is resident in the nursing home.  If we were to start a vetting or monitoring process of every applicant or individual who wishes to establish a nursing home one would run into difficulties.  I think the Minister's view on the matter and his approach is right.</P>

Deputy Garland and I were of the view and the laymen in this House who did not have legal experience were of the view that the words &ldquo;it is of opinion&rdquo; left a broad range of possible opinions to those health board officials who would be operating this legislation.  We are dealing with circumstances where people will be deregistered under the provisions of the new section 4 (6) (b).  Therefore, to substitute the words, &ldquo;it has reasonable cause to believe&rdquo; that something was amiss or that something was wrong and that they had not satisfied the regulations, would be fairer than to say that someone in the health board was of the opinion, albeit casual, unsubstantiated or whatever. The Minister's response the previous day was that to meet what we were seeking, his words were preferable.  The legal advice I have available to me does not suggest that.  I would hope at this stage that the Minister, having had time <Col N="1445" /> to reflect on it, would consider rewording his amendment.</P>

      <P>It is a question of interpretation. My legal advice is that the words in the Bill are stronger and as such should not be amended.  If we were to accept the amendment it would increase the discretionary power of the health boards.  I doubt if this is what is intended in the amendment.  The legal advice available to me is that the wording in the Bill is stronger.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6 to amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In the fourth line of subsection (6) (b) (ii), to delete &ldquo;an&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a serious&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was not discussed the previous day and I consider it important. Subsection (6) (b) (ii) deals with &ldquo;the applicant or the registered proprietor, as the case may be, or the person in charge or, as the case may be, proposed to be in charge of the home has been convicted of an offence under this Act&rdquo;&mdash; I have no problem with that &mdash;&ldquo;or the Act of 1964&rdquo;&mdash; I have no problem with that &mdash;&ldquo;or of any other offence...&rdquo;.  This could be very vague.  One could argue that if someone had a parking or a speeding offence technically in the opinion of the health board personnel they would not be a fit person to run the nursing home. Any offence must relate to either the Act in question or be a serious offence that would render that person unfit to carry on a nursing home.  We are all capable <Col N="1446" /> of committing offences, unwittingly or otherwise, but I feel the wording is too broad and needs to be tightened up as it could cause difficulties for people.  The section needs to be re-worded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the amendment.  Surely it is the Minister's intention to prohibit those who are clearly unsuitable, such as those guilty of an offence in a nursing home or a crime of violence against individuals, from obtaining a licence.  I do not think it is the Minister's intention that any offence would lead to disqualification and I would welcome his comments on his matter. This side of the House is strongly of the view that we should resist the inclusion of this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsman has advised that it is difficult to distinguish, in drafting legislation between serious and not so serious offences which might disqualify a person from being a registered proprietor or person in charge of a nursing home.  The amendment I have proposed in the redrafted section 4 will delete the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the board&rdquo; and &ldquo;unsuitable&rdquo;. This section, as amended, will encourage a board to reach an objective decision about a person's fitness as a nursing home proprietor or a person in charge.  An objective decision must be made and must be justified on the basis of the facts.  As a safeguard, an aggrieved person has a right of appeal to the District Court against an unreasonable decision of a health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; could cause more problems than it would solve.  We all know that the type of offence referred to in this section is very serious, such as murder, fraud or grievous bodily harm.  The difficulty lies in the gradations of involvement a person may have in a crime and the type of sentence imposed.  Most of the populace have not been convicted of any offence and it is <Col N="1447" /> only fittng that where the person proposing to run a nursing home has a conviction, the matter should be taken into account.  I have no doubt that the health boards will act in a responsible manner and such offences as parking fines and other instances will not cause any problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister has it as his intention that any conviction will be taken into account &mdash; this is what he stated &mdash; even though undue weight might not be put on it.  I do not think it is either fair or reasonable that the most trivial of unrelated offences should be taken into account.  Perhaps the amendment in the name of Deputy Yates does not meet the exact requirements of the situation but I think the Minister knows what Deputies on this side of the House are about.  A person will have the right to appeal to the District Court but can one imagine someone who wishes to run a nursing home going to the District Court to vindicate that right and expecting to attract business thereafter having dragged his name in public through the District Court?  I do not think that is a reasonable view to take.</P>
      <P>On a previous amendment the Minister referred to the rights of an individual. We are now back discussing the rights of an individual in this regard and the Minister's proposal is far too draconian. If the Minister does not see his way to accepting the amendment, which does not meet all the fears of this side of the House, perhaps he would agree to look again at this section and dissolve its draconian nature somewhat and come back with a more suitable amendment on Report Stage.  I appeal to him to do that and to re-think the proposal that each and any offence should be taken into account.  That is far too strong a position to take on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fascinated by the Minister's response.  In the first instance, his interpretation does not matter because this will be a matter for the CEO of a health board or a District Court judge to <Col N="1448" /> determine.  I do not think the law should be so unclear on this matter.  The Minister said that as far as he was concerned the type of offence referred to in this Bill is murder, fraud or grievous bodily harm.  I ask him to indicate how he came to that assumption.  If someone is up for not paying his television licence fee &mdash; even though the revenue from these licences could go anywhere by the end of the week &mdash; would this be considered a serious offence and preclude a person from registering? If someone, God forbid, had one too many to drink at a Christmas party and subsequently was taken off the road and breathalysed, would this be considered a serious offence?  The health boards will have to act as Pontius Pilate in deciding on these matters.  Perhaps the CEO in the North Western Health Board will take an entirely different view from the one adopted by the CEO in the Eastern Health Board and regard failure to have a licence for a dog as sufficient in deciding whether a person is a fit person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is open to any conjecture one wishes to put on it.  I am not arguing that my amendment is the answer but my intention is obvious.  If we are going to go beyond the scope of the offence listed in the related Acts on the administration of nursing homes we must clearly state what type of other offence we are talking about.  If the Minister intends to restrict it to murder, fraud or grievous bodily harm, so be it, but that is not what the Bill says.  We need to determine whether we are talking about drink driving or licences for dogs and televisions or whether we are talking about a serious offence.  The Minister should get more legal advice in this matter and try to wrap it up so that the uncertainty is taken out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made by Deputy Yates but I think the type of offence referred to in the Bill is very clear.  As I said, we have removed the words &ldquo;in the opinion of the board&rdquo; from the Bill and as a result have strengthened subsection (6) (b) (ii).  The section states: &ldquo;... any other offence that is such as to render the person unfit to carry on or, as the case may be, to be in charge of the home?  I do not think there is any person who believes that a health board, even given the lack of uniformity Deputy Yates refers to, would decide that a person who failed to pay his television licence fee is unfit.  It is quite clear that the offence they are guilty of must render them unfit to carry on or as the case may be to be in charge of a home.  If we were to add in the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; we would only compound the difficulty and one would have to decide what constitutes a serious offence.  Members of this House may feel that a person convicted of certain offences should not be in charge of a home but these may not be considered serious in the legal sense.  We will have another look at the wording of the section but I believe it is as strong as we can make it in legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point but it is not a frivolous one but quite serious, and I will be retabling the amendment on Report Stage.  I am withdrawing it here on the understanding that the Minister will come forward with a better amendment than my own.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 to amendment No. 26 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8 to amendment No. 26:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second line of subsection (8) <Col N="1450" /> (a) (i), after &ldquo;registration&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The subsection reads that a health board may at the time of registration or subsequently attach to the registration conditions in relation to the carrying on of the nursing home concerned and such other means as it considers appropriate having regard to its functions under this Bill.  My intention is to insert &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;&mdash; they may attach reasonable conditions. It is self-evident that it would be unacceptable for anybody, health board or other, to impose conditions on a nursing home which would be unreasonable. The Minister should have no difficulty in accepting my simple amendment to ensure it is understood that it is the intention of the Oireachtas that conditions that would be attached to any such registration would be of a reasonable nature. That should be spelled out clearly in legislation rather than left to the discretion of health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could take amendments Nos. 8 and 9 together.  They are broadly on the same point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I reiterate the point Deputy Howlin made that as it stands conditions can be set out in relation to any matter, the parking conditions, lighting conditions, anything at all, depending on how obnoxious or pedantic the officials might be.  The point here is that we would have uniformity. We would know what this means.  The purpose of legislation is to be precise, to put matters beyond doubt.  There is no point in legislation that will create as many doubts as it resolves.  To attach different conditions is an &ldquo;open sesame&rdquo; to anything that might be concerned with a nursing home and could cause many problems.  That could include, for <Col N="1451" /> instance, conditions relating to a mortuary attached to the premises.  We do not know what might follow from this. There is no one better than a programme manager to say to the unfortunate nursing home manager, &ldquo;I can read you section 4 of the Act, Sir, which says that clearly I am entitled to put down whatever different conditions I like, whether you consider them reasonable or not.  This is the law.&rdquo;  Therefore, I suggest that we insert either &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;directly relevant to the care of dependent persons&rdquo;.  We all have the same objective in this House which is to protect elderly people while not exposing people to excessive bureaucracy.  That is a balance we are trying to achieve.  Therefore, either amendment No. 8 or amendment No. 9 or both should be accepted by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have accepted a good deal today.  We are very reasonable. I know the nursing homes are concerned about the implications of the conditions that may be attached, but any home that has a difficulty with a requirement can discuss it with the officials of the board. I believe that, as in the case of other legislation, the boards concerned are responsible for implementing the law as <Col N="1452" /> it relates to them.  The boards are amenable to discussion with, for example, people setting up food outlets and having to comply with the hygiene regulations. The boards are reasonable in going out to talk to people to help find an agreed solution.  I do not think it necessary to include the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in the Bill. I do not know what effect it would have legally, but it appears the wording is quite precise and Deputy Yates said it should be precise.  I believe there is a statutory obligation on the boards to be reasonable at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me intervene to coax the Minister further on the question of reasonableness.  If he cannot legislate in the way we want to legislate, then in laying down regulations as he will be required to do under the legislation will the Minister be very specific on how reasonably he wants these people to operate and will there be guidelines to be applied nationally?  Otherwise we will have different interpretations of this section by different health boards and different officers.  As will be seen from the debates we have had on the various sections, we are all the time worried about the different interpretations of different health board officers, programme managers etc.  One of the ways to overcome that is to have a set of regulations to be agreed and published by the Minister which would be guidelines for the officers in interpreting the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has really said is, &ldquo;If you do not like the judgment, have a discussion with the judge.&rdquo;  I am beginning to get the impression that the Minister decided this afternoon to approach this Bill by simply not giving an inch to Opposition amendments no matter how constructive they are.  Members on this side of the House today have approached the debate very constructively and reasonably.  To refuse to add the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; which he accepts should be in the Bill in concept, on the basis that it is understood already, is unreasonable.  I am inclined to become unreasonable myself when all we get <Col N="1453" /> from the Minister are generalisations and no positive attempt to make this stage a real Committee Stage the health spokespersons here have worked on, by way of building a better Bill.  It is important to put these two amendments into the Bill. They will allay the fears of those engaged in trying to run nursing homes.  They will give clear indication as to what the Oireachtas means to health board officials who will apply these regulations. There should be no difficulty for the Minister in accepting the approach on this side of the house in these two amendments above all because they are so innocuous.</P>

    <P>Deputy Howlin has been here since we commenced at 3.45 p.m. and I have told the House regarding four different amendments proposed to this Bill that I would have a look at them before Report Stage.

We have accepted amendments to this Bill from the Opposition the last day we were both here on Committee Stage.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This also relates to conditions attaching <Col N="1455" /> to the licence.  Again we are trying to achieve some form of balance.  I came across one case where the health board and the director of community care were trying to get the owner of a private nursing home to extend the property, which was a semi-detached building.  The only way the health board wanted him to expand was by acquiring the adjoining semi-detached building, not by any other form of extension.  Bureaucrats and technocrats by their nature do not have any regard to financial considerations and often solutions which would have the same net effect are not acceptable to officials.  Some regard should be paid to financial cost.  Of course certain developments must be carried out, regardless of cost, but some element of awareness should be brought into health board thinking.  Perhaps this would be better dealt with in the code of practice and if the Minister will undertake to include some reference to it in the code or practice I will reconsider this amendment.</P>

    <P>This deals with the information a health board may request from an applicant in the process of registration.  It is suggested that the information that can be requested is any information they consider necessary.  I do not know what that means.  It could mean any information. It could relate to past financial history, personal family details, the persons who might be living in the house and all sorts of private matters.  It would be more prudent to substitute the words &ldquo;relevant to the application&rdquo;, so that matters <Col N="1456" /> extraneous to the application would not be brought into common internal health board memoranda.</P>

I do not accept that the words &ldquo;considers necessary&rdquo; should be deleted.  The section requires the health board to act in an objective manner by requesting information related to their function under the Bill only.

This is important in the straightforward context of protecting people in nursing homes.  I am sorry the Minister is so rigid in this respect.  These are not major points but it is an improvement in wording which would achieve a better balance and fair play.  We are trying to balance good administration and the rights of the individual.  I do not believe it is fair to give a blank cheque by specifying any information which an official considers fair.  We do not have that in other codes. I regret the Minister's narrow view.</P>

      <P>I am sympathetic to the intention of this amendment which is to facilitate the transfer of nursing homes. However, to delete subsection (12) would not be satisfactory.  The section provides for the re-registration of nursing homes in a number of circumstances, such as the death of a registered proprietor or the transfer of ownership of a nursing home.  I have already proposed an amendment to section 4 (12) which would remove the reservations which nursing home owners had about the absence from the Bill of a method of prior clearance by a health board for a prospective buyer of a nursing home as a suitable registered proprietor.  As a result of my amendment the prospective owner will be able to apply for a declaration in advance of the purchase of the nursing home that he is a suitable person to carry on a nursing home.</P>

      <Col N="1459" /> In the third line, to delete &ldquo;the District Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Minister for Health&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We discussed this issue on the last occasion.  This amendment proposes the removal of the appeals mechanism from the District Court and giving it to the Minister.  The notion put forward originally by Deputy Yates was that the District Court was not a suitable place for the hearing of appeals &mdash; it is a judicial setting and primarily one where matters of a criminal nature are adjudicated upon.  It would be more appropriate that an appeal against registration, which would be a matter of deciding the suitability of an applicant to run a nursing home, would be best kept within the health field rather than going into a judicial setting.  The argument put forward &mdash; Deputy Yates will be able to elaborate on this &mdash; was that the Minister would be a far more appropriate authority to deal with such appeals; it should be taken out of the judicial sphere, the Minister should be able to make an adjudication on health grounds alone and not, so to speak, throw the whole issue into a queue with criminal cases, motoring offences, etc., and the expertise should lie primarily in the Minister's office to make a proper and fair adjudication on the matter on the grounds of health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for my delay in reappearing and thank my colleague, Deputy Howlin, for moving the amendment in my name.  As Deputy Howlin rightly said, this amendment proposes to give the Minister for Health a role in the appeals process.  The appeals process should be looked at in the context of trying to involve the minimum expense on a person and to have uniformity.  The argument that there may be a lack of uniformity between health boards could apply also to District Courts.  Therefore, by giving the Minister a direct role in the appeals process, he could have an overseeing role in the actual operation of the Act without being unduly involved.  I <Col N="1460" /> look forward in anticipation to the Ministers acceptance of this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more appropriate that the appeals by nursing home proprietors should be made to the District Court rather than to the Minister.  The District Court is easily accessible and offers a speedy and inexpensive remedy in the event of a difference of opinion between a health board and a nursing home proprietor.  The knowledge that a nursing home proprietor may appeal a health decision to a District Court will impose a very strict discipline on the manner in which the health board reach their decision.  The health boards will have to justify their decisions on objective grounds and, if necessary, demonstrate their objectivity in court.  I feel strongly that the advantages of this system will outweigh any reservations which nursing home owners may have about appeals being heard in the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's reply.  I do not know if the Minister has ever appeared in the District Court in a personal capacity.  I have never been in a District Court but I was in a Circuit Court once in relation to a local authority case &mdash; it related to water extraction in County Carlow.  The majority of ordinary people are afraid of going to court.  They do not want to be lined up with criminals or to be put in the dock, as it were.  On top of that there is the question of expenses.  Once a case has to be heard in a District Court the average person will have to employ a solicitor.  Such people incur substantial expenses just because they are not familiar with the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>District Courts are a lottery &mdash; some District Court judges are eccentric while <Col N="1461" /> others are normal in all respects.  Litigation can involve a great deal of delay. I know from experience that it can take up to two years for a case to be heard in the High Court.  I know the same delays do not exist in regard to the Circuit Court and, to a lesser extent, the District Court. However, if a District Court justice is not available &mdash; this issue was raised on numerous occasions by the select committee on the Child Care Bill &mdash; or the court is closed for the month of August, what will be the time limit in regard to appeals and what way will they be affected?  In order to reduce expense, bring more certainty to the issue and to help people who do not like going to court because it is not a criminal matter I ask the Minister to reconsider this issue on Report Stage.  It is not a major point but in its operation it would give the Department far greater control.  I do not believe it would become politicised if it was handled by the Minister.  I have confidence that it would be handled fairly by the Department.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider it so that we can go on to deal with other sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise one or two other matters in relation to this amendment.  Deputy Yates spoke about our discussions in the Child Care Committee. One of the things we spoke about at some length was the competence of the District Court.  Quite clearly in adjudicating on matters like this a certain competence is required that is not necessarily a judical competence.  We felt that there are areas which should be the preserve of those who are expert in them and who have some training and background in them.  This is one area which would be best dealt with by the Minister's own office, by the staff who drafted this Bill, the people who would be charged with over-viewing the implementation of this legislation around the country.  There are a variety of District Court justices who would not have any particular training in this area, making arbitrary judgments.  I do not think that is necessarily the best way of going about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> Deputy Yates referred to the fear people have of court cases.  On a previous amendment the Minister said that the majority of people in this country have never been convicted of an offence or indicted.  That is true, thank God.  In fact I would say the vast majority of people have never been inside a court and many would be discouraged by the very notion of going into court.  On a previous amendment I said that when one has made an application and been refused the very last thing one wants is to have the matter decided in open court because by virtue of the whole proceedings one is a defendant when one appears in the District Court and conclusions can be drawn from that.  Many people would be quite reluctant to take that option.  For all those reasons, I think the amendment put forward by Deputy Yates is an improvement on the procedure envisaged by the Minister. Perhaps the Minister would think again about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>My own view is that the more appropriate way is through the District Court.  First, we are talking about a very tiny number of cases in which there would be a difference of opinion.  If one looks at the performance of the health boards over the last 20 years in areas where they issue licences of one kind or another it is very rarely that an applicant took an action against a decision of the health board on the basis that they had been unfair in their deliberations.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points.  Certainly we want to be fair to the nursing home owners and at the same time we have an obligation to the people who use the nursing homes.  I take the point made about the fear of the District Court.  I have had plenty of experience of it in my professional capacity in general practice and I was a regular visitor there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>I was in and out of them in a professional capacity in the old days when general practitioners had to go into court and give evidence of observations <Col N="1463" /> of people who were alleged to have been drunk in charge of bicycles, motor cars and all sorts of things, so I know the inside of them very well.  I take the point that most people have a fear of going in there.  Nobody, however, has any greater fear than the health boards who will be questioned on the objectivity they used in making a decision.  Against that background, I believe that it will ensure that the health boards will take their obligation in regard to objectivity very seriously.  Again, it is not something that will arise very often.  It would arise in a very tiny minority of cases.  I think the health boards will be very objective in their decision making.  I believe this is the more appropriate route to go both in the interests of the people who use the nursing homes and in the interests of the proprietors to ensure that the greatest objectivity will be adhered to by the health boards.</P>

    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify this point.  Someone would appeal within 21 days.  If the District Court hearing is not available within 21 days what is the position?  Does the appeal lapse?  Does it <Col N="1464" /> have to be registered with the court clerk or what is the procedure?

My own understanding is that 21 days is a reasonable period to make an appeal and once the appeal is lodged it does not mean that the appeal has to be heard or that the court has to hear the appeal.  If we were changing it upwards I would perfer to have it based on a number of days rather than a month because a month is not as definitive.  If it is necessary to increase it to 28 days we will come back to it on Report Stage.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where a notification of a decision specified in subsection (1) <Col N="1466" /> (other than a decision to refuse to register a nursing home which was not registered or deemed to be registered at the time of the relevant application for registration) is given under section 4, then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  during such period from such notification (not being less than 21 days) as the health board concerned considers reasonable and specifies in the notification, and</P>

    <P>(i)  the period from the end of the period aforesaid until the determination or withdrawal of the appeal or any appeal therefrom to the Circuit Court under subsection (3) or any appeal from the determination of that court, and</P>

    <P>This is the substitute amendment to amendment No. 30 that was tabled. Amendment No. 30 deals with section 5 appeals and the substitute amendment rectifies a problem in the Bill drawn to my attention by the National Council for the Elderly.  The council pointed out that when a nursing home was refused registration the Bill did not provide for a period of grace for health boards and relatives to make alternative arrangements for patients.  The substitute <Col N="1467" /> amendment provides that a district court which turns down an appeal by a nursing home proprietor against a health board refusal to renew registration may specify a period in which the home can continue to operate.  This is to ensure that the health board and the relatives can make alternative arrangements for patients in the nursing home.</P>

      <P>It will be a matter for the District Court to decide the time and I have no doubt that will depend on the size of the nursing home and where a patient is to be placed.  My interpretation is that the Deputy is asking that the period from such notification would not be less than 21 days.  Under the terms of my amendment more than 21 days would have to be allowed for the movement of patients.  I do not have any hangup about the period and I will have a look at the issue between now and Report Stage. The difficulty I see about inserting 28 days is that we are talking about a home that has not been, for one reason or another, licensed.  In other words, it is not a suitable place for elderly people. If we accept the Deputy's amendment would we be keeping the people in such a home one week longer?

      <P>Section 6 is important in that it deals with the regulations in relation to standards in nursing homes. The Minister has indicated that he will draw up the regulations and I have no doubt that they will cover the issues listed by him because the team involved in drafting the Bill will be responsible for the preparation of the regulation.  There should be an imperative put into the section.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in all similar legislation.  It was used in the last legislation on nursing homes. Indeed, it was used in the regulations on nursing homes introduced in 1986.  Draft regulations, to be implemented on the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas, have been drawn up. They have already been circulated with a request for comments to be in before the end of this month.  The draftsman has worded it in that way and it is not necessary to include the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The present wording is used in legislation of this nature and is acceptable.</P>

      <P>On amendment No. 34 there are lengthy subsections &mdash; from (a) to (k) in section 6 prescribing requirements. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the term normally used in such legislation and it is not sufficient argument for rejecting the simple amendment which proposes to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. This legislation is of vital importance in relation to the standards and conditions in such homes.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have a difficulty with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in regard to amendment No. 34 but I will be happy to look at amendment No. 31 before Report Stage. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; might put an obligation on health boards which might not be necessary.  It could mean that they might <Col N="1470" /> have to provide training for members of staff who could already be trained.  We will have to look at this very carefully in regard to both amendments but, as I said, if it was included in amendment No. 34 it might impose a cost factor on a health board.  If we inserted &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in amendment No. 31 it would get over the concern raised by the Deputy &mdash; I do not believe there is a difficulty &mdash; and I am satisfied that the legislation and regulations governing nursing homes are quite satisfactory. Indeed, the former Deputy Desmond, when he was Minister for Health, introduced very good regulations in 1986.</P>

      <P>There is no argument about the fact that the Minister will be introducing these regulations.  However, I am alarmed about the areas covered under the subsection although I know he will do what is required under subsection (1).  The Minister said it might be too onerous a burden to draw up regulations in regard to every aspect but I understand that the same people who drafted the legislation will draw up the regulations. They did not put this into the Bill to take up space, they did so &mdash; and we agree &mdash; because they are areas which should be encompassed by regulations.  If we are enacting them because we feel they should be there, then regulations should be drawn up to make them enforceable in regard to each nursing home.  I am at a loss to know why &ldquo;may&rdquo; could not be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in each case.  However, I do not have any great fears about it and I am sure the Minister will not disillusion me in that regard.  I hope he will copperfasten my confidence in him by his actions.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister's comments in regard to amendment No. 31.  However, I appeal to him to look again at amendment No. 34.  I do not want to refer to any particular requirement under the section but (d) prescribes requirements in relation to accommodation, including the amount of space in bedrooms and wards, washing facilities and sanitary conveniences provided in nursing homes.  Is the Minister saying it is not mandatory to say that such conditions are complied with?  That is why we need the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The regulations are already in place and further regulations in regard to this Bill have already been drafted and circulated.  They lay down fairly strict conditions in terms of the physical standard of the building and indeed of the staffing.  I am satisfied that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is appropriate because, as I said already, successive Ministers have ensured that regulations appropriate to the need at the time were in place. I am prepared to accept amendment No. 31 if Deputy Sherlock withdraws amendment No. 34, although we will look at that amendment before Report Stage.  I do not want to lock the health boards into something that may be meaningless. If we accept the second amendment now we would be putting an obligation on the boards to train people who might already be trained and who would not be available to do anything else during that period.  We will include the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in amendment No. 31 and we will look at amendment No. 34 before Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is of significance but not <Col N="1472" /> absolutely crucial.  What I am requesting is that when the Minister is drawing up the regulations he will do so in consultation with the relevant caring and professional organisations.  If the Minister has difficulty in defining that, if that is too loose a term for him to accept, I will accept his assurance that he will table a tighter definition on Report Stage, perhaps reading: &ldquo;following consultation with the relevant caring and professional organisations as he sees fit&rdquo;.  I want to ensure that the people with the professional knowledge, used to dealing in the area &mdash; whether it be nutrition, basic lighting, people who have dealt with the elderly, who are geriatricians &mdash; would be consulted in drawing up the relevant regulations so that we would have the best regulations, in the light of the most up-to-date knowledge available, for the comfort and caring of the elderly.

Therefore, he should not have any difficulty with the substance of these two amendments.  We should endeavour to reach a consensus. It is not that, at the end of the day, the Minister would automatically accept the view of these organisations but that they would at least afford him the courtesy of engaging in some consultation with him. I would contend that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; expresses it no more strongly than it should be in this instance; not that he &ldquo;shall&rdquo; consult but that he &ldquo;may&rdquo; consult. For those reasons I would ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 32 or No. 33.</P>

We have been in consultation with the health boards and with the Irish Private Nursing Homes' Association in <Col N="1473" /> their preparation.  Indeed other interested parties have been sent copies of the draft nursing home and boarding-out regulations.  If there are other groups Deputies feel should be consulted, if they will inform us of them we will certainly ascertain what contribution they might make to these regulations.  We will be generous in such consultation.  Like everybody else, we want to draw up the best possible regulations in the the interests of all people who will be seeking access to nursing homes.  However, we have already consulted a number of interested parties in relation to the provisions of the Bill, as they stand.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) prescribe requirements as to the maximum fees which may be charged for the care of dependent persons while being maintained in a nursing home,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be appropriate to prescribe fees which a <Col N="1474" /> private nursing home, or for that matter any private business, might charge.  The market is and will be the regulator of nursing home fees.  There is no limit to the number of nursing homes which may be registered.  Therefore, no monopoly will arise in respect of the nursing homes which are in business.  The amendment is unnecessary and might well be detrimental to the future of nursing home care in this country.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important subject. One view of this Bill, is that its provisions will create a certain exclusivity among certain types of nursing homes that will come into being only after the enactment of the Bill.  Such eventuality should be avoided.  I do not believe it is right to legislate in this area.  That being said, the Department of Health should take an active interest in monitoring fees charged by nursing homes in the same way as, say, the VHI would take an active interest in fees being charged by consultants, general practitioners or whoever. There is an element of negotiation involved, indeed an element of cost control, where sanction is required.  I would not like to see members of the public being ripped off by nursing homes.  We must remember we are dealing with a very vulnerable sector of the community, perhaps people who will have adopted a nursing home as their second home, having sold their residence.  It is important that some mechanism &mdash; other than legislation &mdash; be put in place; perhaps comprising part of the consultation there should be guidelines for levels of fees.  I have in mind particularly medical card holders whose relatives may be at their wits end trying to gain access to residential care for them where such is required.  Those people should be afforded some protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The market is a regulator but there will be certain circumstances in which the market, as a regulator, will not apply. For example, there might be only one nursing home located in a rural area and somebody who might want to be located near their relatives could not travel, say, <Col N="1475" /> to the other end of County Cork to a nursing home there.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the regulations, rather than in the legislation, the Minister might endeavour to introduce some element of cost consciousness so that there would be no question of there being current affairs television programmes about nursing homes and their cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am anxious about the level of fees that may be charged because there is not a comprehensive spread of nursing homes countrywide.  I have less faith than Deputy Yates has in the market serving as a regulator or being a regulatory force.</P>
      <P>Obviously we are talking primarily about commercial institutions, not State-owned or controlled institutions, in respect of which all we are endeavouring to do is lay down a code of practice or standards to ensure that people would be reasonably comfortable in nursing homes.  Has the Minister any plans to monitor the fees charged by different nursing homes so that health boards would be aware of the level of fees being charged within their areas &mdash; what would be the norm, what would be extraordinarily high or low.  Then we would have some reference points in ascertaining what are the real costs, what is good value and what is not.  Then, in the future, we might ascertain whether amending legislation is required whereas if such data is not available we would be at a distinct disadvantage.  I would ask the Minister to consider requiring health boards to ensure they are aware of the level of fees being charged by different nursing homes, that part of the submissions would be the requirements that such data be provided to health boards so that we would know the spread of fees obtaining at any given time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, the Department would be interested in the level of fees charged.  The first point I want to make is that I do not think it should be included in legislation.  Nonetheless, I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputies Yates and Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> In the next section there is a provision that the Minister may make regulations to prescribe the amounts to be paid by health boards by way of subvention. Obviously, in association with that requirement, the health boards would monitor charges in each of the nursing homes in their areas.  Therefore, fees will be monitored and that information will be available, but whatever mechanism is used I would prefer that we would not write it into the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister states that it is desirable &mdash; although he did not use the word desirable &mdash; to have uniformity, how does he propose to enforce it?  Did the Minister say that it could be written into the legislation?  Perhaps I missed that point?</P>
      <P>I have formed my views from examples I have seen in my own division &mdash; that is a very wide area &mdash; and there is a vast difference in the charges between one place and the other.  In circumstances where it is urgent for families to have their relatives accommodated in a nursing home, it is necessary in some cases that I am aware of for people to pool their resources.  This does not last for very long and it applies mainly where people are waiting to be accommodated in a health board institution.  I feel it is necessary that there be a maximum charge and I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it would not be appropriate that the Minister should write into legislation the fees that a private institution should charge for services. That is one part of the issue. Second, the health boards will be in a position, depending on the circumstances, to subvent patients who are in nursing homes, having regard to the patient's own means and the degree of disability.  Against that background, the health boards will be monitoring the charges in private nursing homes where subvented patients are placed and they would be aware of what is going on.  In my view the marketplace will ensure the fees are kept at a reasonable level. <Col N="1477" /> However, that information will be available.</P>

      <P>In amendment No. 44 I have tried to outline some of the facilities that are important to elderly people such as chiropody, physiotherapy, dental and ophthalmic care.  I am not saying that the nursing home should provide these services but they should have an input by linking in with health board services. These services greatly affect the quality of life of someone who is elderly and dependent.  I firmly believe that a great many of the amendments tabled to section 6 &mdash; although we will not get time to debate them &mdash; are very important and I ask the Minister and his officials to give particular consideration to them.  I will not be able to move amendment No. 45 on brochures.  This amendment also includes reference to the price etc.  I know I am out of order, Sir, but it is very important.</P>
      <P>Section 6 as it stands is not comprehensive enough.  If we are drawing up regulations, now is the time to specify the legal bones and framework of them. What is in the section is all right but there are substantial gaps.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 37, which we will not reach, I believe that insurance cover for injury to the person is not sufficient but the person's belongings should also be covered.  I know I am strictly out of order but I would ask that this whole section be given a great deal more study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think these amendments are necessary, indeed the existing 1985 regulations already require <Col N="1479" /> nursing home owners to provide facilities for the occupation and recreation of patients and suitable and sufficient equipment having regard to the dependency of the persons maintained in the nursing home.  What is important is that in the new draft regulations we go a lot further than that because proprietors will be obliged to provide opportunities for patients to participate in activities appropriate to their interests or capacity and exercise choice to the extent that such freedom does not infringe on the rights of other patients; and also to provide information concerning current affairs, local matters, voluntary groups and community resources and events.  I believe that the points raised by Deputies Garland and Howlin are adequately covered in the draft regulations.  On the point raised by Deputy Yates I believe we could include it in the code of practice but if we write it into the Bill we may be defeating the purpose that Deputy Yates wants to achieve.  We want to allow for flexibility in meeting future demands and it might be better, therefore, to have it in the code of practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 8, before &ldquo;, the health board&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which shall be completed within 30 days of receipt of an application&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the most controversial section of the Bill so far as I am concerned.  It deals with the question of subventions.  We will be calling more than a voice vote on this because I am totally unhappy about the way health boards have treated the whole question of subventions.  It varies from health board to health board.  Some give no subvention and the Eastern Health Board, who are the most generous, were in a stop-go situation last year.  &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; dealt with the matter on several days in a row.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the period of processing of a claim for a subvention. It is not unusual for some months to pass before a decision is made in such cases. I will quote from a letter of 22 January 1990 from a nursing home, which will give some idea of the position.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this is best explained by quoting an example (one of very many) of an old age pensioner in this home whose application for a subvention was made in May 1989 and <Col N="1481" /> who is still awaiting a decision from the Eastern Health Board.  This lady's total income (including old age pension) is £89 a week and she owns no capital or property.  Such abuse of power can only be avoided if the new legislation makes it mandatory for the health board to take decisions within a specified period of time.</P>
    <P>If the Minister decides to reduce the level of State geriatric care, if there are fewer county homes, welfare homes and health board geriatric institutions &mdash; they are being closed all over the country &mdash; it is unacceptable that people should have to go to private nursing homes and be treated in a humiliating fashion.  This is not only a case of bureaucracy.  People are desperate.  On £89 a week they cannot pay for care in a nursing home costing £120 a week.  The lady referred to in the letter from which I quoted is probably a spinster with no next of kin, whose brothers and sisters have died or are in equally poor circumstances.  This is a political issue so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 50 proposes to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  In the 1964 Act the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was included but in this Bill it has been changed to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  There will certainly be a vote on this amendment if it is not accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Yates's view that this is a very important section. Basically we are talking about who can gain access to nursing homes.  We can have the finest nursing homes in Europe and provide for standards of the highest quality but if people cannot afford them we are wasting our time.  We have to be aware that there are various categories of people who have no option but to go into a nursing home because there is nobody to care for them.  I dealt at great length in my Second Stage contribution on the financial aspects of this matter. There are many elderly people living alone and elderly persons caring for spouses or infirm relatives because there is nowhere for them to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1482" /> Brownswood Hospital, in Deputy Yates' home town &mdash; which was previously a geriatric hospital is now a private nursing home, and Gorey District Hospital which was previously under the auspices of the South-Eastern Health Board is now a community-based hospital and is not available to all.  The number of beds available to the elderly from the health board's perspective has decreased dramatically since 1987.  I can quote the figures, as I did in the debate we had here in February, should the Minister require it.  The option for many people is to avail of private nursing homes.  That is a good option for some but it is no option for those who simply cannot afford such care.  We are wasting our time tonight if we do not provide in this section a framework that will enable all those who need it to avail of proper nursing home care in their twilight years.</P>
    <P>The financial implications in this section are crucial and fundamental.  The first amendment in the name of Deputy Yates is not the most controversial amendment of this section but it is a very important one.  People who make application for health board subvention should at least receive an answer within a reasonable time.  We could all quote cases into the record of the House of inordinate delays in simply getting a response to a simple request from a health board for subvention.  It all boils down to the fact that health boards have not got the money and that, therefore, they drag their heels and elderly people are left in a state of discomfort, to put it midly, and in some cases in dire circumstances waiting for a decision.  Sometimes they have gone to their graves before a decision is made to provide them with adequate nursing home care.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the amendment.  I am sure the Minister will know what I am talking about when I refer to the fact that he has much correspondence from certain parties in my county relating to the amounts paid to some of the nursing homes.  It is not sufficient to provide in the legislation that &ldquo;if the health board is of the opinion that <Col N="1483" /> the person is in need of maintenance in a nursing home and is unable to pay any or part of its costs, it may ...&rdquo;.  The provision would be strengthened by the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  More private nursing homes are coming into existence as a result of the difficulty presented by people not being able to get accommodation in health board institutions. People are assessed by the geriatrician of the health board and are told that it could take eight or nine months before a bed becomes available.  This means they have to avail of private accommodation.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I would like the Minister to clarify the position of subvented beds.  Having been a member of a health board for a number of years, I was always led to believe that the beds were subvented regardless of the means of the applicant.  In other words, if a nursing home had ten subvented beds it did not matter to the health board who occupied them.  This was very unfair in that someone who could well afford to pay the full amount was allocated a subvented bed.  In County Carlow those who are in the nursing home are unofficially barred from being considered for admittance to the hospital under the aegis of the health board.  It is considered that if they went into the nursing home they can afford to pay.  They go into the nursing home because of an emergency and because relatives who cannot afford it must get them into some nursing care.  I am keen to hear what is the position in relation to subvented beds because based <Col N="1484" /> on this discussion it means that people can apply.</P>

While I accept that health boards should not delay unduly I would be happy to include something in the regulations or in the code of practice, but I do not think it would be appropriate to write it into the Bill.  In the vast majority of cases the health boards process claims fairly expeditiously.  I take the point raised by Deputy Yates that he is aware of a case where that did not happen.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to look again at this section.  This section is the meat of the Bill.  If we cannot enable people to avail of nursing homes, particularly the most vulnerable and the poor, then we are wasting our time trying to make regulations.  What are we doing? We are making regulations for those who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them and excluding a whole category of people who simply do not have the financial resources to avail of nursing home care.  I had hoped there would be a devolved responsibility on the health board to maintain those people who are means tested and are determined by the health board not to be in a position to maintain themselves.  What will happen now?  The looseness of the phraseology in the section leaves it to the health board to possibly subvent &mdash; they may subvent somebody whom they determine is unable to pay any or part of the cost of the nursing home.  It is totally unacceptable that that would be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly the same position will arise as in the case with dental treatment and all the other aspects of care where there will be a patchwork service throughout the country where some health boards provide it very effectively while others do not, where the delivery of service would be excellent in some regions and awful in other regions.  The bottom line is that there will be no statutory responsibility devolved on health boards to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves in their twilight years.  This is compounded by the fact that the Minister has, by direct policy decision since 1987, <Col N="1487" /> taken many thousands of public beds out of service.  The number of geriatric beds available to the general population is substantially fewer than it was in 1987.  When people are clamouring for a service and when others are willing to provide that service it is wholly unacceptable that the Minister would not require health boards to provide this money to all those who need it.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that it is the mark of a civilised society that we would make adequate provision for all our elderly. It has been a hallmark of this society in particular and something that is unique among western civilised nations that we have regard for the elderly.  Generally, we do not abandon our elderly as is often the case in some European societies.  The enactment of this Bill will not help this process.  If they do not have the resources themselves &mdash; those who have no relatives left, those whose spouse is elderly and unable to look after them and those left with no other option &mdash; they will not be able to get into a nursing home.</P>
    <P>There is also the spectre of those who are actually in a nursing home who cannot continue to maintain themselves because of changed circumstances.  What will happen to those?  What we see here is a wishy washy section that enables health boards, at their discretion, to subsidise to some degree those who, it is determined, do not have the resources to look after themselves.  That is unacceptable.  I appeal to the Minister not to allow this Bill to be effectively gutted and made useless by the inclusion of this watery, ineffectual section as it stands and to give some commitment that he will look at it again between now and Report Stage.  In the interim I want to inform the House that the Labour Party will oppose this section because it does not provide an adequate and comprehensive service to all elderly people who need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the most important for the practical daily lives of those who are residents in and those managing and running nursing homes.  It is all very well to talk about a graded level of subvention.  This is the concept behind <Col N="1488" /> this section.  We would all support the idea that the level of subvention should be higher for an Alzheimer's patient who requires a more demanding type of nursing. That is fine in theory but the reality is that no new homes have been approved since 1980.  Therefore none of the patients in those homes can receive one penny by way of subvention.  The present level of subvention, at a maximum of £45 per week, bears no relationship to the actual cost.  What we are doing in this Bill is going backwards.  Section 54 of the 1953 Health Act places a legal obligation on the health boards to provide financial assistance to people in nursing homes but now the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is being taken out and replaced with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The section will now read &ldquo;... it may, if the person enters or is in a nursing home, and subject to compliance by the home with any requirements made by the board for the purpose of its functions under this section, pay to the home such amount in respect of such maintenance as it considers appropriate having regard to the degree of the dependency and to the means and circumstances of the person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The National Council for the Aged in a major report on the elderly dealt with the question of subvention and highlighted the hardship caused for people as a result of the shortfall between the income of the person, by way of their pension and the health board's subvention, and the fee charged by the nursing home.  In some cases the shortfall may be as high as £40 a week.  This problem is compounded by the fact that supplementary welfare is not payable to those maintained in an institution.  Therefore, this is a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also true that the health boards have failed to discharge their responsibilities under the 1953 Act to provide institutional assistance for persons unable to provide it for themselves.  They are obliged to provide such institutional assistance where it is necessary and proper to do so.  The truth of the matter is that the Minister does not want to implement that provision and this is totally unacceptable.  I note from today's newspapers that the Private Nursing <Col N="1489" /> Homes Association have said that it is impossible to take in patients because they cannot afford to pay.  I would not mind if the Minister was taking an active policy decision that these people should be cared for in State institutions but he has closed that door, as many of those have felt his scalpel or hatchet during the past three years.</P>
    <P>Where are these people to go?  We are aware that only 4 per cent of the elderly require residential care.  We are also aware that the number of people over 70 and 80 years of age is on the increase. Having regard to the fact that it may be another 20 years before we deal with similar legislation, we should bear in mind that this is the most defenceless and most frail group in society who simply do not have the vim and the vigour they once had.  What are we doing?  We are going to remove the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and replace it with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and water down their rights.  I tabled amendments to ensure some element of progression but these were ruled out of order.  I suggested that 70 per cent of the approved weekly costs would be met, with the remainder being met by way of their pension and so on.</P>
    <P>I am bitterly disappointed.  Subvented beds are not available and have not been available for some time.  The reality is that people go before the geriatric assessment committees and are told by the geriatric placement nurse that they are being put on a waiting list.  Before one can gain access to St. John's Hospital or Haughton's Hospital, New Ross, in my constituency, someone has to die.  People have no hope of getting a subvented bed even though some of them are living in appalling conditions in the community. There is no doubt that in the long run it would be far cheaper, from the point of view of the Exchequer, to grant a subvention of either £70 or £80 per week than to maintain a geriatric bed at £220 a week on average.</P>
    <P>We are throwing people to the wolves. Our intention to improve quality and standards and the regulations will be set at nought if access is denied, and access <Col N="1490" /> is being denied, to the most defenceless and poorest within our community.  It is totally unacceptable that we should try to legislate for a two-tier system.  In other words, if someone has enough money, perhaps inherited from a late husband, they can afford to go into a nursing home for which we have set down standards, and if one cannot gain access, tough luck. This is a very serious matter and I appeal to the Minister to remove the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and maintain the <i>status quo</i> by reinserting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I am sure when the heads of the Bill were circulated the Department of Finance saw the opportunity to change the wording.  It is incomprehensible how the Department of Health allowed this to happen and it is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated earlier that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; weakens the section considerably.  As regards sections 26 and 54 of the 1970 Health Act, the amount payable is arbitary and the effects of this have already been referred to in this debate.  The health boards have resorted to subterfuge to contain costs, with the result that great hardship and distress have been caused for those in need of long stay services and those providing them.  In such circumstances, the elderly may be offered a subvented bed a long distance from their homes or their families in the belief that they would receive a subvention.  It has been reported that in some cases people who had been receiving a subvention for some time for no apparent reason saw this being withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nursing home owners are trying to provide and run a viable, cost effective operation of good quality but have experienced delays in the payment of subventions, their removal or the imposition of extra conditions with a demand for higher standards and facilities at the same time.  We need these facilities and now have to depend on this system, given the failure of the health board and the Department of Health to provide care. The Department of Health should ensure that the necessary resources are made available to enable the health boards to <Col N="1491" /> provide such care.  It is not good enough to leave this matter to the discretion of the health boards in assessing who is in need of care and what the means test should consist of.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that when there was a reduction in the number of staff in our hospitals a few years ago there was a furore, but now things are being done in a more subtle way.  People are now means-tested for benefits to which they are entitled.  I feel the same will happen with regard to the subvention payable by health boards if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is not deleted from the Bill and the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; substituted.  We need strong legislation to compel the health boards to provide subventions.  As Deputy Howlin said, the way we care for the elderly and sick is the hallmark of our society.  We have an opportunity in this Bill to ensure this by making provisions for the payment of subventions to nursing homes.</P>

I was at the cutting edge &mdash; if that is not a bad phrase to use in this House &mdash; having sat on the health board where we certainly had no such thing as an application for a subvented bed from an individual patient or even from a hospital, despite the lovely buildings that went up.  There was no question of any subvented beds I would say for the last five years.  Are beds subvented for individuals, is it a total amount or is it up to different health boards?  We are discussing subvented beds here and as one who had dealt with them I say that they are much more fiction than fact at the moment in our part of the country. They do not exist.  You could not apply for one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the major problem of subvention and providing for people in need we looked forward to this section, now we find it envisages a continuance of the two-tiered health service. The elderly in our society and their families had looked forward to this Bill and particularly to this section to help <Col N="1492" /> them along the road and to bring them some sort of future.  The State has a statutory obligation to provide health care for people, provided the facilities are there. In relation to our senior citizens elderly people and medical card holders, while the statutory obligation is there it is there provided you can get access to our institutions whether State or health board. Unfortunately, that depends very much on the subvention.  In this section we are deprived of an opportunity either in the legislation or through regulation to give some definite commitment from the Oireachtas here to the people out there whom we were looking forward to assisting. For most of the private institutions the charge could be £200 per week.</P>
      <P>A medical card holder who is entitled to care cannot get into a public hospital. Perhaps he is getting £50, £60 or £80 a week from social welfare.  What are we getting for such a person at the moment? Perhaps £40 or £45 at the maximum.  Who is going to care for him?  We had looked forward to this section of the Bill for some hope for such people.  We can all talk about our constituencies.  In my constituency a daughter and a son are trying to rear families on their own and to get the £40 or £50 per week to bring a little dignity into the last days of their mother's life.  Because they cannot produce that money and have to look after and educate their children there is the possibility that their mother will be evicted &mdash; I do not like to use that word because we use it in another area &mdash; from the hospital and sent home.  Where in our Constitution are we providing for such people?  We had hoped through this section to provide under regulation, if necessary, the subvention to maintain persons in institutions.</P>

We have people in nursing homes who are well able financially to look after and provide for themselves.  At the same time medical card holders, people in need who depend on that extra £10, £20 or £40, whatever is necessary to provide for their care in those institutions, are being deprived of that.  The Minister might take on board not only my view but the views of all Opposition spokespersons when he is framing the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand how Deputies maintain this section of the Bill is going backwards.  The section is an improvement on what is there already and it is a new provision which implements one of the recommendations of the working party who prepared the report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i>.  Reference has already been made to the difficulties in various health board areas around the country where section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, has not been implemented, or at least no new nursing homes have been approved under that section since 1980.  That is going back a long time.  Various Governments have been in power since 1980 and the Minister for Health has responsibility for implementing that legislation, but no Minister <Col N="1494" /> for Health since 1980 has approved new beds under that section of the 1970 Act. The Eastern Health Board have implemented another section of the Act, section 26, under which they can give a subvention to individuals in hospital beds and they have been doing that.</P>
      <P>What is important about this section is that, first, we will not be depending on the Minister for Health of the day to subvent the beds.  It will be a matter for the health board to assess each patient and decide, having regard to (1) the patient's needs and (2) the degree of dependency, what the subvention should be.  The idea behind this section and its main thrust is to ensure the resources &mdash; which everyone accepts are limited &mdash; are targeted at the very people Deputy Ryan was talking about, the people who need them, having regard to the level of dependency and the degree of nursing required. We are contemplating several categories &mdash; mild, moderate and heavy and possibly a fourth subvention category for those suffering from dementia, Alzheimer's disease.  There is an obligation on the health board to provide support for the elderly in need.  Only a very small percentage of the elderly find their way into long-term residential care.  The vast majority of the elderly live in their own homes or live with their families.  Families are, of course, the great carers in Irish society.  Deputy Howlin has already referred to the fact that we in Ireland look after our elderly people extremely well.  The beds closed by the South-Eastern Health Board were district hospital beds.</P>

      <P>The beds closed by the South-Eastern Health Board were district hospital beds and were funded as such by my Department.  They were not geriatric beds.  I had a most enjoyable day with Deputy Browne in Carlow when we reopened one of them.  It is a credit to the local community.  We were in a position to provide some funding from the national lottery, not only in Bagenalstown but also in Kilrush where the health board have 22 patients and a voluntary group have 48 patients in residence in the hospital.  There have been some improvements in areas where beds were closed but they were district hospital beds, not beds for the elderly.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill there will be no diminution of resources for the care of the elderly.  The Government showed their commitment to the care of the elderly by providing £5 million in the budget.  I stated on Second Stage that persons at present being subvented will continue to be subvented.</P>

      <P>At the rate they are being subvented, but there is no reason a person or a relative cannot apply for the new subvention rate.  There will be no diminution of resources.  The existing subvention to patients will continue but I retained £500,000 from the £5 million allocated by the Government in the budget for implementing this Bill in the <Col N="1496" /> current year in respect of subventions for patients.  This is a major improvement. Deputy Browne said that since 1980 no new beds have been subvented in any health board area.  Not alone will patients who are in those beds continue to be subvented under the old rate but there will be no objection to their applying for the new rate.  The sum of £500,000 is being allocated in the current year and will be targeted at people in accordance with this section, that is, people depending on their own income and means, in the light of their degree of physical dependency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual the Minister has tried to disguise what he is really at.  I am most disappointed that he has made no reference to willingness to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Under section 54 of the 1953 Act it is provided that a health board shall provide financial assistance to those who cannot afford to pay for their stay in a private nursing home.  In this section we are changing from the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During Second Stage debate on 9 November 1989 the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I wish to stress that any person in receipt of a subvention at present under section 54 will not be affected by the Bill in any way.  These subventions will continue to be paid as long as the person is in the home.  However, no new applications will be accepted for section 54 subventions when the provisions of this Bill take effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can see what the Minister is at.  The £500,000 is a mirage, a sop.  It works out at £100 per week for one year for 100 extra pensioners.  It goes nowhere.  We <Col N="1497" /> are talking about a single non-contributory old age pensioner with nil means in receipt of about £50 a week.  How is that person to survive when the cheapest nursing home costs about £110 a week and costs can range up to £220 per week?  A person either goes into a nursing home or goes on to a waiting list for a State or health board geriatric home.  That is the choice.  The Minister is diminishing their rights.  There is no point in being aspirational about light, medium and heavy grading in relation to subventions unless one is prepared to say it means £45, £75 and £90 per week.  It means no such thing. If a person is lucky enough to live in the Eastern Health Board area tonight he or she has a chance of subvention; after tonight nobody in the country has a guaranteed right to a subvention, even meeting the criteria.  I am not talking about satisfying the assessment criteria to get a bed in one of these nursing homes.  All that has to apply irrespective of the financial aspects.  This is most unfair.</P>
    <P>To say that the report on the care of the elderly or any other report vindicates what the Minister is doing is simply unfair.  This is a very retrograde step and it is undeniable that it comes on top of taking about 3,000 long stay beds out of the system nationally over the past five years or so, under a number of Governments. This is no way to treat our elderly, who will increase between now and the end of the century by 7 per cent as a proportion of our population.</P>
    <P>It is tragic that this is happening.  In responding to all the specific points made the Minister did not give any justification for the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  What the Minister is doing is deplorable and is a retrograde step.  One has only to look at today's newspapers to see that the Private Nursing Homes Association believe the present level of subvention, which is not available for 60 per cent of the population, is totally inadequate.  People have to wait from May to January to get their claims processed.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to this House that he <Col N="1498" /> will substantially re-examine section 7 of the Bill to at least ensure that we do not go backwards, as outlined on page 17 of his Second Stage speech and in the 1953 and 1970 Health Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Minister stated clearly that nothing has happened in regard to subvention since 1980.  Many demands were made by this side of the House from 1982 to 1987 for money to be spent on the health services. The Minister is supposed to provide money for these services but nothing has happened in this area for the past three years.  If an old person in my constituency wants to apply for subvention can I tell him that the subvention is available now or will be available shortly or are we talking about something that may happen sometime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a problem which affects the health board area in which both I and the Minister live, that is, the North Eastern Health Board.  In practice no private nursing homes in that health board area are subvented. This is false economics and results in long waiting lists to get into the county homes in the North Eastern Health Board region.  These homes cost in the region of £220 per week whereas the subvention would be probably a quarter or little more of that amount if it was made available by the North Eastern Health Board.  The result of this is that many people are remaining in acute beds in hospital because they cannot be discharged. No private nursing home will take these people because no subvention is available in a private nursing home and the waiting lists for the county homes are so long that they have no possibility of getting into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have very bad economics in this area in the sense that many people are staying on in acute hospitals where the cost may be £300 to £400 per week, a few people are staying in the county home which costs £220 per week and many people are living in intolerable conditions at home where both they and their families are suffering.  Essentially the limited <Col N="1499" /> State resources which are available &mdash; one must recognise the resources are limited &mdash; are being misapplied in the sense that they are either going towards a very expensive facility or they are not going at all to the families concerned.</P>
    <P>I realise that health boards are local authorities and have certain discretion in the matter but I hope the Minister will be able to ensure that there will be a uniform policy of subventing private nursing homes so that they can deal in a cost effective way with this acute human problem.  Something needs to be done about the policy of the North Eastern Health Board which to my mind is plain and simply mistaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that an additional £500,000 would be made available for this scheme.  Will he confirm whether there will be defined criteria across the health boards in relation to the increased subvention?  Is the Minister talking about an extra £10, £20 or will it be up to the maximum amount?  Will this amount be defined right across the board or will it be left to each health board to decide the amount?  It will be totally unacceptable if it gets to the stage where a local representative has to make representations on behalf of an individual. The present level of subvention is totally unacceptable.  It is necessary to define the criteria so that people will know what they are entitled to and that there is a possibility of a further increase so that they can retain a bed in a particular institution.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister if the word &ldquo;dependency&rdquo; in section 7 related to physical or financial dependency or both. I should like him to comment on that point.</P>

      <P>Because I have some good news for Deputy Bruton, I thought it would be appropriate to look in this direction but I take your point, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  What Deputy Bruton is suggesting for the North Eastern Health Board is what will happen with the introduction of this legislation; money will be available in the North Eastern Health Board area and it will be <Col N="1501" /> targeted towards those in need on the basis of their means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and depending on the level of care they need.  Obviously some people need a much higher level of care and a much higher standard of staffing than others.  This legislation will do what Deputy Bruton has proposed.</P>
      <P>Before I resume my seat I think it is only right that I should follow on from the paragraph of my Second Stage speech quoted by Deputy Yates which stated that no new applications under section 54 would be accepted when the new legislation took effect.  The following paragraph of my Second Stage speech, which was before the budget, states, and I quote:</P>
      <P>I would like to give an assurance that the overall level of financial support for people cared for in nursing homes will not diminish as a result of this Bill.  This provision is not about saving money; it is about enabling health boards to target their available resources most effectively and to respond flexibly to the changing demands of dependent people for whom they have responsibility.  This is the approach which the new subvention arrangements provide for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

The Minister has found that sentence and he knows it was in his speech.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a relevant question in regard to this section.  He said he is holding back £500,000 to help subvent beds.  How is that £500,000 to be distributed? Is he going to distribute it on a <i>per capita</i> basis to each health board?  Is he going to do it on the basis of applications from each health board on the number of subventive beds they seek to provide or on the basis of direct application to his Department by individuals? How is the Minister going to distribute that £500,000 around the country?  I ask the Minister to give me a direct reply to those questions.</P>

      <P>In the length of time available to me I would appeal to the Minister to agree to come back on Report Stage with an amendment to the section that will make the necessary provision.  I will give the reason I ask this.  It becomes more serious as we go along.  In the previous debate on this issue I mentioned section 1 which I said was very specific in that it defined a dependent person as one with a physical infirmity or a physical injury, defective disease or mental infirmity.  Old age does not fit into that category.  We have a situation where people are in beds in acute hospitals because there is no accommodation for them.  There are people who are being accommodated in the private nursing homes and their families are paying, which they can ill afford to do in the circumstances.  We have the worst situation we could have in this State when elderly people now feel they are being <Col N="1503" /> neglected.  There was a hope that something would be done for them in this Bill but the fact is they are being neglected and will be left to die because no provision will be made for them.  Beds have been closed down in every health board area in this country.  Only yesterday at a health board meeting people from Killarney came into the Southern Health Board appealing to the health board to reopen the beds that had been closed in 1988 and 1989.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne himself pointed out that no new beds have been subvented in any health board area since 1980.  The answer is we cannot do that. In 1990 what we are trying to do is to get this legislation implemented as rapidly as possible to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question raised by Deputy Howlin about how the money will be <Col N="1504" /> divided, certainly it will be divided on the basis of need, but that will be decided when the legislation is passed and we are in a position to implement it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>The question raised by Deputy Sherlock about old age is an important one and we dealt with it earlier. We had a reasonable debate on the concept of old age not being included in the Bill.  The reason is that the concept of old age is going out of fashion internationally. We did agree with Deputy Sherlock, if my memory serves me correctly, that we would look at the section to ensure that there was nobody who was not included in it and if old age was the only terminology we could come up with that it would go in, but we will have a look at that.</P>
      <P>The final point is that more resources will be made available.  This section in the Bill is certainly an improvement on the situation as described by Deputy Browne and others and it will improve people's position considerably and will do what I am sure everybody in this House wants to do, that is target the resources at the people who need them.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That section 7 is hereby agreed to, that section 8 is hereby deleted, that the amendment set down by the Minister for Health to section 9 is hereby agreed to and that the said section, as amended, is hereby agreed to.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In page 10, subsection (2) (b), line 30, after &ldquo;notice&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in writing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would make the section more explicit by requiring notice to be given to a person in writing because it is very important that any ambiguity or subsequent grievances are avoided.  It is not a substantial change but it would bring order to the procedures and operations of this Bill by health board personnel. Therefore, I ask the Minister to accept this modest, but sensible, amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unnecessary because, in the circumstances envisaged in the section, notice that a nursing home management order would be sought would normally be made in writing.  A health board can only take over the temporary management of a nursing home either with the consent of the owner or on foot of a court order.  This course of action would only be taken in cases of serious breaches of the regulations and it is not necessary to stipulate that notice of the intention of a health board to take such a step should be in writing.  In this situation, it would be normal for written notification to be given.</P>

      <P>We come to amendment No. 64 in the name of Deputy Yates.  Amendment No. 65 is an alternative and I suggest, therefore, that they be discussed together by agreement. Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      <P>I note that amendment No. 65 is virtually identical to amendment No. 64 and, therefore, a decision on amendment No. 64 should suffice.  If Deputy Howlin insists on a separate decision he may have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 64:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2) (c), line 35, after &ldquo;home&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided an opportunity has been given for the person to comply with the regulations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to subsection (2) (c) whereby a management order may be made from time to time in respect of a particular nursing home.  This is more than a condition in the establishment of a nursing home in relation to registration. It may be an order given from time to time to, say, put in a new drain, to improve hygiene or whatever it might be. If it involves a physical dimension it is reasonable that an opportunity should be given, prior to it being made an order, for the person to comply.  Therefore, in terms of getting a balance and being reasonable, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As you rightly said, my amendment is virtually identical to amendment No. 64 in the name of Deputy Yates.  It is to allow a proprietor <Col N="1510" /> a reasonable opportunity to state his case before a management order is granted. It is a sensible provision &mdash; one which the proprietors sought &mdash; and it does not impinge on the rights of individuals.  If my amendment is accepted subsection (2) (c) would contain an additional sentence: &ldquo;for the purposes of this section no management order shall be sought by the health board until the person carrying on the home has been given a reasonable opportunity to comply with the regulations&rdquo;. I dealt with breaches of the health regulations and it is normal practice for notice to be served and a reasonable time given to somebody to comply with regulations before a management order is taken, which is a drastic step.  In some instances it is obviously an appropriate step but a reasonable opportunity should be afforded to the owner to comply with the regulations before this severe step is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>A health board would not normally seek a nursing home management order unless the regulations had been seriously breached.  It would be a very serious step for a health board to take and could only be granted with the consent of the owner or the District Court.  A nursing home management order is not the first line of action for a health board to take if the regulations have been breached.  It is usual &mdash; and has been the practice to date &mdash; for the health boards to discuss the situation with the owner.  A management order would be more suited to a crisis where there was an immediate threat to the wellbeing of the patient being cared for and where the proprietor was unable or unwilling to do anything about it.  Prior to seeking an order the board would already have given a nursing home owner an opportunity to remedy the situation and, therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.  The important point is that the management order must be with the approval of the owner of the premises or the District Court. Before going to the District Court I have no doubt that the health board would approach the owner and look for his or her consent to a management order <Col N="1511" /> because it is only applied in very serious breaches of the regulations.  We must have balance and ensure that we protect the interests of patients.  We must also respect the rights of owners of such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What would be the reaction of a management if they felt that the application for such an order was unjustified?  Would they have to state their case in court?  Is that the only option open to them?  Would they not have any appeal mechanism in the health board to put a stay on such an application pending, literally, putting their house in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be up to the relevant health board to state the case as to why such an order was necessary.  I do not think any health board would wish to seek a management order unless there had been some very serious breach of the regulations.  Obviously it would create an additional burden on them which they would want to avoid if at all possible. Therefore, I do not think any health board would be rushing off to the court seeking a management order.  If there was a serious breach, initially, they would discuss it with the owner of the premises; if it was something that could be rectified it would be and if it was something that could not be rectified then they would discuss with the owner the question of a management order.  Should that prove to be unsuccessful then they might resort to the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister feels that the normal procedure would be to have such discussions in advance of an application to the court, why is he reluctant to incorporate that provision in the Bill, so that it would be a requirement?  We are talking about officials who, perhaps are sometimes over-zealous &mdash; we have all come across them &mdash; who might take a precipitate step.  This is an endeavour to have natural justice apply, not only understood to be applied but required to be applied under the provisions of the Bill.  If the Minister feels it would be the normal practice to have such discussions <Col N="1512" /> would he not think it appropriate to have that requirement incorporated in the Bill, so that there would be a requirement that such discussion, such lee-way &mdash; short and all as it might be &mdash; would be afforded the management of the relevant nursing home?  Probably it would happen very rarely but it could happen that one could come across an over-zealous health board official who might feel a pre-emptive strike might be in order whereas natural justice would indicate a more appropriate course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make two supplementary points to those already made by Deputy Howlin and myself.  If these amendments were accepted by the Minister, or if he brought in this clause himself, an important factor would arise.  The District Court justice would have to satisfy himself &mdash; before granting the management order &mdash; that the relevant health board had given the person an opportunity to comply with it.  That would be a factor as part of their consideration of the case.  If the requirement is not included the district justice would have to adjudicate on the bare case put forward by the relevant health board.  I contend it should be part of the criteria that the district justice will have to decide not only whether a management order should be granted but whether he could say to the health board: &ldquo;Hold on a minute.  I will adjourn this case for two months because I do not believe they have been afforded an adequate opportunity&rdquo;. That is a significant point in favour of its inclusion in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that not only must we remember the circumstances outlined by Deputy Howlin in which there could be a particularly zealous official but also circumstance in which, to all intents and purposes &mdash; if it goes to the District Court &mdash; the damaging publicity in the local papers would mean that nursing home, in terms of attracting new clientele, would be finished.  One cannot say, &ldquo;Go to the court and let the court decide&rdquo;. That might finish the business.  It might not be worth talking about thereafter. Therefore, referral to the District Court <Col N="1513" /> constitutes a very serious step indeed.  On those two points &mdash; not only the question of fair play but if this were incorporated in the Bill, it would form part of the justices criteria to ascertain, on balance, whether the owner has been given an opportunity to put his house in order as well as establish whether or not his house was in order &mdash; regardless of whether a management order in granted and it will be almost a <i>fait accompli</i> if it reaches the District Court.  This is not a matter of mere semantics but could be a very important element in ensuring fair play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Yates says about it constituting a fairly major step to go to the District Court.  For that reason I believe a health board would be very reluctant to do so, and would only do so in the most extraordinary circumstances in which there had been a very serious breach of the regulations.  I believe they would give the owner an opportunity to comply with the regulations.</P>
      <P>Inserting one or other amendment into the Bill might well defeat the objective we all want to achieve.  What I do not want to do in this Bill is begin writing in extra amendments which will dilute one of its prime purposes, which is to protect the interests of patients in a nursing home.  If we were to insert either of those amendments it could well be that, in a crisis &mdash; perhaps in a serious crisis in which the owners disappeared &mdash; the hands of the health board and the courts would be tied behind their backs, because they would be unable to provide a management order for the nursing home.  We must be very careful when inserting amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I understand the Deputies' points, I believe their amendments are unnecessary.  First, I am satisfied that a health board would move to the District Court only in the most critical of circumstances, that first they would discuss the circumstances with the owner. Remember it is in the interests of a health board that a nursing home would operate efficiently and effectively rather than <Col N="1514" /> their having to take responsibility for it. I could not foresee them rushing to seek a management order, rather they would seek the owner's consent and then go to the District Court.  My concern is that, if we start putting further obligations on the health boards, they might find themselves in a crisis situation in which they would be unable to take the necessary action to protect the interests of the patients, which is what we all want to do.</P>

      <P>We come to amendment No. 66 in the name of the Minister.  I observe that amendment No. 68 is consequential on amendment No. 66.  I might suggest that we discuss amendments Nos. 66 and 68 together.  Is that satisfactory?</P>

      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 66:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 42, to delete &ldquo;, at the expense of the board,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to clarify that a health board may undertake to pay part or all of the boarding-out costs.  It was considered that the original phrasing suggested that a health board would pay all of the costs associated with a boarding-out arrangement, which was not the intention of the section.  The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the meaning of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put a rather benign interpretation on this.  On first reading I was certainly opposed to amendment No. 66 because it does not determine who will decide in what circumstances all or part of the boarding-out costs will be paid.  This lack of clarity <Col N="1515" /> is usually a recipe for CEOs to negative any intention.</P>
      <P>I might draw the Minister's attention to the report of the National Council for the Aged, entitled <i>Home from Home,</i> an excellent report on boarding-out schemes for older people in Ireland.  It was produced in 1985.  It was stated in that report that boarding-out certainly was worthy of consideration, that it should be further promoted and had been successful in a number of cases in so far as it allowed people to remain in their community and not moved elsewhere.  It also allowed them to go to bingo sessions, to attend Mass, to go to the shops.  They were part of the community when they were boarded-out.  They were not, as it were, put away in some residential centre.  It was contended that it was cheaper than the full-time cost of a nursing home and filled a policy vacuum.  In the survey undertaken, one of the striking aspects was that only 144 people, elderly and non-elderly, are at present facilitated in eight boarding-out schemes, with a total of 63 carers, often in very rural areas. Therefore, boarding-out is a totally under-utilised option which should be given some element of financial support, if not preferential financial support.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly this matter needs to be dealt with.  Amendment No. 74 in my name also deals with eligibility for assistance and covers the same point as the Minister's amendment No. 68 which states &ldquo;may provide for the payment of all or part of the costs&rdquo;.  I am very anxious that the criteria for eligibility for financial payments would be generous.  In fact I would not be against payment being 100 per cent of the cost in view of the fact that 100 per cent of the cost of boarding out is less than two thirds of the cost of a nursing home, in other words we are talking about the same amount of money, as boarding out is so much cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all those reasons I would like the Minister to clarify the following: how he envisages the payments for boarding out will work; the policy shift between what was originally proposed in the section prior to ministerial amendments Nos. 66 and 68 and if there is a shift, as we have <Col N="1516" /> seen in earlier sections, in the financial intent?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had some discussion on the concept of boarding out and we are all favourably disposed to it as an option that health boards should make available to people for whom it is suitable.  It is not extensively used at present but certainly there is a place for it in the scheme of things</P>
      <P>Alarm bells ring when there is a change, as proposed by the Minister in this section.  The section as originally drafted stated:</P>
      <P>A health board may in accordance with regulations under this section make and carry out, at the expense of the board, an arrangement for the boarding out in a private dwelling....</P>
      <P>The Minister is now saying that was a misunderstanding and that he did not really want to make it a requirement on the health board but would rather allow the health board to make a determination as to the means of an individual whether they will make a payment or not.  We are again back to the core argument we had in section 7.  We are now back to &ldquo;may&rdquo; and the health boards which are already under great financial pressure are given an authority which they &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;may not&rdquo; exercise.  I have not the slightest doubt that there will be people who could avail of this option just as I argued there were people who could avail of the option of private residential nursing homes, who will not be able to avail of it unless the health board subvents them to the full extent of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's amendment is accepted we will have a vagueness in the section about the criteria that will be used for determining the amount of funding that will be available and whether health boards will consider the concept of boarding out as suitable, and perhaps they will not fund anybody in their health board area.  Has the Minister views on this?  Will he clarify whether there will be consistency right across the country and that <Col N="1517" /> the health boards will be required to provide funding for those who want to avail of boarding out, who are suitable for boarding out and have no resources other than being dependent on the health board to fund them.  Clearly, if this legislation is amended in the way the Minister envisages, it will not place an obligation on the health boards to make such provision. It is aspirational and I am terribly nervous about leaving things as vague as they would be if the section is amended.</P>
    <P>If we accept there is a role for boarding out and that it is a good idea for people who are mobile, healthy and able and who have no other dependants and want to be boarded out with a family so that they can be maintained in the community and basically take part in family life, it is important that resources would be put in place to enable that to come to pass. Although the report referred to by Deputy Yates says this is a good idea, the actual numbers involved are extraordinarily small so far.</P>
    <P>For many of the same reasons that I opposed section 7 of the Bill, I also oppose the changes the Minister wants to bring about in this section.  I am not saying that everybody who presents himself for boarding out should be subvented 100 per cent of the cost by the health board, however the Minister's alternative is too vague.  I appeal to him to think again about it and to clarify his thoughts on how he will ensure that all those who are suitable for boarding out, and want to avail of it but cannot afford it will have that option open to them?  Is it his intention that that option will be available to them?  How will he bring this to pass? Clearly, if this amendment is carried it will not be achieved, for that reason I will oppose the Minister's amendment No. 66.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 is based on a report of the National Council for the Aged, which Deputy Yates referred to and it is updated by the recommendations of the report <i>The Years Ahead</i>.  The Bill provides for the first time a statutory framework for boarding out and I am <Col N="1518" /> sure will encourage a greater use of this facility.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that there is no change in our intention in relation to payment.  All existing schemes provide for a contribution from the person boarded out and in effect we are building on the <i>status quo</i>.  A typical contribution at present would be in the region of £20 from the person who is being boarded out with another £25 coming from the health board.  This is a reasonable arrangement because for the most part the elderly people receive the old age pension.</P>
      <P>The amendment is really only a drafting amendment and is intended to clarify what was the intention.  For example, section 11 (1) states:</P>
      <P>A health board may in accordance with regulations under this section make and carry out, at the expense of the board, an arrangement for the boarding out in a private dwelling...</P>
      <P>It could be construed that the health boards were expected to pay everything but equally, it could be construed that the board were obliged only to pay part of it, so it is not as clearly defined as we would like and we have tabled an amendment purely to clarify the position. It is a drafting amendment and there is no change in our approach or there is no change in what was intended.</P>

      <P>This is a new concept and one would want to be very wary of it.  In my experience quite recently, when the local authority were allocating houses in a particular area the management decided that one such dwelling would be retained for the purpose of accommodating the health board.  I am a member of a health board and I am also <Col N="1519" /> a member of the community care committee of the health board.  I attend meetings in which I have an interest but at no time did I ever hear a debate on how this new concept was to be applied and whether those in institutional care were to be taken out and given an opportunity to live in a place other than a home or institution.  Secondly, it should be stated whether this accommodation would be inside or outside the functional area.  If it is outside the area it would mean the person would be far removed from his locality and his relatives.  This provision should not be implemented without there being an investigation as to how the system will operate, what accommodation will be provided and so on.  I am very wary of the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>From my knowledge, only a limited number of health boards operate this system and I do not think the Southern Health Board are one such board.  I hope Deputy Sherlock will not say this is a bad system because the Southern Health Board do not operate it.  In the case of a person who is, say, 70 years of age and is relatively healthy but has bad arthritis and cannot live alone in the community, it is essentially a good thing that that person can stay in his home and have his meals provided, his bed made and so on. In Dublin the nursing home may be only five minutes drive away, whereas in rural areas it could be 20 miles away and therefore the people lose contact with their community.  The boarding out system is totally under-developed in this country. In Belgium, for example, the system has been developed very successfully.  I would go further and say that the system should be encouraged even on a pilot basis.  That is why I propose a new section 12 in amendment No. 75.  It proposes that a health board shall promote the option of boarding out for dependent persons, as an option between institutional care and subvention in a nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have my doubts when the Minister says this provision is just technical. <Col N="1520" /> Amendment No. 71 deals with the amounts of payments by the health boards to persons in respect of boarding out and the fixing of the maximum number of persons who may be boarded out; obviously there has been some element of rethink about the financial cost involved and someone has given advice.  I think we might be able to nip this in the bud.  Sometimes the Minister's first thoughts might be his best and most generous thoughts.  I would be inclined to press this matter a little more firmly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at least as suspicious as Deputy Yates in regard to this matter. Generally I take what the Minister says at face value &mdash; as the Minister knows I am a very trusting individual &mdash; but it is the vagueness of the section if it is amended as proposed by the Minister that concerns me.  Basically he is taking out all the key requirements, the &ldquo;thou shalt&rdquo; as it were, and is replacing them by a new framework of &ldquo;maybes&rdquo;.  I do not think the health boards will have adequate resources to do what the Minister proposes in this section.  I would like the Minister to clearly state his attitude in relation to the funding of people who are boarding out, if he accepts that boarding out is a good idea, that it should be a definite aspect of the geriatric care provided by health boards and that there will be many individuals who will need full maintenance in a boarding out environment. Will he ensure that all those who require full maintenance will get it and what concrete mechanisms will he put in place to ensure that that is provided?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The philosophy of this Minister and the Government is that ideally people should be able to live out their lives in their own homes and, where necessary, there should be support systems in place by the health boards. Indeed this is happening to an increasing extent as witnessed by the improvements following this year's budget.  Where people cannot live out their lives in their <Col N="1521" /> own homes &mdash; I have often referred to this matter &mdash; the great carers in Irish society are their families who are also entitled to some support.  Again that was recongised in the budget and a number of these people qualify for the new carer's allowance which is being implemented by my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods.  The health boards have obligations to ensure support systems.  There is a community care systems in place and it is being developed. Naturally we would like to see it developing more rapidly but certainly it is going in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier today during Question Time to my desire to see more places available for respite care whereby the elderly would be placed in care for a few weeks, perhaps during the summer, so that the carers would be able to go on holiday.  These are very desirable developments.  The vast majority of our elderly either live in their own homes or with their families and that is something we should cherish.  It is what the elderly want and indeed what each of us would like when we are old.</P>
      <P>If, for one reason or other, people are not able to live in their own homes or with their families, the next recourse is to living in the community.  The local authorities provide homes for the elderly in the community and that is very desirable. Boarding out has taken place to a limited extent.  As I have said, it is very desirable that the elderly who are unable to live in their own homes or who have no families to look after them are able to live in their own community, and boarding out is ideal for people to whom it is suited.  Obviously some people are dependent in the sense that they need nursing home care, while others are able to look after themselves but for one reason or other cannot continue to live in their own homes.  I would be very supportive of boarding out for the persons I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the subvention, at present <Col N="1522" /> the elderly pay £20 out of their old age pension and the health boards pay £25, and I think that is a fair balance.  Where none of these facilities are available to an elderly person for one reason or other &mdash; perhaps because of their infirmity &mdash; long-stay residential care in a nursing home or in one of the State's homes for the elderly would be appropriate but that should be a last resort because most of us would want to live in our own community and with our own people for as long as possible.  We are fully supportive of boarding-out. It is important that we should and I am glad that for the first time we are legislating to put a proper structure on the boarding-out facility.  The amendments I am proposing are purely drafting amendments to make more clear what was envisaged in the original text of the Bill.  If Deputies read the original text &mdash; I do not want to go back over it again &mdash; they will see that it could be construed in one or two different ways.  Is it not clear and in order to spell out what we envisage we are proposing these amendments.</P>

It is probably sensible to allow a person being boarded out &mdash; if the person so desires and if it is the most appropriate and most suitable thing to do &mdash; the scope to move across a county line or a boundary if that is in the best interest of the person being boarded out.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (2), to delete lines 3 to 5 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii) the making of payments, and the amounts thereof, by health boards to persons in respect of the boarding out with them of persons under this section,</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to allow the regulations which govern boarding-out to provide for a maximum number of <Col N="1526" /> persons who may be boarded out in any one household.  The draft boarding-out regulations which have been circulated provide for a maximum of four persons in a household and also that the number to be accommodated in shared rooms must not exceed that agreed with the health board.

      <P>I am seeking clarification because I am not sure what is the Minister's intention in subsection (3) which states:</P>
      <P>A dwelling in which a person is boarded out under this section shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, not to be a nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does that mean once a person is boarded-out, it does not matter how many there are in the nursing home it would not be deemed to be a nursing home and it would not come under the regulations we have enacted here or is it that only one person can be boarded out.  Either interpretation would be extreme.  If a person is boarded out in a house, no matter what other activities are going on in the house, it could not come within the scope of the regulations; in other words, there could be a house operating as a nursing home which would take in someone to be boarded-out in a section of it.  If say, it was a family home with an extension that was a nursing home would it be precluded from being encompassed under the terms of this legislation?  Alternatively, if two people were boarded out to the house &mdash; or four as envisaged in the Minister's regulations &mdash; would that not come under the terms of this legislation?  I am seeking clarification on that point and perhaps <Col N="1527" /> the Minister would set me straight at this late hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Boarding out is intended as an approach for the frail, elderly persons who cannot live completely independently and it enables them to live in their own community.  I have proposed an amendment to subsection (5) which will clarify the role of boarding-out as not catering for dependent persons. In the draft boarding out regulations the maximum number of persons who can be maintained in a household is four; normally it would be one to two persons, as is the case at present.  By setting the maximum a little higher it permits flexibility where necessary.  I believe it must remain a flexible approach.</P>

      <P>A dwelling in which a person is boarded out under this section shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, not to be a nursing home.</P>
      <P>If more than one person is involved is it deemed to be a nursing home or is the phrase &ldquo;a person&rdquo; a legal phrase that encompasses any number of persons?</P>

Nursing Homes have expressed a fear that four, five or six people will be boarded out in private dwellings where the people concerned will provide the same services as those provided in nursing homes but under the heading of boarding out and therefore will be exempt under this Bill.  The nursing homes want the number restricted to two at most.  The Minister has mentioned a figure of four, so I think the matter <Col N="1528" /> needs to be clarified.

      <P>I will examine that suggestion before Report Stage.  It should be made quite clear that there is a definition of what constitutes a nursing home and what constitutes boarding out.  It comes down to a question of the dependency of the person concerned and their needs.  Naturally, we want to ensure that the premises where people are being boarded out does not become a cheap nursing home.  That is not our intention and the differences in the requirements and criteria with regard to admission to a nursing home and boarding out in a private dwelling are clearly defined. Draft boarding out regulations have been circulated.</P>

      <P>The undertones to this amendment are the same as those underlying the previous amendment.  Nursing homes have expressed a fear that if more and more people are boarded out fewer people will seek access to nursing homes.  Therefore I suggest that nothing in the operation of this section should affect a person's eligibility for assistance under section 7 of the Bill.  Furthermore, a person who has been boarded out should not be precluded from being considered by the geriatric assessment team in the area if they wish to gain access to a nursing home. This would safeguard the rights of those who at one time were happy to be boarded out but who are no longer so happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully accept there is nothing in the Bill which would preclude a person from being assessed it is important to allay people's fears and to <Col N="1530" /> make things clear &mdash; that is what we should be about in forming legislation &mdash; that this positive statement be included. I ask the Minister to think again and I am sure he would have no objection to including it.  He has already indicated that it is not necessary &mdash; a phrase we have heard frequently tonight &mdash; but I would ask him in this instance to think again as it is necessary to state positively that someone who has been boarded out has the option to change should they so wish. I ask him to include the amendment as it is an excellent one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has used the phrase &ldquo;is not necessary&rdquo; many times but with respect that is only his opinion.  A CEO might well say to Mrs. Murphy that he has met his obligations by providing her with boarding out accommodation while the person who may say to the director of community care that he would prefer to go to a nursing home might be told in reply that the director of community care has discharged his responsibilities. Therefore it is important, without interfering with the services being provided, that the position be made quite clear and that this amendment which would draw a demarcation line between the two, be inserted.  I intend to press the Minister on this point because, at worst, it does not infringe on what he is trying to do while at the same time the health boards, to whom the Bill will be circulated and who will seek to implement it in a few months' time, would know exactly where they stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general principle that it is wrong to put sections in legislation if there is no need for them.  If the Deputy has found anything in the legislation which would preclude the board from giving assistance or preclude the person from applying for assistance under section 7 of the Bill then I would certainly be glad to look at it but there is nothing in the legislation which precludes a person from applying for a subvention <Col N="1531" /> under section 7.  Indeed, a very good boarding out scheme is already in place in County Mayo where the board assume full responsibility for ensuring that accommodation is available for the person no longer considered suitable for boarding out.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the category of person suitable for boarding out and the category of person who should have a nursing home place available to them.  There is an obligation on the board to ensure that they are not grant aiding a person in a boarding house who ought to be in a nursing home and if a person is a dependent person, within the meaning of this Bill, there would be an obligation on the health board to find a place for them in a nursing home rather than in a boarding house.  That person would be fully entitled to apply for a subvention under section 7 of the Bill.  Therefore I see no reason why we should consider inserting this amendment in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the points made for and against inserting the amendment and while I do not want to adjudicate on the matter it seems reasonable that we should make provision that nothing in the operation of this section should affect a person's eligibility for assistance under section 7.  Subsection (5) states that the person to whom this section applies, in relation to a health board, means a dependent person whose usual place of residence is in the functional area of the board, and who, in the opinion of the board, ought, having regard to his means and circumstances, to be boarded out under this section and who consents to be so boarded out.  It is good that such a reference is contained in the Bill.  There is a danger where a person does not give his consent that somebody will get fairly thick and say that they have discharged their obligations and for this reason I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked me to indicate if I found any provision in the <Col N="1532" /> Bill under which someone who has been boarded out would lose their rights under section 7 of the Bill.  I remind him of the first sentence in section 7 (1) which reads: &ldquo;Where, following an assessment by a health board of the dependency of a dependent person and of his means and circumstances, the health board is of opinion that the person is in need of maintenance in a nursing home...&rdquo;. The health board could well argue that the assessment of the dependency of the person meant the person was suitable for boarding out and not suitable for going into a nursing home, that it is entirely at the discretion of the health board and that the health board would be quite within their rights to say, &ldquo;This assessment led us to section 11 which entitles us to press this for you&rdquo;.  Therefore, you could have a dispute.  In those circumstances it could well be necessary to have a statement to the effect that section 11 of the Bill provides that boarding out does not take one iota from a person's right to be considered for a nursing home. This is more than an academic exercise and it is very necessary to put it in.  Time is running out rapidly.  Therefore I suggest, Sir, that you put the question, unless the Minister is prepared to reconsider in view of the strong arguments put to him.</P>

      <P>No, I am not prepared to reconsider.  In his last contribution the Deputy is suggesting that if this amendment was inserted it would provide the opportunity for the person to transfer from a boarding house to a nursing home. That is not the case.  The Deputy stated that the board might decide that the person should remain in the boarding house.  If the board made that decision, then being eligible for assistance under section 7, whether written into the Bill or not, would not improve the person's position.  The person would have to be eligible for the nursing home before section 7 could come into play.</P>

      <P>If some genius, some cost <Col N="1533" /> control manager in the health board said, &ldquo;It is only £25 a week to put someone on boarding out and the subvention is £50 a week; we could save £X00,000 by switching people from nursing homes to boarding out,&rdquo; this would be the greatest thing that ever happened and it would make financial sense from that person's point of view.  It could well be argued that there would be a cost implication in one option over another.  Putting forward a positive option on boarding out would not take from someone's established right to a nursing home subvented bed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would not redress that situation if it were to come about, but there is an obligation on the board to have regard to this legislation and a person who should be in a nursing home cannot be placed in a boarding house.  That will be the legislation when this Bill is enacted.  The health boards will be the first to have to obey the legislation and I have no doubt they all will do so.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;A health board shall promote the option of boarding out for dependent persons, as an option between institutional care and subvention in a nursing home.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>A number of boards already have boarding out schemes in <Col N="1534" /> operation.  I have referred to the Western Health Board.  The inclusion in the Bill of the provisions concerning boarding out will allow health boards to use the boarding out option more extensively.  It is a form of support for the frail elderly as recommended in <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i>.  It is an option which can be used by health boards as they consider appropriate.  Boarding out is not an option between institutional care and subvention in a nursing home.  It is an option of care to maintain a frail but elderly person in a domestic environment and in the person's own community.  I do not consider this amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>Not for the first time today I agree with the Minister.  Boarding out is a good option but it will not have a huge impact around the country.  I would be reluctant to allow legislation to have enshrined in it an obligation on health boards to promote a particular option.  Many people simply will not suit boarding out.  It should be available as an option for those who want it, who feel it is desirable and can fund it, but I favour the Minister's view that we should not enshrine the positive promotion of it in the legislation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of his Private Notice Question regarding the imminent strike at FÁS. That is in order.  Deputy O'Sullivan has some ten minutes to present his case and the Minister some five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for allowing me to raise this very urgent and important matter.  I am aware that discussions did take place today between SIPTU and FÁS in an effort to resolve this threatened dispute. It would be in everyone's interests if the solutions could be found before pickets were placed and attitudes harden on both sides.  I have no doubt that the Minister is well aware of the likely course of events should staff members fail to report for work on Monday next.  Is the Minister in a position to report progress on the matter or, better still, can he inform the House that the matter has been resolved?</P>
      <P>This dispute arises from an agreement which dates back to 1987 in which SIPTU sought the implementation of a preferential buy-back agreement which involved former AnCO employees who were transferred to FÁS.  The union also sought a guarantee for the continuance of the AnCO superannuation scheme and that all benefits of that scheme would be paid in full.  I do feel that it would be unjust if former employees of AnCO were offered conditions which were less favourable than those which they enjoyed prior to 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years several pieces of legislation were passed in this House which guaranteed security of tenure to workers who were transferred from one authority to another.  One which springs to mind and which I was very much involved in myself was the Posts and Telecommunications Act which guaranteed to workers who are now in An Post and <Col N="1543" /> Telecom Éireann standards of income and protection of the rights they enjoyed with the Post Office.</P>
    <P>The action now proposed cannot in any way be described as wild cat action as the decision to strike was taken following lengthy discussions within the union followed by a secret ballot which instructed union headquarters to declare strike action and called on members to cease work at normal finishing time on Friday next, 8 June and to report for picket duty on Monday next, 11 June, at normal starting time for work.</P>
    <P>If a solution is not found before the weekend there will be widespread disruption of services provided by FÁS. First it will affect directly all FÁS trainees, 11,000 people throughout the country who are now involved in social employment schemes.  Payments to those categories will be delayed and disrupted. Training of apprentices will be disrupted which could do long-term damage to many of the young people who are now being trained under the aegis of FÁS.  It will have a still more damaging affect on those who are unemployed and currently seeking employment.  It will also disrupt external courses now being run by statutory bodies such as vocational education committees and private sub-contractors &mdash; these are being carried on at locations outside FÁS premises right across the country.  Finally, 2,000 people now face the possibility of being out on the street on Monday next.</P>
    <P>Since I asked for this Adjournment earlier today I have been informed that negotiations were in progress and I believe they are still ongoing.  I would like to assure the Minister that he has my best wishes for a successful outcome to these discussions, but should the present discussions fail to resolve this dispute I would ask the Minister to have the matter referred to the Labour Court without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy O'Sullivan <Col N="1544" /> for his constructive and helpful comments. I would not quibble with most of the details he outlined as being the history of the dispute.  I share the Deputy's concern at the consequences of the proposed strike by FÁS staff for trainees and participants in the various employment schemes.  In an effort to bring about a conclusion to the outstanding AnCO superannuation issues, protracted discussions between officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and FÁS have been ongoing.  Today FÁS held discussions with the unions concerned and while difficulties still arise and were identified I am hopeful that it may still be possible to secure the agreement of the unions to withdraw or at least defer the proposed action.  I am aware that the board of FÁS will also consider this matter at its monthly meeting tomorrow. I understand that there has been some further news on this issue in the last hour or so and I understand discussions are still continuing.  In view of this, and given the delicate stage of the discussions, I consider that it would be unhelpful for me to engage in public debate on this matter now.  Accordingly I do not propose to make further comment.</P>

      <P>I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue and for confirming that persistence does pay in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A serous situation has arisen with regard to Saint Helen's Senior National School in Portmarnock.  The local parish priest, Fr. Brendan Heffernan, has received a civil bill from the contractors who built that school in 1985, John Whelan Limited and he has been asked to enter an appearance in the court to say why he should not pay the outstanding moneys to Mr. Whelan.  The amount is £13,118.16.  The parish priest has now been forced into taking on a solicitor and entering an appearance against this claim and at the same time he has joined the <Col N="1545" /> Department of Education with him in this court appearance for which as yet no date has been set.</P>
    <P>Saint Helen's Senior National School is a national school in Portmarnock with 599 pupils and one special education class.  When the school was built in 1985 it was very special in the locality of Malahide and Portmarnock because it was the first ever facility provided for special education for junior pupils.  The school was put out to tender.  An architect was taken on board and plans were prepared. The project was approved and the contract awarded to John Whelan Limited by the Department of Education; they were the lower tenderer at the time.  Part of the approval for the go ahead for the commencement of this project involved the immediate upfront payment by the school of £87,000 which was what is called the local contribution, representing one-tenth of the cost of the project.  On top of this £87,000 an agreement was reached with the Department of Education that the school could extend the general purposes room provided they themselves found the additional money. That was estimated to be approximately £32,000.  So, on top of the £87,000 the local contribution was another £32,000 to allow for the extension to the general purposes room.  The reason I am making this clear is out of fear that at some stage the Minister might tell me that these outstanding moneys had anything to do with that general purposes extension.  It does not and the school authorities have told me that they paid that money to the builder.</P>
    <P>The school was occupied in June 1985 and, sometime afterwards, the architects final certificate was lodged with the Department.  It indicated, among other things, that the project had been very cost effective.  The Department did not query anything on the final certificate.  In fact, they made two substantial payments to the school authorities who, in turn, <Col N="1546" /> paid off some of the outstanding bills. For the next year or so the Department continued to pay off small amounts of the outstanding moneys.  Problems arose when the Department in 1987 or early 1988 sent their inspector to make what could be described as the final inspection of the school.  A list of minor repairs needed in the mechanical and electrical areas was prepared by the Department's inspector.  The Department wrote to the priest who was dealing with the matter, Fr. Lloyd, detailing the works that needed to be carried out before the final payment would be made.  The final paragraph of that letter stated that a sum equal to the outstanding works, estimated at between £2,500 and £3,000, would be withheld until such time as the Department were satisfied that the works had been completed.</P>
    <P>When the school authorities approached the contractor, and the sub-contractors to have those defects remedied neither the contractor nor the sub-contractors would undertake the work because they were owed money.  At that stage the architect was owed £6,000, the structural engineers were owed £2,564 and the quantity surveyor was also owed money.  The building was owed £13,000. The local priest had been in touch with the Department telling them about the hiccup and he asked if money would be paid towards those bills so that the work could be completed.  It was very embarrassing and stressful for him last year when the contractor, and sub-contractors, telephoned him and wrote to him demanding payment.  They made allegations about non-payment in the matter.</P>
    <P>Rev. Fr. Heffernan wrote to the Minister in March this year and I tabled a question on the issue in that month.  The parish priest wrote a cordial letter to the Minister and gave details of the outstanding debts on the school and on the other national school in Portmarnock, St. Marnock's which the Minister opened. However, the parish priest did not receive an acknowledgment from the Department.  In the reply to my question on 21 March the Minister indicated that <Col N="1547" /> there was a small amount of money outstanding and that the file would be examined with a view to paying the balance of the grant due to the school authorities at the earliest possible date.  I assumed that that meant that an official was working on the file but when I contacted the priest about six weeks later he told me that the Department had not been in touch with him and he had not received an acknowledgment of his letter.</P>
    <P>On 22 May the parish priest wrote to the Minister informing her that a civil bill had been served on him and that it was his intention to join the Department of Education in the action.  As he stated in his letter, &ldquo;the Department of Education will be in the dock with me&rdquo;.  Will the Minister agree, that at no stage did the Department raise any query about outstanding payments?  When the final certificate from the architect was submitted the Department did not say there was a dispute involved or that the amount was too high.  The school authorities were not given the impression that the money might not be paid.  The local contribution has been paid and, as far as the school management is concerned, the Department owe the money to the contractor who, in turn, is being sued by sub-contractors who have not been paid.  If there is a problem about the money owed to the contractor why is it that it has not been raised with the parish priest in an effort to sort the matter out?  It is surprising that there was no response to the letter from the priest and that my question did not stimulate action from the Department.  The Minister, and her Department, may end up in the dock with the parish priest and I should like to appeal to her to pay the amount of money owed and finish the deal.  The school was completed five years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware of the situation in relation to the accounts for this building school project. The school referred to by the Deputy was built in two phases under the aegis of an <Col N="1548" /> architect in private practice engaged by the school authorities.  The contract in cases like this is entered into with the builder by the chairman of the school board of management who is responsible for all payments.  The role of the Department is the payment of the grant at an agreed level on the basis of certificates from the project architect and following payment of the full local contribution. All the grants relating to the first phase of the project have been fully paid.  The second phase, the one in question, was a major project consisting of 18 classrooms, a general purpose room and full ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Department approved the placing of the contract on 21 November 1983 and the final account for the project was submitted by the school's consultants in May 1987.  Two substantial instalments of grant have been paid to the school authorities following initial examination of the final account documentation.  The Department have received a number of representations from the school authorities in this matter.  While I am not at liberty to divulge the financial details of any school project to outside parties I would like to set the financial situation of this case in context.  The amount of grant stated by the school authorities to be owing to them is not much more than 1 per cent of the overall cost of the project. The examination of final accounts, and the relevant professional fee accounts, is more time consuming than is generally understood.  Extras and variations have to be checked and validated from the point of view of grant eligibility. Furthermore, inspections of the school buildings and the installations must be carried out.  Indeed, the inspection by the Department's engineer revealed a large number of defects and omissions in the mechanical and electrical installations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the school's problems and therefore I have arranged that the examination of all the final account documentation in relation to this phase of the project be completed as a matter of <Col N="1549" /> urgency with a view to paying whatever balance or grant is due to the school authorities with the minimum of delay. When the final payment is being made a full explanatory statement of the grant position will be issued to the school authorities. I have taken note of the point made by the Deputy that this has gone <Col N="1550" /> on for a long period but I hope she appreciates that difficulties arose, some of which she was not aware of.  I will endeavour to have the final payments made as quickly as possible.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if it is his intention to change the law requiring couples, who have adopted a child in another country in accordance with the laws of that country, to also apply to adopt the child under Irish law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legal obligation on persons who have adopted a child abroad to have the child adopted under Irish law. However, some foreign countries attach a condition to their adoption decrees that the child be adopted under the laws of his &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; country.  In other cases, the adopters themselves seek to have the child adopted under Irish law so as to avoid any future difficulties about their parental rights in relation to the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In either case, the adoption application must be processed in accordance with the usual requirements of the Adoption <Col N="1310" /> Acts.  There are no special legal provisions in relation to children adopted abroad nor are there any statutory procedures for the automatic recognition of foreign adoptions.  I am advised that unless the child is adopted under our own legislation, an adoption effected abroad will only be recognised by the courts here if the adopters were domiciled in the country where the adoption was made at the time of its making.</P>
    <P>I believe that it would be desirable to introduce a greater degree of certainty in this area by setting out in legislation the circumstances in which adoptions made abroad would be recognised here.  This is not an easy area in which to legislate involving as it does complex questions of private international law.  The Law Reform Commission have undertaken a study in this area and published their &ldquo;Report on the Recognition of Foreign Adoption Decrees&rdquo; in May 1989.  Their main recommendation is that legislation should be enacted giving the Minister for Health power to designate countries whose adoption orders would be recognised in Ireland.  I would have to emphasise, however, that even if the commission's recommendations were implemented they would not provide for the recognition of orders where the adopters were neither domiciled nor resident for any significant period of time in the country where the adoption was effected as, for example, is the case in relation to recent adoptions by Irish people in Romania.</P>
    <P>It is generally acknowledged that the question of inter-country adoption can only be dealt with at an international level.  The Hague Conference on Private International Law has arranged a conference on inter-country adoption in the Hague from 11-12 June 1990 with a view to developing an agreed international approach to the question.  The conference will be attended by delegates from countries around the world and representatives of my Department and of the Law Reform Commission will also be in attendance.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress has been made in combating the drug abuse problem in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of services available for drug treatment has increased significantly.  An outreach programme, operated by the <Col N="1316" /> Eastern Health Board, aimed at intravenous drug abusers is working successfully and the board have opened a community based drop-in centre for intravenous drug abusers in the south inner city of Dubin.  A similar centre is being developed for the north side of the city.  The Drugs Advisory and Treatment Centre in Pearse Street, Dublin 2 with associated inpatient detoxification facilities at Beaumont Hospital are providing services for over 3,500 attendances per annum.  A number of voluntary agencies are also providing services for drug abusers in the Dublin area and these receive significant State funding from the Eastern Health Board, either directly or through the national lottery.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between the State agencies at both national and local level towards reducing both the supply of and demand for drugs in Dublin city has intensified and this has resulted in an increasing number of persons charged with drug offences.  A total of 1,344, of which 1,073 were in the Dublin area were charged with drug offences in 1989 as compared with 594 in 1979.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are also playing a major role in prevention and control of the misuse of drugs.  Permanent units of the drug squad are operating in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  Over 3,000 members of the force have completed a special intensive training course designed to ensure that each Garda division has a substantial number of members with advance training in the prevention and detection of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The Misuse of Drugs Regulations relating to the possession, supply, import and export of controlled drugs, were updated in 1988 notably in relation to prescription writing and dispensing requirements with a view to curbing the &ldquo;street&rdquo; availability of drugs of abuse.</P>
    <P>The position is being kept under continuous review and as the Deputy may be aware I have recently reconstituted the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drugs to make recommendations on any further action necessary in the context of drawing up a National Plan on Drug Abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> The Deputy will be aware that it is difficult to estimate the number of users of illicit drugs in Dublin and that any figures quoted represent a trend rather than an absolute figure.  The Health Research Board have just completed a pilot project aimed at establishing the incidence of drug abuse in the greater Dublin area, based on the first demand for treatment by drug abusers.  This project established that a total of 336 persons attended for treatment for the first time during the month of August 1989.</P>
    <P>The statistics from the Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre show that 1,001 persons attended the centre during 1989. The drugs being abused by these people were as follows &mdash; multiple abuse in certain cases: heroin 513, morphine 461, diconal 27, palfium 25, temgesic, 149, DF118 249, methadone 109, minor tranquillisers 483, cough mixtures 36, alochol 301, solvents 8, cocaine 29, cannabis 392, amphetamines 42, barbiturates 12, magic mushrooms 2, crack 1 (a US visitor) and LSD 5.</P>
    <P>The national co-ordinating committee are at present examining how the existing data base can be expanded to provide more accurate annual data on drug abuse and, as far as is practicable, to assess the level of drug abuse among persons who do not present for treatment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>There appears to be a great deal of confused thinking about the circumstances in which medical cards are granted.  The position is that medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable without undue hardship to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  While annual income is of obvious relevance, other factors such as family size, capital available and so on must also be taken into account.  Income guidelines are made available to chief executive officers largely to ensure a uniformity of approach throughout the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I am sure the Deputies will appreciate that each individual case must be investigated to determine whether or not a person can arrange general practitioner services without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, I have already announced my intention to set up a medical card appeals system and the necessary administrative and legislative arrangements are currently being actively pursued in my Department.  When this system is in place any person who feels aggrieved in relation to a decision not to grant a medical card can have the problem addressed under the appeals procedures.</P>

    <P>The Health Research Board, which is a statutory independent body established to promote, assist, commission or conduct medical, health and health services research, is funding a two year research project at the Rotunda and Temple Street Hospitals which is investigating the pathology of placenta associated with sudden infant death syndrome.  The project received £15,000 in 1989 and £20,000 this year.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the important role of the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association, I have given the association a grant of £5,800 in 1990 towards the costs of printing its booklet on sudden infant death.  In that regard a request for a grant of approximately £6,000 is currently under consideration by my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition an annual grant of £1,000 is paid by the Eastern Health Board to the association to enable it to carry on its various activities, which include counselling and supporting families affected.</P>
    <P>Information on the incidence of sudden infant death is currently published by the Central Statistics Office on a quarterly and annual basis in its Report on Vital Statistics and is widely available.</P>
    <P>Following a proposal from the scientific sub-committee of the Irish Sudden Infant Death Association, I have agreed to investigate the feasibility of establishing a sudden infant death register which will provide additional epidemiological data. The scope of data collected by the CSO is being examined to determine the potential of such a register.  The question of funding will be considered in due course.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of Ireland's signing in 1978 of the WHO Alma Aba Declaration which stated that primary health care was the key to attaining health for all by the year 2000, and called on all Governments to formulate national strategies, policies and plans for action to launch and sustain primary health care as part of a comprehensive health service, he is satisfied with the Government's commitment to primary health care; if he considers that the financial provision for community and primary care is adequate to reach the target as set out in this WHO declaration; if he will outline the Government's commitment to primary health care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I place considerable importance on the concept of primary health care, which is <Col N="1327" /> central to the World Health Organisation programme, &ldquo;Health for All by the Year 2000&rdquo;.  Primary health care is not confined to medical care and curing but also encompasses prevention, health promotion, rehabilitation and personal social services.  I am continuing my efforts to develop primary and community care and to make the services more responsive to real needs.  While accepting the reality of a continuing role for other levels of care.  At the same time, effective planning and management arrangements are being reviewed to provide an integrated network of complementary services to meet measured health needs in the population.</P>
      <P>I consider general practice to be a key element in meeting the Government's commitment to the reorientation of the health services towards a more efficient delivery of care at the primary care level in the community, with a consequential lessening of the demand upon acute hospital services.  I have taken steps to strengthen the capacity of the general practitioner service and to forge better links with the other community based services and the hospital system.</P>
      <P>A number of important initiatives have also taken place in the context of health promotion.  Much of the premature illness and death in our society e.g. from cardiovascular disease, cancer, accidents, is linked to unhealthy behaviour and lifestyle &mdash; to such factors as smoking, alcohol abuse, unhealthy diet, stress, lack of exercise.  At the beginning of 1988 the Government put in place a new Health Promotion Structure.  A wide variety of health promotion projects are in train to reduce the toll of avoidable deaths and illness from accidents, alcohol, smoking, and diet, including the Kilkenny Health Project, the measles, mumps and rubella campaign, the anti-smoking campaign, the issue of an updated information booklet on AIDS and the development of a Drink Awareness for Youth Programme in co-operation with the National Youth Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A range of community based facilities <Col N="1328" /> such as day hospitals, day centres, supported hostels and community residences have been developed and put in place.</P>
    <P>Another area of the health services which has undergone fundamental change is the psychiatric service where the delivery of the service has changed from an institutional base to a community setting.  A greater number of people with psychiatric problems are now living more meaningful lives in the community.</P>
    <P>These specific developments will build on the framework of a rationalised and integrated health care service which has been developing over the last few years. It will enable us to carry forward the strategy already marked out in such areas as mental health, mental handicap and services for the elderly.</P>
    <P>Community care has increased to 26 per cent of total health expenditure in 1990 from 20 per cent in 1980.  The average annual increase in community care expenditure in the period 1980 - 1990 has been 11 per cent.  Tangible evidence of the commitment to orderly development was given in the budget when the Government made additional resources available for priority needs in mental handicap, services for the elderly and in the dental services.  For example, half of the £5 million additional allocation to services for the elderly is being used to help strengthen home care, including home nursing and home help support.  The remainder of the allocation will be used for such matters as the provision of more facilities for increased day care and additional nursing home &mdash; places for heavily dependent elderly people, thus bringing well earned relief to many caring individuals and families.  A new carer's allowance worth £45 per week, will be introduced later in the year.  This progress in the development of community and primary health care will be maintained in future years.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="1331" /> presume the Deputy is referring to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of F <i>v</i>.  The Superintendent of Ballymun Garda Station and the Eastern Health Board.  I have studied the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice O'Flaherty and comments made by the Chief Justice.  In his judgment, Mr. Justice O'Flaherty provides an authoritative interpretation of the Place of Safety provisions of the Children Act, 1908, in particular those provisions which empower the Garda in certain circumstances to intervene without warrant and place children at risk in care.</P>
      <P>The interpretation which has been given accords with what had been the understanding of my Department and the health boards and it will be of considerable value in removing doubts and uncertainties which had crept in since an earlier judgment in the same case in the High Court late last year.</P>
      <P>However, contrary to newspaper reports, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice O'Flaherty did not refer to the question of legal aid for children but did comment on the desirability of there being some procedure available to enable a child involved in care and custody proceedings to be granted legal representation in his or her own right.</P>
      <P>This is something that is being addressed by the Law Reform Commission in the context of its examination of the law in relation to child sexual abuse.  The need for such provision will be considered by the Government in the light of the commission's final report on the subject, which is expected shortly. The views of the Supreme Court in this regard will be taken into account in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mortality and morbidity data clearly demonstrate that heart disease and cancers are major contributors to premature illness and death.  Causative factors are multifaceted &mdash; environmental, social and lifestyle.  In addressing such factors a broadly based and intersectoral approach is required which incorporates not only health education and information but also seeks to create an environment that support healthy behaviour.</P>
      <P>Specifically in relation to the lifestyle factors, many studies demonstrate that the lifestyle of many middle aged persons places them at risk of premature death from heart disease and certain cancers. Lifestyle risk factors include smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, badly managed stress and alcohol misuse. Reduction in these risk factors are being addressed in a variety of settings including occupational, educational and community. My Department together with statutory and voluntary agencies are involved in a range of health promotion initiatives at national and local levels which address the major lifestyle factors to which I have referred.  For example, the health promotion unit have been active over the past number of years in co-ordinating activities associated with Ireland's participation in the EC cancer programme, the objective of which is to reduce cancer deaths by 15 per cent by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>My Department have a co-ordinated strategy of legislation and education to reduce the incidence of smoking in the community.  I propose extending the scope of the regulations which I made recently restricting and prohibiting smoking in public places.  In this context I intend meeting with trade unions and employers to discuss how such regulations might be applied in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> Community based programmes such as the Kilkenny health project aim to reduce premature illness and death from cardiovascular disease.  This particular programme is receiving the bulk of its funding from my Department.  In addition, my Department, through the health promotion unit, are supporting the piloting of a programme on healthy life styles which can be tailored for use in occupational settings.</P>
    <P>In addition a variety of projects are in train to reduce the toll in illness and death which alcohol takes in our society.  These include the development of a national policy on alcohol under the aegis of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion. On an on-going basis a wide variety of educational materials is available from the health promotion unit and from local health boards.  These are frequently distributed in the context of occupational/health education programmes. I would give every encouragement to employers and trade unions to provide health education programmes in the workplace with the appropriate professional input.</P>
    <P>On a wider front the health promotion unit are at present developing a broad national plan for health promotion to which the role of health boards will be intrinsically linked.  A research project funded by my Department in support of this initiative is under way.  This project concerns the potential of a community based model such as the Kilkenny health project for positively influencing lifestyle and the implications of organising such a programme on a national basis within the existing care delivery structures.</P>

    <P>As regards the disposal of old map stocks, the Survey are currently engaged in efforts to alleviate accommodation problems.

Much of these have become unsaleable due to storage and handling difficulties.</P>
    <P>The old system for meeting demand for maps system was inefficient, costly and labour intensive and was replaced some eight years ago by a &ldquo;printing on demand&rdquo; service.  This is in effect a photocopying process using one master copy for each sheet and large format photocopying machines.  This eliminated the need to keep numerous copies in stock.</P>

      <P>Export sales relief for corporate profits terminated on 5 April 1990. It was an inherent part of the incentive that the tax exemption applied not only to the corporate profits involved but also to the dividends distributed from these profits to the shareholders in the companies concerned.  The exemption will continue to apply to such dividends until the pool of export sales relieved profits existing as of 5 April 1990 is used up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A surcharge on the lines proposed by the Deputy would not be appropriate. Section 54 of the 1974 Finance Act includes a safegurad to ensure that companies do not attempt to minimise the tax liability of senior management or other employees by paying them in shares which would attract a tax free dividend rather than a taxable salary.  The section provides that where a person receives no emoluments from a tax relieved company for services rendered by him to that company, or receives emoluments in respect of such services which, in the opinion of the commissioners are not adequate as consideration for the services rendered, <Col N="1342" /> and that person receives tax relieved dividends from that company, the commissioners may deem part or all of the dividends to be emoluments of that person which are taxable in the ordinary way.</P>

The decision not to publish an edition since 1988 was taken in the context of work pressures and priorities applying since then.  However, the question of publishing an updated edition, with some possible improvements in presentation, early in 1991, is under active consideration at present.</P>

      <P>I have no information available to me on the number of people who took early retirement from the Department of Finance and from the Revenue Commissioners and who subsequently took up employment in the private sector.  In respect of the Central Bank, the terms and conditions of appointment of staff employed by them are entirely a matter for the bank.</P>
      <P>On the question of the loss to the private sector of experts trained at public expense, the usual practice where the cost of courses of education pursued by civil servants is met by the State is to require the officers concerned to refund the fees or an appropriate part of them if they leave the service within a specified period of completing the course.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to introduce a regulation prohibiting civil servants resigning from sensitive and important positions from taking up similar positions in the private sector for a specified period.  I would point out, however, that the prohibition on the communication of official information under section 4 of the Official Secrets Act, 1963, applies to persons who have retired from public office in relation to information which they obtained or to which they had access before retirement.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, on the basis of their recently completed return of income, the taxpayers' income for the current year, 1990-91, will exceed the relevant exemption threshold of £7,500. While they are not entitled to exemption from income tax, they are entitled to a measure of marginal relief, as their income does not greatly exceed the threshold.</P>
      <P>Where marginal relief applies, the taxpayer is given an allowance equivalent to the tax exemption limit, which is higher than the normal tax-free allowances, and the highest tax rate of 53 per cent is applied.  The effect of the procedure is to reduce the taxpayer's overall liability for the relevant year.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is in receipt of a retirement pension and a Department of Social Welfare pension. Both pensions are chargeable to tax.  However as the social welfare pension is paid in full without deduction of tax, the tax attributable to it is being collected under PAYE by restriction of his allowances.  The total tax-free allowances due to the taxpayer for the current year have been calculated as £3,052 but this amount is offset in full by the amount of his social welfare pension.  Therefore, tax is payable at Table A, 30 per cent on the full amount of his retirement pension.</P>

      <P>The recent variations in the rates of payments made to the person are due to a revised means assessment which took effect from 2 May 1990 and an adjustment which had to be made from 21 May 1990 because his wife is now also claiming a social welfare payment.

      <P>The extension of the scheme to dependent spouses in 1987 was opposed by the Irish Dental Association, which advised its members not to sign the contract to operate the extended scheme. Last year the association, as part of its continued opposition to the extension of the scheme, called on its members to discontinue providing certain treatments for all insured persons.  As a result, some dentists are imposing charges on patients for extractions, root treatments and dentures.</P>
      <P>Any person who is asked to pay charges which are not due should refuse to do so and report the matter to my Department. There is, however, no provision within the scheme whereby patients who proceed with treatment and pay such charges can be reimbursed.

      <P>Decisions as to the number of gardaí to be allocated to any particular area are based on an assessment by the Garda authorities of the relative policing needs of all areas throughout the State.  Garda personnel deployment strategies are constantly reviewed to ensure that resources are assigned to where they are most needed at any given time.</P>
      <P>The first group of new Garda trainees who became attested to the force on 2 June are being allocated to stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Area because this is where, in the professional police judgment of the Garda authorities, the greatest need for their services exists.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that full consideration is being and will continue to be given to the policing needs of Cork city.  In particular, the needs of the Cork area will be considered, along with the needs of all other areas, as further trainees complete their initial training and become full members of the force.</P>

      <P>I have studied the report of the Catholic Social Service Council relating to substance abuse in the Dublin Diocese and I am concerned there is available to the Department a data base which will give accurate information relating to the incidence of drug abuse.  Such a system is currently being developed as part of the anti-drug strategy of my Department. The Health Research Board has just completed a scientifically-based pilot project aimed at establishing the incidence of drug abuse in the greater Dublin area, based on the first demand for treatment by drug abusers.  This project established that a total of 336 persons attended for treatment for the first time during the month of August 1989.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to expand the data base to provide accurate, annual data on drug abuse, and as far as is practicable, to assess the level of drug abuse among persons who do not present for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 23 today, preventative treatment and <Col N="1372" /> rehabilitation services are being provided for drug abusers by a range of State and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>However, the Deputy will be interested to hear that I have reconstituted the national co-ordinating committee on drugs and have asked it to examine the services currently being provided and to report to me on the components for a national plan to control drug abuse.</P>

      <P>I would like to state that ENT services will be available in all major acute general hospitals which service the Dublin and Eastern Health Board area.  It is the Department's policy that specialised services such as ENT should be located on a general hospital campus.  In accordance with this policy it is proposed to transfer ENT services currently based at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital to appropriate general hospitals in the Dublin area.  This proposal is consistent with Comhairle na nOspidéal's report on ENT services.  Part of the ENT services based at the Royal Victoria Hospital have been relocated to the Midland Health Board area.  It is intended to relocate the remaining ENT services to the regional ENT unit which will be based primarily at St. James's Hospital, with a provision <Col N="1378" /> for paediatric ENT services at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin.</P>
      <P>The present number of ENT beds at the Eye and Ear Hospital is 37.  Replacement ENT beds will be situated at St. James's Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin.  The number of ENT beds provided at these locations will be a matter for discussion with the hospital authorities concerned at the appropriate time.  I can assure the Deputy that ENT services are being fully supported until such time as these services are relocated.</P>

      <P>As indicated in response to a question in this House on 30 January 1990 the provision of anaesthetic services is being kept under review by my Department. My Department have had regular discussions with the Faculty of Anaesthetists and with Comhairle na nOspidéal, the body with statutory responsibility for the regulation of the number and type of consultant staff, about the maintenance and development of the service generally and in particular about means of attracting and retraining consultant anaesthetist staff in smaller units outide the major urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics being compiled by An Comhairle indicated that on 1 May 1990, 24 consultant anaesthetist posts were vacant out of a complement of 171.  These posts have been approved for permanent filling by Comhairle, interviews have already <Col N="1379" /> been held for many of these posts and some offers of appointments have been made.  Many of these vacancies may be filled in a locum capacity.  The above mentioned vacancies would not include more recently vacated posts which have not as yet been processed by Comhairle.</P>
    <P>The registration of persons in the register of medical practitioners maintained by the Medical Council in accordance with the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, is statutorily a matter for the council.  Section 29 of the Act provides for the temporary registration of doctors who qualified outside the European Community and who satisfy the Medical Council as to the adequacy of their training and experience for the efficient practice of medicine.  Subsection (29) (2) of the 1978 Act expressedly limits the aggregate period of such temporary registration to five years.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the 1978 Act provides for full registration including a provision which provides for the full registration of persons who are not otherwise entitled to apply for full registration on the basis of a specified Irish qualification or in accordance with the provisions of European Community Directives.  Section 27 (2) (d) of the Act provides for the full registration of</P>
    <P>A person who satisfies the (Medical) Council that he has undergone such courses of training and passed such examinations as are specified for the purposes of the Section in rules made by the Council.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council have adopted rules in accordance with the provisions of this section in April 1989.  The first examination under the new rules was held in November 1989 and a second examination was held in April 1990.  The judgment in the Supreme Court case referred to by the Deputies confirmed that the means of obtaining full registration for EC nationals who pursued their medical training and obtained qualification outside the European Community is by way of the rules adopted by the Medical Council in accordance with the provisions of section 27 (2) (d) of the <Col N="1380" /> Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  These rules are statutorily a matter for the Medical Council.</P>
    <P>In view of proceedings being taken in the High Court by a number of doctors in respect of registration it would not be appropriate for me to offer further comment on this issue.</P>

      <P>Other additional consultant posts in the hospital are a matter for the NorthEastern Health Board in the first instance having regard to the board's priorities for competing demands in the provision of a health service in their area.</P>
