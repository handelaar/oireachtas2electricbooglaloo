      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is proposed to bring before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas a resolution terminating the state of emergency which was declared by resolution in September, 1939; and, if so, when.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the present very unsettled international situation, I do not consider that this would be an appropriate time for action as suggested in the Question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this declaration of an emergency, which took place in 1939, was for the purpose of securing public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war and armed rebellion and in view of the fact that the time of war is well past this 15 years, surely the Taoiseach will agree that it is only fair and just that such temporary legislation should go by the board?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will take steps to permit marriages validly solemnised before a minister of religion in France, but invalidly completed according to the civil law of that country, to be registered in Ireland as valid marriages in view of the legal disqualifications and other impediments suffered by Irish citizens and their children by reason of the refusal of the French authorities to recognise the validity of such marriages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in the Registration Acts for the registration in this country of marriages solemnised abroad.  Such marriages are normally registered in the country in which they are solemnised.</P>
      <P>The determination of the legality or otherwise of marriages wherever solemnised is not a function of An tÁrd-Chláraitheóir.  Only the Courts are competent to determine whether or not a marriage is valid under the civil law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the marriages referred to in the Question, I understand that in France it is necessary to go through a civil marriage ceremony in order to ensure that a marriage is recognised as legal.  As this requirement does not appear to have been fulfilled in regard to these marriages, they would not be recognised as legal in France.  Furthermore, I understand that it is an offence <Col N="617" /> under French Law for a clergyman to officiate at a church marriage if no civil ceremony has taken place.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's enquiry regarding the registration of such marriages in this country, I would point out that registration in itself would not necessarily secure their validation under civil law.  This, as I have already mentioned, is a matter for determination by the Courts, but even if any difficulty which might arise in this connection were resolved, there would still be a grave risk that the Courts in other countries might hold, if the matter came before them for determination, that such marriages were invalid by reason of their not having been celebrated in accordance with the law of the State in which they were solemnised.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that there are many complex and intricate problems including issues touching on International Law and usage involved in this question.  They have already been the subject of much consideration by the Departments concerned but the examination of the matter has not yet been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that the Drainage Border Schemes Bill has been enacted in Northern Ireland; and whether, in view of this, he will consider expediting plans for the drainage of the Dromore and Fane Rivers in County Monaghan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill referred to does not at present affect the position in regard to these rivers.  The Dromore River forms part of the Erne catchment which is being surveyed with a view to the preparation of a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The Fane catchment is listed for treatment in the drainage programme but is unlikely to be reached for some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it not been one of the difficulties in the past that the Dromore drainage could not be completed <Col N="619" /> without the co-operation of the Northern Ireland authorities in dealing with their part of the catchment and that, heretofore, they were impeded from that co-operation by a flaw in their legislation?  Inasmuch as that flaw now appears to have been removed, would it not be reasonable to anticipate that we would review the placing of the Dromore catchment area in the programme to which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dromore is not affected by the Border problem, to which the Deputy refers.  The Fane is, to some extent.  The main purpose of the legislation now being enacted in the Northern Parliament is to deal with the Flurry.  Reciprocal legislation with regard to the Flurry is not necessary on this side at the present time.  It may be necessary at a later date in connection with the river Fane.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The works foremen referred to were not seconded to my Department in connection with the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme but were formerly employed by the Department on a temporary basis under Section B of the Land Project. As an alternative to terminating their employment, when Section B was discontinued at the end of 1958, the works foremen were assigned to temporary duties under the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, blocking posts appropriate to agricultural officers, Grade 8.  The rate of pay of the works foremen is higher than that of temporary Grade 8 officers engaged on similar duties.  A small number of agricultural officers Grade 6, recruited by means of a competition conducted by the Civil Service Commission, who have been assigned temporarily to urgent duties under the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme receive the remuneration appropriate to their grade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that some of these foremen are doing the same work as agricultural officers, Grade 6, and that we have an anachronistic situation obtaining where two men are doing identical work side by side, one enjoying a substantially higher rate of remuneration than the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained the position in my reply.  There were only a very small number of Grade 6 officers employed in a temporary capacity to meet the urgent needs of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme for a short period.  These Grade 6 officers were recruited, as stated, through a competition conducted by the Civil Service Commission for land reclamation work.  The works foremen to whom the Deputy refers in his Supplementary were recruited on a temporary basis, even when employed on the Land Project, and rather than let them go, as they would have had to do, we found work for them on the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme on a temporary basis.  In the main, they are working along with Grade 8 officers whose pay in fact is less than that being given to these works foremen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But would it not be reasonable to suggest&mdash;we all know the meaning of the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; in the Civil Service and that there are men working for 40 years who are temporary civil servants&mdash;that where foremen are transferred from the now extinguished Part B of the Land Project and find themselves doing identical work with Grade 6 agricultural officers, their rates of remuneration should be equated, at least, for the temporary period for which they are doing the identical work?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>I indicated in my reply to a Question put by Deputy Cosgrave on 23rd November, 1960, that I was not yet in possession of evidence that would warrant a change in my attitude which was to refuse to grant licences for importation, until satisfied that there is a genuine shortage of home-grown oats suitable for feeding to bloodstock. That is still the position.  I am keeping this matter under constant review, with particular regard to the needs of the bloodstock industry.  I will license the importation of oats only as soon as I am satisfied that there is a genuine need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that at a meeting of the Bloodstock Breeders and the National <Col N="624" /> Farmers' Association, the National Farmers' Association agreed that they were not able to produce sufficient quality oats to meet the needs of the bloodstock industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That Supplementary Question seems to be rather similar to one addressed to me by the Deputy last week.  We do not keep such a list. As late as last night, I met people from Donegal who have a fair idea of the position there and the case they made was that there was plenty of good oats there making £20 a ton.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not make inquiries from both the bloodstock owners and the National Farmers' Association and obtain from them the information which I have asked for and further ascertain that it is a fact, as I know it is, that at present there is the gravest danger of three big studs being taken out of the country because the managers cannot be guaranteed a supply of oats? Further, if he will not himself give to the House the list of people with good quality oats, will he speak&mdash;if they are on speaking terms&mdash;to his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and ensure that the Bloodstock Breeders' Association are provided with a list of the people who have quality oats?</P>

      <P>It is not a question of putting pressure on me to give a licence, if I am satisfied that the issue of such a licence would be justified. Last week and on previous occasions. I mentioned some of the interests which are bound up in this, the bloodstock trainers and some other organisation and the oatmeal millers.  Quite a number of their interests have been pressing me and naturally I do not want to deny a licence to these, if I am satisfied, but I am bound to be careful before I issue such a licence. Deputy Tierney from Tipperary tabled a Parliamentary Question last week and Deputies from Donegal have addressed Parliamentary Questions to me also and have written to me to say that the situation in Donegal was as I described it.  In face of all this, while I do not want it to be understood that I am hidebound in this, I do want to be satisfied that the issue of a licence is justified.</P>

      <P>As the pension payments records readily available do not disclose the organisations in which pensionable service was rendered, an examination of all the relevant files, amounting to 13,933 in number, would be necessary in order to ascertain the information asked for by the Deputy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Disability pensions are not awarded under the Military Service Pensions Acts.  I assume, therefore, that the Deputy is referring to awards made under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1960, under which claims for wound and disability pensions are dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that these Acts provide for the award of wound and disability pensions not only in respect of service during the 1916-1923 period in which, presumably, the Deputy is principally interested, but also in respect of service in the Defence Forces since the 1st October, 1923.  It was not possible to compile, within the time available, the total number of pensions awarded under the Army <Col N="633" /> Pensions Acts in each of the years which the Deputy mentions but, if it will help him, I can have these numbers compiled and sent to him in the near future.</P>
    <P>The number of wound and disability pensions at present on pay under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1960, is 1,214 and the cost of such pensions in the financial year ended 31st March, 1960, was £161,474.  In addition, during the same period, dependants' allowances and gratuities amounting to £68,606 were paid under the Acts.</P>

The amounts from that onward are the totals paid under both the 1924 and 1934 Acts and it is not practicable, from available records, to segregate the payments as between the two Acts.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Military Service Pensions Acts: Special Allowances.</Title>
    <P>26.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state in respect of each year since the special allowance was introduced the number of medal holders who are in receipt of the allowances under the Military Service Pensions Acts, and the cost of such allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Special allowances are not payable under the Military Service Pensions Acts.</P>
      <P>I assume therefore that the Deputy is referring to special allowances granted under the Army Pensions Acts and that, in referring to medal holders, he means persons awarded the Service (1917-1921) Medal without Bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compilation, in respect of each year since special allowances were first introduced in 1943, of the total number of such Medal holders who were in receipt of such allowances would involve the individual examination of <Col N="635" /> almost 10,000 files.  I consider that the time and expense involved in this would not be justified.  The Deputy will appreciate that, subject to the various statutory conditions, special allowances may be awarded to military service, disability and Connaught Rangers pensioners as well as to holders of the 1917-1921 Medal without Bar.  The records readily available do not segregate the different classes, nor is this necessary for ordinary administrative purposes.</P>
    <P>A tabular statement showing the number of special allowances on pay on the last day of each financial year from 1943/44 onwards, and the total cost of special allowances in each such financial year, has been prepared.  I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P>STATEMENT showing the number of Special Allowances on pay on the last day of each financial year from 1943-44 onwards and the total cost of Special Allowances in each such financial year.</P>

The 2,800 acres referred to&mdash;known locally as Roxboro Mountain&mdash;were allotted, in 1925, in undivided shares amongst some 80 allottees.  Subsequently, efforts were made by the Land Commission over a period of several years, to obtain from the commonage holders a surrender of their surplus turbary, with a view to its development and allotment, but, as only about half of them would agree to do so, the Land Commission's proposals for development of the bog had to be abandoned.  The commonage shares were vested in the allottees in 1953.</P>

      <P>In line 22, after &ldquo;flooding&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the provision of water supplies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put this amendment down for the sole purpose of getting confirmation of what the Minister for Transport and Power said last week, that is, that C.I.E., as the present owners of the Royal Canal, could not, without further legislation, terminate water supplies to any farmer now receiving supplies from the company.  The Minister said that under the earlier Acts, these water supplies were protected and that C.I.E. would not be able to terminate them.  I have been unable myself to verify that anywhere, and I should like either confirmation from the Minister or the insertion of protection of the water rights in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is no particular significance in the phraseology of the section as it stands in the omission of the reference to water supplies.  The phraseology as it appears in this Bill repeats that which is contained in Section 24, subsection (23), of the Act of 1958, which is, in turn, borrowed from Section 56, subsection (2) of Part IV of the Transport Act, 1950.  The references to drainage and prevention of flooding were included originally for illustrative purposes rather than as exclusive phrases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the obligation to supply water imposed on C.I.E. under <Col N="639" /> existing legislation arises, for the most part, as a result of terminable agreements. There is at least one agreement which has not a terminable clause, and there may be more.  As far as this legislation is concerned, there is no departure from the existing obligations on C.I.E. for the supply of water from canals.  I am also informed that, by reason of the continuation of the operation of the 1958 Act in respect of the Grand Canal, the inclusion of these words might now have some special significance in relation to their non-inclusion in the 1958 Act in respect of water supplies from the Grand Canal.  To sum up, the exclusion of the words Deputy Sweetman wants included has no special significance and the obligation on C.I.E. to supply water is not affected in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.  I presume I have the right to reply.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not read the discussion of last week.  I made it quite clear that I knew there were rights for C.I.E. to terminate these supplies of water but that it was equally certain that so long as the canal had been kept open for navigation water would be in the canal and that the Company would obviously be desirous of getting the extra revenue that supplying water to farmers would produce.  Now, there is an entirely different situation&mdash;the canal has not to be kept open for navigation and if so the supply of water in that canal may cease completely. If the supply ceases C.I.E. will merely serve three months' notice on the persons concerned.  If they do that, it will completely ruin some farmers there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Transport and Power suggested that if there was to be any change in the water level or supply of water C.I.E. could not do it without submitting further proposals. I want a categorical assurance from the Minister to go on the records of the House that if there is to be any change in relation to the position of water in the Royal Canal he will not give his approval to such changes <Col N="640" /> without first making certain that those people who depend for water supplies on the canal will have an alternative supply, I do not say necessarily at the same cost, but at a reasonable cost.  If that undertaking is not put on record I am afraid the day will come when somebody in C.I.E. will get the idea that it is a waste of money to keep any water in the canal and will suggest filling it in and, as a result, a very substantial number of people will be broken overnight.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister knows that line down by the Royal Canal out to Mullingar but there are a very great number of farmers who get their sole water supply on that line from the Royal Canal.  I want to ensure that there will be&mdash;and I shall say quite candidly preferably in the legislation itself&mdash;specific warning that the water supplies cannot be terminated, or if that is impracticable for the reason that it will cause a difference between the Grand Canal on the one hand and the Royal Canal on the other, an explicit assurance by the Minister&mdash; not in any temporary way but on the basis of an assurance governing Ministers as they succeed one another&mdash; that nothing will be done to prejudice those people's livelihoods because that is what will happen unless some such step is taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the likelihood, in the first place, of filling in that stretch of the canal with which Deputy Sweetman is concerned is very remote.  In fact it is most unlikely to occur at any time.  I also understand that it will be the policy of C.I.E. to continue to supply water to those who are entitled to it under their agreements. Being in the most transient position that one can possibly be in as Minister for Transport and Power, I think I can give the assurance to the Deputy that the Minister for Transport and Power, whoever he may be, must be assured that no hardship will accrue by any action of C.I.E. in relation to supplies of water.  I do not think I can go further than that.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in fact a Bill to authorise C.I.E. to cease using the Royal Canal.  The Minister said something on the Report Stage in regard to C.I.E.'s obligation to maintain certain amenities associated with the canal that they have heretofore maintained but there is one aspect of this to which the House should have regard.  I believe the canals are a very valuable potential tourist amenity and my apprehension is that at first glance that may seem to many Deputies to be a somewhat fantastic concept.  The special amenity to which I refer is the amenity of coarse fishing, which could become a very valuable element in our tourist trade.</P>
      <P>There is so much propaganda about tourism that I think people often get fantastic ideas into their heads as to what it is.  It is a very valuable invisible export but the bulk of that invisible export does not come from the very wealthy tourist who arrives here to stay at luxury hotels.  There is no doubt they make their contribution, but the bulk of tourist income is derived from emigrants returning to visit their families and from the neighbours of these emigrants who are drawn here for the kind of amenities that they value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in some measure personally responsible for the inauguration of the Inland Fisheries Trust and the development of its coarse fishing branch.  I have seen developed in my own constituency of Monaghan a type of tourism quite unknown in some parts of the country.  It is based almost exclusively on the coarse fishing available in some of the small lakes in Monaghan and that type of tourist is very largely a resident of the English midlands.  Such tourists do not seek extravagant or luxurious accommodation but find the kind of accommodation they get in a country town or in <Col N="642" /> a rural village very acceptable.  They are prepared to pay quite a liberal rent &mdash;five or six guineas a week&mdash;for the accommodation they enjoy.  It is a valuable source of revenue to remote rural areas and it is a kind of income that such parts of the country can derive from no other source.</P>
    <P>To the average person here the idea that people would travel from Birmingham, or Manchester, or the midlands of England, to fish in a canal may seem fantastic.  It is literally true, however, that in the canals in that area, including, I think, the Manchester Ship Canal, a very large number of coarse fishing clubs exist; and it is fantastic, but nonetheless true, that so numerous is the membership of these clubs in these areas that there is a widespread agreement amongst them that they do not bring any fish home at all.  If they catch a perch, a bream, a roach, or a dace in one of these canals they always put it back and it is, indeed, not untrue to say that they have familiar friends swimming about in the canal, friends whom they catch regularly, two or three times a month and put back again into the canal.</P>
    <P>Where you have enthusiasts of this kind who have, as they have in Great Britain, an annual holiday and you offer to them the prospect of fishing in the very much more agreeable atmosphere of our Royal Canal system as compared with the urban canal system that they habituate during the rest of the year, and add to that prospect that nobody gives a fiddle-de-dee whether they bring the fish home, fry them, and eat them in the evening, or put them back into the canal, then you are offering those people a tourist attraction of very real and dramatic value to them and you will draw them into areas where the relatively modest outlay they are prepared to undertake during their holiday period will be of great value. They will be very glad of accommodation in a country house.  They will be very happy, indeed, in the accommodation available in the local public house or over the local shop where the owner may care to set a room and cater for a neighbourly kind of people such as I describe during the summer months.</P>
    <P>All of us have seen the tendency for <Col N="643" /> abandoned canals to degenerate into the kind of public scandal that the old canal in the vicinity of the town of Monaghan has now become.  I am sure that when the responsible authority got permission to suspend traffic on the old Ulster Canal all sorts of assurances were given that the most solemn obligations would be undertaken by the Ulster Canal Company to maintain that amenity.  Then, as the years rolled by, the canal reached the stage at which the Ulster Canal Company became incapable of maintaining the canal and we discovered, when they were found incapable, that it was nobody's duty to maintain the canal.  Ever since I have been a Deputy representing Monaghan I have been trying to get the Board of Works, or some body, to do something about the old horror of the abandoned Ulster Canal.  It represents the extreme limit of abuse that can result from a statutory authority suspending traffic on a canal.  I want to prevent, in relation to the Royal Canal and the Grand Canal with which we are dealing now, a much lesser abuse.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister there is no thought of authorising Córas Iompair Éireann to abandon the Royal Canal.  I ask him to go further than that.  I want to see the towpath maintained. I want to see the canal prevented from silting up.  I want to see the canal preserved in such condition that it can be made a fishing amenity to be integrated into the general tourist programme. I want the Minister to bear in mind that the Inland Fishery Trust is prepared to stock the canal so long as the canal is kept in a condition which will make it physically possible to maintain a stock of fish in it.</P>
    <P>I press for some express undertaking by the Minister on this occasion because bitter experience has taught me that once you begin the slow progress which so frequently culminates in the abandonment of a canal you are on a slippery slope and, by the time people wake up to the distance they have travelled, it is often impossible to reverse the trend.  I should like, on the Fifth Stage of this Bill, a specific undertaking from the Minister that he intends to insist that, even if this company <Col N="644" /> are authorised by statute to suspend their navigation operations on the canal, there will remain on them the clear and unequivocal obligation to maintain the canal, at least to the extent indicated by me, as a tourist fishing amenity which will operate to draw tourists to the country for the coarse fishing facilities which it offered in the past and which it should be maintained to offer in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister responsible for the development of tourism, I can assure Deputy Dillon the case he has made is very dear to my administrative heart, apart altogether from the fact that there is undoubted merit in what he has said.  My experience of fishing has been very limited. I think I fished four times in my life, twice for mackerel with a spinner in Cork Harbour, once with a rod and line on the Blackwater, and on one other occasion&mdash;I think I told Deputy Dillon about this&mdash;when I kicked fish out of the stream at Ownahincha strand with my bare feet; the trout were swept out by the release of water from the flax pond.  I think Deputy Dillon was the only one who believed that fishy story because he himself had had, I think, a similar experience.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy of the interest of the Minister for Lands in the case he has made.  The Minister's enthusiasm for the preservation of fishing is at least equal to that of the Deputy, particularly in relation to coarse fishing.  The comparison the Deputy drew between the Royal Canal and the Ulster Canal is not quite in point because the owners of the Ulster Canal, having ceased to operate, left the country and they had, therefore, no further interest in any of the amenities the canal had to offer.  This cannot be the case with Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the Minister for Lands is at present considering the development of all the canals for coarse fishing and for eel fisheries.  The closing of the Royal Canal will not prejudice this development in any way.  On the contrary, I am informed the closing will assist considerably in the development of the canal for coarse fishing purposes.  As Minister <Col N="645" /> for Industry and Commerce, and as the Minister responsible for tourism, I can give to Deputy Dillon an undertaking that the tourist amenities of the canal, with particular reference to coarse fishing facilities, will not be lost sight of and I shall personally take a keen interest in the development, envisaged by the Minister for Lands, of the canal as a centre of coarse and eel fishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the representations which were made during the Second Reading debate that the time limit of four years from date of discharge within which applications for pensions in respect of disease might be made was too short.</P>
      <P>I am advised that, normally, a four year period is quite long enough for a disease to manifest itself and I do not propose to make any change, therefore, in the conditions governing the receipt of applications for pensions in respect of disablement due to disease attributable to Defence Force service at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that our knowledge of the incubation period of diseases which might arise from overseas service is not perhaps such as would justify the exclusion of the possibility that such a disease would take more than four years to show up.  I am quite satisfied that, even if this Bill remained <Col N="646" /> unamended, steps would be taken to cover such a case if it did arise and, rather than disturb a long-standing principle, I would prefer the matter dealt with in that manner.  In deference, however, to the fears of Deputies that circumstances might operate to deprive a genuine applicant of a pension solely because his disease did not become apparent within the four years period, I propose that, in respect of United Nations service only, the time limit should be extended to eight years.</P>
    <P>I am therefore moving five amendments necessary to give effect to this proposal.  They arise in Sections 3, 4 and 7 of the Bill&mdash;as Deputies will have seen from the document circulated. I am taking the opportunity also to rectify in Section 6 a very minor drafting defect.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputies will agree that the extension of time afforded will be adequate and I would only point out in this connection that any longer period would make it so difficult as to be almost impossible for medical examination to diagnose with certainty whether the disease was attributable to service or not.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Section 10 (which provides for the grant of disability pensions in certain cases) of the Act of 1927, as extended by subsection (1) of section 4 of the Act of 1943 to members of the Army Nursing Service, shall have effect in relation to every person who is discharged from the forces or whose service in the Army Nursing Service is terminated (whether before or after the passing of this Act) as if, in subsection (1), after &ldquo;during the emergency period&rdquo; (inserted by section 3 of the Act of 1943) there were inserted &ldquo;or with a United Nations Force&rdquo;, subject <Col N="647" /> to the modifications that, in relation to disablement caused by disease attributable to service with a United Nations Force&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the reference in that subsection to four years shall be construed as a reference to eight years,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(b)  the scales and rates of pensions shall be those specified in that behalf in those provisions of the <i>First Schedule</i> to this Act which are applicable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This subsection, by providing for the insertion in Section 10 of the Act of 1927 of the words &ldquo;or with a United Nations Force&rdquo; has the effect of including disablement, whether before or after the passing of this Bill, due to disease attributable to service with a United Nations Force within the ambit of the said Section 10 which, as amended, deals with pensions for officers, soldiers and members of the Army Nursing Service disabled due to disease.</P>
    <P>The subsection provides that the scales and rates of pensions applicable to United Nations service shall be those in the first section of this Bill and extends the four year limit of disease qualification to eight years.  That is the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Minister's amendment is better by four years than the subsection as originally drafted.  It is a 100 per cent. improvement upon his original proposals, but I am convinced that eight years is again much too short.  It is admitted by most medical authorities that tropical diseases can be contracted that do not manifest themselves for many years afterwards.  There are various types of disease that they know very little about.  When the Minister says that four years is an ample period he must not have sought information from his Department.  He could ask them to cite cases that arose over the years in which disease contracted during active service did not manifest itself until quite recently, several years afterwards. It was proven beyond yea or nay that <Col N="648" /> the disease was contracted on service during the emergency.  Yet, the Minister tells us that four years is ample time.</P>
      <P>I put down an amendment which you, Sir, have ruled out on the grounds that it would involve a charge on public funds and that no Deputy has the right to move such an amendment.  I accept that ruling, of course, without question.  It means that Deputies on this side of the House or on the opposite side of the House have no say in this matter.  It is solely the responsibility of a Minister and the Government to move that the period be extended.</P>
      <P>As I have said at the commencement, we are grateful for small mercies.  Remember, this is not to protect the interests of the serving soldier; this is to protect the Department of Finance and the Exchequer. If this amendment were accepted it would put a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Apparently, all our approval of and pride in our troops has always subsided after a four-year period.  While the soldiers were fighting in the Crimean War they were great fellows but when four years had passed they were referred to the workhouse or a charitable institution.  The 1914-1918 war was fought by heroes for houses to live in and all that sort of thing. When four years had passed they were relegated to the scrap heap.  Here we are carrying on that principle.  I reject it.  When a Bill such as this is going through the House we should subscribe to the principle and the Minister and the Government should subscribe to the principle that if it is found that the applicant contracted disease on active service he should get what he is entitled to get whether it is four, eight, ten, 15 or any number of years afterwards.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is a small advantage to be gained if the applicant is able to continue to serve for some time because he can apply four years from the date of discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the extraordinary case, as I said on Second Reading, that a boy might contract disease now and he may return from the Congo next January <Col N="649" /> and, in 1969, if it is then found that he is suffering from some tropical disease that he could only have contracted on active service the Minister says that in those circumstances the Government of that day will amend the Act.  How does he know?  There will not be the enthusiasm for them then, perhaps.  Maybe the Government that will be in office at that time will say that they should not have gone at all, that this Government and this Dáil were wrong to send them and that anything they got was good enough for them.  We should guard against that and I appeal to the Minister to delete the subsection altogether.  I know the Minister will say: &ldquo;If I delete this from the Bill, then I must delete it from the Pensions Act for the forces at home&rdquo;, and my answer is: &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;  I am grateful that the Minister has met us some of the way but I hold that it is not sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in this amendment has gone some way to meet an amendment I had down and which was ruled out of order on the ground that it would impose a charge on the Exchequer.  However, the Minister and his advisers should advert to the very different circumstances under which this Pensions Bill is being passed compared with those of previous measures.</P>
      <P>All the previous measures have dealt with Army personnel who had served at home and I think, almost without exception, the four-year period was intended to cover the most likely cases which arose and they were cases of tuberculosis contracted while on Army service and which did not manifest itself until some years later even in these cases.  I have no doubt from experience there were some very severe decisions under the terms of the Act because persons who contracted tuberculosis had not, according to the decisions in these cases, contracted it during Army service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this situation for the first time we are dealing with tropical diseases.  So far as I am aware there is, in regard to some of these diseases, no limitation of time during which a particular disease may manifest itself.  There is a <Col N="650" /> somewhat extraordinary provision in this Bill, which is copied out of the earlier one.  A person serving for a period abroad returns home and shortly afterwards his Army service terminates.  If after a lapse of, say eight years, no disease manifests itself and subsequently it does, he is not entitled to a pension because of the terms of this Bill.  A fellow soldier may serve in the Army for a longer period and subsequently the disease manifests itself. Because he has the benefit of the longer service in the Army he will have the additional advantage of the extra eight years and if, after retirement, it manifests itself he will be entitled to a pension.  A disease contracted abroad on the same occasion does not in one case manifest itself for a greater number of years than in another case.  Because one person serves longer than another he will be entitled to a pension whereas his comrade who had served for a shorter period will not be entitled to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department should do some fresh thinking in this matter and, in consultation with the Department of Health, consider in so far as medical information and medical opinion is available, the situation which could possibly develop, but which we all hope will not, arising out of service abroad.</P>
    <P>We have all heard of cases of people who have lived abroad and who many years afterwards contracted a tropical disease.  It was obvious that unless they had lived in some of these foreign climates such a disease would never have been contracted by them.  In this case if tropical diseases manifest themselves at a later period they will certainly stem from the period of service abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the peculiar nature of this service in contradistinction to any service our soldiers have given in the past which has always been on home territory. Undoubtedly the amendment goes a distance to meet the objections which were expressed here on the Second Stage but I believe that, in a matter of this sort, there should be no time limit.  This question should receive <Col N="651" /> examination on the basis that this is an entirely new situation and one in which the Department of Defence have not had previous experience.  The opinion of the Department of Health or that of other experts qualified to give an opinion on the medical aspect of it should be sought and in the light of that a measure should be drafted which would ensure that no one who in the future may contract a disease will because of the terms of this legislation be prevented from receiving a pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put succinctly <Col N="652" /> again the representations that have been made by Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Cosgrave.  I want to ask the Minister this question: Suppose a constituent of mine, who never put his foot outside Castleblayney in his life until he joined the Irish Army, goes on foreign service to the Congo and at some stage thereafter manifests the symptoms of malaria filariasis in Castleblayney, am I expected to argue that he contracted one of those diseases in Dublin or Monaghan when it is manifest to the simplest child that it is one of the diseases which are endemic to the Congo?</P>
      <P>I can conceive of a situation arising with regard to some disease known in that area of West Africa and virtually nowhere else in the world.  Is it seriously suggested to this House in the case of a man who never put his foot outside Ireland, except to go on foreign service to the Congo, who later develops a disease consistent with the disease pattern in question: a long period of incubation&mdash;&ldquo;incubation&rdquo; is not really the word I want&mdash;a long period of suppressed symptoms which flare up at a later stage, that we should envisage a situation being brought about by our statute law whereby the effluxion of time proves that the obvious is not true?</P>
      <P>The Minister's answer is that if such a case arises, we will pass another Act of Parliament.  He says he would prefer to do that rather than make a breach in the principles which attach to our pension regulations.  I think the Minister is making a mistake.  I think that without any breach in the existing code of time limitation attaching to the ordinary Pensions Acts, all of which have been enacted in contemplation of service at home, this is an occasion when a departure can be made and the time limit removed with special reference to foreign service.  If that is done, there is no breach of the long-established principle of time limitation which we all agree is a matter of compromise and adjustment on as fair a basis as we are able to find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an entirely new situation and it is fantastic for the House to place upon anyone in the public service, or outside it, the obligation of <Col N="653" /> telling a man that he developed malaria or some other Congo disease somewhere in Ireland, although it can be demonstrated that never since St. Patrick set foot in Ireland was the disease known in the country, and he can demonstrate that he was on service in the Congo where the disease is endemic.  It is fantastic that we should pass a statute under which the effluxion of time makes that certain fact statutorily untrue.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that if such a case arises we will pass a special Act of Parliament to provide for that soldier.  That is bad legislation.  It would be much better that for foreign service, we should drop the time limit. I think the Minister would be entitled to make a certain schedule of tropical diseases and to say that in respect of those diseases there will be no time limit, but in respect of diseases which are known at home and abroad, such as T.B. and various other diseases, the eight year limitation will apply.  I think it is bad legislation to provide that the effluxion of time should operate to make that which is certainly true statutorily false.</P>
    <P>In answering Deputy Corish's interjection about injuries sustained in the course of sporting activities, the Minister was a bit too emphatic when he said that would not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the true answer. If a soldier is playing football during his weekend leave, that is his own business, but a situation could arise, particularly on foreign service, where a man might be directed, for policy reasons, to engage in a football match with a team of local people which would clearly be part of his Army duties.</P>

      <P>The Minister and I are <i>ad idem</i> on that point.  If it is a part of his duty, the soldier is covered, but if he chooses to play during his leave period, he is not covered.  I suggest to the Minister that he might reconsider <Col N="654" /> this question as to whether there should not be at least a scheduled list of diseases for which the time limit would be removed in respect of soldiers on foreign service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. Listening to Deputy Cosgrave, I was reminded of certain problems we dealt with in the House which came to the notice of every Deputy.  I am referring to the case of a man who is declared fit on joining the Army, and who subsequently contracts a disease, but for some reason or another, the medical board says he did not contract that disease in the Army.  If a man is passed as healthy into the Army and subsequently contracts a disease, I shall go to my grave trying to understand why any medical board should say he did not contract the disease during his service in the Army.  It has happened that a man passed as physically fit and free from disease has contracted T.B. afterwards, and it was said that it was not due to Army service.  The Minister has nothing to do with this matter because it goes back over the years, but I have always resisted that idea.  If a man is examined and told that he is physically fit, if he passes the X-ray test and the other tests to prove that he is fit, and afterwards contracts a disease, it has been said, for some reason or another, that he did not contract it during his Army service.  That is wrong in principle. I have always opposed that idea and shall continue to oppose it.</P>
      <P>I know the previous Minister for Defence dealt with many cases of that kind during the Emergency but we are dealing with another problem now and we all hope that when a man is passed as physically fit and contracts any disease afterwards, the Army authorities or the medical board will not say that the disease was not contracted due to his army service.</P>

      <P>In connection with the extended period, the point I want to make is that the other Acts dealt with the Army at home, and under those Acts dealing with disability, the Minister has power to re-open a case at any time.  If the Minister included some such clause in this Bill, if a case arose after the eight year period, instead of opening the gates, so to speak, there would be provision for special cases which the Minister was satisfied arose out of service in the Congo.</P>
      <P>A man might be mentally sick and be placed in an asylum for a number of years.  Later, having regained his sanity, he might want to make a claim and that might be nine or ten years after the event.  He might say: &ldquo;Look, I was in an asylum and I did not know what was what.  I have now regained my sanity and I want to make a claim for this disability.&rdquo;  On the evidence, the Minister could say that he was a special case without opening the floodgates, as I said, if he inserted some clause giving himself power to re-open those special cases without necessarily extending the period of eight years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish raised the point of injuries and wounds received during activities outside the normal time on which a soldier is on duty.  Let us take the case of an officer or other member of the Defence Forces on service abroad who is involved in an accident or is involved in some way in a civil pursuit arising out of which there may be a civil action.  As the regulations exist at the moment, the Army authorities would look after the welfare of the member but he would be precluded from coming to any decision in relation to the civil action. Any arrangement arrived at with the other parties involved would be without prejudice to any claim the Department of Defence would have in respect of hospitalisation or the giving of particular services to the injured member of the Defence Forces.  I regard this as iniquitous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know how lengthy litigation can be; we know the length of time it can <Col N="656" /> take.  It is detrimental to the future prospects of an injured party where such a regulation compels him rigorously to adhere to the court procedure and await protracted court proceedings before a decision is reached.  There could be relaxation in relation to that. It is something which could certainly be particularly harsh on the unfortunate person involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have gone as far as it is reasonable to expect me to go in meeting the case that has been made by agreeing to introduce amendments to double the normal period, by extending it from four years to eight years, although I know of no good reason why that should be done except for the fact that this comparatively speaking unknown quantity of tropical diseases enters into this question. I am advised that even in the case of tropical diseases, there is no reason to believe that they would not show up within the four years.  The best advice available to me indicates that doubling the period would give plenty of opportunity.</P>
      <P>For obvious reasons, there is need for some time limit.  That should be obvious to everybody.  It is in every-body's interest that the claim should be made as soon as possible.  It is necessary to establish that the disease from which the disability arises is due to service within a definite period, within the period, in this case, of United Nations service.  Except on presumptions which have not been established or in respect of which no evidence has been produced to support them, I can see no reason for suggesting there is any need for the removal of a time limit altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, when speaking earlier today, I am quite satisfied that if a case arose in which it was not possible to make the claim within the eight year period, steps would be taken by any Government to cover it.  I have no reason to believe that such cases would arise.  It was stated that there were cases over the years in which disease contracted during the Emergency did not appear until well after the four year limit.  My Department knows nothing about that.  We <Col N="657" /> know claims have been made but it is practically impossible to believe that such claims could be established after the four year period since the Emergency.  We believe that these diseases would have manifested themselves within that four year period, that is, if they had been, in fact, contracted during the Emergency period. It is impossible to believe they would not have manifested themselves within the four year period.</P>
    <P>It was also argued that we should consider the peculiar nature of the service that gives rise to this Bill today. Of course, that is what we have done and that is why I have agreed to extend the time limit as I am doing in the amendment.  It is because of the peculiar nature of that service.</P>
    <P>I did not quite understand what Deputy Corish was getting at when he spoke about injuries that might be received on the sports field.  If the sports in which the member of the Defence Forces was engaged when he was injured were connected with his Army service&mdash;if it was an Army match or something like that&mdash;then he would be covered by the existing legislation. Of course, that is not disease. That is already covered by the legislation. It would be looked upon as a wound and it does not then really arise in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin stated the Minister had authority to open cases at any time in connection with some of the other Acts.  That is not so.  What the Minister has authority to do is to re-open cases that have been turned down, if there is fresh medical evidence produced which purports to establish the claim which had already been turned down.  In that event, the case can always be reopened.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is reasonable to ask me to remove this time limit altogether because no case has been made except on the basis of pure surmise that there may be some disease which does not show itself within the eight year period, but my medical advisers do not know of any such disease and I am quite certain that if such a case did materialise, steps would be taken to cover it.  Why should we <Col N="658" /> cover things that nobody knows to exist?</P>
    <P>The other points raised have nothing to do with this Bill.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to a member of the Defence Forces injured in an accident being treated by the Army and then taking a civil action to recover damages.  He objected to the Department of Defence insisting that their interests should be covered in any settlement arrived at. Surely it is obvious that that is one of the things that should be covered.  No person should make a settlement and ignore the claims of the Department of Defence.  We would not countenance that.  If the State is at expense in respect of an accident for which somebody is held responsible, obviously the State is entitled to recover in any settlement arrived at.  That is completely irrelevant to the present Bill. I am moving this amendment to extend the time limit for applications from four years to eight years.  I am quite satisfied that that will be ample.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not presuming anything at all.  I am officially aware of cases in this country where the disease did not show until after the four year period.  I can cite offhand one particular case in which a man became ill.  The doctors could not discover what was wrong with him. He was discharged from the Army. He was given every test.  No trace of T. B. was found in him.  Nevertheless, he had all the symptoms.  He was turned down on the ground that whatever he had was not contracted in the Army.  Later T.B. was established.  The case was re-opened by Ministerial Order.  On investigation it was found that the man did have contact with people who had T.B. when he was in in Army.  After 12 or 14 years they were able to establish that he had contracted T.B. on active service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the circumstances were not just like that, then, in a Congo case, the man is out after the eight years.  I want to stress that my amendment to delete the section is not acceptable because it is not within the Rules of Order to move an amendment which imposes a charge on the Exchequer. Therefore, the restriction protects the <Col N="659" /> Exchequer.  The attitude would seem to be: Never mind the fellow in the Congo; never mind the sufferer; it does not matter about him once the enthusiasm and the glory are over; away with him then; it makes no difference.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe in what I am saying. If I could put the matter to a division I would hope Deputy P.J. Burke would come into the Division Lobby with me.  This is something we should not do in this enlightened age.  We should not do what was done immediately after the Crimean War.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin and some other Deputies are to some extent unduly pessimistic.  The young men who went to the Congo are physically fit.  As far as medical science can ensure it, they have been immunised against contracting disease of any kind.  If, in a year or two or five or ten, a delayed action, as it were, on the part of some tropical disease occurs in any of the gallant men who are defending not alone Ireland but world peace, medical science will be able to establish to all concerned&mdash; the Army Pensions Board or any such board&mdash;that it was due to service in a tropical region.</P>
      <P>We are unduly pessimistic and may cause a great deal of concern to the immediate relatives of men in the Congo by suggesting that they will come back here physical wrecks.  That will not happen.  I am quite satisfied our soldiers will come through with flying colours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the position should be as Deputy MacEoin and another Deputy suggested, the men on these benches will most assuredly have regard for the welfare of our soldiers.  They will be ever-mindful of the great service rendered by them.  They will always be on the side of the soldier who&mdash;we hope not&mdash;might contract any disease that would incapacitate him in any way.  I am convinced we are unduly pessimistic.  I always like to cross my fences when I meet them rather than to think three or four fences ahead and to assume that the one at the end will be the fatal one.  I hope we are not causing unnecessary concern <Col N="660" /> to the relatives of our gallant men who are helping to preserve world peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin said he had personal knowledge of cases in which disease appeared after the four year time limit and that men were, consequently, ruled out.  However, the example he gave us was of a case that was not ruled out.  It was turned down originally because it was not established.  Subsequently, when the disease did develop, it became possible to reopen that case.  In other words, the example he gave was not an example of a case ruled out but of a case that came within the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davern is quite right.  I do not feel it is well to give the impression that the men out there are subject to great danger of contracting tropical diseases.  The health record of our two battalions in the Congo has been very good indeed.  If anything, their health record is better than that of an average similar unit at home since they went out.  There is no reason to believe that any great amount of disablement will arise from tropical or any other kind of disease when these men come back.  I am quite satisfied that if any of them should suffer disablement, they are adequately covered by the provisions of this Bill.</P>

I am satisfied, beyond yea or nay, that our Government, the Minister for Defence and the Army authorities are making every provision and taking every possible step to protect them from contracting certain tropical diseases. Vaccination and other treatments have been carried out.  That proves that there was a danger of some diseases which could be guarded against before they left.  Suppose that arising from one of the vaccinations that have taken place, something goes wrong in ten years' time.  It will then be two years too late.

      <P>I asked the Minister to consider the adequacy or inadequacy of the allowance for the education of a child of an officer, N.C.O. or man, after 18 years of age. I suggested to him that if a child was at a whole-time educational establishment, even after the age of 18, the State should assume the responsibility for the child.  The Minister said that the officer, N.C.O. or man if he was alive might not be able to do it.  That, I think, was a presumption on the part of the Minister because it is the intention of everybody to do the best he can for his family, and where there is evidence available that the child of a deceased officer, N.C.O. or man is at a whole-time educational establishment the grant should be continued until the education is completed.  I now ask the Minister to consider that point and see what he can do about it.</P>

    <P>Before subsection (2), page 21, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) In considering whether it is reasonable to make an order for the <Col N="664" /> recovery of possession of a controlled dwelling, the Court shall have regard to the extent, if any, to which the conduct of the landlord contributed to the existence of the grounds upon which he relies in support of his application for recovery of possession.&rdquo;&mdash;(Minister for Justice).</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the points which I made during the debate on the last occasion in regard to landlords creating a situation in so far as they practised various methods to get rid of tenants, one is refusing to take rents.  It is because of that point that the Parliamentary Secretary has included the subsection in the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary should go a little further.  On the last occasion he mentioned that where the landlord refused to take rent the tenant should send the rent by postal order.  I know of one tenant who regularly sends his rent by postal order.  He has to undergo the expense of sending it by registered post and also to the expense of having duplicates typed which describe the purpose of the postal order.  He has to do that because the landlord is an unscrupulous person.  The total cost to the tenant is approximately 3/- per week and he was sending a postal order for several years.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister add to the section a provision that where a tenant had to incur expenses or costs resulting from the landlord's action, he could recoup these costs from the landlord? It is possible that a tenant may have to go to a solicitor for advice resulting from the landlord's refusal to take the rent, particularly in cases where an unscrupulous landlord thinks that by some form of blackmail, he may get the tenant to accept something ridiculous.  The tenant should then be entitled to recover his solicitor's cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of a case where a landlord who was seeking possession of a controlled office made the tenant a ridiculous offer of about one-tenth of its value.  Because the tenant refused the offer, not only did the landlord refuse to accept the rent but he also went to the extent of blackmail by threatening to go to court with some <Col N="665" /> story that the tenant had been in court for an immoral offence on some previous occasion.  Not satisfied with not taking the rent, he tried to use blackmail to force the tenant to accept a ridiculous offer.  The Parliamentary Secretary should realise that there are some landlords who are specialists in corruption and who believe, as I saw in an English paper recently, that there is one way to succeed, that is, to be unscrupulous and to have no heart. There are gentlemen of the landlord type who are most unscrupulous. That is why I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to go further in this section.</P>
    <P>If the landlord thought that he would have to pay the costs incurred by the tenant due to his own action, he might be slow to threaten the tenant.  As matters stand, what has he to lose?  He will chance his arm and not take the rent and will go to court then and look for possession, saying to himself that even if he does not get possession, he will lose nothing and that the whole thing is worth a try. If the landlord knew he might have to pay certain expenses undertaken by the tenant, it might act as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>The landlord is a gentleman who is well advised and who knows the law.  I heard of a case this morning in which some builder sold property and did not carry out his end of the bargain.  He asked the tenants to form a society to which they were all to subscribe £1.  When he did not carry out his contract and when one of the tenants brought him to court, he was able to say that this was a utility society, that the tenant was a member of it and that therefore he could not sue himself.  There is no end to what some of these gentlemen will do.</P>
    <P>This morning a lady came to me outside the City Hall asking what she was to do.  The landlord had refused to carry out repairs and for that reason her rent had not been accepted for five weeks because she had complained to the Corporation of his refusal to do the repairs.  He had collected the rent from the other tenants but had refused to accept hers, saying that if she wanted to pay it, she could bring it to his house.  He was going to force her to travel the three miles <Col N="666" /> back and forth once a week because that was his way of putting on the squeeze.  There are rogues of the first order amongst the landlord community.</P>
    <P>I want this subsection to provide more protection for the tenant.  I have so much experience of those gentlemen that, even if the Parliamentary Secretary says that there are only a few who are bad, I reply to him that it takes only a few to upset a world.  It took only Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin to upset this world.  A few unscrupulous landlords can cause an awful amount of hardship.  That is why I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that if these people have no hearts, they will not be allowed to get away with it.  I am satisfied with the subsection but it does not go far enough.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that Deputy Sherwin is a little less than gracious in this matter.  This amendment had been inserted by me to meet a certain situation which he described to us on the Second Stage, to try to close a loophole that would be available to unscrupulous landlords.  I think it should be sufficient to achieve what Deputy Sherwin wants, particularly if he would do as I suggested when we were discussing a somewhat similar point before, that is, indicate to tenants what their rights are.  I think he was exaggerating a little in the matter of the postal order.  The expense of sending the rent by postal order is quite neligible.  The tenant would retain the counterfoil as evidence that he had remitted the rent. I think that would completely meet the case.  Of course, the safest way for the tenant is to save the rent and have it available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  If he has to have it available every week for the landlord, there should be no insuperable difficulty in putting it by. I am satisfied that in this amendment we are going as far as we possibly can. To suggest that the cost of consulting a solicitor should be recouped from the landlord is not practical and is <Col N="667" /> wrong in principle.  If I take legal advice no one would suggest that I should recover the cost from another person.  If I take the case to court, it is within the competence of the court to award me all the costs it likes and to award damages, if necessary. I think Deputy Sherwin is looking a gift horse in the mouth.  We have dealt with the situation as far as we can and it is reasonable to assume that the tenants will be adequately protected.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin seems to think that unscrupulous landlords can get away with anything they like.  They can, if people are not sufficiently vigilant to look after their own rights.  If they are not, there is very little we can do to help them.  We place all the protection of these Rent Acts on the Statute Book.  Further than that we cannot go.  We cannot compel them to avail themselves of the rights we give them.</P>

      <P>I welcome these amendments.  The position had been that, due to the interpretation of the 1946 Act in the Irish Courts, following similar interpretations of similar legislation in the English Courts, certain anomalies and discrepancies had grown up between the rights of persons, when the tenant died intestate and when the tenant left a will or when the deceased tenant left an administrator who was in occupation of the premises when he had administered the estate.  In these circumstances it was most desirable that the anomalies should be cleared up.  It appears to me that the amendments that have been proposed will now bring a degree of uniformity into the position and enable tenants to know exactly their rights on the death of a non-statutory tenant.  It appears to me that these amendments should be passed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b)  a person adopted under the Adoption Act, 1952, shall be considered the legitimate offspring of the adopter or adopters,</P>
      <P>(c)  subject to the foregoing paragraph, an illegitimate person shall be considered the legitimate offspring of his mother and reputed father, and</P>
      <P>(d)  unless the relevant <i>bona fide</i> residence with the tenant was a residence which began less than six years before the tenant's death, a person <i>in loco parentis</i> to another shall be considered the parent of that other.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with adopted and illegitimate children who are members of the family of a deceased tenant.  The object of this amendment is to delete the requirement that an adopted child or an illegitimate child must be living with the tenant for a period of six years before the death of the tenant.  The necessity for this amendment arose in this way.  At the time the Conroy Commission reported the Adoption Act of 1952 had not been passed.  Since that Act it has been settled policy to treat adopted children exactly the same as if they were the natural children of their adopters.  It would be inconsistent with that policy to require any residence qualification <Col N="670" /> for adopted children.  Therefore, we propose to delete that six years' residence qualification, and I think it is only proper that we should delete it in the case of illegitimate children also. If the House adopts this amendment the position will be that the six years' residence qualification will apply only where the tenant was <i>in loco parentis</i> to the person concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one type of tenant those of us connected with local authorities must have met, and that is the old person who is not able to pay the rent of a new house and who is, therefore, in a somewhat peculiar position.  I think almost every local authority from time to time, when it comes to considering the rehousing of the people in any area, meets the case of the old person who is just not able to pay the rent of the new houses being built in that area. I should like to try and find some way of meeting that type of case without cutting across the whole spirit of the Bill and the difficulties of achieving uniformity in it.  The Parliamentary Secretary has to some extent come somewhere near that aim when, in Section 37 (b), there is reference to &ldquo;a temporary necessity of the landlord or the tenant.&rdquo;  But I do not think you could describe a case that will arise for the remainder of an old person's life as being &ldquo;a temporary necessity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Houses which would not be by any means suitable, or even possible, for <Col N="671" /> an ordinary family might be a possible means of meeting the case I have in mind if we excluded them only for the period in which they were occupied by the old person.  But, quite clearly, if you just did that <i>simpliciter</i> in the Bill, you would open a wide field for evasion that would be quite impossible to cover.  However, I think we could put a stop on that evasion and, at the same time, do what we want by providing that that type of letting for an old person, purely for the life of that old person &mdash;you can define &ldquo;old person&rdquo; if you like&mdash;would be outside the scope of the Bill if, but only if, at the time the arrangement was made the housing officer of the local authority certified that in his opinion it was desirable that there would be this type of special accommodation for the old person concerned.</P>
    <P>Every local authority that I know meets with, and has trouble in trying to solve, this type of housing problem. I cannot see how, if the consent of the housing officer is required at the time the letting is made, evasion would take place.  I think there is a possibility of being able to ensure in that way that something would be done to meet the case of the old age pensioner who perhaps has no family to whom he can turn in his old age and who has to live in certain circumstances on his own.  I think it would ease the difficulties of the landlord.  The fact that the consent of the housing officer is necessary would also prevent evasion and there would be quite definite chances of being able to bridge a difficult gap by something on those lines.</P>

      <P>We do not know that we can estimate the life span even of old persons.  Even among old persons the life span is gradually increasing; we know that from our statistics in the city here.  We have introduced differential rents which meet&mdash;as far as we can see&mdash;all cases of hardship, temporary or otherwise.  You have the breadwinner or head of the house, for instance, killed in an accident and his family left unprovided for.  In that case there is the same position of helplessness as with the old person from the point of view of rent commitments and again we allow the differential rent arrangement to apply.  There is a certain minimum, beyond which the rent cannot go, fixed for each particular thing.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to say this to the gentlemen of the legal fraternity but one of the problems that would be created&mdash; as far as I am advised&mdash;is that if you had statutory rents on controlled houses and if you varied those even out of the greatest generosity, you afterwards leave yourself open to the new rent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know, but I should like this Bill to be as simple as possible. I believe the way to approach the problem about which Deputy Sweetman speaks is for another Minister to deal with it through what we might call social welfare, through an approach to local authorities, but if you are going to fill an Act with saving clauses for every possible situation you will not have a workable Rent Restrictions Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attracted <Col N="673" /> to what Deputy Sweetman has suggested. I appreciate what Deputy Briscoe said as far as Dublin Corporation is concerned but I do not think that is a full answer because Deputy Sweetman mentioned the problem that local authorities have in dealing with certain types of individuals, maybe a single person or perhaps an elderly couple, who would not in the ordinary sense qualify for a local authority house.  They do not qualify unless they happen to be living in a house or area that is being condemned or is to be cleared.  They do not qualify on normal grounds of overcrowding.</P>
      <P>The ordinary local authority dwelling, of course, is not affected by the Rent Acts but there are a number of dwellings that are, as Deputy Briscoe will know as a member of a local authority, subject to closing orders or which are condemned as dwellings unfit for the ordinary family of three, four, five or six but which at the same time the local authority would agree would be suitable to house a single person or an elderly couple.  I think that is the kind of dwelling in respect to which Deputy Sweetman's suggestion could prove very helpful.  You will come across cases where the local health authority feel that possibly a basement dwelling, or a cottage with two rooms that the health authority consider to be too small, or for some reason decide should not be relet for the purposes of a dwelling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, but possibly where the local authority takes a tenant out and says to the landlord: &ldquo;You are not to relet that.&rdquo;  But the local authority will very often be quite satisfied to relet, provided it is to a single person or an elderly person or couple.

      <P>Quite.  In a number of cases it will be condemned and to relet is a breach of the law.  In the bulk of other cases&mdash;and I know some of them&mdash;the landlords may be estate managers who are co-operating with the local authority.  They are not making lettings of houses which they have had inspected by the local authority and about which the local authority feel that, if there were to be further lettings, the powers to condemn premises might have to be invoked.  These people are co-operating with the local authorities; they are not making the lettings but they know from the local authority that, if it could be arranged that the lettings would be to an elderly couple who would remain for the rest of their days and that there would be no danger of overcrowding, the local authority would withdraw their objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position at the moment is this: they cannot make that letting to the elderly couple because the premises are controlled premises and if they do make a letting to an elderly couple that couple will acquire rights under this Act.  If they try to put them out and serve them with a notice to quit, they will become the statutory tenants <Col N="675" /> and when they become the statutory tenants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Suppose there are premises which are not suitable for an ordinary family but would be suitable for a single individual or a family consisting of two or three.

      <P>I will accept that.  The property is declared unsuitable for large families.  As far as the landlord is concerned, those premises must lie there idle.  Let me give an actual instance.  There is not a declaration such as Deputy Briscoe speaks of and there is no order condemning the premises, but an order might come if the landlord were to relet.  On the other hand, he could make a letting to a small family, or a single individual, in the knowledge that whenever the local authority felt the letting should end because the place might deteriorate further&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is where the two things run together.  You have the point of view of the local authority and the point of view of the landlord who owns the premises and could make use of them.  The argument is there on both sides from both <Col N="677" /> points of view.  Deputy Sweetman has suggested that such houses should also be excluded from control under Section 37.  That would help the local authority, and it would also enable the landlord to continue to make lettings of a suitable character.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it might be necessary to introduce a provision under some of the Housing Acts to meet that position.  I do not think there should be anything insuperable in doing that.  A start would have to be made here in order to exclude such dwellings from the provisions governing control in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in some difficulty in understanding what Deputy Sweetman was driving at in the first instance.  It seems to be a matter for the local government code. As far as I understand the point now, it is that there may be a landlord who is co-operating with a local authority. He knows the houses will be condemned or that permission will not be given for lettings to families.  But there is an interim period and, during that interim period, he would have permission from the local authority to make suitable lettings.  That is a matter to be dealt with under the local government code because clearly the position must be either that the local authority condemn and take definite action or else the landlord has a perfect right to let for his own temporary convenience.  He can put the local authority to the jump, can he not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?  Why should he have it both ways?  He is definitely entitled to make a letting. I had some difficulty in grasping the point in the beginning, but surely if it is a matter which is of specific reference to local authority housing, then the intervention of a local authority in the matter of housing is best dealt with specifically in the local authority housing code.  It would complicate things very much to introduce a provision into this Bill.  The general policy is to regulate the relations <Col N="678" /> between landlord and tenant in the traditional way.  We have two main codes.  We have the 1931 Act and we have the Rent Acts.  I take a different view in this matter.  There may be substance in the point made by Deputies opposite.  There probably is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no; I got the point.  But I do not think it is a matter that can be dealt with here. The purpose of Section 37 is to exclude the application of Sections 28 and 29 to lettings for temporary convenience and lettings during employment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 29 and 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 29 and 30.  These are the sections which deal with the right to recover possession. These two sections give a statutory defence to any ejectment proceedings. This section still leaves it open to the landlord in principle.  I have not compared the actual wording with the provisions in previous Acts, but I think it is practically the same.  It is to cover the position of a letting which forms part of any office or employment, such as a gardener, who might have housing accommodation ancillary to his employment. The general basic idea was that the tenancy would cease if the employment ceased.  If the employer wished to change the terms of employment in that way, he was at perfect liberty to do so.  That is the purpose of subsection (a).  Subsection (b) was to meet the <i>bona fide</i> temporary convenience of a landlord or tenant.  Without going into details, we know that the latter part has been the subject of a considerable amount of litigation and was the subject of considerable judicial decision.  I am not clear as to what the state of the law in that regard is at the moment but I think the general idea of temporary necessity or temporary convenience has been rather hedged in by a judicial decision, so that it is difficult enough to make a letting under these heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> Instead of meeting this section as Deputy Sweetman has suggested, I rather ask the question: is it desirable under the heading subsection (b) to define more clearly at this stage what is meant by temporary necessity or temporary convenience having regard to the decisions already made?  Would it be possible to limit more clearly the meaning of these two words?  Certainly, as the law stands now, it does not mean just convenience or necessity in the ordinary conventional way of looking at it; there are certain tests, but, by and large, I would imagine the answer to that is that if you attempt to be more specific there, you will get into deeper water.  On surveying the whole section, the wording there is probably the best one will get and there is no need, even in the light of decisions, to extend the exception here, nor is there any need to increase the protection which has been given by the earlier section which has been excluded by this section.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, therefore, I do not think a case for amending this section arises and, frankly, I think Deputy Sweetman's point would be better referred to the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>I should like it to be clearly understood by Deputies what we are doing in Section 40.  I strongly oppose it.  One of the reasons we have been objecting to this Bill is that it is proposed as a result of this Bill to give increases of their rent to landlords irrespective of whether repairs are carried out by them, irrespective of whether they fulfil their obligations, and there is to be an increase in rent on practically all sitting tenants, no matter what the means <Col N="681" /> of those sitting tenants are, no matter whether they are well-off or poor tenants.</P>
      <P>It has been answered on the Government side that if a landlord does not carry out his obligations and does not repair the premises, the tenant has certain rights and that he can make the landlord do the repairs.  The first answer to that suggestion is the one that has been given several times in the course of this debate, namely, that tenants do not know their rights, that tenants do not like going to law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the House what the rights of tenants are under existing legislation? In the case of what were known as controlled 1923 Act premises, that is to say, by and large, old premises erected before 1919, with a poor law valuation of £30 or less, the tenant had two remedies where the premises were in disrepair.  He could apply to the court to have the rent reduced or he could apply to the court to have a sum ordered by the court to be spent on the premises.  These rights are inserted in this Bill but with an added exception in this Section 40 and subsection (2) of Section 40 of this Bill has carried into this code a provision that was in the Landlord and Tenant Act and which was not in the previous Bill and was not in the previous Rent Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection (2) provides in effect that if a tenant applies to the court because the premises are in a bad <Col N="682" /> state of repair and where the landlord has not carried out the repair, the landlord can get out of his difficulties and the court may refuse an order if it is satisfied that the cost of putting the premises into good repair would involve excessive expenditure, or if it could be put into repair only by rebuilding, reconstructing or structurally altering the premises to a substantial extent.  In other words, we are now putting a new sub-clause into this Bill which will leave it open to landlords to escape their liability in those circumstances.  I do not think we should put it in.</P>
    <P>There are a number of objections to it.  One of them is that we do not know what those words mean at the present time.  They are at the present time the subject of interpretation by the Supreme Court in a matter which has been appealed to the Supreme Court and in which judgment has been reserved.  The whole wording of this subsection has been gone into minutely in a case under the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  There are a number of cases in the High Court depending on the decision of the Supreme Court in this matter and we do not know what the actual import of these words is.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I feel that we should not insert this subsection into Rent Acts.  It is going to make it too easy for landlords in certain circumstances to escape their liabilities. Remember that we are giving an increase to landlords of 12½ per cent. We are giving them an increase because it is said the cost of repairs has gone up, and so it has.  We on this side of the House have no objection to landlords getting an increase of their rent where they have carried out repairs and where they have improved their property, but we object to this uncovenanted increase whether or not the landlords carry out their obligations.</P>
    <P>It is true that they can be forced in certain circumstances to carry out their responsibilities but in this subsection we are making it easier for them to evade those responsibilities.  I would suggest that we should leave Section 40 as it was in the old Rent Restrictions <Col N="683" /> Act and that we do not put in this subsection (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) is entirely permissive.  It merely permits the court to do this, and then only in certain circumstances.  We must not assume that the court will act irresponsibly. Subsection (2) specifically provides that the court may refuse to make an order under this section, if the landlord satisfies the court on all these various points.  That is reasonably adequate protection.  We are placing an onerous liability on the landlord to satisfy the court that the conditions specified in the subsection apply.</P>
      <P>Let us not lose our sense of proportion about this.  What does subsection (2) deal with?  It is dealing with the case of a court awarding a sum of money to a tenant against the landlord to enable the tenant to carry out repairs.  That is a very wide power to give to the court in the relationship between landlord and tenant.  We are modifying that a little.  We are saying, as any sensible man would say and any reasonable court would say: &ldquo;If the sum of money that has to be expended on these premises is absurdly high, if it is such a sum of money that the corresponding rent the landlord would charge to the tenant would be out of proportion to what he could pay, then in that restricted, limited number of cases, we will refuse to award the sum.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all this we have a clear-cut, fair recommendation from the Conroy Commission.  The Conroy Commission examined the operation of Section 48 of the 1946 Act, the corresponding section to this one, and recommended that this proviso, this sensible proviso, be put into it: if the expenditure involved is of such a nature that it would obviously be absurd to incur it, then the court may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to award the sum.  That is all we are doing.  That does not impose any onerous burden on a tenant. It deals only with the case where the tenant is asking to be awarded a sum out of the landlord's pocket to enable him to carry out repairs.  When that is <Col N="684" /> borne in mind and when it is remembered that subsection (5) preserves all the other rights which are available to a tenant to make a landlord carry out repairs, it is evident that Deputy Costello is not being realistic in his approach.  What is Deputy Costello asking us to do?  He is asking us specifically to allow the court, in a case where the expenditure of the money would not be justified, to grant a tenant a sum of money to carry out the work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello has referred to the fact that the increase of 12½ per cent. under Section 10 was being given to landlords, provided they were liable for repairs in whole or in part and it did not matter whether they did the repairs or not.  We objected to that provision on the basis that the landlord, under the Bill as it stands, is not bound to do the repairs.  What he is asked to do is to accept liability for them under his arrangment with the tenant.  Every time that argument was made, the Parliamentary Secretary or some other Deputy referred us to Section 40.</P>

      <P>Section 40 provides that the tenant will not suffer if the landlord does not carry out the repairs, because the tenant could force the landlord to do them or force payment from the landlord so that he could do the repairs himself.  That is not necessarily so, and that is the argument Deputy Costello is putting up.  The Parliamentary Secretary has argued all along&mdash;and in this he has followed the Conroy Commission Report&mdash;that the 12½ per cent. increase to the landlords is to compensate them for the cost of repairs over <Col N="685" /> the past decade or so; in other words, this is money they are supposed to have spent already on the property for which they are being compensated.</P>

      <P>We are talking about the landlord who has not spent a penny on his property.  He will get his 12½ per cent. under Section 10 of the Bill and he will now be in a position, because of this new subsection incorporated in Section 40, to go into the court and make a case that the place is too far gone to do anything with it.  He can pocket his 12½ per cent. increase and if the tenant brings him to court under Section 40, he can put up the case that the premises are too far gone.</P>
      <P>I suggest seriously to the Parliamentary Secretary that if the court does refuse an order under subsection (2) of Section 40, the court should have authority under this Bill to order the landlord to refund to the tenant any increase in rent which was imposed by virtue of Section 10 of this Bill, because in such a case I do not believe there is any justification whatever for the 12½ per cent. increase being awarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That question of compensation in the past has been mentioned, but let us look at the situation in the present and for the future.  Having regard to the actual value of rents and the costs of maintaining property, I think it will be <Col N="686" /> found that the 12½ per cent. will go no further, and can go no further, than to maintain from the point of view of ordinary running repairs premises which are already in reasonable repair. Take the case of a landlord responsible for external repairs, the question of slates, gutters, storm damage, and so on.  That 12½ per cent. would be quickly absorbed and we would still be left with two separate problems.  There would be the problem of the premises which are already so far gone that they cannot be brought into a maintainable state of repair without the expenditure of a large sum. Without going any further, I ask the question: How will we cater for that case?  In regard to a house or tenement which is already too far gone in the matter of substantial repair, there will be continuing running repairs, if I may use that expression, or what I may call normal repairs, to be expected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Should not they be dealt with under Section 10, apart from the 12½ per cent?  They come under the other provisions of Section 10.  The 12½ per cent. does not relate to them.  They are also entitled to a percentage for putting their place into a reasonable state of repair and another percentage for improvements or structural alterations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy is slightly ahead of my argument.  As I said earlier, this section is to some extent of benefit to the tenant, and many tenants wanted a provision of this nature.  Let us take it the other way around.  Suppose a landlord were compelled to put his place into a proper state of repair and the load would come back on the tenant?  I can see it is extremely difficult to work out and extremely difficult to balance up here. I think it will work out in this way: where a landlord fails to keeps a house in a reasonable state of repair and to carry out his duty in the ordinary way, the court will compel him so to do and the tenant will be adequately safeguarded.  The 12½ per cent. provision will actually strengthen the tenant's hand in that regard and will operate as an insurance in that, in the <Col N="687" /> normal general run of cases, the premises will be kept in repair.</P>
      <P>We come now to the type of case that is, I think, in Deputy O'Higgins's mind and about which Deputy Sherwin is thinking.  What will be the position of tenants under bad housing conditions&mdash;tenants of tenements which are so substantially out of repair, through age, lack of care or anything else, that it would be uneconomic to put them back into repair?  That is a very specific type of problem indeed, the answer to which is that it is simply outside our scope.  It is a housing question, where the local authority comes in.  I think when we get to this stage and are dealing with such tenants, we are very near the stage where the building should be condemned and I think that is how the courts would construe it.  That being so, I think Section 40 is equitable and I leave it to the Parliamentary Secretary to give the other grounds he has in mind, such as the Conroy Report and other expert opinions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello raised the question of interpretation.  If in the light of the Supreme Court's interpretation, any major problem for the Legislature arises, amending legislation is always within the competence of this House, and I think that argument would be constraining, rather than a cause for rejecting the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated what my interest in this section is previously.  On the last occasion we discussed rent legislation I said that there are 1,500 families in Dublin at the moment living in certified condemned dwellings. Since then, I have got further official information.  Apart from those 1,500, there are 700 dwellings which the housing authority intend to condemn in the near future.  That means that there are 2,200 condemned dwellings in Dublin, the landlords of which are aware that the local authority intends taking them over, and will not, therefore, spend one penny on them. Nevertheless, the landlords of these 2,200 dwellings will be entitled to ask for the increase of 12½ per cent., as has been stated here, where it is proved <Col N="688" /> that it would be unreasonable to ask for any repairs to be carried out. Surely the landlords of these 2,200 dwellings can easily prove that because they will be able to prove that the Corporation will take over the premises in the next year or so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the 12½ per cent. will be granted to these landlords, who, by right, should be fined, because if the properties are so bad, it is proof that they carried out no repairs for ten or 15 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that we are being unreasonable in asking for the deletion of this subsection. It has also been suggested that the court should have regard to the condition of the premises, and that if the premises are in a bad state of repair and would require the expenditure of an excessive amount of money to put them into good repair, the court should not grant the order directing the landlord to pay a sum of money to the tenant to carry out specified repairs.  I think it should be <Col N="689" /> pointed out that if it is reasonable to include that provision in Section 40, it should also be included in Section 15.</P>
      <P>Under Section 15, if the premises are old, if they are pre-1919 with a poor law valuation of £30 or less, the tenant can get his rent reduced, even if the premises are in a very bad state of repair.  Under this Bill, a tenant who is a tenant of old premises&mdash;pre-1919, with a poor law valuation of £30 or less&mdash;no matter what state of repair they are in, may bring application under Section 40 to ask the landlord to put the premises into good repair.  If the court is satisfied that the expenditure would be excessive, the tenant would not get such an order, but then under Section 15, he can get his rent reduced.  We are introducing a distinction in this Bill which I think is bad.  If it is right for Section 40 to have such a subsection, I imagine it should be right for Section 15 also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The two sets of circumstances are completely different. In one, the landlord is being ordered to pay a sum of money, and in the other the rent is being reduced.  There is a big difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that it is regarded as justifiable to have the rent of premises reduced if they are in a very bad state of repair and an excessive expenditure would be required to put them into a good state of repair, but inequitable to ask the landlord to put them into a good state of repair?  I do not see that that distinction is a valid one.  I am against this subsection.  The fact remains that this will be availed of.  It is put in to assist landlords, to ease the situation of landlords in certain circumstances. I do not think it should be put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that this is merely a permissive clause.  It was permissive, anyway, under Section 40 as it stood.  It was not mandatory on the court to make an order.  The court could take the various circumstances into consideration. Now the court, in interpreting this section, is bound to accede to the <Col N="690" /> view that this subsection was not in the previous legislation, but the Oireachtas has now put it in.  The court must take cognisance of this subsection. All that will be necessary now for the landlord to do will be to bring in a qualified architect.  He will say that to put these premises into repair would cost £1,000.  The roof has to be stripped; the slates have to come off. The bigger the job to be done, the better, so far as the landlord is concerned.</P>
    <P>The court has to say to itself that the Oireachtas has put this in for some reason.  It cannot ignore this subclause if the landlord is in a position to bring in evidence of that sort.  Even though the premises are leaking, the slates defective and the whole premises is or should be condemned, the landlord can get out of his obligations to repair it, even though he has got his 12½ per cent. increase.</P>
    <P>This is not airy-fairy talk.  Deputy Sherwin gave examples of cases which came to his knowledge.  I know of cases which came to my own knowledge of people living in old decrepit premises which should have been condemned long ago and which have not been condemned.  They are the subject of order by the local authority to repair. The landlord has not repaired them and nothing has been done.  The local authority may take action.  It may take them a year during which time the rain enters the premises and the landlord is getting his 12½ per cent. increase.  The tenant cannot come along because of this subsection to get the landlord to put a sum of money into repairs.</P>
    <P>I think the courts applied the old Act reasonably.  I know of cases where the tenants put up figures to show that a considerable sum was necessary to put a premises into repair.  The court said that these were old premises and it did not consider that the landlord should be under an obligation to put a lot of money into the old premises and that it would be sufficient if a certain sum were spent to make the premises waterproof.  I feel that the section under the old Act was interpreted in a very reasonable way by the courts <Col N="691" /> in the past.  We are now putting in a subclause which the courts must take cognisance of, if they are to interpret this section fairly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello is a very good advocate but I think he is pressing his case a little too far.  Let us follow the subject in its sequence. We all agree that the problem of the tenement which has gone so far&mdash;the type of tenement to which Deputy Costello and Deputy Sherwin referred &mdash;exists.  We should clearly keep two things in mind.  The first is this: Is this provision fair to the rest of the tenants who are actually the majority? We all can agree it is.  The case has been made solely on these near-condemned premises against this section. Is the case of the tenement which Deputy Costello has in mind sufficient to warrant our rejecting this section which is manifestly in line for all other tenants?  Let us follow the argument a little further than Deputy Costello.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Pardon me.  It will apply generally but it will not work in this particular way in regard to the other tenants.  It will apply generally and will be a very important one perhaps in the long term for other tenants.  Let us keep to the type of tenement upon which this case is made. Assuming a landlord fails to keep such a tenement in repair and the tenant brings him to court to enforce his right&mdash;a tenant who is already paying him in regard to 12½ per cent. for ordinary repairs&mdash;the court will have regard to all these facts and will do one of two things.</P>
      <P>It will either accede to the tenant's demand under the section and operate in favour of the tenant and the benefit of the tenant compelling a landlord to do his duty or if it finds that &ldquo;the dwelling could be put into good and tenantable repair only by being rebuilt or reconstructed or structurally altered to a substantial extent&rdquo;, then it may decline the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> Deputy Costello claims that is a hardship on the tenant.  It would be but for the very Section 15 which Deputy Costello mentioned because at that stage, surely, if it can &ldquo;be put into good and tenantable repair only by being rebuilt or reconstructed or structurally altered to a substantial extent,&rdquo; it comes within the terms of Section 15, which gives the tenant the right to a reduction in his rent.  Section 15 (1) says &ldquo;the tenant or the sanitary authority may at any time apply to the court on notice to the landlord for an order reducing the rent of any controlled dwelling... on the ground that the dwelling is not in all respects in good and tenantable repair&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Imagine the position of the court. The court is satisfied that it is not in good and tenantable repair, so much so that it refuses to make an order in favour of the tenant to compel a landlord to outlay a certain amount of money on large reconstruction. Surely that court is not going to hold against the tenant in an application under Section 15?  The very fact that the tenant has been refused relief under Section 40 must be the grounds for a reduction in the rent, so that you have the interesting situation&mdash; and I think the logical one&mdash;that in the case of premises which are so far gone it is fair to the landlord not to compel an outlay that is altogether uncalled for as he is not expected to be a social service and on the other hand, it is fair to the tenant.  If the premises are not what he should have, he should not be required to pay the full rent for it.  It is equitable in that case that the rent should be reduced. All these things are provided for in the Bill.  The end of the logical sequence is that the premises become uninhabitable and at some stage the local authority should step in.  When one looks at it that way, can anyone propound a more equitable and logical approach to that problem?  It is not quite the same thing as the 12½ per cent.  The 12½ per cent. is really there for maintaining premises that can be maintained, on a normal basis, in repair.</P>

We all have experience of the lengths the courts have gone to, and advocates in the courts have gone to, so as to obtain fair considerations and applications.  I want to pay a tribute to the administration of the law in that regard in the courts by both judges and advocates.</P>
      <P>My point is that you have to take the whole system of the code as well as the individual section or subsection. I have tried to show that the logic of the case works out for the benefit of the tenant in the end, while being fair to the landlord.  It is over-pleading on Deputy Costello's part to represent it as a case of the higher the better&mdash; that, if a landlord can demonstrate to the court that the cost is outlandish or show that the whole building is out of repair he gets away with it.  That is not a fair picture.  If the landlord does that, having regard to Section 15, the result must be that if the tenant does not get the repairs he gets a large corresponding reduction in rent.  We know the fairminded attitude of the judges.  If the landlord was not doing that, they would redress the matter on the other leg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> I come now to the interpretation of subsection (b):</P>
    <P>the dwelling could be put into good and tenantable repair only by being rebuilt or reconstructed or structurally altered to a substantial extent.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that if a landlord comes into court and says that to do this would require this, that and the other&mdash;and he can always bring architects to support him and the court has to accept that&mdash;he will succeed in evading his obligations.  There are some slates off the roof and the roof is leaking in some flat.  The landlord comes into court and brings in an architect to show that the roof has to be replaced.  To do a good job the roof has to be replaced and there is a big cost and he hopes to get away on that section.  I feel that the counsel or the tenant himself or the court, if he has not a solicitor, will ask: &ldquo;Can I keep out the rain by putting on the slates and leaving the question of deterioration of the roof as a whole to another time?&rdquo;  The court will say that the landlord can do that and, therefore, that reasonable repair will be done and the section will not be evaded at all.</P>
    <P>It is totally different with a dangerous building.  It is a different line of country.  It is just to meet that that that section is there.  When one examines it in this way, there is a very strong case to be made for the tenant's interest and, in the tenant's interest as well as that of the landlord, from the point of view of equity, unanimity and consistency in the whole court there is a very strong case to be made for the insertion of this section.</P>

Even if the unfortunate type of tenant to whom we have regard realised his rights in the matter, which he will not, he would not have the wherewithal to proceed on the lines suggested by Deputy de Valera.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>We all realise that in the cities particularly and in the larger towns a section of landlords, fortunately a small section, are extensive owners of slum property.  By reading the reports of the courts every day we can see that they also appear to specialise in availing of every possible loophole in the law to rid themselves of their obligations and liabilities insofar as keeping the premises in which their tenants dwell in repair.</P>
      <P>In this section we have a provision where the tenant can take the landlord into court to have the premises put into proper repair.  If the cost of putting it into good and tenantable repair would involve an excessive expenditure the tenant cannot succeed. I can visualise that it would be quite easy for the landlord of this type of tenement slum property to succeed in court under this section.  It is true to say that it would cost an excessive amount to put it into repair.  Therefore, the landlord succeeds in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does this Bill do?  In spite of the fact that the landlord has gone to the court and proved that the property is in this state of disrepair, we are giving him an increase of 12½ per cent. in the rent.  I am speaking now of extensive owners of property of that kind.  An increase of 12½ per cent. is a fairly good bonus on property in respect of which they have gone into court to prove it is in a shocking state of repair.  I cannot understand what justification the Parliamentary Secretary can put forward for an increase of 12½ per cent. in such a case.  I seriously commend him to have a look at the suggestion by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins to incorporate somewhere in this section, or in the Bill, that where the landlord succeeds in proving to the <Col N="696" /> court that the repair cannot be carried out except for an excessive sum&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>

      <P>The over-riding consideration in this section is to preserve a fairly considerable asset of old but repairable houses.  I am not concerned with tenements very much because the whole tendency of our building schemes is to get rid of slum dwellings as quickly as possible.  In every city and town there are a fairly considerable number of good houses which are structurally sound but which need repairs. The purpose of this section is to try to get them repaired without prohibitive cost.  When they are repaired the important part about it is this: some of those may be 8/- a week and some may be 16/- a week.  Twelve and a half per cent. is added to the 8/- which becomes 9/- and to the 16/- which becomes 18/-.  That is for the tenant who in most cases does not want to leave that house.  It suits him.  The locality suits him and the schools and churches are near him and, even with the 12½ per cent., it will be pounds cheaper than going into a modern house which becomes available. It is to my mind a great advantage to get these houses repaired. Some of them when repaired may not be up to modern standards and may only suit old people.  That is one thing we are working towards in the cities and towns, to try to get small houses for old people to live in.</P>

      <P>That is my viewpoint on the matter.  This section is designed with that aim and consequently it has its merits.  Undoubtedly it is reasonable to object to every increase but if the purpose is <Col N="697" /> good and it attains its end, preserves a national asset and eliminates the expenditure of a good deal of money on new houses, where old houses may be needed and may be useful, I think it should be supported.</P>

      <P>First of all, let me deal with the argument put forward by Deputy Declan Costello that he knows what happens under the working of Rent Acts, that he has seen Section 48 of the 1946 Act work in practice and that he, from his own personal knowledge, is satisfied that it works well.  The only thing I can offer in rebuttal of that argument is his own expert commission, the Conroy Commission.  I am prepared to take their judgment and their knowledge of the situation in preference to Deputy Costello's.  The Conroy Commission, which on the Second Stage Deputy Costello unequivocally praised and enthused over as an expert commission, made this clear-cut recommendation and we are following them exactly in what they recommended. I prefer to accept the view of the Conroy Commission, based on their wide experience and authoritative knowledge, rather than Deputy Costello's.</P>
      <P>The argument has been put up here by Deputy Casey that this section will operate entirely on tenement dwellings. Of course it will not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally he would not.  Let us be clear whether we are talking about the section or the subsection and exactly what we are talking about.  The insertion of this subsection in Section 40 does not in any way invalidate my argument that landlords liable for repairs can be compelled to carry them out.  Section 40, in 90 per cent. of cases, will operate to compel landlords liable for repairs to carry them out.  The very fact that it is there at all will have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>Ninety per cent.?  And the other ten per cent. will have to pay the 12½ per cent. although their houses will not be repaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The other ten per cent., if it is ten per cent., admittedly will have to pay the 12½ per cent. increased but they can still compel the landlord to carry out the repairs because Section 40 is not the only remedy a tenant has.  As already pointed out, there is Section 15 of the Bill, Section 61 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and the common law rights.  It creates a false impression to try to maintain that Section 40 is the only remedy available to a tenant to compel a landlord to carry out the repairs for which he is liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already enunciated the other remedies available three or four times during this debate and I think it is <Col N="699" /> either obtuse or unfair to try to argue at this stage that Section 40 is the only remedy available.  As I say, Section 40 will be fully effective in 90 per cent. of cases.  The cases in which it will not operate will be cases which most reasonably-minded people would not expect it to operate, namely, cases where the expenditure would be of such a nature as to be obviously unjustified because the expenditure in itself would be so large&mdash;and the special lawful addition arising out of it so large&mdash;that the court would decide the tenant would not be in a position to pay it.  To that extent it is in relief of the tenants themselves.</P>

      <P>When I say &ldquo;reasonable to expect&rdquo; I am talking about this excessive type of repair.  I am not talking about running repairs.  The 12½ per cent. will apply because even though the landlord does not do this major repair he will be liable to carry out running repairs and to the other sanctions of the law in this respect, such as Section 61 of the Landlord and Tenant Act and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it was. The 12½ per cent. increase has been <Col N="700" /> justified all along on the ground that it is to meet normal repairs.  We have always had a provision in the Rent Acts to deal with extraordinary or special repairs.  As I asked before, let us be realistic about this.  What are we doing?  We are merely rounding off this section, merely saying that in a case where the expenditure would be absurd, having regard to the type of house involved, the court is permitted&mdash;and only permitted, there is nothing obligatory about it&mdash;to refuse to grant payment of this sum of money to the tenant.  The tenant by virtue of subsection (5) still has all the other rights available to him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> To add to the section the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) There shall be implied in every contract made after the commencement of this Act for the sale of any interest in a controlled dwelling a provision (if not already expressly included) binding the vendor to give to the purchaser any information in the vendor's possession or procurement regarding any deposit made after such commencement by a tenant of the dwelling as security for payment of the rent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am introducing this amendment to meet the case mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins on the Second Stage.  The House will recollect that we were talking about the case of the tenant who made a deposit with the landlord as a security for rent and we were providing that, where there was a change of landlord, the tenant would still be entitled to procure the refund of the deposit from whoever was landlord at the appropriate time.  Deputy O'Higgins was worried about that because he felt that the landlord at the time might not know of the existence of such a deposit.  I pointed out that it would be a simple matter to make it another requisition in title. He suggested that we go a little further and make it a condition of the contract that the vendor would be required to make the existence of such a deposit known to the purchaser.  This amendment is intended to ensure that every vendor will be compelled to disclose the existence of such a deposit to the purchaser.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has met the point I made and, if anything, he went a little bit further.  I suggested that there should be a provision to make it illegal to exclude a requisition.  The Parliamentary Secretary makes it a positive duty on the vendor to give any necessary information.  I am not opposing the amendment but it appears to me that, when the new section is being put in this form, it might be convenient to stipulate in some way how the information should be given and <Col N="702" /> possibly the Parliamentary Secretary would like to consider that point.</P>
      <P>I do not want to say anything more on this amendment and I am not sure if I am in order in referring to a matter in connection with the section now or later.  It relates to the question of the deposit and I think it is relevant at this point.  In subsection (2) of this section, it is set out that where, during the tenancy of a controlled dwelling, a deposit is made which is not an approved deposit that deposit will be recoverable on demand. It seems to me that there is a loophole there which the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to plug.  What I have in mind is the case where you may have a non-approved deposit insisted on by the landlord before the tenancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Parliamentary Secretary was wiser to go the little bit further that has been mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins, but I should like him to go further still. It seems to me that, even with this subsection added, the whole sale would be closed and the purchaser might be faced with the refund of a deposit which was paid to a vendor who may have gone away.  We should try to make it impossible for a vendor to do that.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should try to provide that the information as to such a deposit should be given by way of statutory declaration.  There is a complete analogy in the statutory declaration which is required under Section 47 of the 1891 Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case it could quite easily be done by adding the words &ldquo;give, if so required, to the purchaser any information in the vendor's possession&rdquo;. One of the normal requisitions would be that when a purchaser was buying rented property, he would be given a statutory declaration as to whether or not there were any deposits.  If the vendor had to complete a statutory <Col N="703" /> declaration to that effect he would not lightly give the answer: &ldquo;not to the knowledge of the vendor&rdquo;.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wishes, he can look up the position under Section 47 of the 1891 Act and he will find the analogy there.  It is standard practice for a solicitor and counsel to require such a declaration and I think it should be provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There would then be no chance of its slipping through by accident. Otherwise, I am afraid that it will slip through on occasion by accident and the purchaser will be liable to pay the tenant's deposit and will have a technical right against the vendor which will be very difficult to enforce.  It should be made reasonably certain that the vendor will properly apply his mind to the answer he is giving before he gives it.</P>

      <P>We are getting very much into practitioners' territory here. I felt that I was going fairly far in this matter.  I do not know whether I could be pushed to go much further but generally, on this subsection, we are doing exactly what we are doing in Section 12 of the Bill.  Subsection (4) of that section deals with the same type of situation.  It deals with the question of persons giving information as to the basic rent.  Our objective was to keep this section in line with subsection (4) of Section 12.  It was really a question of being consistent in the two sections.</P>

I do not think the words set out in that agreement would cover a deposit to which reference was made in an endorsement.  I think that should be covered.  I do not think there is anything in it at all from the point of view of principle.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in relation to the case where there is not a written agreement, the Parliamentary Secretary has provided that the deposit must be entered in the rent book at the time it is made, but it must be carried forward into succeeding rent books if one rent book gets used up.  Otherwise, it will be in it merely at the time it is made and until that rent book is finished.</P>

      <P>I am thinking of something more than that.  I am thinking of the new owner when he comes to give his first receipt&mdash;when the tenant comes to produce his rent book and to take his receipt.  The owner need not necessarily be the owner on a purchase but may be the owner on an <Col N="705" /> intestacy or a bequest.  The first time the tenant comes to make his payment, it should be patent to the person collecting the rent that there is a deposit in that case.  That is desirable and can be met quite simply by adding the words &ldquo;is carried forward in every subsequent rent book&rdquo;.

      <P>&ldquo;(1) This section applies to premises which, immediately before the operative date, were&mdash;</P>

      <P>The object of Section 54 is to enable tenants of purely business premises which become decontrolled as a result of the provisions of this Bill to have immediate access to the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  It has come to our notice that the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act never applied to a certain type of tenancy, that is, lettings for temporary convenience.  As Section 54 stands at the moment, it would grant access to the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act to that type of tenant.  The amendment is to rectify that situation; in other words, to exclude temporary convenience lettings while giving protection to all other types of premises which become decontrolled.</P>

      <P>There is provision in the Landlord and Tenant Act in the case of a letting which will end through the effluxion of time whereby notice must be given three months before the end of tenancy.  There is a similar provision in regard to the period within which an application must be brought where there is a notice to quit.  But, unless there is a specific provision in this Bill importing into the Landlord and Tenant Act a period after determination of the tenancy, will the tenant not be barred by the provisions already in the Landlord and Tenant Act?

    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I had not had an opportunity of reading the Minister's opening statement.  I have since discovered that he introduced along with the Bill what I would describe as a sugared pill, a Supplementary Estimate which is supposed to give grants to those who clear derelict sites.  That does not seem to me to be embodied in the Bill.  It seems reasonable to ask the Minister why.  He read out his Supplementary Estimate and explained fully all the benefits he proposed to offer.  He then dealt very briefly with the Bill but only referred <i>en passant</i> to derelict sites.  He gave no example of a derelict site and did not give Deputies a full understanding of what was really behind the Bill.  Therefore, anybody reading the speech, the Bill and the White Paper must inevitably draw his own conclusion.</P>
      <P>If it was intended, as the Minister said it was, for the purpose of improving the appearance of the country from a tourist angle, surely the Bill could have been brought in as some form of tourist legislation.  If it was intended to do it in this way, the grant provision could have been included in the Bill.  As I see it, the position is that a local authority may decide&mdash; make no mistake about it; the local authority is not the elected representatives but the county or city manager &mdash;that a certain site is derelict.  Under the Bill the county or city manager will get power to tell any private property owner that portion of his estate, be it house or land, is a derelict site and that he must do something with it.  The Minister, towards the end of his speech, pointed out that if the owners failed to do the job required, powers existed under the 1940 Act to enable the local authority to acquire the land and do the work themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only real difference the Bill makes is this.  Heretofore local authorities could get a site only by acquiring it themselves, and they <Col N="709" /> could acquire it on health grounds or if there was a danger to the public, but this Bill puts them in the position that they can force the hand of a local owner by giving him a direction to do something on his land that they claim is a derelict site.  One could read this Bill for two hours and still be no wiser as to the definition of &ldquo;derelict site.&rdquo;  It is probably as difficult to define as &ldquo;charitable donation&rdquo; which the Minister concerned refused to define.  Apparently the Minister for Local Government has given us a definition of a derelict site but it is very wide and vague and it really means that the county or city manager has authority to define anything as a derelict site.</P>
    <P>Then comes the sugar coating of the pill, the Supplementary Estimate. That provides that £5,000 will be made available by the generosity of the Government between now and the 31st March from which anybody who is forced to do anything by the local manager can get a 50 per cent. grant if the work costs more than £30.  If it is less than £30 he gets nothing. The maximum he can get is £100&mdash;I am not quite sure whether the maximum grant will be £100; I rather imagine it is £50.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have probably had the same experience as myself in dealing with the unwieldy sort of system that exists in this country where an ever-generous Government is giving grants know that you cannot just arrange to say: &ldquo;Here is a derelict site.&rdquo;  The local authority says that. It says to the owner: &ldquo;You must get rid of that derelict site but you will be paid a 50 per cent. grant.&rdquo;  In the first instance it is not even in the Bill that they are to get this grant; it is a mere statement of the Minister on a Supplementary Estimate, but assuming that what he says will be the case they will have to wait for it.  The machinery we have is cumbersome, roundabout and outmoded.</P>
    <P>Does any Deputy think&mdash;and it is now near the middle of December&mdash; that if this Bill becomes law on 1st January and if a derelict site is declared, the grant will be given by the time all the cumbersome machinery <Col N="710" /> has functioned before 31st March?  If there are a few claims in one or two parts of the country that may be the case, but if there are claims in from all over Ireland, from people who read what enthusiastic Fianna Fail Deputies said about this wonderful new legislation and if claims come pouring into the Department of Local Government, some 40 or perhaps 60, 80 or even 200 of them, is it reasonable to suggest that, with the sort of machinery that operates here, each of these grants will be dealt with any time before 31st March?</P>
    <P>Had the Minister embodied a provision in the Bill, and there seems to be no reason why he should not have done so, stating that those who did the work would be entitled to a grant, I should not have had so much to say on this.  Candidly, I do not like the Bill very much, but was there any reason why the Minister should not have included such a provision in the Bill?</P>
    <P>The Minister makes one of these nebulous promises, that next year we will have a grant from Local Government. Bord Fáilte will receive the Bill with enthusiasm because it will enable them to get rid of derelict sites and further promote the tourist industry. Is it a good idea to give still more power to civil servants and local authorities?  I do not know that local authorities have been, as it were, too hot in utilising the powers they have had up to this.</P>
    <P>I know several cases where elderly people are living on the income they obtain from the controlled rents of two or three houses.  I know, in particular, of two elderly ladies in that position.  They had no other means, They were unable to do up these houses.  The houses fell into disrepair and the local authority were approached to take over the houses and do them up.  The local authority refused.  They were building houses on a new site outside the town.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have an unhappy knack of taking sites and expending large sums on their development. They will not take houses in a village street and do something with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> In every case, such houses ultimately become derelict.  I fear that the same situation will obtain in relation to this measure.  The local authority will tell people that they must do up their houses or they will become derelict sites, unsafe, unsightly, insanitary. The owners of these houses are probably living on a bare pittance.  Will they get a 50 per cent. grant to do up these houses?  If the houses are demolished, their income goes.  I am putting these points before the House so that we may see the direction in which we are moving.  The cases I have quoted may be extreme cases but they are sufficiently numerous to cause anxiety.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have given their views as to what constitutes derelict sites.  One of the greatest eyesores in villages throughout Ireland is the tumbledown houses.  They destroy the appearance of the villages.  Local authorities never take over such sites. They would not look at them.  They want new sites.  They want a new building scheme with a blueprint and all the other trimmings.  What is to stop local authorities taking over these sites and building new houses on them?  That would be of advantage because it would help to hold the people in the villages&mdash;they would live more convenient to schools, churches and so forth&mdash;but local authorities will not do that.</P>
    <P>It is proposed now to give still further power to local authorities to enable them to compel private individuals to do what the local authorities themselves have so signally failed to do, with all their powers and all their financial resources.  The time has come when we must seriously consider the direction in which we appear to be moving.  Do we, or do we not, want the State to do everything for us?  I have been told that the Party opposite stands for private enterprise. There are members of this House who do not agree with private enterprise. Yet, it is the Party which stands for private enterprise which introduces this sweeping measure giving tremendous power to local authorities.  Remember, that power will not be confined to towns and villages.  It extends also to land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> What is happening in the west of Ireland?  Homesteads are being left derelict.  What will happen to these homesteads when they start to fall down?  In some cases, the holdings and homesteads have been bought by syndicates; in others, they are quite derelict.  The fields are full of weeds; the houses are falling down.  Will the local authorities step in and take these over?  Are we to have property-owning local authorities and farmer local authorities?  Will the county councillors become farmers?  I am not as familiar with the west of Ireland as others but I have spent many holidays there.  Is the time coming when the west will be owned entirely by the Forestry Division and by the local authority?  The people who have owned these holdings and homesteads for generations have been compelled to emigrate in search of a living.  Will the local authority be empowered under this measure to take over these homes and holdings?  Will they be permitted to bulldoze the homesteads and use the fields, covered with weeds, for whatever purpose they think fit?  I should like the Minister to answer these questions.</P>
    <P>It is the right and privilege of every Deputy to resist encroachment of the power of the State.  The State can help in a lot of ways, but I, for one, could never subscribe to giving the State such drastic powers.  Probably those who drafted this measure meant well.  The idea was to clear up the unsightly appearance of towns and villages and the rural areas generally. I wonder are we handing ourselves over to a still closer grip by bureaucratic control?  There are many things in life that are worth while and one is the right of the individual to own his own property and to do what he likes with it so long as he does not interfere with either the safety or the health of his neighbours.</P>
    <P>In the 1940 Act, local authorities had all the power they wanted to meet the situation envisaged by the Minister. This is a further encroachment on the rights of the individual.  If the Minister embodies in the Bill the views he outlined in relation to the Supplementary Estimate, one could take a different view.  As the matter is presented to <Col N="713" /> the House, however, it represents nothing but an infringement of the rights of individuals.  It is the duty of every Deputy to defend those rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think it is overdue.  There is one point I should like to have clarified. Would the Minister tell me what constitutes a local authority in relation to the powers contained in this measure? I think a local authority should mean the elected members of the county council, borough council or corporation.  I do not want to see more power vested in county managers.  If it is the intention to vest these powers in county managers, then there is a strong case to be made for abolishing the elected representatives as such. The more responsibility we lay on the shoulders of elected representatives, the higher will be the standard of representation.</P>
      <P>It is useless to give the opportunity to an elected member of a local body of saying when there is a matter of responsibility to be decided: &ldquo;I have no say in it.  The county manager is doing all this.&rdquo;  That is the type of approach we get from a number of elected members of local authorities. I am not going to say that the fault is confined to one side of the House or another, having regard to the politics of the individuals concerned.</P>
      <P>If the intention is that the local authority in this instance means the county manager, the Minister should reconsider it.  When he has an opportunity on an occasion like this he should give the utmost power to local authorities and show the elected members of local authorities that the Government and the House have confidence in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody questions the desirability of dealing with derelict sites.  There are many derelict sites throughout the country.  We must remember that many of them exist because of our past history, because of the difficulties in which our people lived in generations gone by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reading the Bill through I find myself rather uneasy.  The Bill gives very wide and rather arbitrary powers <Col N="714" /> to local authorities.  It must be remembered that our people traditionally are land-minded.  Once you enter a man's land for a purpose of this kind, his resentment is immediately aroused.  Personally, I think the Bill will lead to a good deal of chaos, litigation, resentment and confusion. If it happens that people will band together and resist incursions of the local authority it may lead to very undesirable situations.</P>
    <P>There, are derelict sites all over the island.  There should be some definition of location.  When, there are derelict sites in cities, towns, villages of a certain size, near a tourist road or a main road, there is some reason for having them removed but there are derelict sites in remote parts of the country where a stranger scarcely ever puts a foot.  Does the Minister contemplate that they also should be included in the Bill for removal?</P>
    <P>In many cases there is no title to ownership of these sites.  In such cases it will be easy for the local authority to get possession and to do as they think fit with the land so taken over. Let us be reasonable in this matter.  If sites suitable for building purposes are taken over, they should be reserved for that purpose alone.  If there are sites that are not fit for building purposes which could be used as car parks or amenities of that kind, it would be desirable that they should be so used. What I fear is that these wide powers will be used by local authorities in a way that will arouse resentment.</P>
    <P>Local authorities should be the first to give a lead in the matter of removal of derelict sites.  I know places where terraces of houses have been erected and the space in front of those houses could be regarded as derelict because of the rough nature of the surface.  I have seen instances of that kind even in Cork City.  I do not know whether it is the contractor or the local authority who is responsible.  At all events, the local authority should give the lead in having such places made presentable and put into decent repair so that they will catch the imagination of the passerby.</P>
    <P>As I have said, one becomes uneasy on reading the Bill.  I believe it will <Col N="715" /> lead to a great deal of confusion.  I hope the powers given to local authorities will never have to be used. Local towns bodies, such as the Irish Industrial Development Association, could be very helpful in this matter if they were appealed to to get rid of eye-sores.  They could encourage owners to be reasonable and to accede to requests to get rid of derelict sites.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that many owners of derelict sites are in very poor circumstances.  If they have not the wherewithal to carry out the work and refuse to conform to the regulations, the local authority may carry out the work and claim the cost from these unfortunate people.  How will they meet such claims?  These are matters that should be considered.</P>
    <P>Above all, I would appeal to the Minister to go slowly in this matter if this Bill is passed or I am afraid he will find himself facing many difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Manley has dealt with this matter from the point of view of the owner of land.  I agree with a great deal of what he said. However, as a member of a local authority, I welcome the Bill.  Local authorities find themselves held up very frequently in the acquisition of derelict sites.  In Kilkenny, as in other towns of similar size, in a row of houses there may be one or two which are allowed to become derelict and thus reduce the status of the terrace. In many cases the local authority have found it very difficult to get possession of the sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been much better if the Minister had left this matter in the hands of the elected members of local authorities rather than make it an executive function of the manager. I have nothing but praise for our own county manager but he is not living in the county or city.  He is very far from the problems of our city.  The local representatives are the people to grapple with these problems.  I was speaking to a Deputy.  I pointed out that we always got the utmost co-operation from the county manager. The Deputy pointed out that there <Col N="716" /> could be a change of managers and that future managers might not be prepared to co-operate.  I had to admit that in those circumstances the position would be different.  Members of local authorities are elected by the people, just as Deputies who pass the laws are elected.  Members of local authorities are reasonable men who would deal with matters on a reasonable basis.  The Minister would have been much better advised had he reserved these functions to the members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>This Bill should help to clean up many streets before they become derelict sites.  There may be cases of hardship but I have never known of any local authority which would not be reasonable.  If a landlord is prepared to do something with the property, the local authority will be only too happy to help him.  The last thing the local authority want to do is to interfere with a landlord's rights. They would be most anxious that the owners of property would make full use of it.  I welcome this Bill if only because it enables local authorities to raise the standard of city amenities. We would all like to see our towns and cities in good condition without broken-down houses or walls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tone of the discussion in the main has been one of welcome for the Bill.  I do not know whether the provisions are fully understood. Some misunderstanding undoubtedly has arisen in the minds of some speakers and possibly some further comments on the matters raised might disabuse the minds of those Deputies who are not too clear as to what is intended under this Bill.</P>
      <P>One big objection which a few Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches and some Independents see is that the functions under the Bill come within the ambit of the county manager rather than of the elected representatives, and some very impassioned pleas have been made as to why these should be in the hands of the elected representatives rather than in the hands of the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of powers of the manager versus the elected body, I am <Col N="717" /> always prepared to go as far as anybody else I have heard discussing these matters in this House or outside it.  However, we are now talking about sites which through neglect have become injurious to the amenities or the health of the people in a particular locality, a site so neglected that it may be dangerous and unhealthy and, therefore, not one that could be regarded as of great value since it has been allowed to fall into such a state.  The impression was created by those who wish the local body rather than the manager to deal with this matter that we are giving the manager some extremely powerful weapon.  Just remember the context: a useless, dangerous or unhealthy site which has been allowed to become that way through the neglect of its owner.  At the same time it is completely forgotten that very recently this House has seen fit to approve, without any question whatsoever, the giving of such powers to the manager in regard to the acquisition of land for other purposes under the Local Government (No. 2) Bill which could be most valuable land in the heart of Dublin, land which need not at the moment cause any concern because of being in an unhealthy or dangerous condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that powers in respect of very valuable land are being given in other Bills and have been given in other Acts. This most recent Bill gives that power and it was not questioned here; yet there is this grave concern being expressed in regard to these sites which have been allowed to deteriorate. Lest a Deputy may interject that this Local Government (No. 2) Bill might only apply to Dublin&mdash;I do not hold that that is so, but it might be felt that is a fair argument&mdash;is it not a fact that in relation to other matters such as the acquisition of land for housing in any part of the country the manager has the power of acquisition? And it is not useless, derelict sites that he normally acquires.  That has been accepted by the House not <Col N="718" /> on one occasion but on many occasions.</P>
      <P>We have taken this matter of power being vested in the manager completely out of its context and, wittingly or otherwise, we are making a mountain out of a molehill.  Furthermore acquisition under this measure will be the last resort.  Under the 1940 Act acquisition or the threat of acquisition was the only power granted to deal with derelict sites.  Now acquisition will under the Bill be the last of three different procedures.  The normal procedure will be that the owner, if the owner can be found, will be notified that the site in certain respects is injurious or dangerous.  The manager will point out that he would like him to do something about it.  The owner of that site, having got that notification from the manager, can opt to send in to the manager his proposals as to what he intends to do with that site in order to remedy the defects that have been pointed out to him by the manager.  If the proposed remedies are accepted, if they seem to meet the case by removing the derelict aspect of the site, then the manager will leave it to the owner to proceed with the works.</P>
      <P>That owner can then get the grants provided for in the Supplementary Estimate.  We are making provision in order to enable him to do the minimum that is required in the interest of public health, amenity and safety.  If he does not respond to the invitation to clear the site, the site will be examined probably by the local engineer who knows the district well.  The manager can then, as a second resort, and under section 3 of the Bill, again send to the owner who has ignored his request to make a voluntary effort himself, a statement as to what he requires the owner to do in order that the objectionable site will be brought into proper condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having had the requirements of the manager stated to him the owner may proceed to do what he is asked by the manager.  If he does, the question of grants can be considered in respect of his case.  On the other hand, the owner may decide to do nothing and again to ignore the requirements of the <Col N="719" /> manager.  In that event the manager may propose to acquire the site.  On the other hand, he can do what he has asked the owner to do if the owner has ignored that requisition. If he has to do the work which the owner has refused to do on requisition, then that work will be done, and the cost, less the grant that might apply, will fall to be paid by the owner.  The owner has recourse to the Minister if he feels aggrieved by the requisition of the local authority.</P>
    <P>In any event, after unsuccessful efforts by the manager for some voluntary effort on the part of the owner with regard to a site which is unhealthy, dangerous or in any other respect injurious to amenity, it comes to the point where there is a question of compulsion.  That compulsion, as I say, arises where the work required to be done is carried out by the local authority, the grant is deducted therefrom and the net expenses of the council are then claimed from the owner.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the local authority cannot find the owner, if there is no one to serve notice on and if the site is dangerous or unhealthy, then it is open to the manager to acquire the site and have the job done that requires to be done.  If, arising from such operation, any question as to ownership should arise, this Bill allows extended time in which, subsequent to the acquisition, claims by the owner, who might turn up out of goodness knows where, may be made. Hitherto, only three months were allowed for such claims, but under this Bill the period is 12 months after the actual taking over of the site.  By and large, the whole point of the argument is that, under the 1940 Act, there was only one method open to the manager, that is, to acquire the site, whereas in this Bill every effort is made to get the owner voluntarily to propose what he is prepared to do, and if that is accepted, he is allowed to qualify for the grant.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the owner, having voluntarily made proposals himself, may be required by the local authority, through the manager, to <Col N="720" /> do specified works, and again he can qualify for a grant to help him.  It is only at the point where he refuses to do either of these things that any question of compulsion enters into the matter.  Compulsion or acquisition will be resorted to only if two abortive efforts have been made to get the owner to do something about the site in the interests of the community. Provision is now being made to give a grant of up to 50 per cent. of the cost of the job.</P>
    <P>I do not think, in the overall context, that that is giving the manager undue power, as has been suggested here.  In fact, I might also say that not every Opposition Deputy has the same views.  The last time we discussed this matter, Deputy Coburn actually praised this idea and said that he saw the wisdom of leaving this matter in the hands of the county manager, rather than making it a direct responsibility of the members of the council. He felt that the manager was best fitted to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Lest anyone has any fear that the manager might get out of hand, let us see what are the provisions in regard to the general behaviour of managers in relation to their councils. On this, as on any other matter, we find that there seem to be adequate safeguards to ensure that he will not really get out of hand, and there are ways in which the council members can keep him in line, if in line he must be kept.  There are a number of safeguards open to the councils which, I think, are generally known to members of county councils or other local authorities.  Undoubtedly where the council are doing work, there must be some expenditure and such expenditure will have to be included in the estimate provided for out of the rates.  All relevant information in that regard can be acquired by the local elected representatives from the manager and they are entitled to that information.  They must, in fact, get the information and they must be satisfied with it, and they need not provide any money if the manager does not satisfy them as to the purpose for which it is sought.</P>
    <P>That is one point with regard to the <Col N="721" /> general control of managers.  It is the elected body only who can provide from the rates any moneys for expenditure by the manager or by the council through the manager.  Section 2 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, provides that the manager must inform the members of the local authority before he performs any specified executive function. In other words, in relation to derelict sites, which are dealt with in this Bill, the members could require the manager to inform them of what he is proposing to do before he takes any irrevocable step.  The normal procedure of question and answer at meetings of the county councils comes into the picture also.  By way of question, any councillor can get from the manager information on any matter in connection with these derelict sites, as he may about any other matters, if he has reason to believe that the manager is about to do something which he feels the manager should not do, or that he is going about it the wrong way.</P>
    <P>Again, of course, county councillors are fully aware that if a person is being pressurised by the manager on this, or indeed on any matter, it is most unlikely that the local representatives &mdash; assuming information was brought to them by the aggrieved party at an early date&mdash;could not take effective action at council level.  Any undue hardship which they might see in a case, as presented to them by their constituents, could therefore be avoided.</P>
    <P>For the life of me, I cannot see how any manager can, in fact, do anything under this Bill, if it becomes law, that could be regarded as an injury to any property owner, without the knowledge of the local representatives.  They believing it would do some injustice to an owner, can, in the last resort, have recourse to the powers of Section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, and requisition the manager not to do the particular function.</P>
    <P>Those are the safeguards.  We are talking, in the main, about derelict sites, sites which have become a nuisance, a danger to the public, either to their health or to their amenities or to their actual bodily safety, all <Col N="722" /> through neglect in 99 cases out of 100. That is the type of task we envisage in this measure.  Lest there should be any fears or doubts, I think there are adequate safeguards to ensure that the elected body are, in fact, the effective, controlling people in this matter because the manager, without their co-operation at various stages, cannot do anything under this measure.  He is absolutely powerless to do anything by compulsion or to compel anybody to do anything or to carry out anything which involves the expenditure of council funds without the council's co-operation.  If they do not provide the money, I am quite sure that the manager is not going to do it out of his own pocket.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde, who resumed the debate here tonight, seems to have various misapprehensions, particularly about the scheme of grants outlined in the introduction to the Supplementary Estimate here.  He said that this scheme of grants was merely a sugar pill which is to be swallowed with this objectionable Derelict Sites Bill.  For the information of the Deputy and that of the House generally, the fact is that the Supplementary Estimate and the scheme of grants is not dependent on the passage of this Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants will, in fact, be used independently of the Bill. The powers to make grants and the terms on which grants may be made are wider than those associated with works within the scope of the Bill now before the House.  They may be used not only for the clearance of derelict sites but for providing certain amenities on such sites.  Deputy Esmonde and a number of other Deputies seem to have the general idea that we are trying to put something across, to blind the House to the implications of the Bill by holding out grants under the Supplementary Estimate which is being taken and discussed simultaneously with the provisions of this Bill.  It is undoubtedly true that with the terms of the Bill and the grants, we hope to make a greater impression on the derelict sites problem in the future than we have been able to do in the past by encouraging, <Col N="723" /> through the grants and by the new and extended procedure under the Bill, more voluntary effort and a greater clearance of these eyesores.</P>
    <P>As things stand we can merely use the limited compulsory powers which are the only thing available under the 1940 Act.  This new scheme of grants is not a sugar pill, as has been suggested. These grants are to help in a material way to encourage the clearance of these eyesores, to encourage the provision of amenities and to encourage local development committees, parish councils and such like to do certain local works for the good of the community.  That is the underlying principle and motive of this scheme of grants.  It is far from being what was described by some Deputies here.</P>
    <P>Another point made in regard to these grants was: what is the use in providing even for this year up to 31st March a sum of £5,000?  It is suggested that it is completely misleading in that no part of it will be used and that it will not be called upon.  The fact is we are putting it there.  We could be wrong either up or down on that £5,000 estimate but that it is no mere shadow and no mere misleading figure is what I wish to explain to the House.</P>
    <P>We have in the Department, arising from the announcement of this scheme of grants, various inquiries seeking fuller information.  Arising from that, we hope there will be utilisation of some of that money before the end of March.  The fact is that if we provide it, we will be in a position to pay it out, if called upon. We believe we will be so called upon. If we did not provide it and if we were called upon, we would not have it.  Which is preferable?  Which is the sensible course?  We have announced a scheme of grants.  We are providing an estimated figure of £5,000.  Surely that is a sane and sensible thing to do?  From inquiries we have in the Department, some part, and possibly all, of that £5,000 will be called on before the end of March. It is for that reason, and not for the reason of trying to get a Bill across <Col N="724" /> the House that might otherwise be objectionable, that this Supplementary Estimate is, in fact, being discussed at the moment.</P>
    <P>A few Deputies also expressed the fear that acquisition of land without buildings could, in fact, develop into the acquisition of a small farm and that a weed-covered field would be fair game for the operations of the county manager, that an avaricious county manager would see in the weeds in that field a reason for his using his powers to acquire and take over the field and use it for any purpose thereafter. Weeds, as we know, in the normal course of events, are dealt with under the Noxious Weeds Legislation. That, I presume, is still the case.  There is no question whatever of the fact that there are weeds in a field in itself inducing the manager to invoke the powers under this Bill to acquire the land&mdash;always assuming he would have the co-operation of the elected members in any such action and that it was possible for him to carry it out.</P>
    <P>The question was put as to what type of land without buildings could be a derelict site.  I think that is what has given rise to the fears expressed by some Deputies.  A very typical example of land without buildings which could be described as a derelict site would be a dump in a field or a field adjoining a public roadway or laneway which was causing damage to the local amenities by unsightliness, odour or rat infestation which would be very injurious to the health of the community.  That would be a good example of land without buildings which could be regarded as a derelict site.  I think everybody appreciating that will agree that that type is something we should have adequate powers to deal with.  It is in the context of the Bill that land, misused in that manner, will be dealt with under the powers we hope will be given to our local authorities if the House agrees to pass this measure.</P>
    <P>A matter that was mentioned by more than one Deputy was that the Bill should not be solely for the benefit of the tourist.  I have not suggested that the Bill is merely for the benefit <Col N="725" /> of the tourist.  I appreciate to the full that a large volume of our people are concerned about the appearance of their towns, villages and the countryside in general.  To suggest that the clearance and improvement of derelict sites should be dealt with merely from the tourist point of view is entirely wrong.  It will be good for the country generally.  It will make our countryside, our towns and our villages more pleasing to the tourist.  That is all to the good.  It should remove some of the complaints which very often are the only complaints by some of our very satisfied tourists when departing from our shores.  Very often their one and only complaint is that they have seen these broken-down, derelict and unsightly buildings, and unsightliness in a general way in and around our towns.  We should remedy that position and at the same time beautify our countryside or make less objectionable some of its features for our people as a whole and for the tourist.  To do such work in the context of tourism is good business.  Anything which improves our economy is directly to the benefit of our population as a whole and to our country in general.  In addition, our young people will come across fewer of these eyesores which sometimes they cannot avoid seeing daily.</P>
    <P>A matter raised by Deputy Coburn and possibly other Deputies was the point, rather than the accusation, that big businessmen may now get grants for demolishing old buildings.  Big businessmen or small businessmen will get the grants if the sites are derelict and injurious in any of the aspects I have mentioned.  Whether the man is big or small in business or whether he is a businessman at all does not materially alter the case.  Anything we can do to encourage people to improve unsightly premises or buildings applies to big and small alike.</P>
    <P>We are not giving the grants as a payment to people but as an encouragement to them to remedy defects in their property which have occurred through neglect over the years, which neglect is now an injury to the general public amenity and possibly to the health of the people and a danger <Col N="726" /> to their safety.  We are not paying a man because he lets his place fall into disrepair but rather to encourage him to remove unsightly buildings and to provide an amenity on a site which is otherwise dangerous to health. Whether a man has a large or a small derelict property, whether he is a big or a small businessman or is not a businessman at all is beside the point. We want to clear these places.  We are giving encouragement by way of grants.  It is not a question of who owns them or how well or how badly off he is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he intends to build on the site he will get a double grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He will, provided the site is declared derelict.  We give the grant to clear it.  He or anybody else who so clears it and thereafter conforms with the provisions of the Housing Acts will be given a grant for the house.  I do not see why we should not encourage the building of some useful dwelling thereon by giving to the person concerned as good a grant as we would give if he forgot about the derelict site and built on a new site.</P>
      <P>In towns where sites are derelict and may be cleared in a voluntary manner with the aid of grants as a result of this provision it is necessary that further encouragement be provided and that the owner will get a grant to build a proper house on such a site. The result will be good not only for the appearance of the locality but it will serve a useful purpose in the life of the community either as a dwelling or a business premises.  In so far as dwellings are concerned, the Housing Acts facilities and grants will be available for building on a site which may have been cleared as a result of a scheme of grants for derelict sites and under this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can a local authority qualify for these grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The local authorities will get the grants in like manner as will the individual or the local development association or the local parish council.  An individual owner <Col N="727" /> or a local group in the form of a development committee or parish council cannot have access to any of these grants without first going through their local authority.  They make their application to the local authority who, in their knowledge of and general interest in the locality, will pass on information with regard to whether or not it is a proper proposal. The local authority will have control in that matter.  It will not be a question of the individual or the local group dealing directly with the office in Dublin.  They will deal through their local authority with the office in Dublin so far as these grants and their availability are concerned.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been said by a number of Deputies by way of what I might call criticism of having appeal procedure to the Minister rather than to the courts.  While the proposed procedure was criticised, at the same time there were other Deputies who disagreed with the criticism and felt that recourse to the courts was not a very wise suggestion, that costly court proceedings could be involved in a dispute regarding a derelict site, that the value of the matter being contested in court might not be very great and that, in fact, the cost of the proceedings might exceed the value of what was in dispute.  Recourse to the Minister is not in any way a new departure.  It applies in many other important matters and we feel that the proper line is that it should be so in this not-so-important matter.  As I say, Deputies have spoken with divided minds on this matter.  Some advocated that we should stick to the idea that appeals should be to the Minister and that in this Bill we should not be the cause of bringing about court proceedings which could be costly and the cost of which could outstrip the value of the property in dispute initially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley raised the question of the extension of time for claims for compensation and he wanted to know whether or not the extension from three months, as in the present law, to 12 months in the new Bill would mean the hold-up of operations <Col N="728" /> under this measure.  The answer is that no such effect would ensue and that the question of extending the period for claims does not in any way mean that an owner could hold up operations in a particular case for 12 months.  The fact is that the ownership of the site would be vested in the local authority and it would be only after that that the claim would arise.  Twelve months is given as the time in which the claim may be made rather than three months because, even in the limited operations which have taken place, certain cases of hardship have arisen where an owner might have been at the ends of the earth and did not realise that a certain action had been taken and the three months having expired, his claim was out of court.  We are extending the period to avoid such cases of hardship in the future and in these days of ready communication 12 months is a fairly satisfactory period.  We do not feel that any cases of hardship should arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham raised the question of railway embankments and abandoned railway stations and he wanted to know whether these were matters which came under this Bill. The fact is that embankments and long stretches of property, which in the main could be said to be derelict, are not provided for as such in the Bill but undoubtedly within the Bill there is power to deal with various points along such embankments, each one of which although not connected can be regarded as a separate derelict site. Appropriate action can be taken in regard to each individual case, but not in regard to a length of embankment of two or three miles.  It means that the powers of the Bill are capable of dealing with what I think the Deputy had in mind when he raised this instance and named railway embankments and derelict railway stations.  These will undoubtedly be covered by this measure if the House agrees to its passage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin mentioned the question of water and referred to the canals in Dublin in particular.  The fact is that, for the purposes of the law, water can be regarded as land and just as in the case of railway embankments <Col N="729" /> and long stretches of property, while they may not be provided for as long stretches of canals, the portions giving offence can be regarded as separate cases and dealt with separately as eyesores or dangers to the public, or whatever the complaint may be.  I want to assure the Deputy that this matter of the canals can be dealt with under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The fact is land includes water and the answer which I know the Deputy wishes to have, regardless of the seeming inconsistency of saying land is water for the purpose of the law, is that this measure will cover the type of thing which he raised and its provisions are capable of dealing with the difficulties there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde dealt with a matter on which, lest it might lead to some confusion in the minds of Deputies, I think I should comment.  He was taking, as he said, an extreme case.  He took the case of a house occupied or owned by people who were growing old and which, due to the rents they were getting, they were not able to maintain in a proper state of repair. He more or less expressed the fear that those houses, although occupied, because they were in a bad state of repair and had a derelict appearance, could be acquired compulsority, by the manager, under this measure.  Actually, such dwellings are excluded from the definition of derelict sites.  Derelict buildings, as we might describe them, which had fallen into that state would be dealt with possibly by one of the provisions in the Housing Acts but would not come within the definition of derelict sites.  Any fears he may have that this could work to the disadvantage of that type of person in those circumstances are not justified; he need have no fears in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that, as a whole, the Bill before the House was brought into being initially by virtue of the <Col N="730" /> fact that the definition of derelict sites in the 1940 Act was found to be defective. That Act was not, in fact, capable, because of those shortcomings, of making any appreciable contribution to the cleaning-up of our towns and countryside.  It was to remedy that situation that the new measure was brought in and the opportunity was availed of to make other changes here and there that appeared to be desirable as a result of the experience of the present law over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The idea generally is that we should clean up our towns, villages and countryside wherever possible so as to lessen the danger of injury to the health of our people and to remedy the general neglect which there has been for a long time.  Somebody has mentioned that that neglect was a legacy of our history.  Be that as it may, the fact is that we have quite a legacy of unsightly buildings.  We have not the appearance of having any great taste in these matters in general. It is a disgrace that this should be so.  It is worse if the health of our people is undermined and it would be worse still if, as a result of the dangerous condition into which many of these buildings have been allowed to fall, injury or damage were done to some innocent passerby.</P>
    <P>All these dangers are there and we know it but if this measure is utilised by the local authorities, through the instrumentality of the county managers but always under the effective control of the elected representatives of the people, we can go a long way towards removing those blots on our landscape for the benefit of our own people, for the improvement of the amenities of the country and for the benefit of the tourists who come here and who contribute so much to the well-being of our economy.  The grants which we are providing should be an added encouragement and give an impetus to the whole drive.  While we may have to pressurise in certain things, it will be admitted that in pushing on in this matter we are pushing something which the vast majority of the people wish to have done.</P>
    <P>We are making a serious effort by way of these grants to make a worthwhile <Col N="731" /> contribution to the cost of doing these jobs, of doing this backlog of clearing-up which is so badly needed throughout the country for the benefit of our own people and the tourists who come to it.  I feel that the provisions of the Bill are necessary and that it is a desirable form of legislation.  I feel that the provision of money by the proposed scale of grants is a very desirable encouragement in order that our countryside may be cleared up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell me whether in this matter of the improvement of derelict sites the local authority will be liable for 50 per cent. of the expenditure and whether they are empowered to remove hulks and other eyesores of that kind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy any indication there but I might say that while we hope that local authorities will do as the Deputy has said, we would listen in a sympathetic way to the various matters they might put before us.  It does not follow that a heavy burden would fall to be borne by the ratepayers.  It is only the residue that will come to be a burden on the rates.  In the case of sites that are of some value to the owner, even if up to the present he has neglected them, he will avail of the grant and the suggestion of the local authority to do the job.  We are hoping that that will be so.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Electoral Law in their Interim Report which was presented to this House on 26th October and to the Seanad on 9th November.</P>
      <P>I should like at the outset to express my appreciation of the work which is being done by the Joint Committee.  The law which they have been asked to examine is very complex and in many ways archaic.  It goes, in oppressive detail, into matters which we should nowadays, if we were dealing with them completely anew, treat a lot more generally.  The examination, revision and codification of this branch of the law is overdue and I welcome the speedy presentation of the interim report as an earnest of the Joint Committee's desire to comply with my request, when moving the motion for the establishment of the Committee, that its report should not be unduly delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will have received with the Bill an explanatory memorandum <Col N="733" /> which sets out briefly what the measure proposes to do.  The interim report of the Joint Committee, on which the Bill is largely based, describes more fully the changes which are proposed and the reasons for them.  I do not think, therefore, that it is necessary for me to go too deeply, at this stage at any rate, into the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the important proposals is contained in Section 3 and in the Schedule which provides for the repeal of the prohibition on the registration of Gardaí as voters at Dáil elections. In future, if this provision is enacted, Gardaí can vote at Dáil and Presidential elections and at referenda. Deputies may remember that as long ago as 28th April, 1959, in a reply to a Parliamentary Question, I gave an undertaking to introduce legislation to deal with this point.</P>
    <P>Under Section 6 of the Bill, Gardaí will be entered on the postal voters lists.  This provision is desirable because, at election time, Gardaí are liable to be assigned to duties outside their own polling districts or constituencies.</P>
    <P>Under Section 1 of the Electoral Act, 1923, a member of the Defence Forces living in barracks or other place provided by the Government is not to be treated, for registration purposes, as being ordinarily resident there or in occupation of business premises.  He is, however, entitled to be registered in the constituency where he states he would, but for his service, be ordinarily resident.  Section 21 of that Act gives soldiers the option to be entered on the postal voters list if they so desire.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the present Bill proposes that a soldier will be registered wherever he is ordinarily resident on the qualifying date.  Since we are repealing the provision in Section 1 of the 1923 Act which states that he is not to be treated as ordinarily resident in the barracks where he is living, this new provision will mean that members of the Defence Forces may be registered in the constituency in which they are living in barracks.  It is further proposed that a soldier may <Col N="734" /> claim to be registered in the place where, but for his service, he would be ordinarily resident.  This provision preserves a right which soldiers already have of voting in their &ldquo;home&rdquo; constituency, as distinct from the one where they are stationed.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the Gardaí, all members of the Defence Forces will in future be entered on the postal voters list.  The provisions for postal voting by Gardaí and soldiers will be applied to local elections under Section 17 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another important provision recommended by the Joint Committee is that at Section 5 under which an elector's age will be taken to be his age on the 15th April, when the register comes into force, rather than seven months earlier, on 15th September, when the preparation of the register officially begins.  This provision, if enacted and implemented, will mean that about 20,000 to 25,000 persons who would not otherwise have been included in the forthcoming register should be registered in it.</P>
    <P>I may say that, on 13th September last, I notified registration officers of the possibility of the change and told them to make arrangements for its implementation, should this legislation be enacted.  I also told them to give the new proposal the widest possible publicity so that all persons affected may claim to be registered.  This publicity has been supplemented by radio broadcasts, stamp cancellation slogans for which I arranged for this and future years, news reports and public announcements in the press.  Notwithstanding these efforts, some persons may still be omitted from the register and, therefore, be left without a vote. It is too late on polling day to correct this situation.  Now is the time to act. I would suggest that every person should take a look at the electors lists in his local post office and see if his name appears.  In particular, persons in the 21 year old age group would be well advised to write to their county registrar at the local circuit court office to make certain they are registered.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Joint Committee dealing with voting by blind and incapacitated voters are <Col N="735" /> their only recommendations which I have found myself unable to accept without qualification.  Briefly, I consider that a person should be allowed to assist one or two blind or incapacitated voters to record their vote, instead of only one such voter as recommended by the Joint Committee, and I have not accepted their recommendation that a person assisting a blind or incapacitated voter should be obliged to complete a declaration of secrecy. The Bill contains a condition, additional to those suggested by the Joint Committee, requiring the person assisting such voters to be at least 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>At present a presiding officer can refuse a request by a blind or incapacitated voter to have his ballot paper marked for him if the request is made within four hours of the close of the poll, and the officer considers that acceding to it would obstruct other voters.  This discretion to refuse will remain in the case of requests for the presiding officer himself to mark a blind or incapacitated voter's ballot paper under the existing procedure in the presence of the agents but will not apply where such a voter wishes to have his paper marked for him by a companion.</P>
    <P>I propose these departures from the recommendations of the Joint Committee as a result of pressing representations which were made to me by a deputation from the National League of the Blind here in Leinster House shortly after the publication of the interim report.  I think that the changes are reasonable and that they should be accepted.</P>
    <P>Matters not dealt with in the interim report are the continuance by Section 2 of the Bill of part of the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1868, and the Currupt Practices Commission Expenses Act, 1869, and the proposal in Section 7 to assimilate the procedures for fixing the latest days for nominations and polling at bye-elections and general elections.  Under this section a somewhat longer maximum period for fixing the polling day than exists at present is suggested. The intention of this change is to <Col N="736" /> enable a sufficiently long period to be allowed between nomination and polling to enable ballot papers to be sent to postal voters abroad and returned by them in time to be reckoned as countable.</P>
    <P>The Acts of 1868 and 1869 were continued up to 31st December, 1960 by the Expiring Laws Act, 1952.  It is intended that they should be continued in operation until they can be revised and assimilated into the general electoral code.  It is considered appropriate, since they are purely electoral enactments, that they should be continued by this Electoral Bill.</P>
    <P>Under Parts III, IV and V of the Bill, the changes being made in the Dáil code by Parts I and II will, where appropriate, be carried into the referenda, presidential and local election codes.</P>
    <P>The Bill, I may say, at first sight strikes one as complex and involving much legislation by reference.  We may, however, I think, comfort ourselves with the thought that it is a step towards the eventual rationalisation and consolidation of the law, towards which the Joint Committee and my Department are now working.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to suggest that any ideas on electoral matters which occur to Deputies and which do not directly relate to the provisions of this Bill might appropriately be submitted by them for consideration by the Joint Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, this is an agreed measure, on the basis of the interim report which was presented to the House after consideration by the Joint Committee on Electoral Reform.  As most Deputies are familiar with the work of that Committee, or some of its work, it is unlikely that there will be any dispute about the terms of this measure. I should like at this stage to express, as a member of the Joint Committee, our appreciation and thanks to the officials of the Department of Local Government for their co-operation and the interest they have taken in the work of that Committee.  The help and assistance which they rendered to the Committee made our deliberations <Col N="737" /> much simpler and assisted greatly the decisions which were arrived at.  I have no doubt that other members of the Committee will feel, as I do, that the help and assistance we received was indeed most beneficial and useful.  I may also say at this stage that we were fortunate in having a chairman who was helpful, considerate and patient in dealing with the various points made by the members.</P>
      <P>The improvements suggested in this measure are desirable and practicable. In so far as they amend the law, they will certainly be welcomed.  For some years now there has been a general view that the Garda Síochána should have the right to vote at Dáil elections. This measure will enable them to exercise that right at the next election and arrangements are being made to provide a postal vote for the Gardaí on lines similar to the postal vote already available to Army personnel.</P>
      <P>The decision was taken by the Joint Committee that from next April for the first time persons who have reached the age of 21 not later than the 15th April next will have the right to have their names entered on the register. Heretofore, a person had to be 21 on the 15th September of the previous year.  Beginning with this register, which is at present being compiled, a person who attains 21 will have the right to vote in the next election if that person is 21 not later than 15th April.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, he issued instructions on the basis of the recommendation made by the Joint Committee to all county registrars or other officials compiling the register so that appropriate action might be taken in time to include those who would reach 21 on or before 15th April next.  I understand that in some parts of Dublin some part of the register had actually been compiled or work had commenced on it before that direction was issued and that consequently in certain cases or places some individuals who will attain 21 not later than the 15th April next may find that their names have not been entered on the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While undoubtedly there has been <Col N="738" /> been considerable emphasis in recent weeks on the importance of ensuring that each individual entitled to be on the register is on it, and while this measure now is a further indication that persons should ensure that their names are entered, it may be that all these public indications will go unnoticed by certain persons and I should be glad if the Minister would discuss with the appropriate persons responsible for the compilation of the register in Dublin whether it would be possible for the staff concerned to review the area or part of the register which they have compiled.  No doubt most of them will be familiar with the part they compiled first and if there are any persons whose names have been omitted it might be possible to include them on the register.  Undoubtedly the publicity which is focussed on the matter will direct attention to the necessity for each person to ensure that his or her name is on the register.</P>
    <P>This will be the register used in the next election and no matter what the actual date of the election may be, a person may be reasonably certain, provided he or she survives that he or she will have the right to vote if his or her name is entered on this register at a general election.  It is rarely a register is compiled so that a person can be so certain that, provided he survives until the actual date of the election, that will be the effective register for the next general election.</P>
    <P>I note from the proposals in the Bill that the Minister has departed to a slight extent from the recommendation of the Joint Committee in connection with blind voters and persons who are incapacitated and unable to mark a ballot paper themselves.  Between now and the Committee Stage I should like the Minister to consider whether that change is satisfactory.  I notice from his remarks that he has made the change in deference to representations made by the National League of the Blind and I have no doubt they have valid reasons for their viewpoint.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that should be mentioned at this stage.  A decision was reached by the Joint Committee subsequent to the decisions enshrined in the first joint interim <Col N="739" /> report.  That is a decision concerning the form of nomination paper or rather the form or method of nomination for Dáil candidates.  We are all familiar with the somewhat antiquated procedure under which a Dáil candidate is obliged not merely to have a proposer and seconder but also to have eight assentors.  As a result of the experience of everybody, I think, who has stood as a candidate and also as a result of our consideration in the Joint Committee there was general agreement that the present form of nomination is antiquated and unsuitable for a modern democracy, that in fact it is open to abuse, that it serves no useful purpose and that the system should be changed substantially; that provided a person is eligible to be a candidate that person should be entitled to have himself or herself nominated without the procedure which has up to this attended the presentation of nomination papers.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published, the Joint Committee have informally considered this matter and I believe I am expressing the view unanimously expressed there when I say that if it is possible to frame an amendment which would include a change in this measure, it was the opinion of the Joint Committee that we should do so.  As I say, when we considered the matter the Minister had already published this Bill.  In fact, the original decision was taken subsequent to the first joint report and consequently could not be included in it.  There is every likelihood that the permanent measure will not be enacted before the next election, especially as, in the spring of next year, we shall be dealing with financial business as well as whatever legislation is left over from this session and it may well be that there will be no opportunity available for consideration of the permanent measure.</P>
    <P>I want to mention, therefore, at this stage that it is proposed to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage for the purpose of simplifying the procedure under which a person is nominated as a candidate for election to the Dáil.  Subject to these observations, <Col N="740" /> this measure should, I think, have the concurrence of all sections in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is long overdue.  Its purpose is to bring electoral law into line with modern conditions. I have a suspicion that most of our electoral law at the moment was initiated and passed by Governments which were not exactly favourably disposed towards the Irish people.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like the Minister to tell me what will be the constituency of a Garda.  Will it be the constituency in which he was born or that in which he is serving?  If it is the constituency in which he is serving, why include him on the postal voters' list?  At the moment presiding officers and polling clerks are allowed to vote in the booth in which they are presiding or clerking, as the case may be.  I think the same system should apply where the Garda are concerned, provided the constituency is the constituency in which the Garda happens to be stationed at the time of the election.</P>
      <P>There is no change with regard to those who may be compelled to vote after the actual closing time.  I refer to those who are in the polling station before the actual closing time but who are refused a ballot paper after 9 o'clock.  It is, of course, within the competence and power of a presiding officer so to refuse.  Very often, old people and those whose sight is not so good spend an unduly long time marking their ballot papers.  Very often, that occurs in the last half hour.  I suggest that presiding officers should be empowered to issue ballot papers to all those present in the polling station before 9 o'clock.  I know cases where people were refused ballot papers even though they were in the polling station before 9 o'clock.  They were turned out without voting.  There is nothing to be gained by that.  There seems to be no point in doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me why it is that people whose names have been on the register for two or three elections suddenly find themselves struck off?  The Garda as a whole are very careful in compiling the register and <Col N="741" /> very careful in eliminating those who should not be on it.  It looks like political victimisation to me when a person who is living in a locality, has never left it, is not a migratory labourer, or anything like that, suddenly finds himself removed from the register. Certain rate collectors are accused and in most cases it is the Fianna Fáil rate collectors who are so accused. The Minister can afford to smile at that because it pays a dividend, as far as he is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister ever know of a case in which a voter's name was struck off for no known reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>When one finds that none of the Fianna Fáil voters are missing, as has happened in my constituency, one cannot help wondering if it is an accident.  If it is an accident, it is certainly a very happy accident for Fianna Fáil.  I regard it, however, as a very serious matter, irrespective of whether the voter will vote for or against me.  It is a very serious matter for a voter to personate another. Surely it is even more serious for someone to strike out deliberately a voter's name and deny that voter the franchise?  I suggest there should be pretty strict punishment for anyone who does that deliberately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that the nomination procedure where the Dáil is concerned is rather archaic.  A candidate must get a number of people to nominate him.  I do not see why the nomination paper should not be simplified. I do not know what possible abuse the present eight or nine assentors are supposed to safeguard against. I quite appreciate that there must be some method to prevent people seeking nominations merely for their own aggrandisement or simply as a joke.  Certain warped minds might regard such a procedure as good fun. <Col N="742" /> Frankly, I think the deposit of £100 is an ample safeguard, plus a proposer and a seconder.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure.  My only regret is that the Minister did not go a little further along the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a little experience of elections and my experience differs somewhat from that of a Party man.  I accept that all competent persons should have a vote.  I agree that the Garda should have a vote.  We should make certain, however, that the politics of the individual Garda are kept secret.  The Garda are responsible for ensuring that elections are carried out properly and the temptation might be there, if candidates were permitted to canvass the Garda, to get to know their politics. It is a funny thing that when people are of the same political mind, they are not above doing things they should not do.  The Guards should be above suspicion.  I recognise the Guards' right to vote but everything should be done to see that the barrack room is not made a propaganda room. I doubt if there should be any canvassing or electioneering activity carried out in a Garda barracks.  While the Garda should have the right to vote, it should be secret.</P>
      <P>I agree that postal voting should continue for the Defence Forces.  I also agree that the blind should be helped to vote, although in their case I am rather worried because canvassers on all sides make it their business to bring in the blind and I am quite certain that Party canvassers influence the blind in voting.  I do not suppose there is any way out of that difficulty.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to persons who are incapacitated.  I often wonder if crippled persons or persons in hospital should not have a postal vote. Why should they be deprived of a vote because they are unable to make their way to the polling booths?  In their case, a medical certificate might be used in giving them a postal vote. I am going on the principle that all persons should have a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why fathers of families <Col N="743" /> who have to go to England in order to keep their families should be denied a vote.  They are making a contribution to the economy of this State.  From experience as a member of the Corporation, I know the problems that these people have to face. The family at home may not be getting enough and the father may be getting only barely enough for existence. A father of a family who is forced to go to England temporarily is denied a vote, although he may be at home at election time.  His continuity with the State is maintained by the fact that his family are here and that he is contributing to the family.  Sons and daughters who emigrate may remain away but the father who emigrates temporarily and leaves his family here should have some claim to a vote.</P>
    <P>A Deputy referred to the fact that it is necessary to be in a polling station at 9 p.m. in order to have the right to vote.  I was at a polling station at St. Michael's School at two minutes to nine on the night of the last election and the Guard, on instructions, closed the door.  The Guard was challenged. He took out his watch and admitted that it was two minutes to nine.  Otherwise, he would not have allowed four people who were standing at the door to go in.  No one has the right to keep people out.  According to complaints in the Press, in some places the polling booth was closed at 8.50 p.m. because of the number of people who were inside.  There should be right of entry until 9 o'clock.  It is another matter whether persons should have the right to vote after 9 o'clock.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not there should be some change in the form of the ballot paper.  I do not see why a man who happens to be lucky enough to have a name starting with &ldquo;A,&rdquo;&ldquo;B&rdquo; or &ldquo;C,&rdquo; should get a few hundred votes to which he is not entitled. There is a chunk vote.  People who do not know the difference start with the name at the top of the ballot paper and go to the bottom.  If the whole subject were investigated, it would be found that a number of persons are <Col N="744" /> members of this House who have no right to be members; they are just here by chance.  Why should the ballot paper not be circular so that we can all have a chance of the chunk vote?  Why should all these votes go to one or two people?  A number of people have changed their names to the Irish form in order to capitalise on that chunk vote and they do not deny it.  It is a serious matter.  200 or 300 votes can make a tremendous difference and have put members into this House who, by right, should not be members.  At least, it could be argued that because their names had the initial &ldquo;A&rdquo;&ldquo;B&rdquo; or &ldquo;C,&rdquo; they got in by a short head.  It is doubtful if they are legitimately entitled to be members.  I make the point for consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I maintain that persons of 18 years of age should have a vote.  Persons of that age are subject to all the rigours of the law.  Legally, they are regarded as being of full mind and knowledge.  Surely they are more entitled to vote than doting old people? In England, several persons were hanged at 18 years of age.  Why should men be conscripted at 18 years of age and forced to fight and to die and yet not have the right to vote? Why should they be allowed to marry at 16 and to rear families and yet be denied the right to vote?  It is quite obvious that this is a conspiracy by the oldsters who want to ensure that there will not be too many young people coming in to throw them out. It is mere selfishness and concern for themselves.  I maintain that if persons of 18 years of age are regarded as being responsible in every other respect, they certainly have the right to vote.</P>
    <P>On the question of abuses, the Minister should do something about personation because personation is practised on a substantial scale by Parties.  It is not practised by individuals because they have not got the machine to do it, even if they wanted to do it.  Parties practise it.  The view is that because the other side do it, they have the right to do it.  The reason there is so much personation is that the Guards do not take it seriously. <Col N="745" /> In fact, Parties do not bother to make charges.  It is like the pot calling the kettle black.  They are afraid to make a charge in case the other side might make a counter charge.  This whole business of abuse is treated as a big joke by political Parties and people will not be afraid to abuse the law while that situation continues.</P>
    <P>If a charge is made, a person has to be sworn.  The average agent is afraid that, if he swears a persons, he may be sued, if he does not make his point.  Because of that danger, he is afraid to challenge.  I do not think an agent should be liable.  He should be allowed to challenge as much as he likes.  In that case, there would be considerably less personation.  It is a serious matter and it is the Minister's job to do something about it.</P>
    <P>On the question of expenses&mdash;this is another joke&mdash;we are told it is an offence to spend too much money.  I was reading a short time ago the life of Beaverbrook, the Press baron, and he explained that on one occasion his friend, Winston Churchill, lost the famous Dundee election by a handful of votes and, because the editor of the paper in question did not back Churchill to the full, he sacked him. That proves the point that if you have newspapers and big money on your side, you will win.  It does not matter what the law says.  You are told a candidate can spend only a certain amount of money.  Let us take a Party candidate who has newspaper support.  That candidate will get unlimited space in the newspaper.  It may be said he has got it for nothing. He is not buying the space but he is getting it in a backhand way. Thousands of pounds can be spent on publicity by a newspaper allied to the Party candidate.  In that way, he is able to get around the law.</P>

I shall take advantage of the Committee Stage to say more on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one small point which I think I raised on some other occasion, that is, the question of the time during which the register is compiled.  The register is compiled in September of each year and for a month or two afterwards, but that is not what I want to deal with.  I wish to refer to the publication of the register.  The register is published and displayed in post offices and employment exchanges and various other places in or about this time, the first week in December or the last week in November.  It varies from place to place.  I do not say there is specific or widespread variation, but while the list may be displayed in Wexford on the first of the month, it may not be displayed in Limerick until the 5th of the month.  Anybody who has a grievance in respect of the register or any person who believes that he or she should be included in the register must make a claim before 18th or 20th December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that not a very short period during which a person may claim a vote? It is well known that in the rural areas people have not the same opportunities to visit these places to scan through the register to see whether or not their names are there and to make their claim for a vote within a period that sometimes may be only three weeks or less.  The objections are heard sometimes in January.  I submit this is not the proper time for this procedure. There are too many holidays and bank holidays&mdash;I will not say for ordinary purposes but for this purpose&mdash;and there is a general air of festivity. <Col N="747" /> People are not politically conscious.  It is not a time when they would be as worried as they ought to be about such matters.  This procedure of claiming one's vote or lodging of objections should be done at some other time of the year, instead of when the weather is bad and when people are not in the habit of travelling into post offices.  I would therefore ask the Minister to see what improvement can be effected in that respect.</P>
    <P>The register should be compiled at some other time, say, in the months of May and June.  There is a very good case for asking rate collectors and other officers to compile the register of electors in May, June and July and for hearing any objections or claims for votes in October and November.  Rate collectors are the people who are mainly concerned in the compilation of the register.  They are particularly busy in February and March in trying to make their collection. Also in the month of September they are engaged in the collection of rates to a certain extent, and that is supposed to be the period during which they are compiling the register.  Therefore, from the point of view of rate collectors and the general public, the Minister should switch the period for the compilation of the register and the period during which people may make objections in respect of the register of electors or make claims for votes.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave, in opening the discussion on this measure, had a few things to say in regard to the new age limit for qualification as it particularly affects Dublin City and has asked that since part of the city check had already been done before the notification went out from my Department on 13th September, we should, by co-operating with the people in charge in Dublin, have another check done in the area that was missed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that every possible device that we can think of and every device the returning officers and the registrars in Dublin can avail of are being tried to ensure that each voter who might otherwise be left out and who would reach the age of 21 between 15th September and 15th of next April will <Col N="748" /> be put on.  Whether we can get another check done is a matter with which I dealt in reply to a Parliamentary Question.  I am afraid the difficulties are even more pressing now and I do not think it is possible to hold out any hope of such a re-check being done. However, as regards publicity of one kind or another and in so far as facilities can be made available in any way, the House can rest assured that my Department, in conjunction with the returning officers and registrars concerned, will make every effort to ensure that the facility which this Bill provides will be available to the people in the 21 year age group and that they will be on the register when it appears next April.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of a departure from the interim report with regard to companion marking of papers for blind or incapacitated voters is concerned, the Deputy and the House can be quite assured that the case made to me by the National League of the Blind was indeed a very telling and pressing one.  I may say, at this stage, that we are, after all, making this change in order to help these people, and if a small detail change is to stand between what is being given and what they want, no damage is being done in any way to anyone else.  It is only right that we should facilitate those we are making provision to help.  If it were not for that attitude and for the idea that we want to help them, we would not be making any provision for them at all.  Therefore, as I say, the case is of their own proposing.  Representations were made to me since the publication of the report which I felt it incumbent on me to include in the Bill, and certain provisions were added, if you like, in order to meet their wishes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also mentioned the procedure for nominations.  This matter has, I understand, been discussed by the Joint Committee since the provisions now contained in the Bill were reported on, and there is no doubt that there are one hundred and one other things, each and all of which could, in fact, be held to be something that we could put into this <Col N="749" /> Bill, even by way of amendment.  This is a Bill which, by its very nature we urgently want to get through the House because of the fact that it deals with provisions for matters such as registration of voters which we are endeavouring to have completed at the moment.  Certain complications could arise because of that urgency.</P>
    <P>The Committee made an interim report arising from that urgency, and I imagine that to add any extraneous matter at this stage, even though a good case could be made for its inclusion, would give rise to questions as to why thousands of other things were not included as well.  In addition, with regard to a particular matter which has not been fully examined in its true light in so far as I and my Department, and indeed the Government, are concerned, I could not say straight off that I shall or shall not accept it.  I would feel that it is a matter which is being reported on by the Committee and will be considered.</P>
    <P>This is not necessarily a complete, final and permanent measure.  In fact it could be followed possibly in the next six months by another Bill.  I am not saying it will be, but it is quite possible that it could be, if the matters to be reported on by the Joint Committee present themselves in the months that lie ahead.  If we can get around to getting a decision on this report, as I say, there is no real reason that I can see why we might not have another instalment, as it were, and a redrafting of certain provisions of our electoral code.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick asked what was the constituency of a member of the Garda.  His constituency is the one in which he is normally resident, and his constituency qualification is that of the ordinary individual, the same as the qualification for any one of us here or any other person throughout the land.  He will qualify by virtue of the same provision as any other ordinary citizen of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick also wanted to know why a member of the Garda should be made to vote by post and not record his vote in the same way as a polling clerk or presiding officer. <Col N="750" /> The fact is, as I mentioned on Second Reading, it is not quite the same thing. In fact, quite frequently Garda are moved out into different areas.  Very often, on the day of the election, they are moved out into different constituencies. It might be said that that holds out no real difficulty and that we make arrangements where presiding officers or polling clerks are moved out.  The big difference is that, in 99 out of 100 cases, so far as polling clerks and presiding officers are concerned, the place they are to be assigned to is decided some days in advance of the date of the poll and the person who would assign them to the various posts throughout the constituency is the returning officer in whose control and power it lies to make available to them the vote or ballot at the particular station in which they are employed in relation to the election.</P>
    <P>The Garda may not have knowledge of being moved out until the day before, and, in some cases, the morning of, the election.  It would be impossible for them to communicate to the returning officer all the various switching that would be bound to take place and he, in turn, would have no magic way of providing ballot papers for the several thousand Gardai here and there in areas outside the actual station at which they would normally be recorded as resident voters.  For those reasons, it is absolutely essential that the Garda should vote by post and also because of the impossibility of ensuring that they would, in fact, get their votes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick also raised the question as to why persons who had succeeded in getting inside the premises in which the ballot was being taken, before closing time, were not permitted to vote.  That would raise the question of closing time.  There will always be those who rush at the last minute to vote, and it is not always the people who are busily engaged who wait till the last moment. There is always a residue who come at the very last moment.  If we were to accept what would seem to be quite a reasonable case, that, if they got inside, they should be allowed to vote, <Col N="751" /> this is what would arise: polling might begin in a small room accommodating half a dozen people in addition to the staff; if those half a dozen people got in and we said: &ldquo;Well and good, they may vote,&rdquo; and if we allowed them to vote after the time, there would be a great danger that the time would be exceeded.  In fact, I imagine that the clock is not always seen in its true light when it comes to a minute or two after 9 o'clock in such cases.</P>
    <P>We must also take account of the extreme case where a hall is taken which might hold practically half the total registered voters.  The hall would accommodate them and they might all come in at one, two or five minutes past 9 o'clock.  Is it to be said that the poll should continue to be taken until everyone on the premises had cast his vote, which could be three hours after the official closing time?  Some closing time has to be fixed, and if 9 o'clock is not late enough, then the obvious thing to do is to extend the closing time so that those people who wish to vote and are precluded from getting there in time will get there in time in future.</P>
    <P>As I said, overall, this is not a matter which causes an undue amount of concern because the presiding officers and the staffs usually deal with these matters in a reasonable way.  Undoubtedly, an unreasonable attitude and possibly even the attitude displayed by any one of these persons here and there can, in fact, give rise to comment such as we have heard and, justifiable comment possibly, that voters have been unreasonably treated after presenting themselves at the polling station, possibly through no fault of their own, at the last minute.  There has to be a closing time and there must be some regulation.  Otherwise, the abuse to the degree I mentioned could, in fact, be great and nobody would be happy then, either.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also, very naïvely, I felt, for a most experienced politician, wanted to know if I, as Minister, had any explanation in regard to a person being omitted from the voters' list after that person had been on it for <Col N="752" /> a number of years and had not left the country and had not done anything to disqualify himself in the interval. As he developed the theme, it appeared that the rate collectors were to blame.  Furthermore, in this particular case, it turned out that it was only the Fianna Fáil rate collectors who were to be blamed.  I have known Fianna Fáil people who were, in fact, left off in this way.</P>
    <P>I have seen in my own constituency such happenings taking place.  I followed the matter up as to how that could happen because it did not seem possible that it should have taken place.  It was not because of any machinations of an anti-Fianna Fáil rate collector in my case.  It was a mistake by the printer.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure yet.  These unavoidable mistakes can happen and Deputy Blowick is long enough in politics to know what a local rate collector in a country area has to do with it.  It may arise only in the initial stages.  The final check is gone into, not by the rate collector at his sole discretion, but by the local Garda as well, plus any of the agents or other interested people on behalf of the various political Parties.  Generally speaking, rate collectors are one group of people whose responsibility for the compilation of the registers is strictly and carefully watched.  They get a right rap across the knuckles from their county registrar or returning officer who, in fact, is the means whereby they get something extra for doing this work.  They are careful in regard to that work.  That is a common sense approach to things, apart from their sense of fair play.  It is in their own interests that they should do it properly.  The idea that rate collectors&mdash;let them be Fianna Fáil or whatever they may be&mdash;have an all-powerful interest in the final leaving-off of people is a fear about which I did not really feel Deputy Blowick was very serious.  I should not like it to go forward that this is a practice which is a danger to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, we go to such lengths to try to ensure that no one is left off the register that it has come to be accepted by the people that being on the voters' list is not something which they themselves should check.  In other countries, they have to make great efforts to ensure they are on it.  We err, if we err at all, on the opposite side.  We go to every possible length by way of publication, rate collectors, Gardaí and even the local political organisations, to ensure that everybody is on the register.  In addition, we have press publicity, stamp cancellation, radio talks, topical talks, spot advertisements and goodness knows what else.  It is really inconceivable how anyone can ultimately be left off the register, after all these things are done.  Certainly if they are left off, they can scarcely blame anyone for their not having a vote.  By and large, we go to the utmost extremes. We are even going still further and looking for new ways and means to ensure, if possible, that every person entitled to vote is, in fact, on the list.</P>

      <P>There was one matter raised by Deputy Sherwin, that is, that the barrack room of the Garda station should not be made a propaganda centre.  In fact, he feels that canvassers should be kept out of them and that, generally speaking, it would be a bad thing to give votes to the Garda if it should bring about a situation where the politics of the individual Garda should become known.  We were not born yesterday.  Just like everybody else, some Gardaí have one view and some another.  Many of them are just as cute as the rest of us.  Nobody knows what they are.  I do not think this new procedure will change that.  I have no real fear that the Garda station will be any more a propaganda centre in the future than it was in the past.  I am not worried about that aspect at all.</P>
      <P>Hospital cases, emigrants and migrants, and all these other types of people whom we could add to the list, who, through no fault of their own, are not in a position to cast their vote on a particular day could have a case made in their regard.  We must have regard to reason and the reasonable carrying out of the policy at whatever day and time it is being taken.  It is not because of lack of wish in regard to this matter that all and sundry are not accommodated in exceptional cases.  The difficulty of meeting these various cases is the only reason why they are not being met and are not proposed to be met in the future.</P>

    <P>The alphabetical order on the ballot <Col N="755" /> paper is Deputy Sherwin's difficulty. On the dog tracks there are two places in the draw that are good.

      <P>Deputy Corish spoke about the compilation of the register not in the sense I have already discussed but in the sense of the timings. He referred to the publication of the long list or the &ldquo;pink list&rdquo; as I might call it in December and the interval between that and the date claims may be made which he says is rather short.  I agree and I have held that view for a considerable time.  If further legislation similar to that which we are now bringing through this House is dealt with by me, I hope that we shall achieve a proper regulation of the time for claims, objections and various checking which is not only unduly short at the moment but comes at a bad time on the eve of Christmas.  Who is thinking about checking a register or making a claim for a vote, even if they have checked the register, almost on the eve of Christmas?  It is a bad time.  I made definite enquiries about this matter.  I asked why the period is not longer.  The reason it cannot be extended is due not to any choice of date but to the circumstances of the time schedule.  Allowance must be made for the various procedures <Col N="757" /> of claims, objections, revisions, final checking of the list, final issue of the list to the printers, and the very important time-binding factor.  This register must be available throughout the country as and from 15th April. Every printer of blocks of this register in the various counties throughout the country is involved.  The last of them must have their register out by the 15th of the month.  At the time limits we are using, we could possibly get registers out from some printers a month before that but invariably we come to the last date in the case of some printer or other and not always the same printer is the last printer.</P>

I want to indicate my appreciation of the Joint Committee's efforts in this regard, particularly of the expedition with which they produced the interim report and the precise manner in which they presented it.

I hope to see the adoption and carriage into legislation of these suggested amendments, that is, the further amendments the Minister will see in due course. There is also the question of how to simplify complex aspects of our existing electoral law.  As it is now likely <Col N="758" /> to be ten months before we have a General Election, according to the Taoiseach, would the Minister examine as soon as possible the practicability of embodying some further recommendations which he received from the Joint Committee in due course in another Bill which could probably be passed through this House well in advance of the next General Election and which would simplify the whole procedure certainly from the point of view of candidates?</P>

      <P>To put it clearly, if the Deputy follows what I have said I think what he is asking has already been suggested in my reply.  This Bill is urgent.  Certain parts of it must be enacted very soon; otherwise there will be all sorts of complications.  That is why the Committee reported so rapidly and that is why we want to get the Bill through both Houses as soon as possible.  Any question of adding to it, by way of amendment, any further recommendations would naturally delay the Bill because some of them have not been sufficiently examined or been agreed by my Department, myself or the Government.  In addition, it does not follow that no further Bill will emerge between now and the next election.  In fact, I feel that another instalment of the revision of the electoral laws will quite possibly emerge within the next six months. I think that answers the Deputy's question.</P>

    <P>Most of the milk sold in this country goes to creameries for manufacturing purposes.  The proportion of our total milk production that goes to the liquid milk market is only 21 per cent.  This is not because liquid milk consumption per head of the population is low in this country; in fact, our liquid milk consumption is one of the highest in Europe.  The real reason is, of course, that our population is small and their liquid milk requirements, even on the basis of our high rate of consumption per head, are only about 120 million gallons a year.  On the other hand, the total quantity of milk delivered to creameries this year will not be far short of 300 million gallons, and will probably beat every other year with the possible exception of 1957.  Of this quantity, approximately 180 million gallons would be needed to meet home requirements of butter on the basis of the average consumption during the past three years, and 12 million gallons would be needed to meet home market requirements in respect of other milk products, such as cheese, milk powder, condensed milk and chocolate.  The quantity of milk available for conversion into dairy products for the export market is, therefore, in the region of 80 to 100 million gallons.  In the past, most of this milk surplus has been converted into butter for export, though there is, <Col N="760" /> of course, an important export trade also in chocolate crumb, and a smaller but increasing export of cheese and milk powder.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the scope for increased liquid consumption of milk in this country is limited.  The same applies to butter, as we are one of the biggest per-head consumers of butter in the world.  The only milk product for which there seems to be a prospect of increased home consumption is cheese.  Our per-head consumption of cheese is, indeed, the lowest in Western Europe, although it is tending to rise.  From the point of view of health and variety of diet, there is everything to be said for our eating more cheese in this country.</P>
    <P>While milk production has varied from year to year, because of weather and other conditions, it seems clear that the underlying tendency is upwards. This is partly due to the fact that the yield per cow has been increasing, and this, in turn, is due to better farming, which is now greatly facilitated by the relatively low prices at which fertilisers are made available by means of the fertilisers subsidies. A further factor of considerable importance is, of course, that there is an assured price for milk supplied to creameries and for milk supplied for human consumption in our two biggest city areas.  While the price paid to producers for milk in this country is not high in comparison with other European countries, the fact that a certain price is assured provides a very useful measure of stability to producers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tendency of milk production to increase, as milk is the basic product of our agriculture and on it depends to a very large extent our cattle and pig industries.  We have seen that any appreciable expansion in home consumption of liquid milk and of milk products other than cheese cannot be expected, and it follows that we must look to the export market for dairy products to absorb our surplus of milk.  This surplus, however, even at what for us was a relatively high level this year, represents only a very modest proportion of the requirements of available export markets and indeed <Col N="761" /> any expansion in our exportable surplus which may take place could not form more than a small part of the needs of those markets.  One of the main problems which has faced us in the past is lack of continuity of supply on the export market.  We exported butter only when a surplus arose, and kept imports down to the lowest possible level.  Apart from a reasonably steady market for a limited quantity of chocolate crumb and milk powder, our exports of other milk products were small and depended on whether our creameries were able to manufacture the products at the prices obtainable on the export market.  If the creameries did not get at least the same price per gallon of milk as they would have obtained for milk converted into butter and sold to the Butter Marketing Committee, they did not manufacture other products for export.</P>
    <P>The main functions of the Board to be set up under this Bill&mdash;to be known as An Bord Bainne&mdash;will be to channel milk production into the most profitable manufacturing outlets, to improve methods of marketing of dairy products, and to develop export markets in a systematic manner. The Board will take over the present functions of the Butter Marketing Committee in regard to purchase, storage, sale, etc., of creamery butter. The Government will provide the Board with an annual grant, the amount of which will be negotiated each year, and the Board will be authorised to collect levies from the producers to meet the balance of its requirements.</P>
    <P>The Board will, in principle, become the sole exporter of all dairy products, but, as some exceptions to this are desirable in the interests of the dairy industry as a whole, the Bill empowers the Minister for Agriculture to delegate from time to time export marketing functions for particular products to the manufacturers concerned. At the outset, it is proposed to leave to the individual manufacturers the export of all chocolate crumb to Britain and the Six Counties; milk powder; non-creamery butter, and some special lines of cheese.  The Board would be the sole <Col N="762" /> exporter of creamery butter, fresh cream, canned cream, condensed milk, and cheese other than some special lines, and would also handle the export of chocolate crumb to destinations other than Britain and the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill sets out the constitution of the Board.  There will be nine members, of whom four will represent suppliers of milk to creameries, and there will be one representative each of manufacturers of cheese, milk powder and chocolate crumb, together with one representative of the Dairy Disposal Company, Limited, and one officer of my Department. I should mention that the White Paper on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce visualised a membership of eight, but, following representations made by the creamery industry, I decided to increase by one the representation of creamery milk suppliers, this additional member to be specially selected to represent the interests of creamery societies in the production of fresh cream.  Otherwise no change has been made in the representation as set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Each of the representatives of creamery milk suppliers will be associated with a different group of creamery premises.  One will be chosen by creamery societies in Counties Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and Laois; one will be selected by societies in the other counties: and the member who will represent the cream interests will be chosen by creamery societies in the country as a whole.  The fourth representative of milk suppliers will represent the suppliers to creameries operated by the Dairy Disposal Company, Ltd., and its associated companies.  In the first three groups candidates will be proposed by the societies and if more than one is proposed the societies will ballot to choose the candidate who will be a member.  In the case of the suppliers' representative for the Dairy Disposal Company's group the creamery suppliers will propose the candidate and if necessary will later vote individually on the proposals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> This procedure follows reasonably closely the method recommended by the Advisory Committee, departing from the latter method only to the extent necessary to give effect to the decision to have a member representing the cream interests nominated by creamery societies in the country as a whole.  The three representatives of the manufacturers will be nominated by the manufacturers concerned but in the event of disagreement among them the nomination will be made by me.</P>
    <P>The Board will hold office for a period of four years and members will be eligible for re-election.  The Chairman of the Board will be selected by the Board from among their own membership.</P>
    <P>The provisions in regard to resignation or disqualification of members of the Board are on routine lines.  A member of either House of the Oireachtas may not at the same time be a member or an employee of the Board.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill provides for the fixing by me after consultation with the Minister for Finance of the remuneration and allowances for expenses of the Chairman and other members of the Board.  The recommendation of the Advisory Committee in this matter was that &ldquo;the Chairman and members should receive such remuneration as will ensure that they will have adequate interest in their work and will provide the amount of time necessary for the proper performance of their duties.&rdquo;  The Chief Officer of the Board will be a full-time employee.  His salary will be fixed by me after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  The remuneration of other members of the Board's staff is being left to the discretion of the Board itself.  Provision is also being made for the taking over by the board of the existing staff of the Butter Marketing Committee.</P>
    <P>Under Section 35 of the Bill the Board is empowered to collect levies on milk supplied to creameries.  These levies will enable the Board to meet its expenses, including the dairying industry's proportion of any deficit <Col N="764" /> arising on exports of milk products. There are also provisions in Sections 36 and 37 of the Bill for levies on butter sales and on butter stocks. These provisions are re-enactments with appropriate amendments of similar provisions in the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts.  The levy on butter sales is at present utilised and will continue to be utilised under the machinery of the Board to meet the cost of cold storing butter for winter use.  The levy on butter stocks is for the purpose of preventing butter traders from benefiting overnight from the increased value of their butter stocks in the event of a decision to increase the price of butter.  All these levies are at present paid into the dairy produce (price stabilisation) fund.  Any balance remaining in that fund when the Board has been established will be transferred to the Board.</P>
    <P>As I already stated it is proposed to pay the Board each year out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas a grant or grants of such amount as I, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may fix after consultation with the Board, in relation to its programme for that year.  The use to which such a grant will be put by the Board will be specified in writing at the time of the payment.  It is specifically laid down in Section 31 (4) of the Bill that a grant shall not be used to defray more than two-thirds of any loss incurred by the Board on the export of milk products or any support given by the Board in relation to the export of such products.  This will ensure that the dairy industry will continue to contribute its share of export losses.</P>
    <P>The price payable to producers for milk for manufacturing purposes will continue to be supported through the home market support price payable to creameries for butter.  The Board will be required to buy all suitable butter manufactured by creameries at the price prescribed by the Government and the Board's selling price of butter on the home market will also be determined by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Board is being empowered to borrow from time to time with my consent such sums as it considers necessary <Col N="765" /> for capital or current purposes. The maximum loan which I, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may guarantee to the Board is fixed at £5,000,000.  Provision is made in the Bill for the laying before each House of a statement giving particulars of guaranteed loans and the amounts outstanding at the end of every financial year.</P>
    <P>The Board will be required to establish and maintain a Dairy Produce Fund into which all moneys received by the Board will be paid and out of which the purchase price of milk products, the Board's expenses in connection with such purchases and its outlay in performing its functions under the Bill shall be paid.  It will also be required to keep all proper and usual accounts and to submit those accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General for annual audit. When audited these accounts and a copy of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General thereon will be laid before each House.</P>
    <P>I may say here that there are some references in the Bill to existing legislation which I have endeavoured to clearify in notes which have been circulated.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to take the opportunity of acknowledging on my own behalf and on behalf of <Col N="766" /> the Government our indebtedness to the members of the Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce for the ready manner in which they gave their time and energy in the service of the public.  I should also like to express my appreciation of the services rendered by the members of the Butter Marketing Committee who have carried out their functions quietly and efficiently over the years.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware that the Board which it is proposed to establish under this Bill will have an onerous task but I am sure that, with the co-operation of all concerned, it will succeed in securing a permanent place on the world markets for our dairy products.</P>
    <P>I trust this Bill will commend itself to the House.  I should also mention that the text of the Bill as circulated contains a few minor inaccuracies and I propose to have them corrected on Committee Stage.</P>
