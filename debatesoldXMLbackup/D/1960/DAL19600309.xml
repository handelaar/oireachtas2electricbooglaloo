      <P>As I have stated on previous occasions in reply to similar questions, it is not possible to determine how many of the insured population are in employment at any particular date.  Estimates, of the average numbers in insurable employment in the State as a whole over a period, may be based on the numbers of insurance stamps sold, but no such estimates can be made for individual counties.  The information requested by the Deputy is not, therefore, available.</P>

      <P>Limerick County Council are considering proposals for the improvement of the section of the Limerick-Shannon Airport road within their area.  I understand that the Council are experiencing difficulties regarding the acquisition of the lands required and that they may consider proceeding for compulsory acquisition.</P>
      <P>As I intimated in reply to a previous question from the Deputy last year, the Clare County Council have been advised that a special grant would be available for the section of the road within their area if suitable proposals were submitted to my Department.  Since that time the Council have made considerable progress in the necessary surveys, etc., for the purposes of the scheme.  Engineering documents for the first section proposed to be undertaken by the Council at an estimated cost of £38,000 approximately were received in my Department on the 26th ultimo and are at present under examination.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the attached copy <Col N="174" /> of Circular No. 16/59 relating to inspection, the Minister for Education desires to call special attention to the fact that in future a teacher's work in the teaching of Irish will be assessed as a whole and that there will not be separate assessments of Oral Irish and Written Irish.  It should be understood, however, that the Inspector, when making his assessment of the work as a whole, will attach greater importance to Oral Irish than to Written Irish.  In this connection the Minister wishes to stress his desire that the teachers should make every effort to advance as far as possible and as quickly as possible the speaking of Irish amongst their pupils.  If, with this in view, a teacher is satisfied in relation to pupils whom he may have in a junior class in any year that, having regard to the level of their intelligence, etc., he would be likely to make more progress with them in Oral Irish by transferring the emphasis from teaching through Irish to the teaching of Irish Conversation, then such teacher will be free to act accordingly. That of course will be on the understanding that his work in the case of Irish will be assessed principally from the point of view of the advance made by the pupils in the spoken tongue.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, I was endeavouring to point out that the Opposition speakers had chosen to ignore the reasons for the definite increase in the Estimate on Capital Account in respect of civil servants, teachers, the Garda, and the Defence Forces.  I am sure if these increases had not been awarded, the Opposition would be very vehement in advocating that they should be given, and that the Government were very remiss in not giving them.  Since they have been given, they were ignored&mdash;no mention was made of them.  Instead, they contented themselves with referring to what they described as the colossal increase in the overall amount of the Vote on Account now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They also chose to ignore the important increases shown in respect of such matters as agricultural lands and fisheries, which, to my mind, are definite signs of the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> These matters are worthy of note and should not go unnoticed.  Deputy Sweetman dwelt at considerable length on the question of the additional provision for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  He pointed out that it was an indication of an overall rise in rates throughout the country as though it were something which had not happened before.  I would ask him to examine the record of the county councils during the two periods of office of the Coalition Governments and he will find that the steepest rise in that continuous upward trend of rates for the past 25 years was recorded during those years.  Let us not seek to imply that the increase in rates is <Col N="177" /> due to direct action by this Government.</P>

      <P>As I said last night, I am satisfied that the Estimates portray a picture which holds out a definite hope for the future and not merely gives encouragement in relation to the programme we are pursuing but indicates that we are pursuing the proper line.  Figures just published today show a marked upward trend in the export of industrial goods.  That is most encouraging, but Deputies on the Opposition side will immediately say it is offset by a reduction in the value of exports of livestock.  In the matter of the export of livestock, we are dealing with something which fluctuates and is sensitive even to weather conditions.</P>
      <P>The outlook for the future is good. It is particularly encouraging when something which is stabilised and not likely to fluctuate, such as an increase in industrial exports, shows a permanent improvement.  That is a most satisfactory result.  All these are matters which cannot be ignored and any Deputy speaking to this Vote on Account, if he is honest with himself, must give credit where credit is due. I am satisfied that there is more on the credit side than on the other side, irrespective of whether that is brought about by a temporary decline in market conditions, or by the implementation of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, or any of the factors which operate temporarily to upset our market.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House have every reason to be satisfied that the efforts being made, as reflected in the Vote on Account and the implementation of the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, are entirely satisfactory.  If the trend were more noticeable, it would be still better, but, as I said last night, the fact that it is in the right direction is what concerns us most.  I have already paid tribute to the speech made by Deputy Corish which gave due credit for the trend as reflected in the figures before us.</P>

      <P>It would be well worth quoting the Deputy if I had the Official Report before me.  The Deputy went some way&mdash;like Lana Machree's dog, he went part of the way&mdash;towards approving of the Vote on Account in principle.  Many of the things which Deputy Sweetman attempted to shout down in his speech were not held in the same regard by Deputy Corish.  I think I am not misquoting Deputy Corish when I say that he regarded the increases in the various salaries and incomes of the Civil Service, etc., as being something which was satisfactory and not at all unnecessary.</P>

I thought that was a note which would not be sounded in this House and that the new note struck would be that we would all seek to encourage progress, whenever progress was genuinely in evidence.</P>
      <P>Nobody can fail to see&mdash;perhaps Opposition members may not like it&mdash; the definite progress reflected in the figures before the House to-day.  I am referring to how one may seek to use figures or records to suit one's purpose. I was amazed, looking at the three daily papers to-day, to see the headlines.

      <P>I think the Minister for Finance is unduly sensitive.  His Parliamentary Secretary is made of tougher stuff.  The debates in this House could become so old-maidish if we accepted all the standards set for us by the Minister for Finance in his present frame of mind, which I will say, is not his permanent frame of mind, that Deputies would be afraid to make an interjection at all.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary misunderstood the helpful comments made from the Opposition benches. As he himself spiritedly observed, they not infrequently assist him by their inspiration.  But even stimulated and intoxicated by the inspiration he was receiving from the Opposition, I think that when the Parliamentary Secretary comes to read&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree.  But if, after that, we are only turning the corner and approaching the peaks I must say that that type of talk is very <Col N="181" /> familiar to us.  I have heard the present Taoiseach when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce say, over the past 20 years, that he was turning corners.  One of the most remarkable corners he turned is situated in Inchicore.  I find that the Fianna Fáil organisation bought a cheap house in Inchicore recently by private treaty and were so stimulated by the success of their transaction that they invited the Taoiseach to come down to open it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the corners the Taoiseach has turned and around which the Parliamentary Secretary is now in hot pursuit.  Let me read for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle the corner that was turned by the Taoiseach in Inchicore and that has stimulated the Parliamentary Secretary to go skating round after him.  The Taoiseach's corner in Inchicore related to the economic future of this country and is very relevant, I should think, to the Vote on Account.  Watch the faces to see if they will blush.  He proclaimed for the first time: &ldquo;The keystone of Fianna Fáil economic policy is the British market.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That statement by the Taoiseach is important.  I welcome his conversion to that measure of economic sanity.  He must excuse us if we recall that it has taken 30 years to teach him that lesson.  He must excuse us if we recall in the presence of that pronouncement the day on which his ex-Leader spoke at Arva and told our people that the British market was gone forever and that the livestock industry was finished not only for the small farmer but for the big farmer as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He suggested to them that, in examining the question of an alternative occupation because the livestock industry was no longer open to them, they might consider the advantages of honey.  He said that if they proposed to embark upon the production of honey he was in a position to advise them that the most prolific variety of bee was the Egyptian bee. That statement was made at Arva as the Fianna Fáil policy for the land of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame Fianna Fáil Deputies for laughing at it; they have learned something in the last quarter of a century but at what a cost!  What a terrible price our people have paid for their education!  My apprehension is that that characteristic irresponsibility may lead them into the paths of economic heresy again because they are incompetent and if they find that progress <Col N="183" /> on sane lines involves problems difficult of solution they may revert to their old hysterical doctrine to the great detriment of the economy of this country.</P>
    <P>On the 8th May, 1957, the Minister for Finance was talking in this House as reported at Column 947, Volume 161 of the Dáil Debates.  On that occasion he announced that Fianna Fáil had decided to abolish the food subsidies. Of course, he said he profoundly regretted it but he could not avoid it. He added that these subsidies now cost the Exchequer £9,000,000 per annum. I would direct the attention of the House to the fact that the current Estimates for current spending, omitting capital items, are up £8,000,000 over 1957 and that the Central Fund for this year, as nearly as one can estimate it on the figure we have for last year, will be up by £5,000,000 over the Central Fund figure for 1957.</P>
    <P>That represents <i>in toto</i> an increase, omitting all capital items, of £22,000,000 per annum over and above what was appropriated from this country in 1957.  I ask Deputies of the Fianna Fáil party to reflect on that because there are certain additional factors which they ought to bear in mind.  We told them in 1957 that if they precipitated the economic upheaval which would ensue on the abolition of the food subsidies it was entirely illusory to imagine that the Minister for Finance's exhortation in 1957 would receive the slightest attention from anybody.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will look at Column 947, Volume 161 of the Dáil Debates they will find that in the paragraph, after he announced the abolition of the food subsidies, the Minister for Finance went on to say he wanted to warn everybody in the House that if we looked for compensation by seeking wage increases it would negative the value of this operation and set us on the road to inflation.  No element in this community that was in a position effectively to reject that advice accepted it.</P>
    <P>Since that day we have the sixth and seventh round of wage increases in the economy of this country.  There <Col N="184" /> are many groups of organised workers, professional, artisan and others, who to-day say that, despite their successful application for increased remuneration, they have not yet caught up with the increases in the cost of living precipitated by the Government's action.  It is certain that those on fixed incomes, and a very large and wide range of pensioners and people dependent upon income of that kind, are worse off now than they were four years ago.  Yet the burden of the cost on the Exchequer in the efforts made by this House in some measure to mitigate the impact of that 1957 imposition on pensioners and others of that kind has become very heavy and constitutes a large part of the £22,000,000 to which I referred.</P>
    <P>But what people in this House frequently forget is that there has flowed from that decision also not only the increased burden of the £22,000,000 on Parliament but every employer in this country has been obliged to meet the fair demands of his working people to offset at least in some degree the increase in the cost of living precipitated upon them.  We might as well face it because anybody with any knowledge of rural Ireland knows it to be true that more than one small business in rural Ireland has closed down because the proprietors are no longer able to pay labour in the business in which they are engaged, business of a character which cannot be carried on single-handed.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true to say&mdash;it is an inescapable economic fact&mdash;that in certain sectors of the economy you can have higher wages and fewer employees or you can have a higher number of men employed at a lower rate of wages.  We tried to make the lower rate of wages worth more by keeping the cost of essential food commodities down and thus spread employment as widely as we could over all our people and to protect them from the spur that is on them now to emigrate to Great Britain in order to get the higher monetary income.  All these consequences flow from the one fatal decision in 1957 to sweep away the then carefully constructed <Col N="185" /> balance devised to maintain employment and keep down the cost of living in this country.</P>
    <P>The cost of living here is now rising above that of Great Britain. The unfortunate fact is that the rate of industrial wages in Great Britain is infinitely higher than industrial employment can provide here bearing in mind the opportunities for overtime that exist in Great Britain compared with those that obtain here, but what none of us remember is that while the cost of living complex has been in some measure corrected by the sixth and seventh round of increases in wages for industrial workers in all categories, there is one section of this community that has not participated in any increase but yet has borne a large share of every increase that has been given.  That section is the small farmers on the land of Ireland.  Each round of wage increases awarded in this country since 1957&mdash;I think there were two&mdash;has in the last analysis passed back to the consumers and the bulk of those consumers are small farmers.  Small farmers eat bread and they buy butter.  They do not manufacture butter at home in the vast majority of cases.  They buy creamery butter.  Small farmers pay rates and small farmers pay their share of such expenses as bus fares.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, bus fares impinge more heavily on the residents of Dublin, Cork and the larger urban centres.  It is an item which costs the small farmers something too.  They are in the deplorable position that they are ground between the upper and nether millstones because, although their cost of living is steadily rising, the cost of everything they have to sell is going down.  They are not in the position of people with a stable income with the cost of living rising against them; they are in the position of people with the cost of living rising against them and their incomes going down.  They have no trade union.</P>
    <P>If that situation impinged on an organised section of the community we would be confronted with industrial upheavals, strikes and the like, but the plain fact is&mdash;and we all know it&mdash;that the general reaction in rural Ireland is <Col N="186" /> to stick to their homes as long as they can.  When the going becomes quite impossible, they simply lock the door and move out.  That is a phenomenon which I never saw in my life until the last two or three years.  Emigration we have always had to some extent and I saw for some time a growing tendency on the part of our young people to refuse to stay at home.</P>
    <P>You would meet many a case where middle-aged parents were anxious to have a son to whom they could pass on the holding, but discovered that none of the sons wanted it and that they would sooner go and work abroad, but it is only in the last few years that we have seen families paying their debts in the neighbouring shop, putting the hasp and padlock on the door and moving out, man, wife and child. They are going because the cost of living, plus the steady decline in income from their labour, has made life impossible for them.  Ordinarily, they do not belong to the mobile element in our community who are excessively mobile in that they can go without any cost: these are the most firmly rooted element in our community and they are being driven out by their present economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>Seeing that we have carried the Taoiseach so far in his conversion to a realisation that the British market is the keystone of our economy and that it is something earnestly to be desired to promote the economic integration of our two countries, can I bring him to the point of agreeing with me that fundamentally, in the last analysis, the economic life of this country rests on the only natural resources at our disposal&mdash;12 million acres of arable land &mdash;and, unless they can be exploited profitably to their maximum capability, no efforts by any other section of the community can long continue to yield dividends for our people?</P>
    <P>We can talk in terms which, to me, are always somewhat illusory and yet they give a certain global picture.  In that context, I would direct the attention of the House to the fact that the statisticians claim that in 1953 the farmers received 29.4 per cent. of the total national income.  In 1958, that share <Col N="187" /> dropped to 25 per cent. and these statistics are to be found on page 8 of the <i>Statistical Survey</i> of 1958, if any Deputy is interested to see them.  These global figures do not appeal to me because I see things more clearly through the eyes of personal experience in the knowledge of my neighbours' circumstances and, looking about at my neighbours in rural Ireland, I am obsessed by the fact that last year alone I believe the income of dairy farmers declined in respect of milk delivered to the creameries by not less than £2,000,000.  That is only the beginning of the story, and I challenge contradiction on this, because 12 months ago a dropped calf throughout the south of Ireland was worth £25, while today the same dropped calf is worth about £15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Some may say less, but if it is less now, it might have been less last year.  By and large, the price of dropped calves has dropped over £10.  That is 2,400 pence and that is 4d a gallon on the milk of a 600-gallon cow, or 3d a gallon on the milk of an 800-gallon cow&mdash;take it what way you like.  Can you imagine what the reaction of the creamery farmers would be if anybody proposed asking them to carry on the creamery industry on the basis of reducing the price of creamery milk by 4d per gallon? That is in fact what they have been asked to do in the past 12 months as a result of the fall in prices of calves.</P>
      <P>We all know that the yield of an 800-gallon cow last year was 650 gallons, if the owner was lucky and a 600-gallon cow did not do too badly if she gave 500 gallons.  Those farmers are having a bad time.  Lambs that were worth £5 or £6 two years ago sold last year&mdash;if you could sell them at all&mdash;for between £3 and £4 and I saw hundreds of lambs brought down from the hills and driven back again because there was nobody to buy them. I, myself, saw lambs sold for £3.  15/- last year which would have made £5 15/- or £6 the year before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of barley was reduced <Col N="188" /> from 40/- to 37/- a barrel.  The number of pigs going into the factories has declined steeply.  I ask farmer Deputies here who are familiar with conditions in rural Ireland today: do they remember at any time since the war, prices for young cattle being worse or demand slower?  I had cattle out at a fair last week and I was not asked where I was going.  I would have had no difficulty in selling the same cattle last year at £60 apiece. It is bad enough to be offered a bad price; it is much worse when nobody asks you anything.  All those cattle were cattle with green tags on their ears coming from a farm where there are only green-tag cattle.  I do not know if Deputies recall&mdash; Deputies, like the Parliamentary Secretary who spoke, have conveniently short memories&mdash;the prices women got for turkeys last Christmas?  How many women who sold turkeys last year had any profit at all?  How many made a loss?</P>
    <P>I read with edification and attention the calculations of statisticians but these are facts that I get, not from books, but from my own neighbours' experience and from my own experience in rural Ireland.  I want to submit to this House that whatever the statisticians say, whatever <i>Pravda</i> says, so surely as the average standard of living of the small farmer and the medium farmer in this country declines, so certainly will the repercussions be felt in the rest of our economy in due time.  Let us remember&mdash;we who are now working and living in the city of Dublin&mdash;that a great bulk of employment for our people is provided in the towns of rural Ireland in providing services and accommodation for the farmers who frequent these towns.  I would ask Deputies: how do these towns stand at present?  I want to submit to the House that already in rural Ireland the drapery trade, the boot trade, the hardware trade and, to a lesser degree, the grocery trade are in the doldrums. These are facts.  So certainly as those facts are true, their repercussions will be felt in the boot and shoe factories, the drapery warehouses and the other urban centres of supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> I am glad to see that the fiscal stimuli provided by the inter-Party Government by way of tax exemption on profits earned on exports have yielded some return in the increased volume of exports which, I am told, is to be found in this year's trade returns.  But I think the Minister for Finance will be the first to agree that we have been fortunate in the past year or two in the terms of trade on which we have been called to import and export.  I hope they stay in our favour.  If the terms of trade operating in 1955-56 had continued into 1957, 1958 and 1959, our present economic condition would be well-nigh desperate.  But, very fortunately, they have turned in our favour and have yielded us an advantage in the balance sheet of anything from £8,000,000 to £12,000,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see an increase in industrial exports but the great danger is that a £9,000,000 increase in industrial exports will be inflated in this House into a suggestion that they are some adequate substitute for what is to me the appalling tendency of the agricultural industry to fade away. Do Deputies appreciate that according to the Minister's estimate&mdash;and the Minister for Finance has himself been a Minister for Agriculture in his time &mdash;he anticipates virtually no exports of butter this year?  I wonder does he anticipate any exports of any creamery butter at all?  I understand that some chocolate crumb is going out.  First grade cheese is good, but not as good as it was.  There is a vast export trade, if we could but tap it, for dried milk.  But the gloomy prognostication of the Minister himself is that he sees no prospect of any substantial butter exports at all. I hope he is wrong.  I believe he is wrong.  I believe the good hay season we had last year and the mild winter ought to produce some surplus of butter for export and I shall be appalled if it does not.</P>
    <P>The present trend gives one no reason to hope that we will have any substantial exports of bacon in the coming year, but I hope we may.  At present we have no agricultural exports at all, except cattle, a trickle of sheep, and wool.  Fortunately, we <Col N="190" /> have wool; because we succeeded in doubling the number of sheep on the hills.  But if the price of lambs continues to decline as it did last year, there is very grave danger of a contraction in the number of sheep with a subsequent reduction in our exports of wool.</P>
    <P>I want to make this perfectly clear. In the last analysis, there is no substitute for the profit motive to persuade the farmers to extract the maximum return of which the soil of Ireland is capable.  That is the first cardinal economic principle I have learned in my experience of the public life of this country.  But there is a second: no matter how urgent the allure of price may become, we shall not get the maximum return, unless it is put within the farmer's reach to employ the most effective methods, with many of which he is not now familiar.</P>
    <P>There is no means on God's earth of doing that except by bringing within his immediate reach&mdash;though not imposing upon him&mdash;a skilled adviser to whom he can have recourse for advice, if and when he wants it.  This is absolutely certain.  I learned by my own experience that it is true&mdash;I think the Minister for Agriculture is unduly obsessed with this&mdash;that, at first, in many parts of Ireland, the agricultural adviser is looked upon with suspicion, but if you have patience, he will get into one, two or three progressive farms in his area.  Then, with astonishing rapidity, when the neighbours see what informed agriculture can do on their neighbour's holding, they will come in and seek the advice themselves.</P>
    <P>The experience we had in Bansha cannot be too often repeated.  I sent the first parish agent in this country to Bansha.  My instructions to him were not to approach any farmer himself. I remember calling in a young inspector of the Department and saying to him: &ldquo;Now, I am going to give you the most difficult assignment it is possible to give anybody.  I am going to ask you to go down to Bansha and, in effect, to do nothing for six months.  I want you to go down, sit in the parish agent's office and impose upon yourself <Col N="191" /> the self-denying ordinance of being available to everybody while trespassing on nobody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So it transpired that, despite strong local co-operation from Muintir na Tíre, a long period elapsed in which he did not make contact with more than half a dozen farmers in the whole of that parish.  Before he left it, he had been invited into 99 per cent. of the holdings in the parish of Bansha and I do not want to weary the House with the statistical results of one agent's operations in that parish.  They can be measured by the application of lime to the land, by the application of phosphate and potash to the land, by the increased output of the land and by the diversification of agriculture in that parish.  The work of such an agent was beyond praise.</P>
    <P>That can be done in practically every parish in Ireland and, given a reasonable price incentive and access to advice of that character, I am convinced that the output of the land of Ireland can be increased by 50 per cent. and I should be surprised if, over 10 years, it could not be doubled. That is the key to the solution of the economic problems of this country. If you could increase the total output of the agricultural industry by 50 per cent. you could increase the agricultural exports of the country, not by 50 per cent. but by 250 per cent., and that is the equation that a lot of people forget to take into account.</P>
    <P>Every additional pound's worth of agricultural output in this country is destined for the export market.  We ourselves are eating here all the food that our people require and are to-day the best fed population in the whole world, measured by international standards, and my recollection of the correct equation is that if we could increase the output of the land of Ireland by 50 per cent, that would result in an increase of 250 per cent. in agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>If we can engender that increase, there will flow from it a very considerable volume of the processing of agricultural products in this country because, in our exertions to solve the <Col N="192" /> problem of marketing so substantially an increased volume of output, it will inevitably emerge that some of it will be processed in one form or other for export.  Its processing, and the development of industry based on that increased agricultural output, will in turn increase industrial employment and so will lead to a very substantially increased consumer potential in this country, and the one will help the other.  In my judgment, by that means, we can reach, in this country, what is now popularly described in international economic circles as the &ldquo;takeoff point in economic expansion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that when O.E.E.C. experts came here, they committed themselves to the view that, having made a survey, they were satisfied the potential was here for an annual increase in agricultural output, not of two per cent. but of seven, eight or nine per cent, that we had the essential infra work completed and that, if we put our minds together on that increased output, over a period of ten years, we would detonate a real, dramatic&mdash;one might almost describe it&mdash;explosive economic progress.  I know of no other basis upon which such a forward move can be postulated, and I am equally certain that on the land of this country and the people who live upon it, we have the basis upon which real progress could be made.</P>
    <P>I do not want to underestimate the marketing problems that will be created by that increased output, but I have no doubt in my mind that, given adequate market research and a resolute determination to do what may be necessary to market the increased output, it can be done.  I do not want to sound extreme because I do not believe we shall be driven to extreme measures, but I should be quite prepared to implement direct marketing to the consumer, if that were necessary, in order to market the increased output of the agricultural industry.  I do not believe it is necessary and I believe we can get that increased output disposed of in the market of our neighbours, consisting of 50,000,000 people, who, working to the limits of their capacity on their own land, could not produce <Col N="193" /> half of the food they ordinarily consume and whose tendency will be to consume more and more of the kind of food we produce as their standards of living continue to rise, through the ordinary channels of trade.</P>
    <P>But, if it should appear to us that we would be blocked by an international <i>cartel</i> or combine, we have the means of entering that market direct, and undertaking direct selling in it in respect of commodities like bacon and butter, provided we have enough to supply it.  I am referring to this only in the most superficial way because I do not think it is my duty to go into details of that kind at this stage.  I think that is the job of the Government.  Yet I am constitutionally incapable of getting up here and simply lambasting the Government, without envisaging some of the things we might do if we had the power to do them, which, unhappily at the moment, we have not got.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister for Agriculture to understand what I am talking about but I have some vague hope that other members of the Government may.  I could well imagine, if it were put to me that I could not find room for this increased volume of butter and bacon, myself replying: &ldquo;Take Liverpool and Cheshire and we will concentrate our supplies of bacon in that area, if needs be to the consumer direct through Irish bacon shops, and if we have butter and cannot pass it into the ordinary channels of trade, very well, let us concentrate on Cardiff and Birmingham and, if needs be, we will sell it direct to the consumer there also.&rdquo;  I do not believe that situation would arise but the potentials are vast if the only problem is marketing, but you cannot have a market if you have not the wherewithal to supply it and the first thing to do is to get the supply, give the assurance that the Government mean to market the supply when it becomes available, and I believe we should give that assurance now.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that out of the increased output of the land of this country, we could get a sound basis for genuine economic expansion that would provide employment for a great <Col N="194" /> many more of our people than are at present being employed.  I do not believe that there will ever be a complete cessation of emigration from this country and I want the House to mark those words carefully and well.  I believe the day any country prohibits its people from emigrating, then that country is only fit for relegation behind the Iron Curtain.  One of the fundamental freedoms of any free people is that they shall be free to come and go as they desire but what I want to avoid, and what I believe most rational people want to avoid, is that anybody should be driven out of the country by the fact that he cannot get a living in it.</P>
    <P>What is the use in telling me that a man should not go?  I know a man from the country who was earning about £7 a week, who went to Canada seven years ago and he is a millionaire now.  If he had stayed here at home, he would still be earning £7, £8 or £9 a week.  He never had to go but this would be a poor country if he had been forbidden to go.  In my judgment, our aim should be to create an economic situation where our people can get a decent living here if they want to stay.</P>
    <P>At present there is a great volume of emigration going on, particularly from the west of Ireland.  The man to query on that is not the statistician; it is the man who has a shop in rural Ireland.  Ask the man who sells drapery or the man who sells stout and the latter will be able to tell you how many bottles of stout were consumed in his area last year, and how many this year.  You need not worry about whiskey.  The young fellows do not drink whiskey.  They have not drunk whiskey for the past 35 years, and they do not drink much lemonade, either.  The old fellows do not buy a lot of clothes.  When they buy a coat it is meant to do them 20 years.  They expect to be buried in it.  The old women do not buy much clothes.  When they buy a coat they expect it to be hanging on the back of the door the day they are laid out.  It is the young people who buy clothes.  It is the young people who provide the bulk of the custom in the rural towns of Ireland and it is from the local shopkeeper <Col N="195" /> that you will find out whether the population is rising or falling in his area.</P>
    <P>I challenge any person with knowledge of any rural town west of the Shannon to deny that the population is steadily declining and has rapidly declined in the course of the last two or three years.  It is that that I should like to see stopped.  I should like to see the economic development in this country which did not drive people out.</P>
    <P>What is happening at the present time is that on farms of less than 50 acres in Ireland it is no longer possible to make an income which will induce people to stay when they compare it with the industrial wages available in Great Britain and, when you get down to the 20, 25, and 30 acre farm, it is becoming more and more common for the farmer himself, his wife and family to lock the door and clear out.  You will not get young people to stay on a farm in Ireland now that is under 40 acres.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of rates.  I have mentioned here the urgent necessity of bringing within the reach of farmers the technical assistance requisite to get the maximum return from the land.  I should like to read for the House a very typical Fianna Fáil reaction. There was a discussion at Clare County Committee of Agriculture, reported in the <i>Clare Champion</i> of Saturday, February 27th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Meara said that the two farmers' organisations, the N.F.A. and Macra na Feirme, had asked them to supply more instructors.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Meara went on to say:</P>
    <P>They had got a direction from the Minister for Agriculture that they would have to supply them.  It was the intention of the Government to have an instructor in every two or three parishes.</P>
    <P>Whereupon Senator Brady of Fianna Fáil spoke up and said:</P>
    <P>Produce that direction.  That is only Dillon's programme &mdash; the Parish Plan.  There was no such direction from the Minister.</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, Senator Brady is now safely erected into a monumental position and we need trouble ourselves no longer with his folly.  But, in passing from that, I want to recall that I directed the attention of the House to the immense burden on the agricultural industry of the growing burden of rates.  Fianna Fáil introduced into this House, in 1955, the Health Act and they represented it to the House as being an Act designed to secure that the poor would get better health services than they had had heretofore and, on that representation, the Health Act was passed by Dáil Éireann.  I want to make the submission to the House now that the Health Act in its operation has resulted in little or no benefit to the truly poor and indigent in rural Ireland and that what is happening is that the relatively well-to-do are squeezing out the poor from services that the poor used to enjoy and are now being denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my experience. I think the House should pause.  I want to sound this note of warning. After the year 1955, I understand the figures are not precisely identical. What were health services in 1955 are not identical for the purposes of the returns with health services in 1956 and the years thereafter.  Substantially they are, but there are some elements introduced into the cost of health services after 1955 that were not in the figure for 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing that in mind, here are the figures for the cost of the health services as recorded in the Statistical Abstract: in 1955 the health services cost £4.9 million; 1956, £12.4 million &mdash;to the rates&mdash;this is the charge on the rates, not the charge on the Exchequer&mdash;1957, £14 million, on the rates; 1958, £14.4 million on the rates; 1959, £15.1 million on the rates and <Col N="198" /> that is approximately one-half of their total cost because under a previous Health Act one-half of the cost of the health services is borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I do not think we would feel as badly about that if we felt that the people for whom we were told the Act was designed were getting the benefit of it.  I ask the House to consider, on the occasion of this Vote on Account, is the fundamental industry of the country wisely charged with a burden of that kind for the return we are getting for it?  If we were getting something which made a real social revolution for the poor of this country I would be tempted to look upon so great a burden as that with a sympathetic eye.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that members of the Fianna Fáil Party regard the poor and the sick poor as being accurately described by the unfortunate phrase employed by Deputy P.J. Burke when he spoke of them as the flotsam and jetsam of our society.  I do not believe that is the approach of most Deputies to this problem but I think it is gravely lacking in moral courage and duty if all public representatives here do not query an increase from £4.9 million to £15.1 million in the cost levied on the rates of the land and houses of this country for a service which is giving very poor value to the people for whom it was designed.</P>
    <P>When I go down the country either to my own home or to visit other places I ask myself what is the reason for the grey pall of gloom that lies over rural Ireland.  Is there any Deputy who could say that a businessman or a farmer in rural Ireland has an optimistic or cheerful prospect or believes that such a prospect lies ahead?  That is certainly not my experience.  That ought not to be because the potential is there, but a great many people in rural Ireland have rightly got the idea that fundamentally this Fianna Fáil Government do not believe in the land.  They believe that they have put the &ldquo;dud&rdquo; into the Department of Agriculture. They have put him there because they have made up their minds it does not very much matter where they put him.</P>

      <P>The conviction is spreading through the country and is well founded, that Fianna Fáil do not believe in the agricultural industry, that Fianna Fáil, as at present constituted, believe that where there are not enough bricks, mortar and smoke there can be no really valuable expansion in economic output.  On the contrary, we believe that, if there is to be a real and enduring economic expansion, it must be founded on agriculture, the land and its output. The fundamental difference between us and Fianna Fáil is that we are convinced that the potential is there if it were only exploited and we are <Col N="200" /> convinced that in the present situation it can and should be exploited.</P>
      <P>So far as this ship of State is concerned, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the ship in which we sail.  There is nothing wrong with the crew that man it.  It is the officers and the captain who do not know what direction to sail in and are busily sailing around in circles, with the economic danger that, with their passion for rounding corners and surmounting peaks, they will forget it is a ship and not a jeep of which they are in charge, and, instead of sailing forth into the broad Atlantic, we shall all end up on Ireland's Eye.  Translate that into appropriate economic terms.  I ask the House is it not so? Have we not been dashing about in a wide variety of directions?</P>
      <P>I spoke at a meeting last December about the desirability of close economic integration between this country and Great Britain.  I found the Taoiseach and his Ministers in London a couple of months later avowedly seeking that objective.  They came home and we have never been told what happened.  That was followed by a visitation of high and trusted officials from this country to London to pursue this matter further.  They came home with no other news for us than that they hoped officials would come from London shortly to initial certain agreements.  They came to Dublin and have gone home, and still nothing has happened.  I accept the self-denying ordinance a responsible Opposition should assume not to press the Taoiseach too soon to take Dáil Éireann into his confidence but we believe something requires to be done now.  We believe it can be done and we press on the Taoiseach and his Government to avail of the opportunity of this Vote to tell us what they intend to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certain that the marketing of increased agricultural output presents no insuperable difficulties.  I fully appreciate the delicate problem of international trade but the time is overdue when this Government should tell us what their intentions are in respect of continental countries who are supplying us with anything up to £10 worth of <Col N="201" /> goods for every £1 worth they buy from us, especially in respect of those countries from whom we are taking commodities without which we can well afford to do and in respect of whom we find ourselves confronted with quantitative restrictions on exports we have to offer when we know those countries are accepting similar exports from other sources of supply.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind all the difficulties of negotiating trade agreements and ancillary matters, I believe the Government should make its policy known in respect of this question and its readiness known to defend the interests of our agricultural export potential in those countries, even at some cost to industrial enterprises which may have an interest in maintaining the absurd balance of trade situation that exists at the present time.  I am convinced proper pressure on those lines would help to create further marketing outlets for what we have to sell.  We are satisfied that a combination of effort on those lines and on other lines into which I do not think it is appropriate to go in excessive detail, can be made to find markets for all this country is capable of producing.  The only thing that awaits is the energy, the vision and the courage to get that production from the land through the people who live on it.  The failure of the present Government to do that is drawing us deeper and deeper into a morass of depression, fatuity and frustration which is bad for the country and bad for our people.  If this Government is not prepared to take the initiative in a new departure then I suggest, reverting to my metaphor of the ship, we should re-affirm our faith in the vessel and crew and resolve to change the officers and the captain.  If we do that, we have nothing to worry about but if we keep the present body of men in charge there is every reason for grave apprehension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess myself in complete agreement with the remarks of the last speaker in connection with the pall of gloom that hangs over rural Ireland at the moment.  That is as far as I can go with the last speaker in referring to <Col N="202" /> that pall of gloom.  I believe that that feeling of despondency has been in existence in rural Ireland for many years and in my opinion, neither the words of the Minister in moving this Vote on Account, nor the words of the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, will do anything to dispel the air of gloom over rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>We are told that energy, vision and courage are necessary if this country is to be brought to anything like a reasonable state, to ensure a livelihood for the majority of the people.  We need a lot more than courage, faith and energy.  The people of this country have never been lacking in courage. They have seldom been lacking in energy.  But apart from energy and courage, we need direction and control, yet direction and control seem to be words abhorred by the major Parties in this House.  It would appear that the idea of our major political Parties is that we must have the utmost freedom in this country for the limited few who are able to live here in comfort, while the remainder must be satisfied with the lowest possible standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmer, his family, and the workers in rural Ireland, are depressed today.  They are disillusioned and cynical and before putting forward a policy to solve or to banish the feeling of cynicism, to give an air of hope, we should examine what has caused this sense of disillusionment. What is behind it?  I do not suggest for a moment that I am sufficiently expert, or that this debate would allow me or anybody else, to give the full facts which lie behind that feeling prevalent today, but I do think that amongst the causes which brought about that atmosphere was primarily the feeling of lack of security and stability&mdash;a lack of security with regard to the worker; a lack of stability and the absence of outlet for the small farmer as far as his produce is concerned. In the last eight or ten years, certainly since I entered public life, we know what happened when the farmer produced more.  Take the west of Ireland where he produced more pigs. We found that as he produced more, <Col N="203" /> his outlet became more insecure.  We found also that no matter how depressed prices became for pigs, there was no decrease in the profits for the bacon curers or manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Last year, with a great beating of drums, we were told that there was no end to the credit made available by the banks and other lending houses for the purchase of cattle and other stock.  Then for portion of the year it was impossible for the farmer to get rid of the stock so that it would appear, if it is beef or cattle that is concerned, the more he produces and the more he carries on his land, the more doubtful becomes the market.  Even at the present time the price the farmer is getting for his cattle is one that is not too pleasing to him.  That follows the exhortations for the last three or four years to carry two cattle on the piece of land where he had previously only one.</P>
    <P>If we refer to the position of other agricultural products we find that the same criticism applies, with one or two exceptions.  We must get over that difficulty.  We must help the small farmer whom everybody in this House appears to want to help, and about whom we have heard Deputies from rural Ireland speak at great length.  If we are to protect and give encouragement to the small farmer, in many cases it will be necessary to take very drastic action against vested interests and rings which exploit him.  These vested interests will exploit him in the future just as in the past, unless some Government take the necessary action and some practical steps instead of making airy suggestions and expressing pious aspirations as to how these things can be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister in introducing the Vote on Account did so with what I can only describe as an air of complacency. An air of complacency is the last thing any Minister, and particularly a Minister for Finance, should display at the present time. The Taoiseach and other members of his Cabinet have in recent weeks expressed themselves as being perturbed about the condition of our economy. In a number of guarded statements <Col N="204" /> and speeches recently, the Taoiseach made his feelings clear to the public.</P>
    <P>He believes that, in spite of the efforts made by himself and the Government, all is not well so far as the economic security of the State is concerned.  It should not be unreasonable to expect that, when the Vote on Account is being discussed, we should hear something more concrete with regard to Government policy than vague references by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to the proposals in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, and to the means by which these proposals are being implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government have now been in office for three years, and it is not unfair to suggest that their record, in so far as emigration, employment, and the standard of living are concerned, should be examined critically at this stage, especially in view of the fact that when the Government took office, they did so with a flourish of trumpets.  They held out hopes that in their term of office, at least 100,000 new jobs would be provided.  Taking that promise and that aim into consideration, we should examine how far behind their objective the Government are today in respect of employment.</P>
    <P>Last year, in the Budget statement, the Minister for Finance made a document available to Deputies which disclosed that in the previous year, no fewer than 10,000 people had lost their employment.  In other words, there were 10,000 fewer at work in 1958 than in the previous year.  By April, we shall have more statistics available on the employment position.  I venture to prophesy at this stage that the figures disclosed in the appendix to the next <i>Statistical Abstract</i> will show that the numbers in employment have decreased rather than increased since last year.  It is fantastic when we consider the promise made by a very responsible man like the Taoiseach, that it was the aim and objective of his Party to create 100,000 new jobs, to find fewer people in employment than were in employment when the Government took office three years ago.</P>
    <P>That statement cannot be denied.  If <Col N="205" /> that is agreed upon, the record of this Government is such that they no longer deserve the confidence of the people.  It may be asked, and rightly so, have the people an alternative?  I can only honestly say that, at the moment, I see no alternative.  That, to my mind, is the great tragedy of the Irish political situation today.  I feel that the only hope is that, on the retirement of the leaders of the various political Parties, those who replace them will have common sense and that they will show a sense of responsibility to the people rather than to their political followers. I hope they will be big enough to make the political decisions which will have to be made in the near future, if we are to have any progress in this country.</P>
    <P>I have heard suggestions in this debate, and outside the House, that we should have closer ties with the British Commonwealth.  It appears to me that certain furtive and hidden moves are being made to bring this country back into a disappearing Commonwealth.  Some moves are furtive and hidden, and some are made in a very flamboyant manner indeed.  It should be borne in mind that no matter what the association of this country with the Commonwealth may be, that will provide no solution for the major problems that must be solved here in Ireland first. It is no solution to suggest that if there is a first-class trade agreement made with our neighbour, it will solve our problems.  There are those who look with longing on the restoring of political ties with the people across the Irish Sea.  That will not solve our problems.</P>
    <P>The major problems in Ireland will have to be tackled by the Irish people here at home.  There is no use in looking across the mountains, or into the distance, and hoping that something will happen, and somebody will come to our rescue.  We have looked with longing across the Irish Sea, and to our friends in America, and we can keep on looking, but there is no hope of the economic advancement of this country, unless the effort comes from within the country.  If we lose heart with regard to our own ability to put our own house in order, then <Col N="206" /> we no longer deserve to be described as a free and independent nation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will say it is all very fine to talk in generalities but how can changes be brought about?  I shall give briefly a few specific points which I think, if solved, would give a feeling of hope to the people that perhaps other evils would be remedied. I referred a few moments ago to the small farmer <i>vis-á-vis</i> the bacon industry.  If we are serious about giving security and stability to the small farmer, so far as pigs and bacon are concerned, we must come down on his side and protect him from what I describe as exploitation by the bacon curers.  Is there a hope, or a chance, that the necessary punitive and controlling measures to achieve that end will be taken by this Government?</P>
    <P>I do not believe this Government can do so, because, in my opinion, the people who control that industry, who exploit the farmer, who make fat profits at his expense and also, incidentally, at the expense of the consumers, are very close to the Government.  If an example were made of the bacon curers it would give some confidence to the bacon producers.  The small farmer hears appeals on the wireless and there are all sorts of exhortations to him to produce more pigs but from now on he will not be misled by those exhortations.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention briefly the position of another product of our farms, the turkeys.  Is there any woman in rural Ireland who keeps turkeys who has an idea three months or even three weeks before the peak of the season at Christmas what she is likely to get for her turkeys?  Is there any sense of stability in that industry?  Deputies will tell me that that means control; it means a State board; it means the payment of civil servants.  Of course it does and, at the same time, it means confidence and stability.  It means that a fair return will be given to the producer. It means that the producer will not be exploited by the middleman, by the exporter or by anybody else.  If there is a good year, if prices abroad are <Col N="207" /> high one year, it means that whatever is saved will be given back to the producers and that it will not be siphoned off by these bandits on the road between the producer and the consumer.  There are vested interests there.  I do not think we shall get any measures to put an end to the exploitation or to give a sense of security to that industry.</P>
    <P>We have contracts for malting barley, and so on.  The producer is at the mercy of the various private companies which distil in this country. I know it will be suggested that the Government have no power to control these people.  I suggest, however, that as our taxpayers are paying approximately £90,000 a year to help distillers to sell their product outside the State surely we can have some say with regard to the control of their contracts and surely we can have some say with regard to whether or not they are going the right way about the sale of their end products, and so on?</P>
    <P>We are told it would be a crime to interfere with private enterprise.  The distilling industry is one of the most important industries in the country to the small farmers, to our towns and to our export trade.  If proper control were exercised right from the stage at which barley is sold until we put the finished product on the market outside the State, it would be of great benefit to the people generally.  Let it not be said the market is not there. The market is there but it means that our private enterprise groups in the distilling industry here must sacrifice a certain amount of their autonomy and become part of a larger concern outside.  That is an industry which the taxpayer is helping but no control whatever is being exercised over it on behalf of the community.</P>
    <P>I want to come back again to the bacon industry.  In this Vote on Account, we are making money available, to add insult to injury, to the bacon factories to improve their premises.  A sum of no less than £50,000 is earmarked for the improvement and modernisation of bacon factories all over the country.  Have the <Col N="208" /> Government had a look at the profits of these companies?  Have the Government decided these companies are so poor, after years of exploiting the producers, that they cannot afford to modernise their premises?  It would appear that that is the position. I cannot object any more strenuously than I am now objecting to the allocating of £50,000 to bacon factories all over the west of Ireland which we know in many instances are closely associated with the Government.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the money spent on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  I suppose it could be said that to a great extent our major exports for years have been cattle and people.  The British are insisting on getting tuberculin-tested cattle.  They insist that the cattle exported from this country must be free from tuberculosis.  I do not think it will be long before the British insist that our emigrants will undergo similar tests.  At the moment, we have the extraordinary position that the sanatoria in this country are filled with Irish men and women who have contracted tuberculosis in Britain and have come back here to receive treatment and to be restored to health. The entire cost of restoring them to health must be borne here in Ireland while the disease was contracted in Britain.</P>
    <P>I mention that to show that many of these young people are leaving this country when they are not fitted from the point of view of health for the conditions they have to face in Britain. Apart altogether from the fact that we are losing their value as workers, we have in many instances to pay for them when they are broken in health outside the State and return here to crowd our sanatoria.  That is one aspect of emigration.</P>
    <P>On the question of the money being spent on eradicating tuberculosis in our cattle, even though it is considered an economic heresy to cast doubts on aspects of this scheme, I believe that vast sums of money are being wasted. I also believe that a courageous Government would examine the position and say to themselves: &ldquo;Now <Col N="209" /> that we are in such a tight corner with regard to exports, is it not time seriously to consider the position with regard to the dead meat trade in general?&rdquo;  I have often wondered why some university graduate or some economic expert has not made a study and produced figures to show the relevant values of, say, 100 cattle slaughtered here for the dead meat trade &mdash;and the value of the by-products, the employment given here in respect of those 100 cattle&mdash;and 100 cattle exported on the hoof.  If comparable figures were got, they would open the eyes of the general public to the tragic waste that takes place every year here in the cattle industry.  I know I shall be told by Deputy Dillon that the cattle trade is the sheet anchor of the small farmer.  I could not disagree more with him.  One of the greatest curses in this country in the past 30 or 40 years has been the dependence of the small farmer on cattle, especially store cattle.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons why the west of Ireland is bled of its people year after year is this dependence on store cattle.  A man with 15 or 25 acres of land who is expected to double the number of cattle on his land will, even if he does so, not be in a position to make an economic holding out of it.  I should much prefer&mdash;and I do not care what anybody makes of it outside this House&mdash;to see the price of cattle reduced if those cattle were slaughtered here in Ireland and the sons of the small farmers had work on the processing and on the by-products of those cattle.</P>
    <P>We know what happened over the years when attempts were made to get the dead meat trade on a proper footing.  We had speculators and exploiters moving in.  They tried to buy and depress the price of cattle.  They made profits at the expense of the farmers.  The result of it is that in the minds of many small farmers today the idea of having our cattle slaughtered here is open to grave suspicion. They feel they will be exploited by the middleman or the manufacturer in that trade, just as they are exploited at the present time in the bacon industry.</P>

      <P>This matter is one which can be more suitably discussed on the Estimate for Agriculture.  We are dealing with the Vote on Account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's advice on that.  I said what I wish to say on that line.  I was really trying to give a picture to the House of the steps that should be taken by the Government to give a sense of hope and encouragement to the producers, especially the farmers.  You cannot give them any sense of hope or encouragement, unless you give them a sense of security when they produce the goods.  I shall finish with that aspect of the cattle business.  It may be discovered that by utilising the most up-to-date marketing and services, we shall get a first-clas market abroad, even in Britain, for our by-products if we take the necessary step here of having the State move into this dead meat trade.</P>
      <P>I do not think we are at liberty to deal with particular items on the Vote on Account, but, in general, I would say that some of the increases which are apparent in the Book of Estimates and for which we are voting money in this Vote on Account do not seem to be desirable at all.  There is an increase for the President which I think at this time is uncalled for. There is an increase in the Vote for the Secret Service which I think is also uncalled for.</P>
      <P>What is, to my mind, a most fantastic increase is the increase in the Defence Estimate.  I do not think the Government can defend that extraordinary increase of over £740,000. I think the Government are living in cuckooland when we are asked to increase taxation on the people to provide more defensive equipment, which defensive equipment, I understand, includes aeroplanes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that over the past three years, members on all sides of the House have begged the Government to purchase at least one or two helicopters for the purpose of saving lives, helping the community on our barren coasts and bringing to our lighthouses mail and food when distress hits them.  We were told that the <Col N="211" /> Government could not afford to purchase even one helicopter.  Yet we are faced with an increase of over £700,000 for the purchase of defence equipment, which includes aeroplanes.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into any detail except to say that the Government should at this stage prune ruthlessly that Defence Estimate.  Strong pleas were made by Deputies that more should be done for the old age pensioners, the widows and the weaker sections of the community.  I have not the slightest doubt that if the various Ministers get cracking in their own Departments and do a little paring of administrative costs, they will find sufficient money in those Departments to enable them, in conjunction with the Minister for Defence who should be requested to take at least £1 million off that overflowing Estimate, to give something to the weaker sections of the community who have no organisation to fight their case and who can present no organised front or pressure group to obtain their rights for them.</P>
    <P>I listened last year to the Taoiseach telling us that private enterprise was the only solution of our problems and that the Government were wedded to the idea of achieving any expansion in the economy through private enterprise. We are living in the past as far as that outlook is concerned.  Even the Government in Britain, which cannot be described as a left wing Government, is far to the left of either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael in this House.</P>
    <P>Within the past few weeks, we find that Government interfering every day with big business.  They are interfering there in regard to the direction to be taken in the expansion of certain industries. The Government are empowered to interfere with regard to expenditure on capital development in these industries and the present Tory Government have interfered, and will interfere, in regard to the actual location for an expansion of these industries by &ldquo;big business&rdquo; in Britain.  The motor industry in Britain is being directed by the Government to set up its new factories in Liverpool and elsewhere. Some of these big companies objected but the power is there in British legislation and private enterprise must <Col N="212" /> accept control and direction in the interests of the public.</P>
    <P>Here, in Ireland, we live on the basis that private enterprise is sacred, that it comes first rather than the good of the community.  We know that the overriding consideration of private enterprise is gain and gain is often made at the expense of the general public.  All British Governments have decided that the general public must be saved in so far as possible from the kind of private enterprise which is prepared to eat its neighbour, if necessary, to make more money.  We shall have to take similar steps here.  Are the Government prepared to do so?</P>
    <P>The former leader of Fianna Fáil who is now sitting above in the Park said on a number of occasions in this House that he was going to give every possible opportunity to the system we have to see if it would solve our problems and give a living to our people. On a number of occasions, he expressed concern here because the system was not doing that.  He often communed with himself in this House and wondered what he could do. Several times I heard him state that, if necessary, he would go outside this system and make a radical change, if he felt that the means we had already, had failed to give what it was the Government's duty to ensure &mdash; a chance to our people to live and work here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I think it is the duty of the State to move into many fields which it has ignored up to the present.  If it does not move in, there is little hope for our future.  Let nobody for a moment believe the story that seems to have emanated from a certain camp that the rate of emigration is dropping. There is nothing more dangerous than that Deputies should accept what is only a fairy tale.  Final figures for this year cannot be got and the first time we shall have proper figures for the 1959-1960-1961 period will be when the census of population is taken in 1961.  But we are entitled, on certain evidence available to us to-day, to suggest that the trend for the past five years is upwards and there has been no change in the past 12 months in that trend of emigration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> I have here figures which were given to me to-day in reply to a question.  I do not suggest for a moment that these figures disclose the entire picture but they are accurate figures for one section of the community.  I asked the Minister for Local Government if he would state the number of relatives and employees whose claims were admitted for the purpose of abatement of rates on agricultural land in each of the years from 1950 to date and in respect of whom employment allowances were paid to farmers.  That question really relates to the number of relatives and employees of farmers who have been on the list for abatement over the past ten years and the list shows that in the past 12 months, there was a drop from 82,000 to 78,000 in the number entitled to appear on that list.  That is a drop of 4,000. That includes only males over the age of 17, and not all males over 17 in rural Ireland.  It includes only males for whom the parents are in receipt of employment allowances or who are employees on the farm.</P>
    <P>In order to get the position clear in regard to the fair sex, it is not unfair to double that number, so that we get, so far as the farms are concerned, a drop of 8,000 boys and girls in the past 12 months on the farms in rural Ireland.  That figure is accurate because this is a Government return, but we have no way of checking the numbers who have left the towns and who are not on these lists.  I would say that the position has not improved one iota; the same emergency exists with regard to emigration.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is worth while speaking in this House.  I remember on a number of occasions suggesting that all this debate could be dealt with by bringing in a series of long-playing records and I can readily believe that what I have said here to-day is merely what I said last year or something similar to it.  I wonder how many more years we shall be allowed, if we are returned by the people, to dillydally on and hope for the best?</P>
    <P>The aim of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael was stated to be to give maximum employment in the country, to give full employment.  Have they ever <Col N="214" /> said what they meant by full employment? Does it mean to give full employment to the few who are left? Does it mean that they believe, as Deputy Dillon would appear to believe, that emigration is not a bad thing at all?  Does it mean that we can pour out the life-blood of the country, the young people, and then give the remainder a good time?  I do not suggest that the man who wishes to leave this country, who wants to pack his bags and get on a boat to see Australia or Canada, should be stopped, but for every such person leaving Ireland, ten others go who do not want to go but who must go because of economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is no use in trying to soft-pedal the problem of emigration by suggesting that a great proportion of the emigrants need not go at all.  If we are able to cater for our people who would like to remain and work in Ireland, we shall not be doing badly for a start, but we are not even looking after those.  The suggestion was put forward here that a man who leaves a good job in Ireland at £7 a week and goes to Australia or Canada returns a millionaire in nine or ten years' time.  Do we ever hear of the other man who cannot even afford to write home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Acting Chairman, if he will allow me to say so, is acting rather as a prophet at the moment.  I was about to refer to the fact that so far as the balance of payments and our invisible assets are concerned&mdash;and Government policy has a bearing on this&mdash;we take credit in this country for the money sent home by our emigrants each year. Last year, I think, the figure for emigrants' remittances was in the region of £12,000,000.  We accepted that and it helped us to balance our accounts.  If the terms of trade are against this country and if our imports are in excess of our exports, we balance the books by bringing in on the receipt side of the ledger the money sent home by our emigrants.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office might be able to find out for us what the capital value of a human being is and give us figures for the different classes of people.  What is the capital value of a youth up to 21 who has only a national school education? What is the capital value of that boy as far as food, clothing, education, housing, amusements and so forth are concerned?  What is his loss to the nation when he emigrates?  We might have the same information in regard to a youth who has a secondary education up to Leaving Certificate. What is the value in £ s. d. of a university graduate, say, an engineer or a doctor?  Let us sit down and examine the loss to the country each year by the emigration of such people.  If we are putting them out at the rate of 45,000 to 50,000 a year, we should put an average capital value on them if we are to take credit for what they send home in emigrants' remittances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall conclude by referring again to what another speaker termed the air of gloom and the feeling of despondency in the country.  If we are realistic on both sides, we shall not deny that such is the case.  We shall also agree that this fog has not been cleared by any political Party in the past 12 or 14 years.  It is a fog they have all helped to bring down <Col N="216" /> upon the Irish rural scene, a fog that cannot be lifted by the methods adopted in the past 10, 12 or 14 years.  I am talking of a period of which I had experience myself.</P>
    <P>We have tinkered for too long with the old methods going back to the foundation of the State.  It is time there was a complete and radical change and the State itself stepped in before it is too late and the Irish people are replaced, as is happening every day, by foreigners coming in here.  I do not object to people coming in here in limited numbers, people who wish to live here and give their services to this country, but I do object to our negligence in failing to take measures to protect the Irish race because of our worshipping at certain shrines, such as that of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Government's three years in office show they have no new approach or hope to offer the Irish people.  There is no alternative as far as the political Parties are concerned.  This period can be described only as a mark-time period in which there is an opportunity for the people in the political Parties to sort themselves out on economic issues and no longer on the question of whether you are for the Treaty or against it.  From now on, the question should be: &ldquo;Do you believe in a certain line of approach, as far as the State is concerned, on economics and social issues, or do you take up another line of thought?&rdquo;  If there is disagreement on that, the people can decide. There can be no such thing as hoodwinking the people and hiding your economic views under the green, white and gold flag.</P>
    <P>Let us examine what has been done over the past 40 years by pursuing outmoded methods.  Let the politicians and those who hope to get the support of the people in future on economic and social policy decide one way or the other whether they will take a conservative or a left-wing view.  The merits of both types of approach will then be decided by the people.  The sooner that line-up on economic and social issues takes place, the better for the people.  If it is delayed much longer, I doubt, judging by the emigration <Col N="217" /> figures over the past four or five years, whether any Government will be in a position to take steps to put a stop to that drain of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw your attention, Sir, to the fact that I should have been called on the last occasion.  The Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Brennan, spoke from this side of the House.  The Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Sweetman and the Leader of the Labour Party and Deputy McQuillan were called from that side of the House.  I have been here since 3 o'clock and I might as well stick it out until 6.30.</P>
      <P>One would have expected that the Vote on Account would have been an occasion for the major speech of a new leader of a political Party, and certainly it was with the utmost interest that many Deputies awaited Deputy Dillon's address on this Vote on Account.  I am deeply grieved to say that I, for one, was gravely disappointed. Throughout his entire speech, he did not make one constructive criticism.  He meandered into the realms of his own ideas on agriculture, the parish plan, ground limestone and those other matters which perhaps are more appropriate to a discussion on the Department of Agriculture.  I think it is an indication of the whole tenor of the Fine Gael Party who are on the way out of Irish politics, and God speed their flight.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon did, however, make a criticism of the Taoiseach for allegedly stating that the keystone of our economic policy was the British market and he congratulated this Party and the Taoiseach on our conversion.  I am not aware of his conversion, or perversion, as I said before, but there is a difference between close alliance with the British economy and a close alliance with the British Commonwealth of Nations.  There is a world of difference between close economic ties with Britain and close political ties and, of course, it was on the economic ties that the Taoiseach was speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When, of all people, Deputy Dillon, speaks about conversion he should <Col N="218" /> blush for shame.  He spoke about the wheat acreage but that is the same Deputy Dillon who hoped that wheat would go up the spout with the peat and beet.  That is the same man who now, as Leader of the Fine Gael Party and Leader of the Opposition in this House, bemoans the fact that enough wheat is not being grown.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also suggested that the Minister for Finance omitted to include any payment in the Vote on Account for the subsidisation of the export of creamery butter and I want to correct him on that.  The Minister has included a sum of £250,000 for that purpose and I myself think that figure may be increased.</P>

      <P>It is on the bottom of page 223 &mdash;&ldquo;Subsidies on Dairy Produce&rdquo; with a paragraph which reads: &ldquo;Provision for payment of subsidies on exports of creamery butter, etc.&rdquo;  Last year £1,000,000 was provided and that was not used on account of the weather conditions, and this year £250,000 is provided.  I now draw Deputy Dillon's attention to it and say that I do not think it will be sufficient because I hope the weather will be of such a nature this year that we shall have butter for export.  When dealing with that, I should also like to draw attention to the fallacy which is being repeated at different political meetings that we pay the foreigner for eating our butter.  It is a very lucky thing that we have the foreigner there to buy this surplus butter from us.</P>

      <P>And previously Cumann na nGaedheal cut the price of milk but, as the Acting Chairman has called me to order, I shall leave that matter.  Last night Deputy Sweetman spoke about the health services and he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In regard to the provision being made for Health Services on page 354 of the Volume of Estimates in the current year, we are being asked to provide £8,160,000 under the main heading and £250,000 as a subsidiary, making a total of £8,410,000.  I want the House to realise and understand that when we are providing that sum it means that our Health Services are costing £16,800,000.</P>
      <P>Then he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This figure of £17,000,000 is a colossal one for us in our circumstances to expend on Health Services ...  It is a sum which, when we are expending it, justifies us in ensuring that we are getting proper value for the money being spent. Everywhere I go in the country I am told by those who should be entitled to claim services of that kind that they feel, and many members of the local authorities feel, that the operation and administration of the services are such that we are not getting the value we should get for the expenditure of that vast sum of money.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make with regard to the health services is that the Fine Gael Party try to make capital out of the cost of the health services and yet, whenever local authorities come to strike the rate, there is not one member of the Fine Gael Party on any local authority who can suggest any one item under the heading of Health Services which can be reduced by one penny.  As a matter of fact, conscientious <Col N="222" /> persons connected with the health services are of the opinion that, even though the cost is £17 million per annum, the services are still inadequate. That is also my opinion.</P>
      <P>Without going into details which would be more appropriate on the Estimates, may I remind the House that ophthalmic and dental services are provided only for school children, that these services are not provided for others?  I hope that in the years to come, next year perhaps, the medical card will provide for people in the middle income group free treatment by dispensary doctors.  I suggest that the additional cost would not be very great.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman also recalled that the Minister for Finance, when he was Minister for Health, told local authorities that the rates would not be increased by more than 2/- in the £ as a result of the implementation of the 1953 Health Act.  I recall the incident very well.  Does Deputy Sweetman not realise that the Minister was telling the truth to the best of his ability, when speaking in 1952, before the Bill was enacted?  Since then wages have gone up on three occasions, salaries have been increased, the cost of medicine has been increased and a new category of qualifying persons has been brought within the scope of the Act.</P>

      <P>Let no one go before the electorate and criticise the Health Act.  The Health Act has been made an issue on election platforms in the past and the Irish people have endorsed it on two occasions.  Deputy Thomas O'Higgins, to his credit, when he was Minister for Health, did his utmost to try to make the Act work.  I do not know that he satisfied everyone but he tried to the best of his ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that the Health Act should be discussed without reference to the figures in regard to T.B. It is all right for plutocrats like Deputy Dillon, Deputy Sweetman and Deputy O'Higgins to criticise the expenditure of money on health services but do they realise that in 1953, when <Col N="223" /> the Health Act came in, 30.9 per 100,000 of the population suffered from tuberculosis of the respiratory system? That figure was reduced to 17.7 in 1958.  All other forms of T.B. were reduced from 9.4 per 100,000 of the population in 1953 to 2.8 per 100,000 in 1958.</P>

      <P>What has the 1947 figure to do with it?  I draw your attention to the mentality of Deputy O'Sullivan.

I am talking about the figures for T.B. which, under every Government since then, including the Coalition Government, have progressively declined.</P>

      <P>I have, I trust, shut Deputy Sweetman up for all time.  He criticised the Minister for the bill of £8 million for health services.  That would be £17 million for the whole country because the local authorities will have to pay the other one-half.  It is a tremendous achievement to be able to say that the State, in that period from 1953 to 1958, has reduced the incidence of T.B. from 30.9 to 17.7 per 100,000 of the population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But let Deputy Sweetman remember, when he is talking about the increase in rates, that there was far too much money flogged out in the building of sanatoria, far too much, far too unwisely.  It could have been spent on the maintenance of mentally retarded and handicapped children, on the alleviation of congestion in mental homes.  There was far too much spent on sanatoria by the said Deputy Dr. Browne, possibly with the best intentions in the world.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that a former Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government would have been constructive in his remarks. Throughout his entire speech, Deputy Sweetman had not one constructive criticism to offer on the Estimate, except to sneer at the whole thing. I am sure that the Minister, when he is replying, will not have much difficulty in demolishing the few points made by the Deputy.  The Deputy was Minister for Finance of a Government which, in 1951, left to a Fianna Fáil Government a deficit in the balance of payments of £61.6 million&mdash; a lovely item with which to face office. When Fianna Fáil left office in 1954 we had got the deficit down to manageable proportions, to £5.5 million. Deputy O'Sullivan's Government was not well back in office when, in 1955, the deficit in the balance of payments had again gone out of manageable proportions, to £35 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the start of the collapse of the Coalition Government of the time because then the levies and mass unemployment came.  The criticism of Fianna Fáil at the time was not directed at the imposition of the levies as such but that the decision to take <Col N="225" /> remedial measures, which was forecast by Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Dr. Ryan when in Opposition, was made too late and that Deputy Sweetman panicked.  He should never have let the position get out of hand.  I am glad to say the Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, in his first year of office remitted a substantial number of the levies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>And made the rest permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I hope that before our term of office expires the balance of these levies which, as Deputy O'Sullivan interjected, are in permanent taxation, will be remitted too.</P>
      <P>Mention of emigration was made by all the Opposition speakers so far. There is no use in going into that on the Vote on Account except to say that everything points to a downward trend.  The excess of the outward passenger movement over inward movement shows that in 1957 53,000 more people left than came in.  In 1958 that was down to 32,000.  It is far too high but I quote the figure merely to indicate the downward trend.</P>
      <P>Another point which Deputy Sweetman, the former Minister for Finance, overlooked and which the present Minister for Finance, if he wished to make a political speech, could have rubbed in very hard is in relation to the American counterpart loan.  Do Deputy Sweetman and Deputy O'Higgins know what we are paying back for the balance of the American counterpart loan?  We are paying back an annual sum of £41 million.  When we came into power in 1932 we had to fight an economic war over the land annuities in respect of which the gentlemen on the other side not only did not give us any assistance but blackguarded us from one end of the country to another.</P>

      <P>Any particular aspect, I should have said.  I trust the shadow Minister for Agriculture, Deputy O'Sullivan, will speak on this in due course.  All aspects of agriculture show the one trend.  In 1956 there were 747,000 pigs in the country, according to the Statistical Abstract. In 1958 there were 947,000.  In 1956 there were 3,439,000 sheep; in 1958 there were 4,174,000.  We are told today by Deputy Dillon there is a slight increase in the number of cattle.</P>

      <P>The calves were not born at the time for which I am giving you these statistics. The number of bulls went down by seven per cent. and all other types of cattle increased by 1.8 per cent. From January, 1958, to January 1959, there was an increase in sheep of 8.1 per cent.  Under this Vote the capital expenditure has increased from £8.9 million in 1955-56 to £14.6 million in 1958-59.  Deputy O'Sullivan is not in form today; he cannot contradict any of those statistics.</P>
      <P>As regards agricultural workers, there was a progressive decline, on average, of 11,000 males on the farm between the years 1942 and 1953, inclusive. In 1954, for the first time in the history of the State, there was an increase in the numbers employed on the land.  The Coalition took office then and in 1955 there was another drop of 3,000 in the number employed on the land.  In 1956 the figure was 9,000 and in 1957, the year we returned to office, there were 10,000 fewer on the land.  In the Coalition's term of office, 22,000 young male employees had departed from rural Ireland.  I am glad to say that in 1958 this tendency was reduced to manageable proportions. There was a drop of 4,000 and I hope, when the figures for 1959-60 come out, the position will return to that which obtained in 1954 and that employment will be on the upgrade. I suppose Deputy O'Sullivan does not want me to bore him with the figures for wheat or barley or for the corn crop, which increased from 1,105,000 acres in 1956 to 1,189,000 in 1958.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some points made by Deputy Sweetman to which I should like to refer.  Deputy Sweetman gave us figures of the amount paid out to local authorities for various purposes from the Local Loans Fund.  I cite this case as a typical example of the gross, downright dishonesty of the Fine Gael Party leaders.  Giving a cursory glance at the figures for 1954-55, 1955-56, 1956-57, and 1957-58, there would not be a very substantial change in the amount furnished from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities that would suggest that one year things might have been a bit better, that there might have been twice as many houses built, or twice as much sanitary work undertaken one year and the next year it might have increased again by a half million pounds this way or that way.  What is the truth of the matter?  The truth of the matter is that Dublin Corporation made an issue of £6 million 5 per cent. stock at 98 in December, 1955. The public gave £1,802,000 of this £6 million.  They looked for only £6 million at 5 per cent., issued at 98, and the public gave £1,802,000.  What happened?  The remainder had to be taken up by the underwriters who were the Minister for Finance and the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to make the Local Loans Fund available for Dublin and Cork Corporation was rendered inevitable by the failure of the 1955 public stock issue.  Hitherto, the Dublin and Cork Corporations had no access to the Local Loans Fund.  When they could not get the money, the Coalition Government said: &ldquo;All right; you can now draw on the Local Loans Fund.&rdquo;  Then, from 1st April, 1957, Dublin and Cork Corporations got all the capital they required from the Local Loans Fund and they have relied on the Fund for all their borrowing, with the exception of a loan of £350,000 which the Dublin Corporation obtained from an Insurance company and a loan of £30,000 which Cork Corporation got also from an insurance company.  It can be seen therefore if the Dublin and Cork Corporations had met their obligations, from sources other than the Local Loans Fund, the amount of money <Col N="229" /> shown as having been drawn from the Local Loans Fund would have been a very insignificant amount indeed.</P>
    <P>Here is an interesting figure in this connection.  Expenditure in 1956-57 by local authorities, other than Cork and Dublin Corporations, for new houses to be put in hands in that year, was estimated by the Department of Local Government to be £1,110,000&mdash; £460,000 for urban areas and £650,000 for rural areas.  In May, 1956, the Government decided that the estimated borrowings for all new works would have to be cut by at least 50 per cent.  Between July 1956 and February 1957&mdash;when we came back to power&mdash;only seven unimportant local authority housing projects were sanctioned, outside Dublin and Cork. Between July, 1956, and February, 1957, seven minor schemes were sanctioned and the total expenditure sanctioned by the Coalition for the entire country&mdash;outside of Dublin and Cork&mdash;between these dates was what? Was it £3 million?  It was £13,000&mdash; and then Deputy Sweetman has the audacity to criticise the Fianna Fáil administration for a hold up in the payment of housing grants.</P>
    <P>Our criticism in the housing censure motion in December, 1956, which was moved by the then Deputy Smith on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, when we were in Opposition, was not in regard to the number of houses necessary, or being erected or reconstructed. It was the fact that local authorities would not be told the truth.  They did not know when they were to get their money.  Houses had been completed and were actually being lived in and the local authorities could not get their money and no new schemes could be embarked on.  When we came back into office in 1957, we found that unsanctioned arrears of tenders and site acquisitions, and partially completed local authority work, represented an ultimate expenditure of £1 million.  On top of the deficit which Deputy Sweetman left us of £6 million in the Budget of 1957 which we had to bring in&mdash;the Capital Budget which he boasted was lying on the desk of the <Col N="230" /> Minister for Finance&mdash;Deputy Smith, then Minister for Local Government, had there and then to pay £1.340 millions to the local authorities to clear off the debts left by the Coalition to the builders and the commitments of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon chose to pick out for mention the Department of Defence, the Department of Health and one or two other items and queried the vast increase. In the main, all the increases in this Vote on Account for the Public Services for the year ending 31st March, 1961, are caused by increases in salaries and wages.</P>

      <P>Is it the case of the Fine Gael Party that they object to these increases?  Do they think these increases should not be paid?  If they do not object to increased remuneration for civil servants and officers of local authorities, where does their criticism lie?  What are they complaining about?  Would they be a little more specific?  They cannot have their cake and eat it.</P>
      <P>Mention was made by Deputy Dillon of rates on agricultural land.  We brought that Act in, in 1953&mdash;I think I am right in saying that&mdash;and it provided for increased allowances of £17 for each adult workman employed by a farmer.  The allowance previously was £6 10s.  In 1956, the Government of the day adopted the 1953 scheme which was so vehemently criticised in this House.  They extended it to 1959 and this year we, as we all knew, have extended it further to 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman chose to skip very quickly through the Local Government Estimate, with particular reference to certain subheads.  He did not deal at all with the Road Fund. I should like to recall to the minds of Deputies a serious omission on Deputy Sweetman's part.  As we know, in the financial year, 1954-55, an allocation of £1½ million was given to the Road Fund from the National Development Fund.  Payments from the National Development Fund were not made to the Road Fund in subsequent years. As a matter of fact, it was quite illegal <Col N="231" /> to do so after 31st March, 1957.  In 1955-56, supplementary grants were notified to all local authorities.  They were discontinued in 1956-57.  I want to recall to the minds of Deputies on the opposite side of the House what took place in 1956-57 in regard to the Road Fund and, when they criticise this Book of Estimates, they might bear this little item in mind.  In 1956-57, the Minister for Finance found himself in such straitened circumstances that he stole £500,000 from the road fund.</P>

      <P>He raided the Exchequer to the extent of £½ million, and then the income which accrues under that heading&mdash;from petrol rationing, hire purchase restrictions and the import levies&mdash;which was a source of revenue, fell substantially.  At 31st March, 1957, what were the outstanding commitments the Minister for Finance had to meet?  He had to meet £4.177 million compared with £1.18 million on 1st April, 1954.  We had to face £4.17 million, and it was obvious that some hasty decision was necessary on behalf of the Government by the Minister for Finance. What happened?  In order that grants could continue at the same level in 1957-58 as in the previous year, a repayable advance of £900,000 was obtained.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture was Minister for Local Government at that time and I should like to recall what he said at Column 899, Volume 161, of the Official Report of 7th May 1957:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, therefore, as I found it, was that if reasonable interim payments were to be made to local authorities the total of new grants should not exceed £3,000,000&mdash;a reduction of £2,000,000 with a consequent drop in employment of up to 4,000 men.  Neither an increase in the overdrafts of local authorities nor a further drop in the amount of employment afforded on road works would be desirable.  In those circumstances and after consultation <Col N="232" /> with the Minister for Finance, the Government has agreed that the funds available for road works in the current year should be supplemented by a sum of approximately £900,000 to be made available from State capital and to be repayable from the Road Fund over a period of years.  This will enable the allocation for the current year to be maintained at the same amount as that allocated last year.</P>
    <P>Commitments are still high.  At 31st March, 1955, our commitments to the Road Fund were over £3,000,000, but we have maintained the grants at the 1956-57 level&mdash;and only with the greatest difficulty.  It is for those reasons, as the Minister has pointed out, that special State assistance was afforded to the Road Fund under the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1959, to deal with road problems arising from certain factors.</P>
    <P>Again, when Deputies criticise this Government for increases under this item, I draw their attention to the fact that the Road Fund Act, 1959, makes provision for payments not exceeding £400,000 per annum for five years to the Road Fund, half of which is a free grant and half, repayable advances. This scheme of grants and advances enabled special assistance to be given to local authorities to deal with roads affected by the recent closing of railways and roads leading to particular major industrial undertakings.  I understand major schemes with a very high employment content are now proceeding. We had the work on the Dublin-Bray road and the Dublin-Naas road, and work on the Dublin-Balbriggan road is going on at present and costing £124,000.  The Dublin County Council section of this work was held up by opposition in certain quarters, and that cost £315,000, and the Corporation's proportion is £120,000.</P>
    <P>The question of bridges comes under the Vote on page 120 of the Book of Estimates&mdash;Vote No. 32&mdash; Local Government.  Three bridges which are often discussed here, Wexford Bridge, Youghal Bridge and Valentia Bridge, will all come up for consideration and be dealt with by <Col N="233" /> the Minister for Finance in the coming year.</P>

(Minister for Lands).</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>One can hardly put sufficient emphasis on the great importance of forestry.  We realise, as the Minister will clearly admit, that forestry and the important work of afforestation will not pay immediate or early dividends.  This has been very clearly demonstrated in the statement the Minister made here last night in connection with the fact that Irish timber is in general use in the building trade and that the building trade are coming to recognise that Irish-grown products, properly handled and seasoned, are equal to any of the imported grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that the timber to which the Minister is now referring was planted many years ago when the initial stages of forestry were undertaken by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  It shows very clearly the wisdom and the sound judgment of that Government that we have now reached the stage at which our own timber, properly seasoned and <Col N="234" /> in fit condition, can be used in the building trade for constructional purposes. I hope this trend will continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot blow his trumpet too loudly in praise of the activities of the Forestry Division because he knows quite well as does every member of this House that, until the period during which Deputy Blowick was Minister for Lands, Forestry was completely at a standstill. The inter-Party Government revived Forestry.  They put new life into afforestation.</P>
    <P>When the Minister tells the House that the target for the State-planting programme this season is 25,000 acres, one might well ask how that comes about.  Is the Minister trying to convey that it is as a result of the policy of the present Government that forestry has made such headway?  Is it not a fact that the inter-Party Government made it possible for the Minister to make that declaration here yesterday? All down through the years, the great difficulty in connection with forestry was the acquisition of suitable lands. That question usually cropped up in regard to the presentation of the right and the proper type of title to the lands.  The inter-Party Government simplified matters.  They made it easier for the Forestry Division to acquire lands.  They made matters easier for the vendor anxious to transfer his lands for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate goes on to deal with the fact that extra expenditure in travelling has been occasioned by the additional progress made in Forestry.  It is right to say, and the evidence is there in my constituency&mdash; probably more so in my constituency than in any constituency in Ireland with the exception of Wicklow&mdash;that a vast amount of very valuable and useful work in Forestry has been carried out.  Forestry is one of the greatest works that can be undertaken by any Government.</P>
    <P>It is not too encouraging to hear that the total number of men employed by the Forestry Division is 4,800. We all know that a far greater amount of labour can be absorbed.  I recommend the Minister to direct the attention <Col N="235" /> of his inspectors and foresters to the still vast amount of land available which the owners are anxious to give to the Forestry Division for planting. Bearing in mind that the Forestry Division are not too generous in their payment for land, it is amazing that so many landowners are anxious to sell.  Probably in some cases the land is of poor quality but would be suitable for afforestation, particularly when it adjoins existing forest centres.  Every encouragement should be given by the Minister to his Department to enter into negotiations with such landowners to acquire the land by agreement with the least possible delay so that the development work that must be undertaken in respect of the erection of suitable fences, the proper drainage of the land and preparation for planting may commence as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are many people who feel that if you put a plant into the ground to-day there should be profitable results from it at an early date.  Thinning operations require a certain amount of training and skill on the part of the workers.  I am glad to say that we have in this country as highly-trained and highly-skilled foresters as are to be found in any country.  I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to our highly-technical and fully-qualified foresters.  We can proudly boast that no Forestry Department in the world has a better staff of technical men than we have.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered if, due to the extra expenditure referred to in this Supplementary Estimate, some of the officers of the Minister's Department are engaged in negotiations with Bord na Móna which has an extensive bog development programme.  I have often been puzzled too why there was not a greater measure of co-operation between the Forestry Division and Bord na Móna so that one would be working at the same time as the other. There is a time of the year when Bord na Móna find it impossible to retain the services of their men.  At the time Bord na Móna would be letting their temporary workers go, they could immediately be turned over <Col N="236" /> to Forestry where they could be engaged on the preparation of lands for planting or on road making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see here additional expenditure of £70,000 for the purchase of road materials.  I was just about to make reference to road-making because it is just as important to have good roads leading well into the forest as to have a good road adjacent to the forest.  Since, as the Minister pointed out, the building trade look upon our native timber as the best they can use, it is particularly important that there should be good roads through the forests so that good heavy trucks and lorries may be used for the haulage and transport of the felled timber.</P>
      <P>There seems to be an extraordinary amount of money provided in respect of materials for road-making.  We all know quite well that the amount paid by local authorities for sand and gravel to those who have sand and gravel pits is not by any means generous. At the same time, it must be admitted that the Forestry Division in the forests with which I am familiar have certainly very good roads through them.  I understand that as the forests become more extensive and as the growth develops, it is for them to extend those roads and construct new branch roads leading off these main roads to the forest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recommend very strongly to the Minister that the width of these roads be not less than the width <Col N="237" /> of the ordinary county by-road. I have seen roads through some of the forests in my area in respect of which a good deal of additional work has to be undertaken in their widening because, in the original construction, the roads were not made sufficiently wide.  I trust the engineering section of the Forestry Division will bear in mind the wisdom in road construction of laying a solid and sound foundation with sufficient width to accommodate a double line of traffic.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Department have devoted so much of their energies to road-making through the forests.  It is of the greatest possible importance.  I trust this progress will continue to a greater extent and that it may also be possible to have additional men employed at such work where the local foresters have recommended that the construction of roads should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I note with satisfaction that the Minister refers to the fact that a further factor contributing towards the excess cost of labour is the wage increase of 7/6 per week effective from 2nd January, 1960.  If there is any one section of the community entitled to special wage increase facilities, it is the forestry workers, because, unlike the industrious, hardworking county council workers, the forestry worker must take certain lessons from his local forester and no green countryman, so to speak, can be employed properly with success in the forest, unless he has a knowledge of the work he must perform.</P>
    <P>That is why I say that the forestry worker should be singled out as the worker who should be given an increased rate of pay.  I realise the importance of the county council worker and I realise the importance of the agricultural worker.  Nevertheless, I feel that the increase of 7/6 per week, with effect from 2nd of last January, for the ordinary forestry worker was not sufficient and that the Forestry Division should bear in mind the amount of additional work above the ordinary labouring duties that must be performed in forestry work, for example, thinning and planting.  At times, a very special <Col N="238" /> type of drainage work must be performed.</P>
    <P>An increase of 7/6 per week was granted in response to trade union demands.  We know well that the trade unions are quite capable and competent to look after their members. Nevertheless, I feel that the Forestry Division should set the headline themselves and that special provision should be made above the agricultural labourer and above the ordinary county council worker for proper rates of pay for forestry workers.  I feel that an increase of 7/6 per week was insufficient, having due regard to the increased cost of living.  I have no doubt that the trade unions are alive to their responsibilites in this matter and that in the coming financial year, they may be faced with another demand which I feel will be a reasonable one in respect of workers who have work of a very special character to perform.</P>
    <P>I note the absence from the Supplementary Estimate of any reference to the introduction of a pension scheme for forestry workers.  I had hoped that some provision would be made for it.  Particularly when the Minister dealt with the question of the increase of 7/6 per week, I thought he would have made some reference to the introduction of a pension scheme for these workers.  I trust that on the main Estimate, to be introduced very shortly, the Minister will bear the matter in mind.</P>

      <P>When the main Estimate comes up for consideration, the House expects to hear from the Minister what progress has been made in regard to the provision of a proper pension scheme for forestry workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not clearly expressed himself, at least to me anyway, in regard to the expenditure of £4,000 on subhead F&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Services.  The incentive bonus scheme is a good scheme but I wonder does that scheme mean more work for the forestry worker or fewer men on the pay roll of the Forestrry Division? <Col N="239" /> I should like the Minister to give the House a little more information in that regard.  Am I to understand that this consultant is more or less what may be described as an efficiency expert, whose duties are, if possible, to cut down on the numbers of men employed and to institute a scheme whereby more work will be performed by fewer men?  I am not too clear about that.  I wonder is it really paying the Forestry Division to spend £4,000 on the services of one man to apply this bonus scheme.  I have not been fully informed on this either by the forestry workers with whom I am in contact or anybody connected with forestry.  I would ask the Minister to give more detailed information if possible in that regard.</P>
    <P>I hope to deal more fully with the sale of timber on the main Estimate. I feel that the trading and sales section of the forestry department is not sufficiently alert and is not yielding as good a return as it might.  I believe sales of timber should be divided into various classifications&mdash;timber for commercial purposes, for firewood and timber for other purposes.  I suppose this could more properly be dealt with on the main Estimate and for that reason I propose to reserve my observations until then.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that we on this side of the House have no objection to giving him the money he seeks but we have to remind him and the Government that we are very much alive to the importance of forestry as a major industry in this country from the points of view of the provision of our own timber, the provision of suitable plants, advancing our nurseries and particularly of providing great employment.  That is one of the reasons I am so keen on forestry development. I feel that with an extensive and progressive forestry policy we would be quite capable of employing at least 12,000 men in our forests despite the fact that to-day we have only about 4,500 employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I have to take a different line in regard to this Estimate and criticise the Department for the manner in which they have <Col N="240" /> carried out forestry administration in County Wicklow.  I have been a lifelong advocate of forestry; I supported it when it was not very popular and I regret to find that while in this Estimate increases are being sought, in almost all forests in Wicklow we have had men with long service&mdash;ten or fifteen years&mdash;dismissed, while we have retained men with less than half that service.</P>
      <P>The trade unions always agreed that the man longest in service should be kept longest in the job, that the last man in should be the first discharged. I believe the Minister's Department have received a complaint and I hope they will investigate it.  I am making a statement now that I challenge the Minister or his Department to refute. The six members discharged at Ballinglen quarry by a peculiar coincidence are the six men who remained away for a day during the Referendum and Presidential Election.  It seems peculiar that these six men were picked out as the first to be discharged while others were retained.  An inquiry into alleged victimisation of these men has been sought.  Why should they have been singled out of the 70 men at that forestry centre?  I challenge the Department to send down an independent inspector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ensure that action will be taken.  We will be in a position to supply all the evidence required to prove that the reports the Minister has received in connection with the dismissal of these men are not correct.  If the Minister had the real truth I firmly believe from my association with him that he would not stand over the action that was taken.  I believe in County Wicklow we could put a large number of men to work instead of dismissing them to <Col N="241" /> ensure that some of the innermost trees are not smothered with an overgrowth of briars.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that the 7/6 increase about which we were told is not such a large one for men engaged in forestry.  We know that these men have to travel up to 10 miles to and from work in County Wicklow.  If they are an hour late for any reason they lose money.  Frequently they do not get the full week especially in the kind of weather we had in recent months.  The cash actually paid is much less than the amount they should receive in theory because it is not always possible to provide suitable work.</P>
      <P>I should like to have some proper scheme worked out.  Many years ago a Minister in that Department agreed that when men reached the entrance to the forest that should count as their time of arrival and not the time when they commenced work possibly two or three miles up the hill.  He would allow a concession also where a shower took place and he showed some human feeling so that these men would not be deprived of pay for half an hour or an hour.  At that time they had co-operation but, unfortunately, at present there is so much unemployment in rural areas and especially in Ballinglen and Aughrim that there is no hope of men discharged from the forestry service finding employment with the small farmers in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to substantiate the complaint that I made.  I would appeal to the Minister to try to provide work for the men discharged after a service of ten or fifteen years in forestry.  That would probably result in greater co-operation. Personally, I do not agree with some of the union work; possibly it is because they are operating in areas with so little employment that the unions have to be careful but there is a limit to the patience of the men in rural areas and a limit to the patience they have with organisations.  Having been a union official all my life, I see their difficulties but at the same time I cannot see a trade union escaping its responsibility and its duties in respect of rural workers, especially forestry workers, who are giving so much to the country at present.  We cannot <Col N="242" /> devote all our thought to the cities and towns where there is 100 per cent. organisation.  Since we are providing for the others, we should consider the man in the rural areas on low wages. I hope the trade unions will devote the remainder of the year to protecting him from county councils and Government Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the House is agreeable to give this Supplementary Estimate of £90,250 to the Minister.  I was glad to learn from the Minister's introductory speech that so much has been done in the Forestry Section over the past 12 months.  However, every Deputy looks at this matter from the point of view of his own constituency and I am perturbed about two or three forests in my own immediate area in North Galway&mdash;the forests at Clonbrock, Mountbellew and Ballygar, where men have been left off within the past month or so.  Other Deputies have said that the same thing has happened in their constituencies. I admit that this sort of thing happens in many State Departments.  We have it in Galway County Council.  Coming towards the end of the financial year, work generally becomes slack because, possibly, funds are running out; but since we are giving this Supplementary Estimate, I cannot understand how this is happening in my area.  I trust that the lay-off of workers in Clonbrock, Mountbellew and Ballygar is merely temporary, coming to the end of the financial year, and that these men will be re-employed as soon as possible.  Some of them have been working in these forests for years and are married with families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been intimated to me that there is a new departure in the Department and that they have a policy of using machinery instead of men.  I do not know how true that is. However, I am told they brought in machinery to replace men in a virgin bog at Ballygar but that they had to go to the Sugar Company at Gowla farm to get tractors to pull the machines out.  In spite of that, they did not employ men but left the machines there until the bog dried up so that the machines could be used <Col N="243" /> again.  Machinery may be a good thing and may get the work done more quickly and so on, but, to my mind, there is a social question in this as well as a question of efficiency.  Since these forestry workers have built their homes and settled down beside the forests in which they work it would be very unjust to force them to take the emigrant ship and seek employment abroad by replacing them with machinery.  I hope that policy will not be followed by the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I do not know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if I am allowed to speak about the intake of land in these forests in which I am interested.  I have myself drawn to the attention of the Forestry Section some land which is available adjacent to these forests. I should like to have the intake of land speeded up because if these forests were taken over, not only would there be no unemployment, but I believe we could give more employment. There is one forest in particular, Clonbrock, near Kinclare Caltra, where land has been offered.  The amount of land involved is small, only 60 acres or 70 acres of a commonage. I took up this matter with the Forestry Section when I was first elected round 1948 or 1949.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, it should be said that no Party will object to giving the Minister money for the promotion of afforestation.  The Forestry Division may be said to be a productive State department; it gives quite a substantial amount of employment.  The Minister says that extra money is required to meet additional labour charges.  In view of the fact that afforestation seems to be expanding at present, as it has been for the past ten or 15 years, the Minister would be doing a good day's work if he endeavoured to provide security of employment over a certain number of years for the workers in the Forestry Division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the work of the Forestry Division is seasonal, that certain types of work are carried out at different times of the year and that it may be found necessary on occasion to let people off.  But I think the Minister would be doing something to stem emigration if he could devise some method whereby forestry workers will be engaged for the 12 months of the year, because, as was said last night, nine or ten months' work on forestry is not sufficient for any worker.  I know it is difficult to carry a man for two months when you have no work to give him and during a time when you have to pay him wages, but I do not think it would be such a difficult task to arrange the afforestation year to ensure that those workers who have been employed on forestry for nine, ten or 15 years, should get a full 12 <Col N="245" /> months' work during the year, so as to get away from the casual work basis that seems to be peculiar to many types of employment.  If this were done in the Forestry Section of the Department the Minister would be doing a tremendous amount to curb unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>Naturally the Minister cannot know what sackings take place in particular counties and particular forests but I do think he ought to take note of what has been said by Deputy Everett in regard to the sacking of men who were employed for periods of ten and 14 years.  Various reasons may be given by those men as to why they were sacked and the officials in the Department may have other reasons but it does seem peculiar, and I believe the Minister will think it so, that men working on forestry for upwards of ten years were sacked shortly after the day of the Presidential Election when, as good citizens, they went out and worked in that particular campaign. Whom they supported, what individual or Party they supported, does not make any difference.  In my opinion they discharged a national duty in working on election day and, if they were sacked for that reason, I do not think it could be regarded as fair.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not commit himself to-night to reply on that matter but after this debate, if he has not done so already, he ought to satisfy himself as to whether or not these dismissals were proper.  In conclusion I would ask him to ensure that as far as employment in afforestation is concerned&mdash;I know it would not be simple &mdash;he should try to provide employment for 12 months of the year and not for seven, eight or nine months only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage of the debate there is not much that remains to be said.  Deputy Blowick and Deputy O.J. Flanagan covered some of the points to which I meant to advert and Deputy Kitt also referred to some points that were in my mind. As he said, when speaking on an Estimate such as this, one is influenced by conditions in one's own constituency. No doubt the Minister finds it increasingly difficult as time goes on <Col N="246" /> to obtain sufficient land for afforestation but he has an asset in the understanding and sympathy of so many organisations and individuals, quite apart from Deputies here, and through them it is to be hoped he will be able to acquire enough land to maintain the high planting rate now happily being reached or, perhaps, better it.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what progress was made in consequence of the Bill introduced by Deputy Blowick and which was implemented, with a great flourish of trumpets by his successor, the present Minister for Transport and Power? That was a Bill passed during the lifetime of the last Government which made it easier for his Department to acquire land by simplifying the procedure in regard to the title of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Chair that I would not advert to it if someone else had not spoken on that point. I agree with Deputy Kitt in the appeal he made to the Minister to give precedence at all costs, even at the expense of some slight increase in the cost of running his Department, to considering the social aspect in the spending of money and to remember that, even though a machine may produce better work in a shorter time, it may be at the expense of the employment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In rural parts of the country we all know of neighbours who used to get work on the roads and who are unemployed today because of the fact that machinery has replaced them in road building.  Many men look to afforestation for employment and this is one Department which could provide more employment, employment which will have an enduring benefit to the country.  In every instance where it is at all possible, I appeal to the <Col N="247" /> Minister to give preference to the employment of manual labour because this is the type of work which calls for personal attention on the part of efficient workers.  In his Department the Minister has an excellent team of officials, men dedicated to their work, and I want to join with Deputy O.J. Flanagan in paying tribute to the foresters for the manner in which they carry out their work and supervise the work of others.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already, the Minister has also behind him many voluntary organisations which made it possible for him and his predecessors to attain the target we have now reached and, in this respect, I have just one word of criticism to offer.  I have in mind an area where forestry was unknown and where it took quite a lot of local effort to secure land for planting.  It was done with the main aim and object of giving local employment but, when the land was secured and the Department took it over, labour was moved in from outside.  I agree that the men who were brought in were men who had been working on forestry for some period, but to a certain extent, that negatived the good effect locally.  I think it may be detrimental to the Minister in his efforts to secure more land in that area because the people who agitated in favour of a forestry scheme there had as their main reason the giving of a modicum of local employment.  I just ask him to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>I shall reserve any further inquiries I have to make for the main Estimate and join with the other Deputies in saying how happy I am that we have reached such a high planting rate. That was not done today or yesterday. It took planning to build up that particular branch of afforestation, and I do not mean any pun in that.  It took a number of years to reach the point we have now reached and I hope that progress will be maintained.  The Minister will have the help and the assistance of all Parties and members in this House if that can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House because many of the matters that could be raised on this Supplementary <Col N="248" /> Estimate have already been fully discussed by previous speakers. I just want to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that forestry workers necessarily operate in very open spaces, on mountain sides and so on, and I think ample provision should be made for their comfort.  In particular some provision should be made by which they could have a hot meal, or two, during their ten hours' work each day.  They start work at 8 o'clock in the morning and I think they finish at 6 in the evening.  A temporary structure could be erected, where there are big acreages to plant, and one worker, who might be pretty good at cookery, could take a couple of hours off to cater for the men in that respect.  Men have to travel very long distances.  At all times, suitable provision should be made for their comfort. Men who are well fed and cared for work all the better.  There may be sudden storms or bad weather and shelter should be provided.  I would ask the Minister to make suitable provision in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>Very many matters have been raised on the Supplementary Estimate which would be much more applicable to the general Estimate for my Department and, therefore, I do not propose to deal with the various questions of general policy that have been raised. In the short time left to me, I just want to give the House some information which was requested in the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick expressed disappointment at the fact that only 4,800 men are employed in forestry and suggested that the figure appeared to be going down.  In actual fact, there are approximately 150 more men in employment this year than there were last year and the trend has been upwards, which would seem to conflict with the view held by Deputy Blowick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the question of man <i>versus</i> machinery is concerned, there can be very little room for debate, but I should like to make one point very clear, namely, that, without the machines, there is a certain amount of employment that would not become available at all, because, in modern <Col N="249" /> forestry, machines have made it possible for my Department to plant bogs and exposed areas which otherwise would not be plantable.  That has brought in its wake additional employment. I should also say that it is the settled policy of the Department, where there is no very radical difference in costings, to prefer man labour to machinery, that they lean in that direction.</P>
    <P>I cannot express any view on the matter mentioned by Deputy Kitt in connection with machinery in County Galway, except to state that I shall have it inquired into by my Department.</P>
    <P>In regard to the savings and the breakdown of the figures for savings required by the House, the two figures are: savings on nurseries of £8,000 and on machinery, of £26,000, making a total of £34,000 in the year under review.  The saving on nurseries was due to the low weeding costs and the increased use of T.V. oil for spraying. The saving in machinery was due to lower requirements than anticipated, both in purchase and hire of heavy plant.</P>
    <P>I did not give the mileage of roads under construction when introducing the Supplementary Estimate.  It is 275 miles.  The material now being used, in the main, is gravel, which has been found to be cheaper than stone. The cost of these roads is very substantial and, for their purpose, a narrow road is quite sufficient.  As a matter of fact, a narrow road is necessary because, apart from the cost of constructing the road, there is also the question of saving the land for planting. These roads may be narrow, taking an average run of them, but there are wide places on the roads, which make them suitable for the purpose for which they are constructed.</P>
    <P>In this matter, we look to the costings and use, in the main, the cheapest method.  If material can be purchased outside at a cheaper rate than the cost of its production by the workmen on the forest or quarry, we get it from outside.  I think that is a practice which would be approved by the House and that if any other practice were suggested, the Department would <Col N="250" /> come under severe criticism, because, at all times, the Department must have regard to the financial and economic aspects of this whole business.</P>
    <P>A Deputy raised the question as to whether there was any co-operation with our opposite numbers in Britain, whether the friendly relations that existed formerly were still maintained. I am glad to say that, in fact, there is a joint mission working here and in Britain as to the most suitable strains of <i>pinus contorta</i>, that my Department and the British Forestry Commission are working in this field in the closest harmony, and that information is freely exchanged between their Department and ours.</P>
    <P>There is a stand of this species in Kilworth Forest in Cork which, I understand, is one of the best examples of the species in Western Europe and as the seed of this variety give very different results in different areas, the information obtained here has been quite useful to the people on the other side and they, on their part, have been most co-operative with the officials of my Department.  Therefore, as far as the experiments carried out on both sides of the Channel are concerned, our Department and theirs get on extremely well and the good relations that formerly existed have gone from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett raised the question of the dismissal of forestry workers in county Wicklow.  He made certain allegations in the House as to the reason for which these men are alleged to have been dismissed.  All I can say is that this is the first I have heard of the matter and that I shall ask the Deputy to give me particulars and, undoubtedly, the allegations will be investigated by me.  This evidently happened a considerable time ago and on the information available to me at the moment, I cannot throw any light on the allegations made by Deputy Everett.  I can only assure the Deputy, and Deputy Corish who followed him on the same side, that the allegations will be investigated.</P>
    <P>I want to say that, generally, the ordinary rule applies, just as it does in industry outside, that the more experienced workers, who have been <Col N="251" /> there for a long time, are invariably retained rather than people who have come in last.  Where men have been found to be successful and to have acquired skill as a result of their work, they are naturally more valuable and, naturally, are kept on.  On the question of providing continuity of employment for those engaged in the industry, I am sure the House will realise that it is no pleasure for me or for the Forestry Section to let men go.  Part of the reason is the lack of long-term planning in connection with the whole business.  I should like Deputies to appreciate that to do this job in a proper way&mdash;this is accepted forestry practice outside this country and should be accepted here&mdash;we would require a plantable reserve of 75,000 acres to work on our present target.  In other words, if the planting of 25,000 acres a year is to be our target, we need at least 75,000 acres in reserve so as to do that job properly and economically, to make the best use of machinery and to provide continuity of employment for the labour force involved.</P>
    <P>Until we build up to that stage, a certain amount of laying off in valley periods is inevitable in this business. However, I do hope that, with the increased interest being shown and the increased cooperation we are getting in this field in connection with the intake of land, we shall soon reach the stage when we shall have the prescribed plantable reserve, and that we shall be able to plan our work more efficiently both from the State's point of view and the point of view of those employed in the industry.  I thank the House for their cooperation in connection with this Estimate.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question which he may not be in a position to answer offhand, but perhaps he would bear it in mind for the main Estimate, in connection with general forest management.  I am told by those who profess to know that if suitable rides are made through the forests you can materially increase their shooting amenities by turning them into valuable woodcock shootings. As the Minister knows the woodcock is a migratory bird; therefore, <Col N="252" /> we cannot control their numbers. They come and they go, but I believe by the provision of rides through the forests designed to promote the habituation of woodcock we would add a valuable amenity to the forest. On the other hand, I fully appreciate the Minister might not want to admit sportsmen into the forests but it is a matter the Minister could have examined as to whether there is an additional potential to be derived from that valuable forest attraction if it proves practicable to promote it.</P>

      <P>I shall certainly bear the Deputy's suggestion in mind.  I have, in one sense, encouraged people to use these forestry lands as reserves. However, in view of the danger of fire and other considerations, the question of letting people in to shoot is one that we would want to consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1960, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 &amp; 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts. 1863 to 1953; No. 45 of 1926; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec. 23); No. 17 of 1951; etc.), of certain other Services administered by that Office, and of the Television Advisory Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government decided that a television service should be established under a single public Authority to be set up to control both sound and television broadcasting, it decided also that the arrangements for the provision of buildings, the supply of equipment for television studios and the transmitter station for the Dublin area, and for the acquisition of sites for transmitters outside Dublin should be put in hand immediately.  This was <Col N="253" /> to ensure that the proposed new Broadcasting Authority would be in a position to begin television broadcasts, and proceed to provide a national system, as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I set up a small Advisory Committee consisting of persons who will later be invited with others to become members of the Broadcasting Authority, to advise and assist me in arranging these matters.  The Committee has been functioning since the 11th September. With its advice and assistance, arrangements are in hand for the provision of the transmitter station and studios in the Dublin area and for the provision of the radio link between them.  The acquisition of sites for four transmitting stations outside Dublin is in train.</P>
    <P>Television, like telephones, telex and radio, is basically a form of telegraphy, and general consideration of any new development in this field falls within the scope of the Telegraph Acts 1863 to 1953.  Doubt is felt, however, whether expenditure in respect of the committee, which is concerned solely with the provision of a television service, comes within the ambit of this year's Vote for Posts and Telegraphs. Accordingly, a Supplementary Estimate is being introduced.  Expenditure incurred so far has been met by an advance by the Minister for Finance from the Contingency Fund which it is intended to repay from the Vote for Posts and Telegraphs.  A gross provision of £1,000 is being made, but as savings of £990 are available on other Subheads of the Vote, only a nett £10 is required.</P>
    <P>The members of the Committee do not receive remuneration for their work but are paid travelling and subsistence expenses.  The provision is mainly to cover such expenses.  In addition, it will cover miscellaneous expenditure on technical advice, on entertainment, etc., arising out of the work of the Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>As the sum asked for is small because of the savings referred to, I do not think it is necessary to dwell too long on this Supplementary Estimate.  However, I should like the Minister to tell us, if he can, how <Col N="254" /> many members are on this Advisory Committee.  I should like to know also how the savings totalling £990 were made.</P>
      <P>In connection with the setting up of these transmitters for the television service, the one at Kippure mountain will be the first to be put into operation. It is stated there will be four others in various parts of the country. I assume it will take a very long time before these transmitters are set up in rural areas and particularly in remote areas in Kerry and Cork.  It will be a source of disappointment to people in remote areas that they will not have the service at the same time as it is being established in the eastern counties and in the city of Dublin. Perhaps it would be well&mdash;I do not know exactly how it would work out &mdash;if the television service did not come into operation until it was possible to extend it throughout the whole country.  There may be reasons why that would not be advisable and I should like the Minister to give his views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one specific point I want to raise on this Estimate. Perhaps I might be permitted to say by way of introduction that I can imagine what would be said in Dáil Eireann if the Minister were in these benches and I presented a Supplementary Estimate for £1,000, one of the items of which was entertainment.  I can imagine the howls from the Fianna Fáil benches about the profligate distribution of public money on unsuitable entertainment.  However, I forbear from the comment because I am sure that any expenditure under that head which is vouched for by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will be properly spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a matter on which I should like a categorical assurance from the Minister.  He says that he has set up a small advisory committee consisting of persons who will later be invited to become members of the broadcasting Authority.  May I take it as certain that the customary rule applies to membership of this broadcasting Authority, that is, that any person who is a member of it can have no business relationships with it?  That rule is <Col N="255" /> well established in the United States of America.  It is fully recognised in respect of all local authorities in this country and, of course, Ministers of State, on taking office, are required to resign any directorships they may have and divorce themselves from business interests.  Any of us in this House who intervene in a debate on a specific matter in which we have a direct business interest are, at least by custom, expected to declare that interest before addressing the House.</P>
    <P>I should like a specific undertaking from the Minister that no member of the advisory committee, or of the broadcasting Authority, will be allowed to have business relationships of any kind with the Authority of which he is a member and that the Minister proposes to provide that if such a relationship is established, that will automatically disqualify that person from continuing to be a member of the Authority.  Any other arrangement, I conceive, would cause a grave scandal and possibly generate abuse.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise a point in connection with the question of savings under other heads, which the Minister has mentioned.  I think we have not got our list of priorities properly sorted out, particularly in connection with the installation of telephonic communication.  It is a well-known fact that it is quite a simple and speedy matter at any time to get a connection between the city of Dublin and any part of Great Britain &mdash;London, Manchester or Glasgow.  It is a different matter altogether for somebody in rural Ireland to get in telephonic communication with a town perhaps 15 or 20 miles away.  I want to know whether there is a hold-up in regard to the expenditure on telephonic equipment.</P>

If instead of savings the Supplementary Estimate were for the purpose of making more money available to ensure that the list of priorities will be properly balanced, the Minister would come in here to extract money from the taxpayer in order to speed up the laying of cables and extra wiring and so on, to close the gap as between the speed of communications in rural Ireland in comparison with the pitch of perfection in the system of communications between Dublin and cross-channel</P>

I think that apart altogether from the question of the desirability of setting up television and the expenses incurred by the body which is making the necessary arrangements it is somewhat peculiar, to say the least of it, that people cannot have telephone communications in areas in rural Ireland, while, at the same time, the Minister is prepared to spend money for the purpose of giving amusement to these people while they are waiting to make telephone calls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief on this matter and the reason I intend to be brief is that I <Col N="257" /> consider that the economies effected in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have not added to the efficiency of the Department.  We noted from the Minister's address in presenting this Supplementary Estimate that he referred to the setting up of a television station and an Authority.  While money is being provided for that purpose, there have been economies in regard to the main workings of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Sheldon) Acting Chairman (Mr. Sheldon)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Sheldon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear to the Deputy that the main activities of the Department are not relevant to the debate, whether there are savings or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I should like to convey this to the Minister, through the Chair, that the moneys provided under this Supplementary Estimate for the setting up of the television station have been the cause of considerable disappointment in my constituency.  I understand that quite a detailed and thorough investigation was carried out in an area known as Croghan Hill in Offaly.  It was genuinely believed, in relation to the selection of the site for a television station, that the district around Croghan Hill contained in its soil a certain electrical mineral which rendered it a most suitable site, if not a far more suitable site than that already selected.  I would ask the Minister to consult with his advisers who have recommended to him the selection of the particular site for the setting up of the television station, and to ask in what circumstances, and why, the site at Croghan Hill, Offaly, was not considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has also made observations with regard to the advisory committee he has appointed.  The duties of that Committee are to advise the Minister on matters relating to the setting up, and the running, of the television station in general.  I wonder is the Minister aware of the fact that it is believed that certain undertakings have been given to Mr. Eamonn Andrews.  I do not use the name of Mr. Andrews in this House with any degree of disrespect, but with the greatest admiration.  I feel that if any <Col N="258" /> undertakings between the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and Mr. Andrews have been given, this House should be made aware of them.  I understand there have been quite a number of long and detailed conferences between the Minister and Mr. Andrews.  That must be expected from one to whom credit must be given of having some experience of television and its management.  Nevertheless, if any guarantee, or promises, or undertakings, have been given to Mr. Andrews, I feel that the House should be made aware of them.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the Minister should be made aware of the fact that there is a considerable amount of gossip, which may be well-founded, in circulation in this city and elsewhere. I do not know what instances Deputy Dillon had in mind when he made his observations this evening, but I would go a step further, and sound a note of warning to the Minister, that if we are to go ahead with the setting up of a television station, an opportunity must be given to members of this House, either on an Estimate such as this which provides money for such works, or on another occasion, to discuss the matter.  I trust that the warning which has already been given by the Leader of the Opposition, with regard to any benefits that may be derived by members of the Committee, or of the Authority to be set up, will be very seriously considered by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to make my position on what I have to say, as clear as possible.  If a large amount of money provided by this House is to be put in the way of relatives of members of the committee, who may be given certain work by way of contract, surely this House should take the necessary steps to ensure that there will not be any collusion or intrigue with regard to the giving of sub-contracts, whether electrical or otherwise, connected with television. It is no harm for me to come bluntly to the point.  There are certain interests with which Mr. Andrews may be indirectly connected in respect of the general promotion and operation of a business, such as the setting up of television.  It is only right, before anything <Col N="259" /> does take place, or before Mr. Andrews has received a permanent appointment, that somebody in this House should sound a note of warning to him and to every other member of the Board, or the Committee already appointed, that if we have any evidence that contracts will be placed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with certain individuals who might have family connections, or be closely connected with the Committee which will advise the Minister on this matter, a very serious view will be taken in this House.  A very close eye is being kept, even at the present time, on the progress and development which is taking place in that regard.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to raise anything in this House that might give rise to suspicion.  I make these observations having in my possession certain information.  I am only waiting until certain contracts are placed in connection with this television station, and if the people about whom I have information secure the contracts, I shall then be in a position to place in the hands of the Minister this information which I now have.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be prepared to take the advice of Mr. Andrews, who has a sound judgment of television, and his colleagues on matters relating to the administration of television and the programmes, but if the advice of those gentlemen is to be taken on the giving of contracts for electrical work or other sub-contracts, and if the contracts are placed within a certain range of family relations, there are members of this House who are prepared to leave nothing undone to ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent wisely and well and with a degree of honesty.  That is the only note of warning I want to sound to the Minister on the Estimate he has presented to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many Deputies who have dealt more ably than I could with this matter on the Bill at present before the House dealing with the setting up <Col N="260" /> of the broadcasting Authority and with which I have not yet finished.  I rose to speak to sound a note of warning to the Minister, and to express the hope that a degree fair play and honesty will be exercised in the giving of contracts, in the placing of sub-contracts, and in whatever work is to be undertaken in connection with the broadcasting Authority to which the Minister referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Palmer asked me how many persons were appointed on this Committee, and I wish to tell him that four people were appointed, with Mr. Eamonn Andrews as Chairman.  The Committee was purely an advisory committee on technical matters in connection with the establishment of a television service. We were very fortunate to obtain the services of Mr. Eamonn Andrews for this assignment.  He is a man of international repute in the television world. He has acquired knowledge in that matter which in itself is a very valuable contribution to the decisions being taken in connection with the establishment here of a television service.</P>
      <P>The savings which make up this Vote are from the general current account of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  They do not apply in any way to the capital account of the Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan dealt with the provision of capital services but it is a separate matter entirely.  Deputy Palmer expected me to itemise the savings.  I regret it would not be possible at such short notice to do so.</P>
      <P>In so far as this Estimate provides for entertainment, I wish to inform the House that it provides for an item of entertainment already paid for which amounted to £8 13s.  It was to give entertainment to a technical adviser who came into this country, on invitation by me, free, gratis and for nothing, without any payment for his services, in connection with the drawings and the provision of the studio building on the Montrose site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the site at Croghan Hill is concerned, mentioned by Deputy O. <Col N="261" /> J. Flanagan, it is news to me that at any time Croghan Hill was considered as a site for good transmission.  It is the first I heard of it.</P>
    <P>A survey was made in 1956-57 by Radio Éireann or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in connection with the establishment or proposed establishment of V.H.F. transmission for the sound broadcasting service. The members of that survey committee, the people concerned, selected certain sites for that purpose.  Incidentally, they happen to be the sites recommended to me as the sites suitable for television broadcasts.</P>

      <P>I have to rely entirely on the technical advice given to me. The sites are already selected.  They are the sites from which I am advised the best possible service can be provided for the whole country.</P>
      <P>In so far as the membership of the Committee is concerned&mdash;their relationship with outside businesses or firms which are likely to have contracts with the Authority itself&mdash;that matter is provided for in Section 8 of the Bill. When we come to discuss Section 8 of the Bill on Committee Stage, we can have a full debate on that matter. I do not think it would be in order, even if I so desired, to deal fully with that section on this Estimate.  I should prefer to leave it over, if that will suit the Leader of the Opposition, until we discuss the matter on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon knows as well as I do what Section 8 is and what it provides for.  I feel it takes adequate measures to deal with a situation such as he has in mind.  Before the members of the Authority are appointed, I feel certain the Government will go fully into their standing in relation to any outside commitments they may have with firms in ordinary business. I feel certain they will have to satisfy themselves that each member measures up to the requirements for membership of such an Authority.</P>

      <P>This Vote on Account is in respect of the Estimates for the year ending 31st March, 1961. The Minister, in the Book of Estimates which he has published, has produced what I think is an all-time high record for this country.  These Estimates are produced by a Government formed from a Party who, during their years in Opposition, campaigned against the height of Government expenditure.  They are produced by a Government formed by a Party who put themselves on record as taking what I understood to be an irrevocable decision in 1953 that taxation in this country was too high and that taxation could not go any higher; that the danger point had been reached and that the limit of endurance of the people had been reached.</P>
      <P>Now, after three years in office since the last general election, the Minister for Finance comes with a Book of Estimates higher than was ever produced in this country&mdash;higher even than the Minister's Party were capable of producing before.  When the Taoiseach was speaking as an Opposition Deputy in 1956 on the Financial Statement, he gave the House the benefit of his views.  He recorded the decision which he said he and his colleagues had taken regarding Government expenditure and high taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the fact that the Minister had introduced an all-time record as far as the Estimates are concerned, that he is doing that as a colleague of the present Taoiseach who on the 8th of May, 1956, speaking in this House announced the decision of the Fianna Fáil Party regarding taxation and the fact that, in their view, taxation had reached the danger limit.  I am quoting from the Dáil debates of the 8th May, 1956, Column 49, in which the present Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, is reported as having said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> In 1953, the Fianna Fáil Government, of which I was a member, took a decision that taxation in this country had reached the danger limit.  We announced that we had made up our minds on that fact and that, so far as we were concerned, there would be no increase in tax rates above the 1953 level.  We made it clear that, if any Budget difficulty arose, that difficulty would be met by a reduction of expenditure and not by increasing the burden on the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>On the same day, as reported at Column 68, the present Minister for Health, then Deputy MacEntee, speaking from these Benches, said:</P>
    <P>That is what the working class people in our rural areas are paying for the fact that the Government has not tackled what is the basic difficulty in all this matter, the phenomenon of rising Government expenditure.  Until we can manage to curb and curtail that, there will be no relief for any taxpayer in this country and the burdens upon the workers, upon the poorer sections of this community, are going to be increased.  That is what is at stake here in this Resolution.</P>
    <P>Just four years after the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health expressed those sentiments from these Benches, and after a general election which took place less than a year later and returned them to office, we find the Minister for Finance presenting this House with a Book of Estimates for very nearly £30 million more than the Book of Estimates for the year 1952-53.  I do not pretend to know what plans the Minister has in store, so far as taxation is concerned, arising from the Estimates which he is presenting to us, but certainly I should be very pleasantly surprised if any of the Deputies opposite could convince me that in a Book of Estimates totalling something over £123 million there will be any relief for the taxpayer such as was spoken about by the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach when they spoke here on the 8th May, 1956.</P>
    <P>What effort has this Government made towards reducing Government <Col N="265" /> expenditure?  What effort has been made by the Minister for Finance or any of his colleagues?  Deputy O'Malley, when speaking here a short while ago, said that the increases in the Book of Estimates were due mainly to increases in wages and salaries.  He inquired if Deputies on this side of the House were opposed to that.  He asked if we did not criticise that, where did our criticism lie?</P>
    <P>Assuming Deputy O'Malley is right in regard to this colossal Book of Estimates produced by the Minister and that the increases are attributable mainly to increases in wages and salaries, is it not pertinent to inquire how did those increases in wages and salaries come about?  How were they occasioned?  The trade unions, and those whom they represent here have not, I think, by and large over the years, proved themselves unwilling to meet, discuss and co-operate with employers' representatives on matters of wages and working conditions. Certainly, more than once they have shown very commendable restraint in face of what must have seemed to them to be provocation at the hands of Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>If it was necessary to increase wages and salaries, how did that necessity come about?  Surely, it was because of the deliberate action of the present Fianna Fáil Government, or Party in any event, in pushing up the cost of living by deliberate positive Government action, increasing the cost of living and making it necessary to give wage increases?  Was that the Fianna Fáil Party's contribution to curbing Government expenditure?  Was that their contribution to avoiding increased taxation?  The present Fianna Fáil Party, since they formed a Government in 1957, have not once but twice deliberately by their Budgetary and their financial policy implemented through this House, increased the cost of living and necessitated any wage increases there were.</P>
    <P>When this Government were last in Opposition, occupying those Benches, the Estimates for the year 1956-57 totalled something more than £109 <Col N="266" /> million.  The following year, 1957-58, they were up to £112½ million approximately. There was a slight reduction in 1958-59 to £110 million.  Of course, there have been Supplementary Estimates since that.  Now we are faced with a Book of Estimates amounting to practically £123½ million.</P>
    <P>In the face of that situation, I was amazed to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance use so little time and a great deal of energy in exuding confidence and Government complacency with regard to the position in this country, and exulting in the pride which he and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party thought they were entitled to take in the housing figures for the past year in dealing with the question of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I have not seen the Parliamentary Secretary's speech in the Dáil Debates yet because it has not been published yet but, according to the notes which I took, he said that his Party were rightly proud of housing figures for the past year.  He went on to say that local authority housing is tapering off and that the emphasis is now on private housing.  I want to examine whether or not the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues can be rightly proud of the housing figures for the past twelve months and of their record in housing since they took office.</P>
    <P>If members of the Government and Deputies behind them feel inclined to stick out their chests about housing, I would advise them to be very careful that they are not sticking out their chins as well.  I remember during the period of office of the last Government the hullabaloo set up on this side of the House on the question of housing, how the then Government were charged with falling down on the job, how we were told that the whole building industry was in a state of chaos caused by the ineptitude of that Government. All of us can remember the propaganda disseminated by Fianna Fáil spokesmen both inside and outside the House at the time of the general election and leading up to it, on the question of housing.  We remember the charges levelled against the inter-Party <Col N="267" /> Government.  It is in the context of that campaign that I think it is right to examine now, as best we can, the Fianna Fáil record since they took office.</P>
    <P>I want to support what I am saying regarding that Fianna Fáil campaign by a few references.  I am sure Deputies opposite are sick and tired of some of these references and I hope that before this Dáil has run its course not only will they be sick and tired but also heartily ashamed of some of the propaganda that came out in their interests and over the names of some of them prior to the last general election, during it, and even since then.</P>
    <P>The first quotation I want to make is from propaganda produced on behalf of Deputy Galvin when he was contesting a by-election in Cork City. In this Fianna Fáil pamphlet produced in his support it is proclaimed that private house-building was almost at a standstill.  The Fianna Fáil Party in their efforts to get Deputy Galvin into the Dáil told the people: &ldquo;Private house-building in Cork City and suburbs has almost come to a standstill. Hundreds of people, young married couples especially, who had hoped to build their own homes are being forced to abandon their plans as a result of the breakdown of the Small Dwellings Loans.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil succeeded in putting Deputy Galvin into the House.  Before the Dáil ends, I hope we may hear Deputy Galvin's vindication of the propaganda used on his behalf.  It did not rest there.  A pamphlet was produced for the Fianna Fáil Party as a whole, on behalf of all the Deputies in the Party, including the Minister for Finance, Deputy Corry and Deputy Gogan on the occasion of the last general election.  It had a photo of the former Taoiseach, now Uachtarán na Éireann.  The big, black, bold heading was: &ldquo;Let us go ahead again&mdash;vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  One of the articles in it is headed &ldquo;Homes for Irishmen.&rdquo;  It says: &ldquo;One of the most serious problems facing the new Fianna Fáil Government will be the question of the building industry which <Col N="268" /> has been thrown into a state of chaos. Private house-building is almost at a standstill; the loan system has broken down while local authority operations have been greatly curtailed.  Many thousands of building workers have lost their jobs.&rdquo;  Then it goes on: &ldquo;It will be a first task of Fianna Fáil to see that life and vigour are restored to the building trade so that Small Dwellings Loans once again become available for house purchase.&rdquo;  That was a document produced, I think, in every constituency to assist in putting Fianna Fáil back as a Government.</P>
    <P>Shortly after they had got back, there was a by-election in one of the North-side constituencies in Dublin which ultimately returned Deputy Sherwin to the Dáil.  Fianna Fáil produced their usual type of election pamphlet.  I do not know where it was printed; they are all the same type of thing but, if they are dreary in the monotony with which they come out, they are brightened by some of the articles which appear in them and some of the promises held out.</P>
    <P>In support of the Fianna Fáil candidate in Dublin North Central by-election in November, 1957, Fianna Fáil had this to say regarding housing. The heading was: &ldquo;We are going ahead with housing.&rdquo;  The article goes on: &ldquo;During the last year of the Coalition Government there was an almost complete close-down of housing. Not merely was there a serious slowing of house construction but many schemes due to begin last year or early this year were held up.  In Dublin City the number of dwellings in tender on April 1st was only 222 compared with 815 last year.  Private house building was in no better position due to the collapse of the Small Dwellings Loans scheme.  During 1956 the number of grant houses under construction fell by almost 1,000. Action has now been taken to deal with this position.&rdquo;  I want to remind the House again that notwithstanding the complaints made in those Fianna Fáil pamphlets regarding both private building and local authority building &mdash;which is referred to in the last quotation I read&mdash;Deputy Brennan, the <Col N="269" /> Parliamentary Secretary, now assures the House that local authority housing is tapering off and that the emphasis is now to be placed on private housing.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the record of the present Government since they got back to office early in 1957 and examine this record within the framework set by the Fianna Fáil Party themselves in the propaganda to which I have referred. If we consult the statistical abstract published by the Central Statistics Office for the year 1959, on page 190 certain figures are given with regard to new houses and houses reconstructed for each of the years from 1952 to 1959.</P>
    <P>Starting in the year 1956&mdash;that, mark you, is the year which according to Fianna Fáil, according to their speeches, propaganda and all the hullabaloo they were kicking up from this side of the House, was the black year as far as the building industry and employment were concerned and was the main cause for Fianna Fáil's success in defeating the last Government in the last general election&mdash; according to the Statistical Abstract there were 9,837 new houses built in the year 1956 and 6,494 houses were reconstructed during the year 1956. According to the Statistical Abstract the number of new houses in the year 1959 was 4,893 and the number of houses reconstructed was 6,909.  So that, after three years of Fianna Fáil Government, when they were telling the people that if they were elected work was to start at once, we find that, as between the years 1956 and 1959, there is a decrease of 4,944 in the number of new houses erected and as between 1958 and 1959 there is a decrease of 253 in the number of houses reconstructed.</P>
    <P>If we turn to the local authority housing for the same years, there were 4,011 local authority houses erected in the year 1956 and the last year given in the Abstract&mdash;it does not go to 1959; it goes to 1958&mdash;shows that, as between 1956 and 1958, when Fianna Fáil had been in office for something over 12 months, there was a decrease to 3,467 in the number of houses erected for local authorities in 1958.  This is the record which the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="270" /> to the Minister for Finance feels entitles him to say that the Government and the Party of which he is a member are really proud of the housing figures.</P>
    <P>I examined these statistics in more detail, having regard to the Fianna Fáil campaign against the previous Government and the fact that Fianna Fáil Deputies now feel entitled to stick out their chests in pride at their record in house building.  I think some other interesting figures are worth recording. In the Statistical Abstract new house building by private persons and public utility societies is shown for a number of years.  Remember the Parliamentary Secretary claimed that the necessity for local authority houses was now tapering off and that the emphasis must be put on private houses.  Let us see what has been happening as far as private housing is concerned over the last few years.  Let us look at this record about which the Government apparently feel they are entitled to stick out their chests.</P>
    <P>I should say that these figures are to the 31st of March in each year. To the 31st March 1957&mdash;and remember these figures would apply to the period in office of the previous Government because the Fianna Fáil Government took office only as a result of a general election held in March, 1957&mdash;the number of new houses built by private persons and public utility societies in rural areas was 4,066 and the number built in urban areas 1,495.  After Fianna Fáil had been there for a couple of years, taking the twelve months to the 31st March, 1959, we find that the number of new houses built by private persons and public utility societies in rural areas was 1,651&mdash;in other words, a decrease of 2,415 as against the year ending on the 31st March 1957. Taking the same two years again, the 31st March, 1957, as against 31st March, 1959, on the 31st March, 1957 the number of new local authority houses built in rural areas amounted to 1,617 and the number of new local authority houses built in urban areas amounted to 3,167.  Two years afterwards how does Fianna Fáil's record in the field of local authority housing compare when measured against those <Col N="271" /> figures?  To the 31st March, 1959, the number of new houses built by local authorities in rural areas under the Fianna Fáil Government amounted to 648 as against 1,617 to the 31st March, 1957.  The number of local authority houses built in urban areas for the year to the 31st March, 1959, was 1,164 or more than 2,000 fewer than the number built for the twelve months ending on the 31st March, 1957.</P>
    <P>I wonder if in face of those figures the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance still feels he is entitled to come into the House and say he is rightly proud of the housing figures for the past year?  If he is rightly proud of them and if he feels he can stick out his chest, I wonder does his Minister agree with him? Does any Deputy representing the city of Dublin agree with him?  That is the Fianna Fáil record so far as housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>Only last week or the week before we had a discussion here regarding the state of affairs existing so far as housing grants are concerned.  Every Deputy knows that a situation had arisen in the Custom House where houses were passed for grants and listed for payment but the grants could not issue because the money was not there to pay them and it was necessary for the Minister for Local Government to come into the House and get a Supplementary Estimate passed in order to enable the payments to be made.  There were a number of private citizens and house builders who were gravely embarrassed and financially embarrassed because the present Government had allowed that situation to develop and exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish, I think it was, when speaking here yesterday referred to a question he had asked regarding the numbers employed in local authority building for the past five or six years. If any Deputy in the benches opposite doubts the figures I have given with regard to the number of houses built by Fianna Fáil as against the number of houses built before they took office, they can check and counter check those figures by reference to the <Col N="272" /> numbers employed in the building of local authority houses for the past few years.</P>
    <P>The note I have of the figures given to Deputy Corish in reply to his question showed that the number employed in local authority building to 31st January, 1956, was 6,147; to 31st January, 1957, 4,580; for the year to 31st January, 1958, it dropped to 2,604; there was a further slight drop to 31st January, 1959, when it was 2,583 and another drop to 31st January this year, when the total was 1,781.  In other words, on 31st January of the present year, there were practically 3,000 fewer persons employed in local authority building than in the year to 31st January, 1957, the last year for which the previous Government were responsible.  That is the record of this Government and of the Party opposite, so far as housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would advise the members of the Party opposite, particularly their Ministers and junior Ministers, to show less confidence and less complacency when dealing with this question of housing.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance must feel he has a lot of facetious Deputies behind him because one of the questions which he posed for the consideration of the members of this Assembly was whether or not any serious Deputy contended that unemployment could be ended in a short time?  I want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary, and every other Deputy opposite, that that is precisely what the members of the Government Party contended before and during the last general election, and it was because they contended that, and because they persuaded the voters that they were right in their contention, that they now form the Government.</P>
    <P>If any Deputy opposite does not believe what I am saying, I would refer him to the Fianna Fáil pamphlet which was produced during the last general election to persuade the people to give their votes to Fianna Fáil and to entrust the Fianna Fáil Party with the government of this country.  The Parliamentary Secretary now asks if any serious Deputy can contend that unemployment <Col N="273" /> can be ended in a short time. This Fianna Fáil pamphlet has a big black heading on page 3, &ldquo;Action Can Start Now&rdquo;, and the article starts this way:</P>
    <P>Over 90,000 people are now out of work.  The Coalition say they can do nothing for them now.  Fianna Fáil believes that work must be provided at once...</P>
    <P>and the words &ldquo;at once&rdquo; are in italics.  Surely that was contending exactly what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance now says cannot be contended by any Deputy who approaches this problem seriously?  Every member of the Fianna Fáil Party occupying a seat in Dáil Éireann is there partly because of his success, or the success of his Party, in persuading the voters that Fianna Fáil could do something immediately in regard to putting people back into employment.  I do not think it necessary for me to labour at any great length the fact that that was the Fianna Fáil effort and their campaign during the general election.</P>
    <P>We have already had&mdash;not in this debate but in other debates&mdash;some quotations from speeches of the Taoiseach during the course of the general election campaign, and every one of us remembers the posters with which the Fianna Fáil Party candidates placarded every wall up and down the country, the notorious posters addressed to the housewives of this country: &ldquo;Wives Get Your Husbands Off To Work&mdash;Vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  We remember the theme of the propaganda that unemployment was the test of Government policy and that no Government policy was good enough which allowed any people to remain out of work or in idleness.  What is the record of the Government since taking office in March, 1957?</P>
    <P>At the end of last year, just before Christmas, we had an opportunity of discussing that record in this House on the occasion of the Adjournment Motion.  I want to go back on that because I have not heard any explanation, which is satisfactory to me in any event, of the figures given by the Taoiseach in reply to a question put by Deputy T. Lynch on 11th November, <Col N="274" /> 1959.  I propose examining those figures again and asking the Minister for Finance to say, when replying to this debate, if he can give any better explanation for them than that which was attempted by the Taoiseach and some other Fianna Fáil speakers when they immediately sounded the retreat after the figures had been published and appeared in the Official Report. All of us recall how, as soon as the seriousness of the position as disclosed by the reply given to that question was apparent, the bugle sounded immediately and the Government went into a huddle to try to give this House some explanation which would prove that the position was other than as disclosed in the reply to that question.</P>
    <P>According to the figures given by the Taoiseach on 11th November last, there were approximately 41,000 people fewer in employment in the year ended 31st March, 1959, than there were in the year ended 31st March, 1956, based on the estimate of the number of persons in insurable employment.  That was after two or 2¼ years of Fianna Fáil Government.  They had succeeded in driving 41,000 people out of employment, 41,000 people who were in jobs, who were earning their living in this country at the time Fianna Fáil were sticking up their posters &ldquo;Wives Get Your Husbands Off To Work.&rdquo;  At the time Fianna Fáil speakers were campaigning through the country, promising action at once as far as the unemployed were concerned, there were 41,000 people earning their living in jobs and those people, two or 2¼ years later, under a Fianna Fáil Government, found themselves out of jobs and, presumably, either having to sign on at the labour exchange or emigrate and look for work elsewhere. Those are not figures that are manufactured by anyone on this side of the House.  They are figures issued by the Taoiseach's Department in reply to a Parliamentary Question.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have failed dismally on the housing programme.  They have a dreary, dismal record.  It is one of God's mercies to them that the Deputies now in Opposition did not take advantage of that position as <Col N="275" /> Fianna Fáil Deputies did when they were on this side of the House and it is another of God's mercies to the Fianna Fáil Party that the Government's political opponents do not control a powerful string of newspapers to give publicity to the position existing over the past few years, as far as housing is concerned, because if there were publicity or even half the magnitude of that given by the Fianna Fáil string of Party newspapers in 1956, the Government would not have lasted for six months.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have failed in housing. They have failed in dealing with the unemployment situation.  I do not think it necessary to dwell at any length on the question of emigration. I do not believe that even Fianna Fáil Deputies, even if they tried to whistle up the same type of confidence as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance endeavoured to whistle up when speaking in this debate, are foolish enough to feel complacent as regards emigration. There may or may not be a slight improvement in the emigration figures, but, whether there is an improvement or not, every Deputy, no matter which side of the House he occupies, will concede that emigration is running and continuing to run at too high a figure and there is nothing the Fianna Fáil Government have done since they came back to office that has alleviated that position.</P>
    <P>I shall not rub their noses in quotations any further.  I invite them to look back over the propaganda which they issued during the last general election and they will find that they dealt with the question of emigration in exactly the same way as they dealt with the question of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is one other topic I want to refer to, that is, the cost of living. Before Fianna Fáil succeeded in getting themselves elected Government at the last general election, the Government immediately preceding them had faced an extremely difficult year. It had faced a year in which a balance of payments problem arose and had to be dealt with.  As a result of the political and moral courage of the members of that Government in dealing <Col N="276" /> with that problem, they incurred, and knew they would incur, a certain amount of political unpopularity, but I think it is true, and I think it will be conceded even by their political opponents, that one thing which ran through every action of the previous Government, one motive which was there all the time, was to try to minimise the effect on the weaker sections of the community of any of the actions which it was necessary to take, and right throughout the period of office of that Government, and indeed of the previous inter-Party Government, all the time they were in office, they did whatever they could by Governmental action to cushion the weaker sections of the community against anything in the nature of increases in the cost of living or anything which might affect their standard of living.</P>
    <P>When the previous Government were in office, one of the matters in respect of which the Fianna Fáil Party campaigned against them was the question of the levies which were introduced and, generally, the question of the cost of living.  We now have it on record from the Taoiseach that the action which the inter-Party Government took, in face of the balance of payments problem, was an action which remedied the situation.  Speaking in this House on 14th May, 1957, the Taoiseach, who was then Tánaiste, dealing with the action taken by his predecessors in office in connection with the balance of payments problem said, at column 1151:</P>
    <P>I did not think they were dealing with it the right way but we certainly recognised their obligation to do something about it and as a result of the measures they took that balance of payments problem was solved for the time being.</P>
    <P>So that, at last, we have it on record now from the head of the Government that when he and his colleagues took office, the danger and the problem which had arisen regarding the balance of payments was solved and that it was solved by the action of his predecessors.</P>
    <P>Since the Fianna Fáil Party came back to office, I do not think they <Col N="277" /> can afford to be complacent with regard to trade figures to-day, with regard to the question of the balance of payments.  In any event, the point I want to make is that whatever problems existed in that respect before they came into office were solved by the methods taken by their predecessors and yet, when Fianna Fáil came back to office, despite what I believe were at least implicit commitments to the electorate not to increase food prices or not to increase the cost of living, the Fianna Fáil Party, in their very first Budget, increased the cost of living by deliberately removing food subsidies and shoving up food prices.</P>
    <P>I tabled a Parliamentary Question on 9th December last, in which I asked the Taoiseach to state the commodities included in the calculation of the cost-of-living index figure which have increased in price since March, 1957, and the price of such commodities on 1st March, 1957, and the latest convenient date, and the percentage increase in each case.  I got a reply from the Taoiseach's Department in which 197 items were listed, items which were included in the calculation of the cost-of-living index figure and, since March, 1957, since the Fianna Fáil Government took office, 149 out of those 197 items had increased in price.  There were decreases in 42 of the 197 items and there were six where the prices were unchanged.  That is the Fianna Fáil record so far as the cost of living is concerned and so far as prices are concerned.  I do not believe that any member of the Fianna Fáil Party, indeed any member of this House, can feel in any way complacent with regard to the Government's record.  They have now well passed the half-way mark of the lifetime of this Dáil.  Unless they are able to render a very much better account of their stewardship, whenever the next general election takes place, than they can now after three years in office, I have no doubt at all that they will get an opportunity from the people of resting from their political activities for some time. would consider it cheap and false if <Col N="278" /> The Government will shortly be introducing their Budget and presumably on that occasion they will lay down the pattern of their financial policy for the next 12 months.  I should like to express the hope, although I believe it is a forlorn one having regard to the record size of the Estimates introduced by the Minister, that some consideration will be given to the taxpayers.  I do not want to go into that subject now but I do feel that practically every section of the community has been harshly treated by the operation of the policies of the Government.  The people have been badly let down by the Government in their last three years in office.  Without wishing for the success of the Fianna Fáil Party at the next or future elections, for the sake of the people I hope Fianna Fáil will now pull up their socks, take off their coats and, for the remainder of the lifetime of this Dáil, &ldquo;get cracking.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take the line pursued by some previous speakers, on the one hand deploring the increase in the amount of the Estimates and, on the other hand, regretting that bigger allowances are not given for certain services.  I have always held that if services are to be provided and improved services demanded, whether at national or local authority level, these can only be given at an increased cost and that that would be reflected either at local authority level in increased rates or at national level in increased taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no quarrel with the fact that the Estimates produced each year over the past number of years show an ever-increasing figure, because I am aware that the people have kept up a steady clamour through their representatives in this House for an ever-increasing standard of benefits.  I am one who is unrepentant in the belief that the people have not, as yet, reached the pinnacle of the benefits they need, particularly those in the social welfare group.  Because other members of my Party and I will be asking the Minister for Finance to remember that and to alter that position by increasing the benefits, I <Col N="279" /> we made any complaint about the increase in the amount of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>If I had any quarrel it would be rather by way of pointing out, if I could, where the amount of money spent was not being used to the best advantage; or, if I could, pointing out where savings could be made which would in no way interfere with the services given.  I consider that the most important service a Government can give a country is the promotion of the employment of the people.  To that end the spending of any money, however great, is, in my opinion, justified. It is justified because a country with full employment has a happy and contented people who carry out their function in life by earning their living and rearing their families secure in the knowledge that they will be able to provide for them.</P>
    <P>Money spent in the promotion of industry or, in other words, in the giving of employment in any sphere, will be repaid not only by the contentment and happiness given to the people but in actual cash by savings under the heading of social welfare benefits which will not be required, such as unemployment and various other benefits which have to be given to them to enable them to exist during periods of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have adopted that as a policy.  If we are to accept their <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> I would call it an avowal of a policy of the pumping into industry, be it agricultural or other industry, of the money necessary to create more employment.  I agree with that policy and in so far as the Fianna Fáil Government will attempt to carry out that programme they will receive no criticism from me or from any other member of my Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, speaking here last evening, gave some facts and figures in relation to employment content over the years 1957, 1958 and 1959.  The test of whether the Fianna Fáil policy of economic expansion has been successful during the past year can be measured by the increased employment resulting therefrom. <Col N="280" /> Deputy Sweetman, being a member of the Front Bench Opposition, would naturally paint a picture which would not show the Government in the best light possible, to say the least of it. Notwithstanding the fact that he was speaking as a member of the Opposition, there is no gainsaying the figures he produced from statistics obtained from Government sources in reply to Parliamentary Questions.  It must be clear, having made due allowance for the colouring which perhaps Deputy Sweetman or any of us on the Opposition side might give to a speech, that no matter how you examine the figures, you cannot show any progress along the road of increased employment.</P>
    <P>Even today from the trade returns published in the daily newspapers, and measured by that standard, we find that the year 1959 ended up with £1,500,000 less exported than in the previous year.  Let me hasten to add that it was heartening to see the much greater volume of industrial goods which were exported this year as compared with last year, which almost offset the falling off in the export of livestock.  In as far as that is a proof of industrial expansion, I and other members of my Party welcome it.</P>
    <P>It is true that there is another side to the picture.  Our imports were of such a magnitude as to give one reason to think that perhaps some of our exports were but re-exports of industrial products which came in here and were re-exported after assembly and which have but a very small employment content.  I do not need to produce any sets of figures from the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> to prove that there is unemployment.  Anyone who stands in any railway station, or in any bus depot in any town, village or city in Ireland, can have all the necessary evidence of boys and girls, young men and young women, leaving the country to seek the employment which is not available here for them.</P>
    <P>I am quite well aware that members on the other side of the House will remind me of the figures in the live register.  I am quite well aware of them.  I know that if these are compared with last year's and with the <Col N="281" /> previous year's and still more, compared with the figures of the year previous to that, they will show a steady decline.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that increased employment is not the reason for that decline. Rather is it that the people have given up all hope of securing employment in this country and have emigrated and the vast majority of them are taking up permanent residence in Britain.</P>
    <P>Within the past year, at least in the area which I live, it has become a common sight, to see not the father or the son or the daughter emigrating to secure employment to feed their dependents at home, but to see the entire family, father, mother and children, selling their furniture, giving up their home to take up employment, mainly in Great Britain.  That is a deplorable position and it is against that background that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was reported in the national papers a few weeks ago as saying that the young people &ldquo;never had it so good&rdquo;.  Outside of the fact that the expression &ldquo;never had it so good&rdquo; is but a parrot catch cry and a repetition of the Conservative slogan in Britain during the last election, one would think that the man with the main responsibility for the promotion of industry would bow his head in shame at a time when two out of every three young people born into any family in this country have to emigrate, rather than use the expression &ldquo;the young people never had it so good&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know what his contrast is but I suggest that the only improvement that can be claimed for the young people is an improvement in contrast to conditions at the time of the Famine.  Surely there is no great glory in saying that related to the time of the Famine, things are much better.  There is a barometer used by trade unionists to test the trend of employment.  Trade unionists have noticed from experience that if things are improving, if money is plentiful, the building trade group will be kept busily engaged.  On the other hand, when a depression is setting in or when times are bad, those engaged in the building industry are unemployed.  If we are to test the prosperity <Col N="282" /> or the depression of this country by that barometer, I am afraid the figures are against anyone claiming credit for what is happening.</P>
    <P>Information, in the form of a tabular statement, was given in reply to a Dáil question tabled by Deputy Corish yesterday.  The figures show the number of men employed on local authority housing schemes.  The date is 31st January in each case: 1956, 6,147; 1957, 4,580; 1958, 2,604; 1959, 2,583; and at 31st January, this year, 1,781.  If a barometer reading of a reduction from 6,000 to 1,500, approximately, is to be taken as an indication of the condition the country is in, then we may expect, and know, that we are in for a very bad time.</P>
    <P>I am aware that could be answered by such statements as: &ldquo;The needs of the working classes have now been almost met&rdquo;, &ldquo;Local authority house building is falling off&rdquo;, but Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, a few moments ago, gave the complete answer to that suggestion.  He proved conclusively, with official figures, that not only in local authority housing, but also in private building under the S.D.A. or any other scheme, the employment content is gradually growing smaller. How then are we to face the years to come with complacency?</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that, while I am in no way against the progressive use of machinery, it has been made abundantly clear to those of us in the Labour Party who are members of local authorities, that the excessive use of unnecessary machinery on road work has had a deplorable effect on the employment content of the money used for road repairs.  I know it is generally pointed out that if we watch Great Britain and America, our old-fashioned manual methods can be put to shame by the advanced techniques and machinery used in those highly-advanced countries.  I would remind Deputies that in Great Britain and, to a certain extent, in America, the shortage is a shortage of man-power.  They have more jobs to give than people to fill them.  In Ireland, unfortunately, the reverse is true, and what we have in most plentiful supply are unemployed <Col N="283" /> men and women seeking employment. If, in America and Great Britain, man-power is diverted from manual employment where machinery can do the work, a certain number of those who are diverted will be taken up in producing the machines which replace them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that is not true of this country where heavy industries are practically non-existent.  From the economic point of view, it has been made clear in most estimates of local authorities which I have read, that there is no actual saving in cost per mile of road surface where the work is carried out with the most up-to-date machinery, as compared with manual work carried out a number of years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir, but I suggest that what I am trying to show to the House with regard to this talk of efficiency and improved methods, is the fact that while that might be an excellent thing for a country with a shortage of man-power, it could be a dreadful thing for a country like this where there is insufficient employment.  I shall pass on and leave it at that, in deference to your ruling, Sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last evening, Deputy Corish drew attention to the fact that it was always the manual worker who was expected to make the increased effort to produce more, so that we can all live in comfort.  Productivity has been screamed at us from Press and radio for the past two years, in fact, practically ever since the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was produced. We have had Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, company directors, professors, and managers of businesses, giving their comments, and their recommendations to the workers to produce more.  We have had learned professors, Senators from the other House, in a certain Sunday newspaper, indicating to the working people what they should do.  I would recommend to Deputies a statement of the <Col N="284" /> workers' side which appeared in an open letter in the <i>Sunday Press,</i> last Sunday week, from the President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  In that letter, he replied to a good deal of the criticism and the suggestions about how increased productivity could be achieved.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat something I said here this time two years ago.  If there is, and I believe there is, such a call for increased productivity, it is the duty of the Government to set up some form of legislative body that will ensure to the workers the right to meet the employers at some level, so that they may have some say in how the savings or the increased profits accruing from their increased productivity will be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>By good management, certainly, but unfortunately, where there is not good management in factories, it is not done.  I suggest that is in the national interest and that the Government would be doing a good day's work if, on the same basis as they formed savings committees and safety committees, jointly, between management and workers, they set up a committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a bonus system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of the incentive bonus scheme but that is a different thing altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reward for extra production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>If a worker receives an incentive bonus and goes on to earn more wages, it would appear to be a good thing for him and for the country.  But if, because of his increased activities and earning of more wages, at the end of a period the costings of the article he manufactures were not reduced, there would be a danger that he would work himself <Col N="285" /> out of a job whereas, if the savings and profits earned by increased productivity were to reduce the costings of the article manufactured and that in turn could be exported in a more plentiful supply, it would be a continuous improvement in the manufacture of the articles and in their sale abroad.</P>
      <P>If workers could be sure that some portion of the increased effort produced by them was diverted to reducing costs so that more employment would be created they would enter into it with a much greater effort and a much greater amount of confidence. Unfortunately, the effort thrown in by the workers has in the past, in many cases, been used either to swell directors' profits or fees or been used in the form of share bonuses for shareholders.</P>
      <P>It is true that the trade unions have taken good care to see that their workers secure a proportionate increase of the effort they give; I suggest that, with the knowledge that this would be used, not for personal gain on either side, but for a greater national effort in output that would secure a continuity of employment, we would have much greater co-operation from the workers' side.</P>
      <P>If the trade unions demand increased pay for increased work I suggest that that, of itself, is not a bad thing.  If anything, I believe this country is suffering from the fact that the wage structure of the ordinary working people is in a deplorable state.  We are told, and I expect it is correct, that agriculture is our main industry.  We are pumping into that main industry about £12 million a year in the form of grants.  If we are to believe the Agricultural Wages Board, the total amount of wages that can be paid by this, our major industry, is £5-5s per week for a fully trained adult worker.  I have no particular knowledge of agriculture but if that is correct, then unfortunately we are leaning on a very broken reed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry that can give only that starvation wage does not deserve to exist.  It is true that many farmers claim that they exist at an even lower level than that of their paid help.  If <Col N="286" /> that claim is true&mdash;I have no means of disproving it&mdash;then agriculture in this country must be in a pitiable condition.  If wages were stepped up, the products for which the farmers now claim they cannot get a decent price&mdash;products which they claim would remain unsold if they increased their production&mdash;would, in turn, be consumed by the urban workers.  It is regrettable on the one hand that our agricultural community are claiming they have an abundance of products for which there is no sale while we know that in the City of Dublin and in many cities and towns throughout Ireland there are people hungry because they have not sufficient money to buy the produce they so badly need.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point on which I should like to touch before concluding&mdash;the question of the tourist industry in this country.  While welcoming every effort by this or any other Government or anybody in this country to attract people from outside our shores to spend their holidays here, I believe we are geared to too rich a type of visitor for this type of country. Luxurious hotels at costly charges will not be attractive to the ordinary British workman.  I believe that the ordinary worker in Great Britain, his wife and his family, are the source most likely to supply us with our tourists.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that rich American families on the grand tour of Europe may call in for a short period to see the Lakes of Killarney or to visit some other beauty spot in this country.  It is more particularly true that people with Irish blood in their veins may call at some period to trace their ancestry. However, on the whole, the tourist trade in this country must depend on the neighbouring island and on the ordinary men and women there.</P>
    <P>I could not be loud enough in my praise for those organisations, be they Bord Fáilte or local development groups, which are promoting the fishing competitions and fishing contests that have been so successful in many parts of the country.  I suggest that the hundreds of thousands of our Irish exiles in Great Britain should be supplied, through local development <Col N="287" /> organisations in each town and area, with free literature, be they leaflets, photographs or brochures of any kind, that they could distribute in Great Britain.  I think that not half enough effort is spent on bringing home to the ordinary men and women not so much the attractions of Ireland as the cheapness of the accommodation and the goodness of our food.  I believe that an ordinary worker, having completed fifty weeks of employment, is more attracted to a relaxing and carefree holiday at cheap cost in a country that will be a change from his own than&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. MacCarthy) Acting Chairman (Mr. MacCarthy)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. MacCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be more appropriate on the main Estimate on Tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  It is pretty difficult to make one's point without going into some detail.  I believe that one of the main factors in encouraging tourism in this country will be the improvement of the method of transport of our visitors from Great Britain to Ireland in the passenger ships.  Any effort to improve our tourist industry should be directed towards improving the conditions under which tourists travel, if necessary even by some subvention in the way of a small payment towards the cost in the slack season period.</P>
      <P>It is with regret that I note there is some reduction in the Estimate for Social Services.  While it would not be reasonable to suggest that the Minister has no intention of improving the lot of the old, the widow and the unemployment assistance groups in his coming Budget, the fact that the Minister for Social Welfare has not increased his Estimate, augurs very badly for them and that there is, in actual fact, a cut or a saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a saving, I cannot see where is must come from other than from the local authorities.  If there is any tightening up&mdash;I know this is denied by the Parliamentary Secretary &mdash;in the regulations or conditions under which benefits are got and which has caused the saving, those deprived of their benefits will have to be assisted from local rates.  I would regret any <Col N="288" /> effort to reduce still further the position of those people who even at the moment are in such dire need.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by pointing out that what we need most in this country to carry out the programme of Fianna Fáil or the programme of any other group in this country who are minded to improve the lot of the people is money.  It is my honest belief that no Government in this country will ever succeed in getting us out of the position we occupy at the present moment, unless they take their courage in their hands and secure some kind of control over both the banking and the insurance systems.</P>
    <P>In these two spheres, there is the means of carrying out an economic programme.  In these two systems, there is the means of improving our social welfare services.  I look forward to the day when some Government in this country will secure to themselves the right to say where the money secured by these groups should go, and not only that, but see to it that most of the money is returned to uplift the people who have made it possible both for banks and insurance companies to prosper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The general trend of criticism in the activities of the different Parties in this House seems to be a criticism of housing.  At the same time, we have a general wail about emigration.  If all those thousands are leaving the country, one wonders what the houses are there for. Members of every Party jump up here and claim that they built so many thousands of houses in their time.  One member says that they built so many thousands in their time and then, according as each Party changes place, we have a howl about the thousands who emigrate.  If the thousands are emigrating, who occupies the houses they are leaving? What is all the shouting about houses for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy M.J. O'Higgins on that matter and I felt rather amused.  He knows the condition of affairs under which his Party left office.  He knows the condition of affairs in regard to loans outstanding <Col N="289" /> to Cork County Council and to the thousands of people, newly married people, who had applied for grants and loans to build their houses and the loans were not forthcoming. He knows the number of contractors who were broken and the number of builders providers who had to go out of business as well.  He knew all that when he got up to speak here. He knew the step Deputy Sweetman took to prevent any further local authority housing from going ahead.</P>
    <P>I remember coming in here and raising a question with the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy O'Donnell, in regard to a scheme of houses in Ballinacurra in my district. I do not know how he managed it but he produced the result of an inquiry by a Local Government official and a refusal was given in regard to the site because there was no water supply. That was in 1956 but, lo and behold, on that very same site today houses are being built with the sanction of the Minister for Local Government who apparently succeeded in striking the rock, like Moses, and produced the water out of the watermain that for the past 25 years has been running in front of that site.  That is the kind of stuff you got and that is the manner in which housing was held up.  Any Deputy who is interested, can go to the library and he will find Deputy O'Donnell's statement on the Ballinacurra housing scheme and the results of the inspector's inquiry in 1956.  It is down there in the Official Report and Deputies can go down and have a look at it.  When I stated that there was a watermain in front of this site, I was laughed at by the Minister for Local Government.  Those are the facts.</P>
    <P>Again, we are accused here in regard to salaries.  The vast bulk of the increase was on salaries for civil servants and others.  They can apportion the blame now as I read this out. I want to take the case of the civil servant who had £915 a year in 1947. In 1948 he got an increase of £50 per year.  In 1951 he got a further increase of £106 a year.  In 1953 he got a further increase of £64 a year. In 1955 he got an additional increase <Col N="290" /> of £84 a year.  In 1958 he got an increase of £26 a year and in 1960 he has got an increase of £78 a year.  That is £408 of an increase per year for the civil servant who had £915 in 1947. I have called out the years and the blame can be apportioned during that period.  Apparently some genius of a judge&mdash;I suppose he is another civil servant&mdash;decided that the cost of living had gone up and that they were entitled to this.  That man had practically an increase of 50 per cent. in his salary from 1947 to 1960.  The 50 per cent. increase, in the Estimates for the Civil Service over these years now amounts to £17 million.  There it is, and it is simple enough for anybody to understand.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Kyne complain about the wages of the agricultural workers.  If I had my way, I would put the wages of agricultural workers on a higher plane than those of industrial workers.  The agricultural workers have to be far more skilled, but out of what are they to be paid?  In 1948 the farmer got £24 per ton for feeding barley; this year it is £19.  He got £33 10s. per ton for wheat; it is now £28.  The price of milk has not changed since 1948 and, if we are to take the tape measure on which all those other increases were given to the civil servants and apply it to agriculture, it works out this way.  Beet, the price of which is based on the cost of production, has increased in the meantime from £4 8s. per ton to £6 8s. per ton.  That means the cost of production on the land has gone up to that extent while the price paid to the farmer has gone down.</P>
    <P>When I hear people here sneering, particularly Deputies representing Dublin, at the agricultural community, I feel like telling them that the largest industry in this city practically owes its existence to the subsidy the farmers pay for it.  Some three years ago we had a conference with Arthur Guinness and Son and they said that the agricultural community do not contribute to exports.  Forty per cent. of the production of Arthur Guinness is for home consumption while 60 per cent. is for export to go into competition with the products of the British brewers. They asked us if we were prepared to <Col N="291" /> help them out in that regard.  When we examined the figures we found that although the British farmer has a guaranteed price of 58s. per barrel for barley, the British brewer is paying only 44s. a barrel for it.</P>
    <P>We supplied 466,000 barrels of barley last year for brewing.  In plain language we contributed&mdash;in order to keep that industry going and to provide employment in Dublin&mdash;out of the sweat of the farmers' brows, £480,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a horror of anybody saying anything about agriculture.  I am speaking of employment and the number at present employed in Dublin in one industry, due to the assistance given by the farmers in helping out on prices to provide an export market.  That is just one instance of what is happening. When examining the position in regard to employment, you must consider many things.  There has been a rush by Governments here for the export market.  In my early days in Sinn Féin we learned first the policy of self-sufficiency.  Unfortunately, Governments are apt to close their eyes to the markets at home and not to bother much about ways and means of supplying them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody studying trade and shipping statistics in the Library will find some amazing things.  For example, he will find that we imported £2,000,000 worth of cane sugar last year, 64,000 tons.  There is £2,000,000 on to your adverse trade balance.  You also find that we exported 34,000 tons of sugar and sugar products last year and we paid the amazing sum of £855,000 for the privilege of sending that across the water to Britain.  I raised the matter here and I found, to be quite frank, that those dealing with it did not know their subject.  They said we were getting the very same conditions as Commonwealth countries are getting. What is the position?  The <Col N="292" /> Cubans are guaranteed a market by the American Government at somewhere between £54 and £60 a ton for their sugar.  What they have left is thrown on the surplus market and that is what we get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy under which the farmers must decide whether to increase production or not. There is a market of £2,000,000 here on the one hand and a body of small tillage farmers on the other who signed contracts this year for 96,000 acres of beet and who were told that only 66,000 acres were required.  There are 30,000 acres of beet&mdash;sufficient to fill that £2,000,000 gap.  We are entitled to know what is wrong.  It is this: on the one hand you have a trick under which agreements that were made are by-passed.  Commonwealth sugar is entering Britain today at a price £14 per ton better than the price of Irish sugar.  I admit the Irish Sugar Company pays the same duty and the same levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir; I shall take another line.  In answer to a question here on 17th February, I was informed by the Minister that £1,462,344 worth of agricultural machinery was imported from Britain. Is there not an opportunity for establishing an industry there and giving <Col N="293" /> employment to the thousands Deputy Kyne says have to emigrate?  I should like the Minister to examine that matter.</P>
      <P>In reply to a further question, the Minister also told me:</P>
      <P>Certain agricultural implements, and their component parts, designed for operation by a mechanically propelled vehicle are liable to Custom's duty at the rate of 37½ per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> (full) or 25 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> (preferential, applicable to goods of United Kingdom or Canadian origin).</P>
      <P>Twenty-five per cent. of £1,462,000 is £365,000&mdash;or at least it was when I went to school.  Last Wednesday, I asked the Minister if he would tell me the total amount of tax levied and customs duty collected on agricultural machinery imported from Britain in the years 1958 and 1959.  The House will remember that the figure for those imports is £1,400,000 and the duty is 25 per cent.  The reply I got was:</P>
      <P>The total amount of customs duties collected on agricultural machinery imported from Britain in the years 1958 and 1959 were respectively £36,500 and £35,000 approximately.</P>
      <P>Twenty-five per cent. of £1,400,000 amounted to £36,000!  Has somebody forgotten a nought?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that is beside the point. I suggest there is undoubtedly an opportunity there.  Judging by the figures, there is evidently a very considerable market for such machinery in this country.  There was an import of £757,000 worth of agricultural machinery from other countries as well, making a total £2,000,000 worth of agricultural machinery coming into this country each year.  Surely the Government should examine that matter?  I have repeatedly referred to the position this country would be in, if there were a war tomorrow. Within 12 months, every foreign tractor and item of agricultural machinery would be thrown in the dyke because there would be no parts for them.  I suggest to the Minister that there is room here for the manufacture <Col N="294" /> of tractors and other agricultural machinery and that employment could be given to at least 1,000 or 2,000 men.</P>
    <P>In 1953, this House voted £250,000 for the expansion and extension of the steel industry at Haulbowline.  The Government went out of office and I do not know what became of the £250,000.  I suppose it was levied off the people in one way or another.  In any event, the £250,000 disappeared and there was no expansion or extension in Haulbowline from 1954 to 1957.  Today, however employment in that industry is increasing at the rate of between 25 and 50 men a week. That is a happy position for any industry to be in.  Undoubtedly, the change of Government has saved that industry and has resulted in an enormous increase in employment.</P>
    <P>Only a few months ago, I had the pleasure of seeing 43 young men from the locality sent out to Holland to learn the trade of shipbuilding for the Rushbrooke Dockyard.  Again, that is a happy augury for the future.  I understand that three teams of 40 are to be sent out for such training.  When those lads come back trained, it will mean that, instead of foreigners, our own skilled people will be in charge of that industry.  We shall not have the Irish as merely the hewers of wood and the drawers of water.</P>
    <P>I can see all these changes going on around me.  There is also the position at Whitegate.  A very notable statement was made by my former colleague in this House, Mr. P.J. O'Gorman.  I remember seeing Deputy Palmer strolling around Youghal during a by-election, knocking at the doors and being told: &ldquo;My husband is in England.  What can I do?&rdquo;</P>

We have the pleasure now of hearing the former Deputy O'Gorman welcoming people to the town of Youghal, a town in <Col N="295" /> which he said there is no unemployment and everyone is working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help answering, Sir, when I am interrupted.  However, I am giving the history of each town in my constituency as I go on. That is the position in Youghal.  I have already described the position in Cobh and am also happy to say that, thanks to the late William Dwyer, God rest his soul, there is no unemployment in the town of Midleton, either.  That is the general position in my constituency as far as industry is concerned and I wish I could say the same for the agricultural community. Undoubtedly there is something wrong when, on the one hand, there are cries for increased production and people are anxious for increased production, while, on the other hand, there is a prohibition against producing more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only the year before last, the prohibition took the form of a fine of 5/9d. on a barrel of wheat because our farmers were producing too much wheat.  As I pointed out a few minutes ago, this year, we had a position in which the farmers were prepared to produce an extra £2,000,000 worth of sugar beet and it should not be beyond the capabilities of Ministers, or Departments, to devise some means of preventing Britain from putting <Col N="296" /> a £14 a ton barrier on Irish sugar exported there.  Surely that is an extraordinary state of affairs when one recalls that some years back&mdash;I cannot recall the exact date&mdash;the tax was taken off British sugar coming in here and has never been imposed since, although the British are charging a 52 per cent. duty and levy on our sugar going into Britain.  What a joke that is!</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he has bargaining power which he could use&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash; and which could mean an awful lot to us.  It could mean an awful lot to the livelihoods of a large section of my constituents, extending from my own house down to Youghal.  That part of the county lives on beet, barley and wheat.  There is something like 35/- an acre poor law valuation on the land there and I believe the people are paying over £2 in the £1 this year in rates.  At the same time, the rates have gone up by something like 75 per cent. in 10 years, while the price of what these people produce has gone down by something like 30 per cent. in the same period. Then we have Deputy Kyne wondering why there is not more employment on the land.  I thank God that the unfortunate people have somewhere to go off the land.</P>
    <P>The price of Irish beet to-day, and the price of Irish sugar is based, among other things, on about £5-11-0 a week for an agricultural labourer and one could hardly get anybody to sweep the floor in any kind of factory for that amount.  Still, we have suggestions that we could produce more cheaply.  It is good that we have the costings on something and that we have some basis on which to work. However, I do not intend pursuing that matter further.  I am sure the Minister will use his good offices in this connection because his constituency is like my own, a constituency of ordinary, hard-working, tillage farmers and it is up to him, as to me, to do something about the situation.</P>
    <P>As was my duty, I have consulted the general manager of the Irish Sugar Company and he assures me that the <Col N="297" /> factory in Mallow and one other factory could be extended to take an extra 500 tons of beet a day.  That would fill the whole gap.  With the high production of beet this year, the factories had to work very hard and, instead of 1,700 tons of beet a day, they cleared something like 2,500 tons a day, and were working 105 days during the campaign season in Mallow.  By expanding the factories, extra production could be coped with. The farmers are prepared to produce so why not go ahead on those lines?</P>
    <P>Boards are periodically set up by this House but they are completely removed from the jurisdiction and the control of this House.  They are little dictatorships on their own and I suggest to the Minister that it would be wise to bring those boards under the control of this House, or that there should be somebody in the House prepared to answer for them.</P>

      <P>I want to be quite frank about it.  People who are anxious to establish or to expand industries in my constituency from time to time find themselves pushed aside. There is no money available, no grants available, nothing available to the Irish citizen who wants to expand industry and give employment.  A Deputy who puts down a Parliamentary Question is informed that the Minister is not responsible.  Who is responsible?  Whose money are they using?  These matters need full investigation in the House.</P>

But for the <Col N="298" /> operations of those gentlemen I would have a far happier picture to point of the town of Fermoy than I have at present.  The town of Fermoy is a worry.  There is a big unemployment problem there, of men who should not be unemployed and I can assure Deputy McAuliffe that that would not be so but for the fact that areas were taken away from me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people who are anxious to expand industries there and to give employment.  I suggest to the Minister that he should use his good offices on their behalf.  I suppose I cannot say more than that on this Estimate.  I have given the reason for the increases that are, unfortunately, to be seen in the Book of Estimates.  There is £17 million for the Civil Service.  That is a tale of woe.  I have given the increases given periodically.  They were given every two or three years&mdash;1948, 1951, 1953, 1955, 1958 and 1960.  Therefore, neither side of the House can claim that they reduced the cost of living because these increases were based on increases in the cost of living.  The gentleman who had £916 in 1947 got £408 more because of increases in the cost of living.  I hope that when our Bill is discussed next week the Minister will think of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry spoke for nearly three-quarters of an hour and I do not think that anyone in the Opposition could put forward such a scathing indictment of the Government as he did. Although he is a supporter of the present Administration, I did not hear him say one word in support of their policy or in favour of anything they have done, not only in their present term of office, but in their other terms of office to which he referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to judge the Government's general policy on this Vote on Account.  The first thing that strikes one is the increase of £7 million.  The second is that it is the taxpayers who will have to pay the bill and the taxpayers are not as strong numerically as they were 12 months ago.  In other <Col N="299" /> words, there is an ever-increasing rate of expenditure and an ever-dwindling population to pay it.  That is the strongest indictment I can offer of a Government with a huge majority such as the Government have, free to do anything they want to do, free to implement and policy, free from worry about the division bell and the anxieties associated with narrow majorities.  Yet, all they can do is to present us with an enormous bill, while the economic condition of the country is unsatisfactory, as is perfectly plain, no matter how anyone may try to gloss over the fact.</P>
    <P>Were it not for the increase in exports of industrial goods in the past couple of months, we should be facing a financial crisis.  No matter what economists, bankers, Ministers or senior civil servants may say, the balance of payments position must be a cause of disquiet.  When one finds a decline in the exports of the principal industry, the fundamental industry, the root of our economy, naturally there is cause for serious anxiety.  There is no use in a Government who have been three years in office presenting us with this enormous bill, unless they have some policy to implement and some slight hope to offer to the citizens.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Kyne made a very reasonable contribution to the debate. He stressed one point which I think is most serious, namely, that instead of the breadwinner or the grown-up <Col N="300" /> children of a family emigrating, as was the practice formerly, whole families are now going away, that people are turning their backs on this country, selling their furniture, closing up their homes and starting a new life in another part of the world.  That is an indictment of the Government and of Ministers who come in here and speak of their policy without indicating what that policy is.  As far as I can see, they have no policy except to try to struggle on from day to day and week to week.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corry very truly said, they are establishing boards divorced from the administration of the country and divorced from political control, and State funds are being pumped into these boards.  That is the only thing they have offered to Parliament since they became the Government over three years ago.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has a family, anyone who has to earn a livelihood, is naturally anxious that the Government should have something to offer the country.  The change in political outlook in this country and in the countries with which we trade, the recent decisions taken by other countries to liberalise trade&mdash;such things cannot pass us by.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
