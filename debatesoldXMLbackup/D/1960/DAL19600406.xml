      <P>A recipient of a widow's pension who, by reason of illness, is unable to attend at the post office to collect the pension does not normally require a medical certificate in order to secure payment to her authorised agent.  The certificate of a clergyman or of a peace commissioner is accepted in lieu of a doctor's certificate.  A doctor's certificate, however, is necessary if the pensioner is too ill to sign the authorisation and the pension book or is suffering from an infectious disease.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that some doctors in Cork City have refused to give necessary certificates in such cases but if the Deputy will furnish me with particulars, I shall have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>In the nine dispensary districts comprising the city and adjoining built up area of the county, the number of medical cards on issue that lapsed during the year 1959 because the holders did not apply to have them renewed was 1,913.</P>

The information requested is not available for any year prior to the financial year ended on the 31st March, 1958.  I should point out that the amounts of unemployment assistance paid in the financial years ended on the 31st March, 1958, 1959 and 1960 were affected not only by variations in the numbers of persons applying for unemployment assistance but also by variations in the rates of unemployment assistance payable, those rates having been increased twice during that period, first in May, 1957 and again in August, 1959.</P>

I assume the bridge the Deputy has in mind is the footbridge over the Glenamoy River near Martin McDonnell's house in the townland of Lenarevagh, and approximately half a mile southwest of Glenamoy Church. The proposal is not a suitable employment scheme, and a full cost grant could not be made available for it.  I should add that, while I have no responsibility for the repair of this bridge, I am prepared, as already indicated to the beneficiaries, to consider the proposal under the Rural Improvements Scheme, if an application under that scheme is submitted and the beneficiaries are prepared to contribute towards its cost.</P>

      <P>The position under which a wide range of our industrial products enjoy duty free entry to the British market is secured by the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreements.

      <P>At the request of the Dublin Corporation a traffic consultant recently undertook a preliminary survey of the traffic problems of Dublin City and its environs and submitted a preliminary report to the Corporation.  I am not aware that he is examining the possible route of the main road at Shankill. The Dublin Corporation made a preliminary investigation of the proposal to build a new road on the abandoned railway line, but no proposals in regard to it have been submitted to my Department.  A traffic survey which Dublin Corporation are considering following the receipt of the consultant's preliminary report would throw light on the merits of this proposal.  If such a road were constructed it would have to join the existing main road at Shankill and this would affect any development proposals in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 33, after &ldquo;office&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and shall inform such member of the reasons for his removal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of the debate on the Committee Stage of this Bill, reported at Column 1597, Volume 180, No. 11 of the 31st March, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> We were then directing the attention of the Minister to the undesirability of providing that a member of the Authority might be dismissed by the Minister without being told why he was being dismissed.  The Minister then said, at Column 1597:</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard: It could also happen that if the reason for removal were stated, it would do that person other damage.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Even if it were privately communicated to him?</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard: Would he not know the reasons himself, anyway?</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: That is to beg the whole question.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard: He would know he was being removed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: That is all right.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard: He would be told he would be removed from office. I am certain he would be told.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Put it in the Bill that he will be told the reason.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hilliard: Putting it in the Bill is something different.</P>
    <P>I think at that stage we understood the Minister to say not &ldquo;He would be told he would be removed from office,&rdquo;<Col N="1831" /> but we understood him to say &ldquo;He would be told the reason why he was removed from office.&rdquo;  That explains why I commented upon that &ldquo;Put it in the Bill that he will be told the reason.&rdquo;  Then the Minister said &ldquo;Putting it in the Bill is something different.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The debate then proceeded at Column 1598.  I recalled to the Minister what I had thought he had earlier said.  I am reported as saying:</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was unthinkable that a member of this Authority would be removed without being told the reason.</P>
    <P>Long experience teaches one that it is sometimes no harm to reaffirm what has been earlier said in the debate for the purpose of the record.  The Minister is reported as saying, at column 1599:</P>
    <P>He will be told the reason.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that in page 4, line 33, it shall be laid down that: &ldquo;The Government may at any time remove a member of the Authority from office and shall inform such member of the reasons for his removal.&rdquo;  The Minister gives me his personal assurance that he will be told the reason and I accept that without qualification, but I would recall to him that he, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, is a corporation sole that goes on for ever and I seek not to bind the present Minister, whose word is quite adequate reassurance to me, but to bind his successors in office to do what he has personally undertaken to do.</P>
    <P>I think he will agree with me that while Deputy Hilliard may give an undertaking which binds himself for ever, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs can give an undertaking which is only effectively binding while he himself is Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and the only way he can bind himself as a corporation sole is to insert the undertaking he has personally given in the text of the Bill.  I have submitted the amendment in the exact words the Minister chose to <Col N="1832" /> employ and I would be grateful if he could see his way to accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it better to leave the section as it stands.  It is true, from Deputy Dillon's quotation of what I said, that the person would be told the reason but I have considered that matter further and it can happen in one case out of a hundred, or in one out of twenty cases&mdash;whatever small percentage of cases the Deputy wishes to take&mdash;it might not be possible for a Government to give the reason for the removal of a member from the Authority.  In so far as particular classes of cases are concerned, I cannot see why the member cannot be told the reason&mdash;such as inattendance at meetings over lengthy periods, incapacity through ill-health, or insolvency&mdash;but anybody who has actually occupied Ministerial office, or has full knowledge of dealing with staffs, must be well aware that there are occasions on which a person just cannot be told the reason he is being removed from office.</P>
      <P>I do not want to quote cases if I can avoid doing so, but I think it would be best to leave a decision on this matter to the Government whenever a person is being removed from office. I am quite satisfied that whatever Minister or Government may be in office whenever such a thing could occur&mdash;and it is most unlikely to happen&mdash;will not take advantage of this power to remove a member from office without having the gravest reason.  Therefore, I feel it would be better to leave the section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me rather strange that the Minister has gone back on what he said in Column 1599 because, as far as I can understand him, his reason now for rejecting this amendment is that he thinks there would be occasions when it would not be desirable to tell the member of the Authority who was being removed from office why he was being removed.  That is all very well, but for a Minister to get second thoughts of that sort is not very desirable either.  For the life of me I cannot see any reason whatever why the person concerned should not be told the <Col N="1833" /> reason why he was being removed.</P>
      <P>I can see a perfect answer from the Minister in saying it would be undesirable for the Government to publish such a reason and that is why, though we had originally argued that the Government should publish the reasons, we deliberately changed the amendment so as to make it clear that it was the person concerned, the person being removed from office, who was entitled to be told privately why he was being removed.  After all, removing a member of the broadcasting Authority from his position as a director is a pretty big slur on that member.  It is a very big slur that he is being taken off and told that no longer is he a member.  The person concerned is at least entitled to have under statute the protection that would be inherent in this amendment.</P>
      <P>Here is a person who comes along and serves on a public board.  The Government of the day decide that they wish to remove him from office but they are not prepared to wait until his period of office terminates and then not re-appoint him.  They go ahead and remove him from office and I submit that he is entitled to the courtesy of being told why.  The Minister is not prepared to concede that and I gather now that he is going very much further in the wrong direction than he did on Committee Stage.  If he is not prepared to concede it, then I think he will find it hard to get people of honour to serve on the Authority because they will want to know why they are removed from office, if ever they are.  It is at least due a person that he be told why a slur is being cast upon him in public, and removal from an office such as this would be a slur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. In the first place I do not like the wording of the section: &ldquo;may at any time remove a member of the Authority from office.&rdquo;  The section might have been modulated by leaving out the words &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; and, even if the Minister was not prepared to accept the amendment, he might have been encouraged by his own speech, which was quoted previously, to add the words &ldquo;for good and sufficient reasons.&rdquo;  The Minister is a fair-minded <Col N="1834" /> and just man.  I think everybody in the Dáil will admit he is and I think the board would be quite satisfied, if he were to remain in office <i>saecula saeculorum</i>, that he would not do anything unjust to a member of the Authority.</P>
      <P>However, I am aware from personal experience that all Ministers are not as fair and just as the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I have had personal experience of a case where a Minister has taken advantage of a clause somewhat similar to this to remove a member from a board without giving any reason and, furthermore, without giving the individual concerned an opportunity to plead his case.  In other words, if the Minister or the Government decide that a man should be removed from office, he is not allowed to defend his case and is simply removed.  That is completely unjust and unfair.  While I do not ascribe to the present Minister any such undesirable motives, I do think it desirable to include in the section some safeguard whereby the individual would at least have the right to protest and to see that justice is done if justice is not done in his case. I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment or else to insert such words as &ldquo;for good and sufficient reason.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express an opinion on this matter. I am suspicious of this section because I have had experience of being a member of a certain organisation. Suddenly I received no more invitations to attend meetings and ceased to be a member on that account.  I did not resign.  They just stopped inviting me.  That is the last I heard of it. Something similar can happen in this case.  The present Minister is a nice sort of fellow; we all have regard for him; but he will not be always there.  The very opposite type may be in his position.  There are many &ldquo;toughs&rdquo; in politics as well as very nice people.  Some years ago announcers on Radio Éireann were dismissed.  I understand that one man was dismissed because he had certain political sentiments, which were not <Col N="1835" /> those of the Government, and because he expressed them he was sacked.  A man might lapse morally and it might be a good thing to dismiss him.  A man might go soft in the head and it might be a good thing to let him go. The point is there can be abuse of a power.</P>
      <P>I have studied history.  My mind goes back to revolutionary France. The Committee of Public Safety there had power to arrest anyone without trial and shoot him.  Robespierre got into power and later he tried to work a quick one and tried to have a rule passed by the Convention whereby he could arrest the members of the Convention and shoot them but they were &ldquo;not having any.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man could find himself out of a job because he had been acting contrary to the political interests of the Minister at the time and no question is to be asked.  It is because of the <Col N="1836" /> dangers of the political use that might be made of this rule that I object because, as I said before&mdash;I do not like always saying it&mdash;I do not trust anyone.  Therefore, while I have said a good word about the Minister and meant it, he will not be always the Minister.  I agree with Deputy Dillon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Every person appointed to be a member of the Authority shall within three months after his appointment absolutely sell and dispose of all shares in any broadcasting undertaking which he shall at the time of his appointment own or be interested in for his own benefit, and if any shares in any broadcasting undertaking shall come to or vest in a member of the Authority by will or succession for his own benefit, he shall within three months after the same shall have so come to or vested in him, absolutely sell and dispose of the same or his interest therein.</P>
      <P>(2)  A member of the Authority shall not, while he holds that office, purchase, take, or become interested in for his own benefit any shares in any broadcasting undertaking.</P>
      <P>(3)  Any member of the Authority who shall retain, purchase, take, or become or remain interested in any shares in any broadcasting undertaking in contravention of this section shall be disqualified for and be deemed to have vacated his office as such member.</P>
      <P>(4)  In this section the expression &lsquo;shares in any broadcasting undertaking&rsquo; means and includes any stock, shares, debentures, debenture stock, bonds, or other securities of any company engaged in the production or the sale of broadcasting programmes whether televised or by sound only and includes any share or interest in any unincorporated undertaking similarly engaged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to repeat what I said yesterday that this amendment, which stands in the name of Deputy Palmer, has to be considered in the light of the fact that a particular person has been named for the position.  It would be far preferable if the amendment could be considered on a purely theoretical, abstract basis.  However, it is not the Opposition who have prevented the amendment and the section being discussed in an abstract way.  It is the Minister who, by his own announcement of the name of the person who is to be offered the appointment of Chairman of the Broadcasting Authority, takes this discussion out of the abstract, in which all of us, including the Minister, would prefer to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to repeat also what I said yesterday in relation to the person, that I make no comment of any kind unfavourable to his abilities as an <Col N="1839" /> actor or as a producer.  I know nothing of his administrative experience but the ability he has shown in acting and in producing does not necessarily imply any administrative ability.  He may have it; I do not know.  However, it is not on that account that we are moving this amendment.  It is because we want to make certain that in the public life of this body and in the public life of the country nothing is permitted by legislation which could cause even a breath of suspicion or cause anybody outside to suggest in any way that something was being done that should not be done in a public position.</P>
    <P>The amendment before the House is one that is copied exactly, word for word except for two words, from the Electricity Supply Act of 1927.  The Electricity Supply Act set up a board; this sets up an Authority instead of the Board.  The other difference is that the Electricity Supply Act deals with an electrical undertaking.  In this Bill we are dealing not with an electrical undertaking but with a broadcasting undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Act of 1927, which was the first of the State-sponsored bodies to be set up, clearly laid it down that while a director could have, in certain circumstances, a contract with the board, he could not be a member of or have any interest in another electrical undertaking.  It was obviously necessary in that case that a member of the E.S.B. should be permitted to have a contract with the board because otherwise he would not be able to have any electric light in his house.</P>
    <P>Equally it was felt then to be desirable&mdash;not merely was it felt to be desirable; it was in practice and in fact desirable&mdash;that a member of the Electricity Supply Board should not be able to engage in any analogous or competing business.  For that reason the Act of 1927 included a provision that a member of the Electricity Supply Board, on being appointed a member, had to sell or otherwise dispose of all his interests in any company or unincorporated concern <Col N="1840" /> which dealt first with the business of producing electricity&mdash;of which there were not likely to be many&mdash;and secondly, with the business of selling by wholesale or retail, electrical apparatus, of which there were bound to be a great many.  In fact, even in the lifetime of this Government&mdash;or perhaps it was in the previous Fianna Fáil Government; I think it was in the 1951 to 1954 Government&mdash;I remember a person being appointed a member of the Electricity Supply Board who at the time was a member of a company dealing in electrical apparatus.  In consequence of that appointment the person concerned, in pursuance of the provision contained in Section 11 of the Act of 1927, resigned&mdash;properly resigned&mdash;from the company which was an electrical undertaking within the meaning of the 1927 Act.  It sold certain materials which could be described as electrical apparatus.</P>
    <P>That person was appointed to be a member of the E.S.B. by the present Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I say &ldquo;was appointed&rdquo; by him; it is possible that he was appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but he was appointed by Fianna Fáil.  It is not surprising that he was appointed by Fianna Fáil because he was one of the 11 just men who applied for subscriptions for Fianna Fáil in the 1948 general election, but put that to one side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When he came to be given his appointment notwithstanding the friendship that the Government had for him, they made him comply&mdash;and properly made him comply&mdash;with Section 11 of the Electricity Supply Act of 1927.  In relation to this Bill the Minister proposes to have no such restriction.  The Minister makes the case that it is necessary to have in this Authority someone who has prior knowledge of broadcasting.  Surely to goodness, the Electricity Supply Board in 1927, if that argument were good today, <Col N="1841" /> could have used the same argument in 1927, that it was desirable then to have people with experience of electrical undertakings to serve on the new electrical grid board that was then being set up?  The Government of that day decided it was not desirable, that it was essential that for the reputation of the country and of the board that there should be a provision against people doing continuous business with the board, the continuous business that they would do if they were engaged in an electrical undertaking. They were right in so doing and we would be right in so providing today.</P>
      <P>In relation to this Bill, there is nothing whatever making it necessary that the chairman or any of the members of the broadcasting Authority should be a person with technical knowledge of broadcasting.  In fact, on the contrary, it would be far better for the members of the Authority to be people able to look at the broad national picture in relation to broadcasting rather than that they should be people who had such technical knowledge as would inevitably make them take a narrow view of the issues involved.  I believe it is true of the members of the Authority; I believe it is doubly true or trebly true of the chairman of the Authority.</P>
      <P>Above all else, the job of a chairman of a body like this is to take the broadest general view on matters of policy, to be sure that he gets the best possible technical advice from his officials or from consultants but, having got the best possible technical advice, to be certain that the board over which he presides considers that advice in the light of broad general principles of policy.  He should not be constrained, restricted or in any way narrowed in his consideration of the problems by the fact that he himself has technical experience from one aspect only because remember the person we are concerned with has technical experience from one aspect and from one aspect only and that is from the aspect of producing and acting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not what is required from a chairman of this Authority.  What <Col N="1842" /> is required is a person with a broad national policy outlook related to television and sound broadcasting.  I say that in reference to a particular person who has been named.  I wish to make it clear it is not for the purpose of criticising him or in any way attacking him but for the purpose of making it clear beyond question that there is no need for the Minister to insist that he takes his chairman from persons who have broadcasting experience as such.  Being clear therefore myself, and I think all of us on this side of the House are absolutely clear&mdash;and I believe most members on the other side are, but they are not equally able to express their views&mdash;that what is wanted here is a broad basis for the board like that.  When one considers whether it is desirable to have a person there who is dealing day in and day out with the Authority, I want to say in the most categorical fashion I can that there is nothing more undesirable.  It was thought to be highly undesirable in 1927 in the case of electricity and it is perhaps even more undesirable today for an Authority of this type.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is not accepted it means that a person can buy in Canada, in America and elsewhere throughout the world, the Irish copyright rights of suitable television material and having bought that material, having bought the Irish rights for it, can come along and sell those Irish rights to the Authority of which he is the chairman and in respect of which his colleagues are bound to be influenced by the fact that they are being sold to the Authority by the chairman.  That is not a fanciful story.  I could understand people saying, if a member put the amendment to the House on a basis of that hypothesis, that it was a hypothesis that was never likely to happen.  But it is not an hypothesis; it is a fact and it is to the honour of Mr. Andrews that he has acknowledged in a public interview in Radio Review that he has been doing that and that he intends to do that.  The fact that he has so disclosed his position is to his honour but it is a thing that should not be permitted by this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1843" /> He said there that his company, the company of which he was a founder and of which he is a director has been buying for Ireland the Irish rights for television material in America, Canada and elsewhere; that he has been buying it for the purpose of selling it to the Broadcasting Authority when an Irish television station is set up; and that he has obtained options. I do not see when that is the position, how anybody who wishes to question or to criticise the price which is to be paid for that material by the Television Authority when it is set up, could be satisfied that the sale was carried through in a normal businesslike way.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting in any way that because these options have been taken up an unfair price will be charged to the Broadcasting Authority for them.  But, I am not merely suggesting, I am stating categorically that no matter what may be the facts, nobody whose material is turned down in favour of material purchased in this manner will believe that he got a fair run.  That is a dead weight round the neck of the new Broadcasting Authority that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should not put on it, when it is just starting off.</P>
    <P>Any member of the public who has something that he wants to put on television and that he feels is good enough to be produced on television, and who is turned down will certainly feel he has a grievance if this arrangement is adopted.  Whether he has a grievance or not is not really the question.  The question is that in relation to public concerns what is done must not merely be what is right, fair, just and proper, but what appears to be right, fair, just and proper.  This arrangement that the Minister wishes to provide in his Bill that a person can be chairman of the Authority and at the same time that his company can be selling programme material to that Authority, day in and day out, is not one that could possibly appear to be fair, right, just or proper.</P>
    <P>We had some discussion in relation to the analogy that arose in respect <Col N="1844" /> of the county councils and the County Management Act.  One defence put up for the County Management Act was that that would not happen then. But there is a difference and it is that now a member of a local authority under statute has no power to influence the way in which a contract is given by the county manager.  Under statute the member of a local authority has had the power taken away from him.  It is the manager alone who, under statute, has that power and it is for that reason alone now that a member of a local authority can, shall we say, supply milk to a hospital in the local authority area.  He can only do it because under statute he is prohibited from having any effect in any way on his colleagues and his colleagues have no statutory permission in any way to make that contract.</P>
    <P>In the present case the colleagues are being permitted by statute to do it.  The intention, from what the Minister himself has said, is that the man can serve two masters at one and the same time.  It is quite outrageous to suggest that it is proper in a public concern.  It is quite outrageous to suggest that it will not give rise to grave public uneasiness that a man should be chairman of a broadcasting Authority at one second and in the next second chairman of the company supplying the Authority, and that intends to supply the Authority, on his own admission.  I pay honour and tribute to him for having made the admission.  On his own admission, he intends to supply most of the material for that Authority.  A man cannot serve two masters and the Minister is trying to put a person into that unfortunate position.  This amendment prevents that happening and for that reason I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reasons I have already given on the Committee Stage, I do not propose to accept this amendment.  It is abundantly clear to me both from the E.S.B. Act of 1927 and from the other Acts which I have quoted that the principle of a member of a semi-State body having some interest in the contracts made by <Col N="1845" /> that body has been accepted in our legislation because provision has been made for such circumstances on the lines of Section 8 of this Bill. Provision has already been made in other Acts.  While Section 11 of the E.S.B. Act precludes the continuance in office of members of the board who have any interest in electrical undertakings or in the sale of electrical apparatus, there has been a departure from this line in subsequent legislation and the position has been, in effect, that the Government has had the widest choice of persons with or without possible interest in contracts with the board concerned.</P>
      <P>Of course it has been, and is, the responsibility of the Government not to appoint persons with interests which conflict with their duties as members of these Authorities.  All I can say, both for myself and the Government, is that we have no intention of evading that responsibility but we disagree with the Members opposite concerning the application of the principle in a particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment because I think there is a vast difference between this case and the case of the other companies that have been mentioned, even allowing for the fact that a somewhat similar provision is in the Transport Act and that even Section 10 of the 1927 Electricity Supply Act is on similar lines.  That Act is also governed very stringently by the provisions of Section 11 but in all of these other Acts there is this very profound difference: in no case is the company established the only provider or servicer of fuel, as the case may be, or of transport in the case of the Transport Act. It is true that the E.S.B. has a monopoly but members are obliged under the provisions of Section 11 to divest themselves entirely of any interest in it.  In this case this Authority will have exclusive broadcasting and viewing rights.  That being so, if an arrangement is made under which a person who is a member of the Authority has the rights in respect of a particular programme or piece of entertainment, that piece of entertainment or programme will be the only programme <Col N="1846" /> allowed on the service during the currency of that contract.</P>
      <P>That is a very profound difference because it grants exclusive rights to a particular company or concern.  As I said originally it is unfortunate that this cannot be discussed without referring to the individual concerned but that is not our fault and I want to make that quite clear.  It was the Government who introduced personalities into this by naming them in advance of the legislation.  If the Government now feel that it is unfair that the matter should be discussed they should have thought of that before they took the initial step.  We have been most careful to discuss this in a detached way.  In fact everybody recognises the skill and entertainment value of this person but, leaving aside the person concerned, we are legislating for the future and it may be that neither the Minister nor this person will be directly concerned with this Authority after the lapse of some years.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable public uneasiness elsewhere at what has happened about certain television programmes. There has been considerable uneasiness in other countries and in recent weeks, in this country, strong exception has been taken to the type of programmes provided in certain circumstances over the B.B.C. or I.T.V.  There is not the slightest suggestion that the programmes provided by the person mentioned in this matter would be objectionable in any way whatever but we want to put this thing above suspicion.  This is a new service. No problem may arise in respect of the particular programme or the rights which the company or the individual concerned supply to the new Authority but if problems arise, or criticism is expressed and action has to be taken everyone will say: &ldquo;Was it not obvious from the beginning that there was something wrong?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Government is acting unwisely in this matter and that the Minister has been extremely unfortunate personally.  Everyone recognises that the Minister is a man of integrity. He took over this responsibility after the Government had changed their <Col N="1847" /> minds as to the original concept of the Authority.  The Government is entitled to change their minds but they have stood on every leg so far as the nature of T.V. is concerned. First they have stood on the leg that it would not cost anything from the Exchequer.  After that an advisory committee was appointed.  That was a very proper thing to do but after that we get this legislation.</P>
    <P>Nobody has any doubts about the probity and the character of the person concerned but we are legislating for future generations and future prospects.  It is of some interest that in paragraph 69 of the Report of the Commission, the Commission said that a member of the Authority should have no such financial or other interest as to operate prejudicially to the discharge of his functions as a member of the Authority.  I believe that we should proceed with great care in view of what has happened elsewhere and in view of the very wide potentialities of television and the widespread repercussions that television may have in the future.</P>
    <P>This is a new service.  It is not a new service in respect of broadcasting, as the Authority will take over and continue the existing service.  In view of the considerable public concern in this country recently and to avoid any possibility of a situation developing which would involve the prestige of the Authority, and which might involve the prestige of the country we should take adequate precautions to put the Authority on a proper basis. While in other countries the television Authority is not the direct responsibility of the State, in this country we have properly decided that the television Authority could function only under statutory authority and because of the very wide implications of the whole service, we are most anxious to ensure that this Authority will get off to a good start.  I believe that this difficulty could be, and should be, avoided by the inclusion in the Bill of an amendment such as that tabled by Deputy Palmer.</P>
    <P>The fact that there are somewhat similar provisions in other Bills is not <Col N="1848" /> an answer in this matter for the reason that this Authority will have an absolute monopoly and if a programme is on the air, or on view, it will be the only programme on view while it is in operation.  I believe that the Minister is anxious to do the best he can and to frame the legislation as the most practical and efficient manner of establishing this Authority.  I believe that he has been placed in an unfortunate position because of the change of mind and attitude of the Government on the matter but we have to deal with the Bill as it is.</P>
    <P>A reasonable approach is to ensure that there will be no reason for any doubt in the minds of anybody about the viewing or broadcasting equipment and the inclusion of the amendment would avoid that.  The Minister yesterday stated that if any conflict arose, the chairman had stated that he was quite prepared to resign and that he more or less put the Government on notice that that was his view.  We accept that but it is not good enough to say that he is prepared to resign if his interests should conflict with those of the Authority.  It is inconceivable that a body of this sort could function properly if the chairman had to resign. It is one thing where a member of the Authority can leave a meeting while his interests are being discussed but can anybody imagine a situation developing in which a chairman leaves the meeting, and someone else is appointed in his absence, and the matter is discussed and people are expected to discuss it on the assumption that nobody knows what the chairman's view is on that particular matter?</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister would be well advised to accept this amendment. This in no way reflects on any of the persons concerned but it would ensure that in this new service we would have a good start, a start that would ensure that the Authority would operate properly. We should ensure that nothing is left undone by the Oireachtas in order to frame the legislation so that the public and the national interest will be well safeguarded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support <Col N="1849" /> the amendment.  It applies to other members of the Authority as well as to the chairman.  Early in the discussion I spoke to the Minister about the desirability of appointing people to the Authority who are free from all political association with his own Party, people who would not be bound by political or other considerations.  I think it is just as desirable that anybody appointed to this Authority should be free from any suggestion to the effect that he was associated with the supplying of a service to the Authority.</P>
      <P>We need not stretch our memories back too far to find instances in which there was severe public criticism of people who took advantage of their appointments on companies and boards to feather their own nests.  I am not suggesting that this could possibly arise in this instance, but the public mind is open to suggestion and I think in fairness to the members themselves the best thing to do would be to ensure that there could be no possible criticism because of their associations with broadcasting or other services.  If this is to be a success&mdash;personally, I have grave doubts that it will pay its way&mdash;it is important that we should appoint people who are absolutely impartial and who have no associations with outside firms or corporations which might be supplying a service, or something else, to the Authority.  In two or three years' time, should this service by any chance prove a disastrous failure, there might be suggestions that, while the Authority was a failure, some of the individual members on it came out of it very well indeed. In order to provide against any such criticism the Minister should give the members a free standing so that the public could in no way tie them with their associations with outside concerns. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.  It is a fair amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree in principle with so much that Deputy Cosgrave has said that I find it personally disappointing that I cannot agree with him in actual practice.  It seems to me that it is quite inconsistent to bring in an amendment such as this and yet make no provision that the Minister himself <Col N="1850" /> should hold no shares in any undertaking dealing with broadcasting, programmes or equipment, or anything of that kind.  If we are to be so very, very careful with individual members of this Authority that not only shall they not be directors of any concern with which the Authority may have business dealings but they may not even be the owners of shares in any similar undertaking, then I think we are entering into a very dangerous line of country indeed.  We can become far too nervous about a situation like this.</P>
      <P>I think we are in danger of being a little petty.  I do not say that in any personal sense to Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Palmer or Deputy Russell.  I think we are growing unduly nervous. I hope we shall grow up a little and try to view the matter in a more dispassionate light.  Surely, if the Government are to appoint members to this Authority, they have to ask themselves the question: &ldquo;Are these to be men of standing and of probity, men whom we can trust?  If we cannot trust them, then let us leave it as set out in Section 8; if, at any time, a member of the Authority has any interest in any company or concern with which the Authority proposes to make a contract, that member shall disclose to the Authority the fact of that interest.&rdquo;  That is the usual procedure in any company meeting.  It is the sort of thing any company director always has to bear in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an almost invariable practice that a director of any company has to disclose to his fellow directors in that company any other directorships he may hold.  I have never seen any instance where a director has been asked or expected to disclose that he is a shareholder in another company. That might be necessary if he were in fact the virtual proprietor by reason of being the majority shareholder.  But this amendment does not state that a person shall not be a majority shareholder in another company with broadcasting connections.  The effect of the amendment would be to restrain him from owning even one share.  I cannot see the real reason behind this restraint unless there is some personal suspicion against a particular individual. <Col N="1851" /> We have been arguing around this now for a couple of days in strict anonymity.  It is futile to go on in this way.  I am quite ignorant of any reason for any suspicion being attached to any proposed or rumoured member of this Authority.  Perhaps I am very ignorant, but I just have not heard anything.  It is only right that if anybody has ground for suspicion he should communicate privately with the Minister, and say: &ldquo;If you intend to appoint Mr. X to the position of chairman, or as a member of the Authority, I think it wise to inform you that he has a certain interest, or that he is a person of doubtful probity,&rdquo; or whatever the reason for the objection may be.</P>
    <P>We are dodging around the problem here.  We are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  If the members of the Authority are to be bound in this way, then I should prefer that they would not be members at all.  Let us regard this as something which could have very wide repercussions. If nobody is allowed to be a shareholder in any company at all which might, directly or indirectly, have contact with some other body, we shall get ourselves hopelessly tangled up.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why the chairman or a member of the Authority should be restricted in this way, any more than the Minister should be restricted. It is not a statutory provision, but it is generally accepted that a Minister shall not be a director of a company; he may, however, be a shareholder to any extent in as many companies as he likes.  In view of that, I see no reason why we should restrict the members of this Authority any more than we do a Minister.</P>

It never occurred to me to ask Deputy Hilliard of this House was he buying in to a company which would have contractual relations with the Authority and was he moved to resist this amendment because he himself was in on the racket.  Maybe we are innocent, but we just still happen to believe on this side of the House that Ministers of the Government of this country do not do that kind of thing.  The peculiar part of it is that Deputy Booth does not think it would be anything very remarkable if they did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And they have a lesser moral standard?  If you accept office in an Irish Government you accept certain criteria of conduct.  Deputy Booth is himself a company director, as I am.  Deputy Booth says there are different criteria of conduct in mercantile circles.  If a man is a director of several companies and something arises in one of them, he simply says: &ldquo;Well, boys, I am a director of another company, have notice of that.&rdquo;  That is all right If his co-directors accept that as a convenient arrangement, that is their business.  There is no involvement of standards in public life or public employment.  Let us not close our eyes to the fact that we always demand from the public servants of this country a far higher standard of rectitude than is demanded from the servants of mercantile companies. Public servants have to be much more circumspect and who should know that better than Deputy Booth who is a member of long experience of the Committee of Public Accounts? Who should know better than Deputy Booth the reason for all the meticulous accounting, the reason for the annual review in which a public servant can be questioned about every detail of anything for which his Department is responsible.  We in Ireland expect our public service to maintain a very high standard of conduct which shall be open to the closest examination at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because this is a new Authority.  Deputy Booth says himself that a variety of activities are accepted as being consistent with correct commercial practice that Deputy Booth would not think of as suitable in a public servant or a Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, here is a new situation where a new Authority is being established and apparently there is some ambiguity as to what is thought the minimum standard.  We seek to lay that down.  We admit it is a high standard, but it is not an unprecedented standard.  The section we are proposing to confirm in this Bill is taken verbatim from the 1927 E.S.B. Act.  That standard has been in operation here for the past 33 years and nobody has found it intolerable, but it is a high standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any form of public activity in which we should require a higher standard than in the control of radio and television?  What is the use? Deputy Booth apparently has not been listening to this debate.  Mr. Eamonn Andrews' name has been referred to as the person whom, the Minister has said, it is his intention to appoint Chairman of this Authority.  It has been said by Deputy Cosgrave, by Deputy Sweetman and by myself that, so far as our information goes, Mr. Andrews is a man of the highest possible standing, both professionally and personally.  We are not concerned to suggest for a moment that Mr. Eamonn Andrews is in any respect a corrupt or undesirable person.  On the contrary, such as our information is, it all tends to the conclusion that <Col N="1855" /> he is a man of the highest character and of high distinction in the profession to which he belongs.  But we are legislating for the permanent existence of this Authority.  We have got to legislate, not only for to-day, but for tomorrow and, we hope, for all time.</P>
    <P>We are not only legislation for that restricted purpose.  In so far as this amendment is concerned, we are seeking to retain in our public life the standard commonly described as &ldquo;a conflict of interests&rdquo; and to ensure that that conflict will not be permitted in our society.  I think that is a good standard.  I want to recall to Deputy Booth and others that in 1898 we in this country were faced with the duty of taking over local government from the old Grand Juries and that, due to that, the Local Government Act, 1898, was passed.  It was provided in that Act that there must be no conflict of interest and it prescribed that any person elected to a local authority under that Act must have no contractual agreements with the authority of which he was a member.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of humble people up and down this country at the instance of our national leaders at that time accepted membership of those bodies. They gave up trifling contracts for the supply of milk, vegetables, meat and other commodities to these local authorities.  They gave up employment that they used to enjoy under the Grand Juries so that as Nationalists, they could participate in the taking over of the public control of local government in this country.  The fact that they had to make sacrifices was in those days considered an inordinate privilege; they felt they were doing it as part of their patriotic duty.  That is the standard we set for our people at that time.  It was the standard set for people in very modest circumstances but they accepted it and lived up to it.  All we are asking for is that in respect of the nine persons to be appointed to this Authority the same standard should apply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has put the case very forcibly.  Can you imagine a situation <Col N="1856" /> in which the Authority is deliberating under the guidance of the chair and the question of a contract to supply the material to be broadcast or televised by the Authority comes up.  The chairman rises from his seat and says: &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, I have an interest in this contract and I propose to withdraw. Let you finish your deliberations upon it.&rdquo;  Those deliberations go on for an hour or an hour and a half and then somebody goes out and says to the chairman: &ldquo;Come on back.&rdquo; Can you seriously picture the situation that then arises when the secretary of the Authority turns to the chairman and says: &ldquo;Your bid was too high and in any case they thought your stuff was tripe.&rdquo;  They had given the contract to somebody else and the chairman says: &ldquo;Well, boys, let us go on to the next business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does anybody in this House consider that to be a realistic situation? Does anybody in this House think that is a situation we ought to create?  Does anybody in this House think this Authority ought to be deprived of the right to say in respect of any contract submitted to it: &ldquo;We think the price too high; we think the material offered is tripe?&rdquo;  I think they ought to be perfectly free to say that in respect of any offer made to them, but does anybody in this House seriously believe they would be perfectly free to say that if the offer were made by, or on behalf of the chairman?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Booth envisages an excess of courage, the fruits of which are to tell the chairman his prices are too high or his product is tripe.  I do not know whether Deputy Booth would normally make that his practice.  I know that when I had the pleasure of sitting with him on the Committee of Public Accounts, when I was his chairman, I would have been gravely shocked if he had addressed me in any such terms.  We had differences, not infrequently, and I think we <Col N="1857" /> always managed to get over them without difficulty, but I would have been very much astonished and would have found myself in a state of considerable difficulty, even in so exalted an atmosphere as the Committee of Public Accounts, if it were suggested by Deputy Booth or other members of the committee that my procedure in that committee, or in connection with its proceedings, reflected little credit upon me as a member of Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a parallel at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to make the parallel if the chairman proposes a contract to the Authority of which he is chairman which, in the judgment of his eight colleagues is excessive in price and unsatisfactory in quality, then the consequences of a difference of that character between the members of the Authority and the chairman create a situation which is quite impossible, and I cannot imagine Deputy Booth thinking it desirable that we should promote the possibility of such a situation arising.  Surely the sensible thing to do is to provide that no member of the Authority will be engaged in the business, and will therefore be able to approach all matters from an objective viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not the slightest objection to the Authority hiring any professional adviser it wants and, if there is any individual without whose expert and technological advice the Authority feel they cannot get on, there is nothing to prevent them giving him a fee and getting his advice on whatever they want.  If an individual has business interests of this kind and feels he wants to accept the position of chairman, there is nothing on God's earth to prevent him divesting himself of his business interests in this field, but I have the utmost sympathy with the man who says: &ldquo;I would be prepared to occupy the post of chairman but I am not prepared to divest myself of my business interests.&rdquo;  I think none the less of him if that is his decision, but I do not think we should create a situation in which, with those interests, he becomes chairman of the Authority and we formally <Col N="1858" /> declare that the whole principle of conflict of interests is now to be abandoned for all time.</P>
    <P>If we do abandon that principle now in this Bill it will be quoted as a precedent for future proposals of this character, and I think the standards of conduct in this country will have suffered a very material loss.  We are seeking here to defend a principle and I believe there are a great many Deputies on the opposite side of the House who desire to see that principle observed.  It is perfectly certain that if we abandon it in connection with this Bill it is only a matter of time until it is jettisoned generally in this country, and the day that happens I think we will all live to regret it.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dr. Browne who says that if you cleave to a principle any departure from it must, in itself, be admitted to be an abandonment of the principle.  To me that is an irrational approach.  We are living in an impractical world.  We have certain principles to which we adhere as closely as it is humanly possible to do but, if some superior interest demands that temporarily and in a very restricted sphere we have to depart from that principle, only a fool would recoil from his duty if the necessity were sufficiently manifest.  I need not go beyond the obvious parallel that we all subscribe to the principle of <i>habeas corpus</i> but there can arise a national emergency in which only a fool would suffer the institutions of State to be struck down because the State had not the flexibility or wisdom to meet a particular situation by suspending <i>habeas corpus</i>, until the necessity for that suspension had passed and then restore it at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>If it were certain and inescapable that you could not constitute the television Authority in this country without abandoning this principle, then I would be prepared to agree, if that were certainly demonstrably so, we would have to consider expressly suspending that principle for this purpose, but does anybody seriously argue at the moment that you cannot get nine men and women in the country, or outside it, to constitute a television <Col N="1859" /> Authority without employing someone who is engaged in television or its programme supply business?  I cannot imagine any rational Deputy making that assertion and, unless we are prepared to make that argument that there are not in the whole of Ireland, or outside it, nine men and women who will constitute a satisfactory television or radio Authority without including somebody who is actually engaged in the supplying of material, I think we should hold sacrosanct what has been a very precious principle in the public life and general administration of this country.  If we do not we will bitterly regret it.</P>
    <P>The general tone of this discussion should bring home to the mind of the Minister the very genuine anxiety that exists in respect of this matter, and I think the Minister would do something wise and useful if he were prepared to say now, that in view of the volume of opinion which has been mobolised to sustain the maintenance of this principle in connection with this business, he is prepared to accept what this amendment suggests as being appropriate for those aspiring to be members of this Authority.</P>

      <P>What I have to say can be put into very few words.  I would have hoped that consideration of a matter like this could have been divorced, at least in people's minds, from any particular personalities and I would have hoped the Minister would have given more consideration to this amendment than he appears to have given.  To my mind the correct parallel in this case is C.I.E., though I admit to considerable differences there.  For C.I.E. it was thought proper that because the Chairman of a public company was there to represent the public's interests he should not have a financial interest, even in that concern, and from that point of view I would have thought that would have been considered very desirable, and that it should have been quite clear that the members of this Authority were there representing the public's interests, having no other possible outside interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> I do not want to labour that point. To me it seems to be relatively self-evident and I would have thought the Minister's approach to this amendment would have been that he thought there was something in it, and that he would be prepared to consider introducing something to the Bill in the Seanad on the same lines, if he did not like the particular wording of the amendment itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I had forgotten that we are now an advisory authority. Then, I think the Minister should have been prepared to have said, if he did not like the wording of this, that he would accept the principle and bring in an amendment with his own words here.  That could be done by way of additional amendment on Report.  If necessary, delay could have operated in the implementation of this Stage.</P>
      <P>There is one other aspect of the problem to which I want to refer. I would have thought that in the interests of the members of the Authority themselves they should be put in the position desired by this amendment.  I think I know my fellow countrymen well enough to know that we have an awful habit of saying, &ldquo;<i>Qui bono</i>?&rdquo;  We are always looking for something in the background. If a television programme were being broadcast and this amendment is not accepted somebody who does not like the programme will say, &ldquo;I know why that is on.&rdquo;  Without really knowing anything, people would be prepared to start a rumour that somebody on the Authority is interested in that programme and that that is why it is on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought it most desirable from the point of view of the members of the Authority themselves that it should be made clear to everyone that they had no financial interest in the material that was appearing on either radio or television. It would be very reassuring to the public to know that the people who were directing the production of programmes on radio and television had <Col N="1861" /> no financial interest and could have no financial interest in the programmes.</P>
    <P>I could well imagine the situation arising where it would be stated that, notwithstanding the possibility that they could have a financial interest, in fact they had not.  The next story would be that their aunt or uncle or cousin or somebody had such an interest.  One can always find a basis for rumour.</P>
    <P>I would very seriously suggest to the Minister that he should take second thoughts about this amendment and, if he does not like the particular wording, that he will at least abandon the Bill at this stage until he takes another look at it, and see if some amendment on these lines could be brought in which would suit his Department better.  Failing that, I think the House should pass this amendment and make sure that the people who are going to run these programmes in future are clearly, in the minds of everyone in the country, not interested financially in the programmes they put on.</P>

      <P>I, like Deputy Sheldon, propose being brief and, like Deputy Sheldon also, I would have thought that the merits of the principle that this amendment is trying to uphold are self-evident. Certainly, I find it extremely frustrating that the Minister and the Government should adopt the attitude which they have adopted in face of what is obviously a reasonable and reasoned approach from this side of the House to an amendment which enshrines a principle which has been accepted in this State. certainly since 1927.  I concede to the Minister that there has been some departure in legislation since the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, in one way or another, but I do seriously suggest to him that the basic principle involved here has never been seriously departed from by the Legislature until the Broadcasting Authority Bill was introduced by the present Minister and the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that what Deputy Sheldon and other Deputies said in <Col N="1862" /> support of this amendment is quite true, and it is probably true in other countries as much as it is here.  I am quite willing to place on record my own confidence in the proposed management of this Authority, and the person whose name has been mentioned as chairman but, no matter what confidence I or anybody else in this House may have in him or in his board, undoubtedly there will be those who will suggest that there is something wrong in the administration of the board in the programmes that are shown, because of his connection with another company dealing in television and broadcasting entertainment.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister is doing any service whatever either to the Broadcasting Authority or to the gentleman whose name has been mentioned by adopting the attitude he has adopted in relation to this amendment.  I believe that the majority of Deputies, if the matter were left to a free vote, untrammelled by Party Whips, would carry this amendment or any other amendment which the Minister himself would like to propose which would preserve the principle enshrined in this amendment, and I am equally certain that the majority of the people outside this House want to see that principle upheld and preserved.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable that the Government, no matter what their majority inside the House is, should concede the value of the principle enshrined in the amendment and should agree that the approach to the Minister and to the Government in this matter has been a reasonable one which should be met by them.  I do not believe it is any answer to the arguments, which have been put up by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Sheldon, Deputy Cosgrave and the others, simply to count heads in the division lobby.  By adopting that attitude the Minister is doing a disservice to the authority which he seeks to establish, and a disservice to the gentleman whose name has been mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I do not accept Deputy Booth's contention that all men are honourable. Let him speak for himself.  I <Col N="1863" /> pay him that compliment.  Let us speak for ourselves.  The reports of the Courts do not suggest that all men are honourable.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice include punishments in legislation for offences against the legislation.  The law does not suggest that all men are honourable.  There is no suggestion that the men who will be appointed will not be trustworthy, but we cannot say that they are.  Deputy Dillon pointed out the case of Lloyd George and the Marconi shares.  We have &ldquo;Jimmy Thomas's&rdquo; tipping off people about Budgets.  One can mention a thousand honourable men &mdash;honourable before they were found out.</P>
      <P>The function of the Church is to keep us upright.  If the Church were not there, we might not be so upright.  In matters of this sort there should be checks to guarantee that we remain upright.  It is not good legislative policy to pass a Bill and to take a chance on the basis that all men are honourable.  Let us not bring the present Government or personalities into the issue, but let there be no suggestion that all men are honourable.  That is not the case.</P>
      <P>In my view the amendment in the name of Deputy Palmer is reasonable. Everybody in this House has personal experience of public life.  People ask me to do things which I cannot do. They ask me to get them a house, and this and that.  Some of these people are alleged to be reputable people.  When I try to point out the regulations to them they are not concerned about regulations and suggest that I can do it.  Let us not forget human nature.  Let us not talk about honourable men.  All these honourable men will have friends and relations and parents.  A person may say to an outsider: &ldquo;Nothing doing.  The regulations are there.&rdquo;  He cannot say that to his pal or to his own kith and kin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the amendment as reasonable. This Authority cannot be compared with other statutory bodies.  This is a body which will be largely open <Col N="1864" /> to a good deal of lobbying from many quarters.  You are talking about nine honourable men.  It is my experience in relation to such appointments that while occasionally the outsider is appointed the vast majority are political henchmen.  Do not tell me that a political henchman will not try to do a favour for another political henchman.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to be personal.  I shall not mention any names.  I shall not mention Eamonn Andrew's name; at least I shall not say anything disparaging about him.  I believe the Minister is unwise and will probably regret what he says in the House when he gets hauled over the coals repeatedly by way of questions.  However, I think it would be wise for the Minister if he accepted this amendment.</P>

      <P>I regret that before I deal with the amendment itself I must refer again to a matter to which I referred yesterday.  On the Second Reading of this Bill I asked the Minister for particulars of the Acts in which there were precedents for the Section which he introduced as Section 8.  The Minister caused a letter to be written to me in reply.  I do not think there is any doubt that the letter is not a confidential letter.  I presume the Minister agrees that it was an official letter?</P>

      <P>The letter which the Minister caused to be written to me referred to Section 12 of the Turf Development Act.  I quote:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs... has directed me to say that they appear almost precisely in the same form in the following Acts, namely, the Turf Development Act, 1946 (Section 12); the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952 (paragraph 6 of the First Schedule); Gaeltacht Industries Act, 1957 (Section 12); Export Promotion Act, 1959 (Section 9).</P>
      <P>Somewhat similar provisions appear in the Electricity Supply Act, 1927 (Section 10) and in the Transport Act, 1950 (Section 7, subsection (6) paragraph (c)).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1865" /> When I got that letter I accepted, as I always would accept, the Minister's word.  I regret that it was necessary for me to tell the House yesterday&mdash; the Minister is aware that I must ascribe the letter to him&mdash;that that was not a straightforward letter.  The fact was that though a provision somewhat on the same lines was included in Section 10 of the Electricity Supply Act, there was another Section, Section 11, which required members of the E.S.B. to sell and to dispose of their interest.  I regret the Minister's letter saw fit not to refer to that.</P>
    <P>I regretted that yesterday and I intended to leave it there as something that had been done by mistake and regrettably done by mistake.  It so happened that I remembered that a person, on being appointed to the E.S.B., had had to resign his membership of an electrical undertaking.  That was why I did not take the Minister's word entirely and searched the Electricity Supply Act.  I regret to state now that not merely is the Minister's letter misleading in relation to the Act of 1957 but that it is also grossly misleading in relation to the Transport Act of 1950.  I regret that it is necessary for me to describe the Minister's letter in those terms but there are no other terms open to me.  It is surely a misuse of Ministerial position that when a Deputy asks for information in this House, as we all do no matter who is on these benches, and that information is given, that there should be suppression as well as indication.  The Minister's letter said: &ldquo;Somewhat similar provisions appear in the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, and in the Transport Act, 1950 (Section 7, Subsection (6), Paragraph (c)).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely a person is not able to read paragraph (c) without also reading paragraph (a) and (b), particularly when they appear on the same page and when they appear immediately above paragraph (c), Paragraph (c), the one to which I was referred, reads:</P>
    <P>It shall be the duty of a member of the Board who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in any contract made or proposed to be made by the Board <Col N="1866" /> to disclose the nature of his interest...</P>
    <P>I agree that is a somewhat similar provision to that of Section 8 of the Bill but Paragraph (a) which appears fifteen lines above it, reads:</P>
    <P>A member of the Board shall, within six months after his appointment, sell or otherwise dispose of any securities which he may hold for his own benefit, whether in his own name or in that of some other person, in any company carrying on a transport undertaking in the State and any transport stock which he may so hold, and it shall not be lawful for a member of the Board to purchase for his own benefit any securities in any such company or any transport stock.</P>
    <P>Does anybody believe that it was straightforward to refer me to paragraph (c) of that section as being a precedent for section 8 of this Bill and not to refer at the same time to paragraph (a) which contains that direction, that a member of the Board of C.I.E. must dispose of his stock in any transport undertaking?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is Deputy Booth's idea of something that is straightforward, it is not mine.  When I was asked officially, as I was asked many times when I had the honour of being in the Government, to refer Deputies on this side to certain Acts to which Governments must refer them, I always took pains to see that they were referred to the whole of the Act in question and not to an excerpt that is taken without reference to the other paragraphs that appear before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything more about that except that I am sorry for the Minister because of the predicament in which he has been placed.  Having being placed in that predicament he would be wise, as one of the ways of making amends, to accept this amendment.  I do not propose to refer very much to the other matters that were raised in this <Col N="1867" /> debate.  There can be little doubt that in two Acts this type of clause, that a person must sell his interest, that a person cannot serve two masters, was included in 1927 and 1950.</P>
    <P>I have not checked the other Acts but the other Acts were 1946, 1952, 1957 and 1959.  Everyone knows perfectly well who was in office in those four years just as everyone knows also who was in office in 1927 and in 1950. Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Dillon referred to the position that would arise when a contract came up in which the chairman was interested&mdash; that he was going to leave the room. I believe he would, as an honourable person, possibly do that.  I do not think he should be put in that position. But even that was not the precedent that the Minister took because there is the precedent for providing that when a member of a board is interested in a contract he should get up and leave the room, that he should not be present while the discussion is taking place.  I think it is in the Sea Fisheries Act of 1952, one of the Acts to which I have referred.  The Minister <Col N="1868" /> did not take that precedent.  No; he took the even worse precedent that the person concerned could stay but could not take part in the discussion.  It would be interesting to see the cross-chat with the chairman sitting there as a dummy and people discussing his programme, the cost of his programme and the sort of programme it was, in his presence.</P>
    <P>There is no case whatever for the section as it is.  There is every case for this amendment.  I believe that there are many honourable Deputies on the other side of the House who know perfectly well that this is what should be done.  I regret that they are not in the position of being able to vote for its implementation.  I do not think it would be fair to attack the Minister for the outrageous implication contained in Deputy Booth's statement.  I feel that I can quite safely leave Deputy Booth to the Minister in another place because I know he feels at the moment: &ldquo;Heaven preserve me from my friends.&rdquo;</P>

If I believed him to have done it intentionally, I would say so without hesitation. I am bound to add that I <Col N="1872" /> honestly believe the Minister did not intend to mislead the House, but I am further bound to say that I consider it amounts to carelessness, calling for censure, when in the first case the Minister refers to a section in the Electricity Supply Act, 1927&mdash;Section 10&mdash;without drawing the attention of the House to Section 11.  Section 10, read alone, would seem to support the case the Minister sought to make against the amendment submitted by us but when read in the context of Section 11 of the 1927 Act, it became quite manifest that the 1927 E.S.B. Act strongly supported the case we were making to the House in defence of our amendment.</P>
    <P>That having being brought to the attention of the House the Minister then had recourse to the Transport Act, 1950, and he went so far as to lay special emphasis on the fact that those of us&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Sweetman and I who were members of the Government responsible for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, the Minister did not rush into the fray to correct Deputy de Valera in making the point that we were members of the Government responsible for the Transport Act of 1950.  That carried such weight with Deputy Dr. Browne that he arose and beat his breast and said, <i>&ldquo;Peccavi</i>&rdquo;.  I, being a more seasoned operator, declined to beat my breast or to say: &ldquo;<i>mea culpa</i>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>Peccavi</i>&rdquo;, and the events justified my attitude in that respect, because so shrewd an <Col N="1873" /> operator as Deputy Sweetman hastened to the Library and got the Act only to discover that in the Act in Section 7 (6a) is the very provision we sought to insert&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a very wide ruling.  I am demurring to what is in the Bill.  I am demurring to the presence in the Bill of a provision which is in conflict with every similar provision in every similar Act enacted by this House in the past.  I think I am entitled to say that if I make this extremely moderate protest against two successive attempts to mislead the House, albeit made unintentionally by the Minister, that I am entitled to complain of a gross lack of care in bringing relevant facts to the attention to the House when, in fact, extracts from other Acts were submitted to us and the really relevant sections of these Acts were suppressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I only hope that the Minister will seek to repair what I am bound to describe as an unseemly performance by making some gesture in the Seanad.  Mark you, inasmuch as this has to go back for further consideration to the Seanad we can suggest to the Minister that he should take certain steps in that Assembly.  I suggest to him that between now and his return to the Seanad he should, in view of the legislative precedent that we have brought to his notice, ask the Seanad to restore what he is seeking to tear down.  I think it is true to say that if the Bill passes in the form in which it now is, we shall have, for the first time in our legislative history, by statute torn down the principle so far <Col N="1874" /> maintained, that conflict of interests shall not be permitted in any public authority established by Act of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is a very grave thing to do and so far no case has been made to justify doing it.</P>
    <P>The only case so far made is that it has been done before and that if it has been done before, it is not unreasonable to do it again.  I think we have pretty effectively established that it has not been done before and that we are doing it now for the first time.  I think it is utterly wrong and that this House will bitterly regret if they do it now.  We exhort the Minister at this, the eleventh hour, to refrain from a most undesirable legislative action.</P>
    <P>I think he will have reasonable grounds whether this project is ultimately a success or not&mdash;and I share some of Deputy Russell's apprehension&mdash;to take some legitimate pride in at least having his name associated with this first venture in the direction of television, but I do not think that he will have any reason at all to be proud of being the Minister responsible for defending the proposition, in which I do not believe he personally believes, that the principle in relation to conflict of interests should be authoritatively abandoned in this country.  It is a dispensation with which I should not like to have my name associated and I am not without hope that a similar sentiment will ultimately influence the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing rather briefly with this matter last week, I mentioned two things which I thought were of extreme importance to the ultimate consideration and application of this Bill.  They were enforceability and uniformity.  If this generally enabling amendment in the name of Deputy Dillon and myself is not accepted a blow is being dealt at the principle of uniformity which, I think, is desired by all sides of this House and by everybody in the country.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that there is a vast number of six-day licences in other parts of the country, I must primarily confine myself to the part I know best and speak of the large number of such licences, <i>vis-a-vis</i> seven-day licences, in County Mayo where there are 418 six-day licences all of them, without exception, being family businesses.  As Deputy Dillon has pointed out, if this amendment is not accepted, these places will be shut down on Sundays for all purposes, whether they are mixed trading or not. That certainly lacks any attempt at achieving uniformity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of enforceability where you have a large proportion of <Col N="1876" /> six-day licences in a town or village, and they are all closed&mdash;and there are one or two places to my knowledge where there are only one or two pubs and both are on six-day licences&mdash;what will be the position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of a case where there are only three six-day licences in a village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that that village has a complete alcoholic blackout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Their customers will be diverted to the near-by town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, their customers will be diverted.  They will not be there any other day of the week either and the family business will fade away.  It will then be possible for the people who manage to survive to buy them and to convert the six-day licence into a seven-day licence.  I do not think that the purchase of another six-day licence in any other part of the country will work out.  You are depressing the value of one set of property as against the value of another.  You are putting people into a position to buy other people out, and that is a principle that should not be accepted.</P>
      <P>I know of one case where an advertisement has been inserted in the four daily papers already offering a six-day licence for sale.  That was over six weeks ago and so far there has been no reply.  In other words, the six-day people who might sell are waiting the passage of this Bill through the House so that they can know their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another argument put forward&mdash;that there are in this country upwards of 4,000 dormant seven-day licences.  Suppose that we revive the whole 4,000 of these licences, we only require 1,300 or 1,400 of them to meet the existing number of six-day licences.  What will happen to the 2,700 seven-day licences that will not be required?  There is no reality in an application to the Courts to revive them for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this Bill.  The ordinary application to the Court for the revival of a licence, or for a new <Col N="1877" /> licence is a simple one.  You must have suitable premises, the character of the applicant must not be brought into question and there must be need for the provision of facilities.</P>
    <P>I am told that there is now a procedure going on where there is an application for a licence in respect of premises in which a totally different type of business is being carried on at the moment.  The premises are not suitable for the carrying on of a licensed trade for which the application is being made.  It was more or less suggested in Court that this dormant licence was being revived in this case, not for the carrying on of the trade in those premises, but for the subsequent transfer of that licence to another house in another town.  That is making a mockery of the existing licensing law for a start.  While it might be done in one court area, there is no guarantee that it will be done in another court area.</P>

That would get rid of all this codology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;anything that will not destroy the livelihood of 418 families in County Mayo will be acceptable to me.  Let us come back now for a moment to the history of these six-day licences.  It is well known that the granting of these licences in certain areas depended in those days on the attitude taken by the presiding magistrate towards drink. Secondly, if the people who sought these six-day licences in those days could have anticipated legislation of this kind, the effect of which would be to shut their doors and open their neighbours' doors, they would never have opted for these licences and would never have been satisfied with them.</P>
      <P>This is a simple section which we want incorporated in the Bill.  If Deputy Flanagan would do something along the lines he has suggested&mdash;I cannot speak for Deputy Dillon in his absence&mdash;I would certainly be prepared to meet any suggestion in a reasonable way.  I do not think the situation will be met adequately, fairly or justly by reviving dormant licences or by the purchase of a six-day licence anywhere else.  That is all too insecure.  I should not like to think that my livelihood was dependent upon the outcome of circumstances which, as we know, are on occasion very volatile indeed and on the exercise of a discretion on the part of those empowered to grant licences, such discretion not being uniform, as it cannot be, having regard to human fallibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corish have made most of the arguments that can be advanced in support of these people.  If the Government do not give some facility to these people to become seven-day licences, without having to enter into the market in a cut-throat business or making fraudulent applications to revive dormant seven-day licences, they will not succeed in enforcing this legislation. Take the town in which there is a <Col N="1879" /> preponderance of six-day licences. There is one town in which there are upwards of 50 such licences and less than ten seven-day licences.  If 5,000 people attend a football match in that town the Minister for Justice will have, I think, to accept from me straight away that the only alternative open to the Gardaí would be to retire into the station and watch television.  There would be no chance of enforcing the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be fair to ask them?  Would it be fair to put that strain on them?  That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be fair. By and large, I do not see that the Government have any real answer to the plea made on behalf of these people.  It is true that these six-day licences did not make any very strong vocal effort before the Commission. I think they let it go by default, with the exception of the people in the town of Ballinasloe.  Obviously they were under the erroneous impression that they need not bother because nothing as inequitable as this would ever be contemplated by either the Commission or the Government.  I appeal now for reason to be applied to rural conditions.  I appeal for an acceptance and an understanding of rural conditions.  I ask that the livelihood of those concerned will not be put in jeopardy by deliberate unreasoned legislation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to expand on some of the points made by Deputy Lindsay.  At the moment it is open to an applicant to try to revive a licence which existed in 1902.  The law lays down certain requirements as to character, suitability of premises, etc., all of which the applicant must prove to the satisfaction of the court before his application is granted.  It is true, as Deputy Lindsay has pointed out, that in one or two instances applications have been leniently dealt with. It is nonsense, however, to predicate the future on these instances and it is only sensible to assume that the law as it stands will be properly applied if <Col N="1880" /> similar applications are made in future. The fact is that there are a number of lapsed licences which would be useful during the two-year period in which this procedure will be followed. Those lapsed licences would be useful if the amendments in the name of the Government, and no better amendments from the point of view of the six-day licensee, are going to become the law.  In other words, a useful amendment would be if we were to say that it would be sufficient for the applicant to tell the Court that he was the holder of an existing six-day licence and his application to have another licence revived was merely for the purpose of having that licence transferred to his existing premises in order to create a seven-day licence therein.</P>
      <P>I have, in practice, come across a situation where a prospective purchaser has been afraid to go ahead because he did not know whether or not his application would be successful. Indeed, on a strict interpretation of the law, he would have to assume that his application would be unsuccessful. I am talking now of the person who has a six-day licence and who has made a bargain with the owner of a premises in which there used to be, depending on its location, a seven-day licence and who wants to transfer that licence, when revived, to his premises in order to make a seven-day licence for himself.  I have not touched upon the position of a person who has a butchery, a bakery or some place in which to make candlesticks and in which there was a licence ten, fifteen, twenty or forty years ago, and who wishes to have that revived so that he can transfer it in the open market to someone who wants it in order to convert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be going too far if we were to alter the existing law in such a way as to re-create a licence merely to make it an asset for a person whose premises have ceased to be a public house and who is, in fact, carrying on business of an entirely different kind.  But I do think it would not be too far to go to leave it open to the applicant to prove that he is the holder of an existing 6-day licence and that his application <Col N="1881" /> for the renewal or revival of an old licence is being made solely for the purpose of converting his existing 6-day licence into a 7-day licence.</P>
    <P>That does not mean that I personally would be satisfied with that alone.  I believe that the Government should give very serious consideration to accepting the amendment down in the names of Deputies Dillon and Lindsay.  Originally, it was thought, and word was spread about, that the Government would introduce certain less stringent measures so far as the 6-day people were concerned.  It was thought that these would be adequate.  I regret to have to say that experience has proved otherwise.  I do not care who says there are 4,000 redundant 7-day licences in this country.  If there are, they are not for sale and they never will be.  They are family heirlooms or something of that kind, but they are not for sale.  When I say that, I speak, not merely from my own investigations and knowledge, but from conversations with distinguished business men and others who know this trade and the people involved in it inside out.</P>
    <P>I was not here when this debate opened last week, but I read through the statements made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Lindsay.  It appeared to me, from an interjection made by the Minister for Justice, that he does not now accept that this Bill, as it stands, is conferring a benefit on the 7-day licence holders and not conferring one on the 6-day licence holders. It absolutely astonishes me to think that the Minister does not yet accept that in the country the <i>bona fide</i> trade, as such, has scarcely any impact whatsoever on the trade of the public houses in the small towns of Ireland. If the Minister for Justice says that, surely the Minister for Lands, who is associated with this Bill, will not say so?</P>
    <P>Is it still seriously suggested that people travel from town A to town B to keep within the law and drink in a 7-day house there?  Anyone who says that is talking through his hat. The plain fact is that the customers of the public houses are, and always <Col N="1882" /> have been, drawn from a radius of three miles of the town.  A handful, perhaps, on any given Sunday might be within the law by being in a seven-day public house and living more than three miles away.  But I say a handful only and, in fact, in practice all down the years there was no difference whatsoever between the man who was drinking in a six-day public house and a seven-day public house on a Sunday.  They were each equally breaking the law.  The effect of the provisions of this Bill will be to put an end to that situation as far as the seven-day licences are concerned, but not so far as the six-day licences are concerned.</P>
    <P>I know all the arguments that have been advanced (a) about the number of licences, which is purely notional and (b), which is more important, about the cost of these licences to the six-day public houses.  I should like to ask a simple question.  Is it fair to ask these people to part with a couple of hundred pounds when you are not asking their seven-day neighbours to part with anything, the seven-day neighbour having paid something like one-seventh more by way of duty, one-seventh of £6 or £7?  The thing is ludicrous, the more so when, as Deputy Lindsay pointed out&mdash; although I think it is not historically true, certainly not as far as my area is concerned&mdash;that many of these people, in the first instance, had no choice whatever and were given six-day licences because the Resident Magistrate had an objection in principle to drinking on Sunday.</P>
    <P>It does seem rather unusual that the whole of Roscommon has something like 62 or 63 six-day licences whereof 56 are in the town of Ballaghaderreen and Ballaghaderreen was not in Roscommon at that time.  Therefore, there were only six six-day licences in the then County of Roscommon.  That is the sort of proportion which to me would appear to be reasonable if the applicants were applying from choice, but a proportion such as exists in East Mayo&mdash;as it then was, and as some of us would still like it to be&mdash;in Charlestown, Ballyhaunis and Ballaghaderreen, a proportion of something like <Col N="1883" /> 60 or 70 six-day licences to seven, eight, or ten seven-day licences, is something utterly unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay pointed out there were certain villages where there were no seven-day licences at all.  I am not certain about it but I think that in the parish in which I was born, Aughamore, there are three six-day licences and no seven-day licences.  It was formerly part of the parish of Knock. It is six miles or so distant from Knock.  Obviously, what will happen if this Bill is passed, if it is passed in its present form or even with the amendments which the Government have suggested, is that the Aughamore people will travel to Knock where they can drink in comfort and within the law.  But they will be turned out of their village public house where they and their people before them have been going down the years.  I think the prejudice against the six-day licences in high places and low is no credit to those who have had it.</P>
    <P>Other arguments have been advanced from time to time.  Let me say that I have nothing at all against the holders of seven-day licences.  I do not want to do any injustice to them.  Most of them with whom I have discussed this matter, apart from some of those who have spent a lot of money over the last few years on purchasing seven-day licences, most of them who are not in that position, readily agree that it would not be fair that they should be given an advantage and that their neighbours should not. I can only say that those who spent a lot of money over the years, particularly in recent years, in buying these licences, were in the same position as the six-day people who did not appear before the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Party to which I belong gave careful consideration to <Col N="1884" /> the subject matter of this Bill.  They took into consideration what happened in other countries when a solution to a similar problem as that before this House was investigated, and they noted that a great deal of controversy and much discussion had taken place amongst the public on the reasons for and against adoption of the solution to the problem.  It is only natural that in dealing with a subject such as dental decay and the causes thereof, and in seeking prevention of it, the ordinary public have to depend to a great extent on the advice and experience of specialists in that field.</P>
      <P>They have to seek, and possibly accept, the views of scientists, doctors and dentists.  To add to the confusion, on reading through the mass of evidence and information relating to the problem in other countries, we find that not even the experts were all quite agreed between themselves.  Some took one view and others the opposite side.  When one adds to that the fact that a great number of individuals and many societies and organisations disputed the right of the various Governments to carry out fluoridation of water on ethical grounds, it is not surprising that the members of my Party found great difficulty in coming to a unanimous decision on the rights and wrongs of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Having discussed it carefully, as I stated at the outset, they have decided that each individual Deputy comprising the Party is entitled by right to assess for himself, having read the information and evidence that is available to him, what he believes is in the best interests of his constituency and of the country in general.  Therefore, any views I express are purely personal.  They relate to my own belief and are not binding on any other member of my Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy T. F. O'Higgins, the former Minister for Health, agree last night with the present Minister that he believed from the evidence available that treatment of water supplies would be beneficial to the arrest of dental decay.  The only point of difference between himself and the Minister, at least as I <Col N="1885" /> understood it, arose on the grounds that he thought that the legislation going through this House now should be an enabling Bill that would give to local authorities, if they so decided, the right to treat the water supplies in their respective jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I would think that the very same reason as caused the Labour Party to decide to give to each individual member his right to consider this problem for himself, does away with the suggestion of leaving to individual local authorities the right as to whether or not to introduce this desirable treatment of water.  I have a very great respect for local authorities and for the fact that they quite rightly represent public opinion in their areas.  I think it is always desirable that their views on what is best for the areas in which they operate should be carefully considered, but I do believe, taking all things together, that it would be an impossible situation to expect members of local authorities to delve through and assess the value of the various decisions of commissions and evidence relating to this problem that is to be examined.</P>
    <P>I feel that when it would come to the final issue, the major factor on which local county councillors or members of local authorities would base their judgment would be that all-important one of the question of how much it was likely to cost, and how much it was likely to put on the local rates. That being so, I think it desirable for the Minister to legislate direct and, if believing as he does that the evidence is such as to satisfy him that it is in the national interests, he should do as he has done in introducing legislation making it compulsory on local authorities to operate this measure.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I approach this problem from an unusual point of view.  I have no fixation about the question of how ethical it is for a Government to introduce legislation, compelling people to do something in their own interests.  For far too long in this country we have given to Governments the right to legislate only in a negative manner.  I believe that not only should the Government restrain people from doing things that are injurious to themselves or others, but <Col N="1886" /> they should take positive action and, if necessary, use a certain degree of compulsion to make people carry out projects or avail themselves of schemes which, in the opinion of the Government, would tend to improve the health and physique of the people in general.</P>
    <P>In this country we accept quite calmly legislation of restraint in matters relating to morals, for instance, censorship of plays, films, books and of the various other media by which thought and ideas are conveyed. We accept without question restraint in relation to public order, a police force, legislation that deals with traffic control and various other things.  I cannot understand why we hesitate when it comes to a matter that is of the greatest importance to the health of the community in general.</P>
    <P>On reading through the reports of the various commissions that have dealt with this problem, both here and abroad, one cannot but be struck by the fact that advocates on one side claim enormous benefits for fluoridation of water and opponents claim that there is great danger in such treatment of water.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister dealt at length and very clearly with the benefits that he believes can be secured from the fluoridation of our public water supplies.  He dealt, perhaps, mildly or lightly with the claims made by opponents of fluoridation as to the dangers that might arise.</P>
    <P>In normal circumstances, were this Bill coming before the House without there being all the evidence that is now available, I would be suggesting to the Minister that the matter was of such importance that before asking the House to take any action in the matter or before he took any action, he should consider establishing an independent commission to investigate and report back to him.  That is not necessary in present circumstances. In 1947, a former Minister for Health set up a commission which after their investigations and, I am sure, careful consideration of all the evidence that they could secure both <Col N="1887" /> at home and abroad, came to the conclusion that it was desirable and was in the interest of public health as a prevention against further dental decay, particularly in young people, that public water supplies should be treated with fluorine in the proportion of one gallon to one million gallons.</P>
    <P>There is but a small number of points to be considered by a Deputy when endeavouring to make up his mind as to the correct way to view the problem before us.  One is, to ask himself whether or not there is urgent need for fluoridation of water.  In his opening speech the Minister made fairly clear the havoc that dental caries is causing.  I do not think that anyone interested in the subject will need any assertion by the Minister as to the widespread decay that there is in the teeth of the people of this country. Unfortunately, those of us who are fathers of families have witnessed in our children that dental decay starts at a very early age and that it is usual for them when they reach the stage of manhood or womanhood, to require dentures.</P>
    <P>In speaking of the condition of the teeth of the people the Minister referred to the fact that, according to the nutritional survey taken a number of years ago, the dietary intake of the people of Ireland compared favourably with that in the United States of America, where it is the highest in the world.  I do not wish to imply that that is not correct but I would point out that in that survey stress was laid on the fact that the vast majority of our people existed mainly on bread and &ldquo;spread&rdquo;.  Whether that is true or not, I think it can be accepted that the diet of the ordinary public does not appear to have any great bearing on dental decay, apart from the fact that certain matters such as powdered sugar of various kinds, white bread and other foods may to some extent advance dental decay.  That being so, it is reasonable to assume that the cause of early dental decay lies in the lack of some element in the water supplies rather than in something contained in the food the people eat.  It must be clear that whatever the remedy is, it is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> The second point is whether this treated water would prove a remedy. All the evidence available before the various commissions and all the evidence from the experts who dealt with this matter indicate to me that the vast majority are completely satisfied that water suitably treated with fluorine can prove not a cure but a prevention of dental decay.  In many countries over a period of 12 years or so, experiments have been carried out and records taken and the result definitely suggests that, to say the least of it, this solution to the problem deserves a trial.</P>
    <P>The third question I would suggest a Deputy should ask himself is: could the treatment be carried out effectively? All I would say on that point is that those who are against this method of treatment have not suggested any other treatment that would be even half as effective.  It is true they suggested that each individual should be equipped with the necessary methods of treating either the water he drank or his dentures.  However, as the Minister indicated in his opening statement and as the evidence of the various commissions indicates, this has the weakness that it depends on the individual to carry out that treatment and would defeat itself</P>
    <P>Piped water, while not serving the whole country will cover an ever-increasing area within the next few years.  It is the easiest and the cheapest method of making available to the public the benefits of fluoridated water.  I would impress upon the Minister the great need of connecting schools compulsorily to whatever water supply is available for them. Unfortunately, in the past due to one reason and another long delays have elapsed between the time when water supplies were available to schools and the time when those supplies were connected.  The dangers of the continued use of untreated water justify the Minister in paying special attention to that fact.</P>
    <P>There is one matter with which I regret the Minister did not deal as clearly as he might and that is the question of cost.  The Commission that dealt with the matter estimate the cost <Col N="1889" /> at something between 3½d. and 7d. per head a year.  I mention this because in the Bill the Minister has seen fit to make this a compulsory measure with which, as I have said, I am in complete agreement.  However, paragraph 3 of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill says:</P>
    <P>A sanitary authority's expenditure on fluoridation (including loan charges on money borrowed to provide equipment) will be recouped by the health authority.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The health authorities' expenditure will, in turn, be recoupable to the extent of one half of the Health Services Grant, subject to the usual rule for the exclusion of capital expenditure and loan charges.</P>
    <P>As this is a compulsory measure and as the local authorities are not to be permitted to decide whether they should enforce it or not, it is only reasonable that any capital outlay should be recoupable in the same way as the expenses in respect of the health services are recouped each year.  I am aware that the Minister is guided by the fact that the local authorities will in time save on dental charges what they will probably lose in administering this scheme and in providing the machinery to carry it out.  However, I still think it would be desirable in order to secure the cooperation, the good will and the support of local authorities if the Minister made it as cheap as possible on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is not only my belief in the advantages of this Bill that has caused me to speak here this evening but also the belief that it is my public duty to support the Bill in its entirety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Kyne, I cannot welcome this Bill because I do not believe in compelling local authorities to use fluorine in public water supplies.  I believe other and better corrective measures could be used for the prevention of dental decay.  We all know that our fathers and grandfathers carried their teeth to the grave before fluorine was ever heard of.  I think the best corrective methods to take would be to advise <Col N="1890" /> school children of the proper food to take.  I mentioned this question at a meeting in Cork of our health authorities. I inquired if the dentists gave instruction to children in the schools on the treatment of their teeth and I was informed that no such instructions were given, but that the teeth were simply pulled out according as they rotted.  I believe prevention is better than cure but I think that if children were properly advised in their young days on the treatment of their teeth, the cleanliness of their teeth and the proper food to eat there would be far less dental decay at present.</P>
      <P>I feel it is all a result of the increasing standard of living&mdash;too many dainties, too much sweet food, too many sweets and too many sweet cakes.  It is all as a result of this intake of sweet foods that we have dental decay in our children and they are not properly advised on the quality of food which they should consume for the building up of bone and muscle. They are gone altogether for those sweet, dainty classes of food which are doing a tremendous amount of harm and it would be far better for the community and more economical for the State and for the local authorities if the children in the schools were advised on the quality of the food they should eat than that huge sums of money should be expended on adding fluorine to water.  It will provide a good job for chemists and other sections who will be supplying this fluorine, I suppose, but I think the whole thing will be a waste of money and the rates are high enough at present without adding to the strain on the ratepayers for this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with tooth decay, that in many cases it is largely hereditary.  In such cases it is difficult indeed to prevent it and I doubt very much if the adding of fluorine will prevent it, where it is hereditary.  For that reason, I cannot welcome this Bill because I believe that the money spent on this scheme of adding fluorine to water will be wasted: it will not have the desired effect.  I read in the papers that it has been turned down in many States in America as being injurious to the <Col N="1891" /> health of the people and I doubt if we have sufficient evidence before us at this time to pass such legislation compelling the local authorities to include this fluorine in the water, whether it is their wish to do so or not.</P>
    <P>If we have enabling legislation and leave it to the discretion of the local authority itself to decide the matter for its own local area, I would not object, but to compel them to do this in this legislation, whether they like it or not, I think, is unfair and unjust and something about which we should be very careful.  For that reason, I am opposing the Bill in what I consider the best interests of the people and of the children.  I am a father myself but I always advise my own children on the food they should eat, and if the people would eat more brown bread and drink more milk, there would be less dental decay and they would carry their teeth to the grave as their forefathers did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I am not in agreement with a great deal of what the Minister said, I think the House should be grateful to him for having made such a long and comprehensive statement covering effectively every facet of dental disease and decay.  No doubt he has studied the matter very closely and it is a subject to which the Custom House has given a great deal of attention.  I am completely in agreement with the opinion expressed here yesterday evening by Deputy O'Higgins that if one is to attempt to deal with this situation by the fluoridation of water, the legislation to that effect should be enabling and not mandatory legislation.</P>
      <P>In the long statement the Minister made, he based a good deal of his arguments on the experiments in prophylactics in regard to dental caries carried out in New Zealand and it is interesting to note, and I repeat this in the House, although it was stated last night by Deputy O'Higgins, that in the findings in this Report, which is a very full report and deals with everything else, on page 151 it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1892" /> The decision to fluoridate public water supplies should be left to the community concern.</P>
    <P>I think that is absolutely crystal clear. In New Zealand, one of the countries perhaps where they have more dental caries than the average, they have specifically stated that in their report, and no doubt have framed their legislation on an enabling basis.  That is a fact of which the Minister should take cognisance.</P>
    <P>Also in the Report of our own fluorine consultants who reported some two years ago it is stated in No. 41, page 15:</P>
    <P>The Council is in doubt as to whether the local authorities have the necessary statutory authority to add fluorine to public water supplies.</P>
    <P>It recommends the introduction of any legislation as may be necessary to enable local authorities to discharge this function.  That makes it clear that our own Commission sitting here had it in mind that any action taken on this should be a matter for the authority concerned and that it should not be made mandatory on them.</P>
    <P>I come then to the Minister's statement which he read yesterday evening. He says:</P>
    <P>But does the fluoridation of public water supplies in fact violate individual rights?  It is highly germane to the argument to point out that the public water supplies do not belong to the individual; they belong to the community.</P>
    <P>Such rights as the individual may possess or enjoy in them, arise from his membership of the community with which his lot is joined.  As an individual he has no right of veto over the decisions of the community, though of course he has the right to dissent from them.</P>
    <P>The water supply, I respectfully submit to the House, belongs to the local authority.  The &ldquo;community&rdquo; in this case is being given a direction by the Minister in legislation introduced into Dáil Éireann.  In other words, I think <Col N="1893" /> in that statement it is rather contradictory to decide that the community have no rights at all, that they may object to the thing but at the same time, if it is imposed on them, they must accept it.  That rather savours to me of bureaucracy.  Personally, I do not think we could accept that point of view.  I have read this statement to show the House that I believe the Minister in this legislation intends to make it mandatory and I object to that.</P>
    <P>I give the Minister credit for having studied this matter very closely but there is no doubt that as he read his statement and as I listened to it last night, it is the sort of speech one would expect in reply to a debate rather than in opening a debate.  All the way through, the Minister is arguing that fluoridation will do no harm.  Over 50 per cent. of his speech was on those lines.  When I come to our own report, I find the same thing.  The general trend expressed right through it is one of explaining all the time that this proposal will not do any harm.</P>
    <P>What do we propose to do?  If we pass this Bill in its entirety as it now stands&mdash;I have no doubt that we shall because the Government have a substantial majority and any Bill they bring in will, in the main, go through unchanged&mdash;we make it mandatory on local authorities to fluoridate the water.  The object in doing that, according to the protagonists, is greatly to improve the dental health of the community.  I do not propose to refute that entirely but, from the numerous reports I have read, I do not think the majority of people who have been concerned with this over the years have sufficient knowledge to show that fluoridation brings all the benefits it is supposed to bring.  Neither is there sufficient evidence to show that it is not of some considerable benefit.  If we are to fluoridate water in Ireland, if it is to be mandatory on local authorities to do so, the most optimistic result in any reports I have been able to read in newspapers or otherwise, reports from Sweden, New Zealand and other places, is that in the lower age group, that is, from six <Col N="1894" /> to seven&mdash;I think that was the first group the Minister mentioned&mdash;the results are about 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to this.  We are passing mandatory legislation to fluoridate the water and the benefits are to accrue to 50 per cent. of those who drink the water, but at the same time our own report&mdash;I think it is in the Minister's statement also but I speak subject to correction there&mdash;says that less than 50 per cent. of our people drink piped water.  So this legislation that claims so much in regard to improving the dental health of the community is to have an impact on 25 per cent. of the people.  That is my assessment of the situation worked out from the facts I have just given the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is claimed by anybody that there is any definite cure or even that there is any definite prophylactic against dental caries.  I think it is claimed that the effect of fluoridating the water is to delay dental caries and, as far as I can read in any literature I have been able to get on the subject, it delays caries for only a matter of a few years.  If we come to the other age groups, we find that the results are not as good; the preventive results are not as high as 50 per cent. When you go up the age scale, the number that seem to benefit comes down considerably.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to this.  If fluoridation will postpone, as I believe it will, the onset of dental caries where it is effective, it will really put the child into an older age group at the time when it may expect the onset of dental caries.  If you succeed in preventing children getting dental caries in the lower age groups, that is, up to the age of 16 years, and suppose it is unnecessary to treat the children for dental caries until they are beyond the age of 16, they are then far more out of parental control and it is therefore less likely that when dental caries comes, it will be attended to.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that there is no cure for dental caries.  That may be true, but there is a cure to this extent, that if the child or adult is treated in <Col N="1895" /> time at the very early onset of the caries&mdash;which is a small break in the outside protection of the tooth&mdash;it can be cured and arrested.  As a matter of fact, people who have had teeth stopped, as I have had, in their early teens, have found that these teeth are still as good as ever and they have never had to go back to the dentist. The picture painted here yesterday by the Minister rather suggested that the teeth of the community were tending to rot away, that we were facing something that was having a disabling effect on the community as a whole.  I agree that dental caries is something we should get rid of if we can&mdash;that is most desirable&mdash;but I do not think it can be justly claimed that dental caries itself is such a serious thing that you must impose a mandatory system on the general public.  Nobody could subscribe to that.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the ethical question, the age-old argument as to whether people have a sovereign right or not. In other words, do parents have the right to decide what their children take in the line of medication or is the State to decide that?  Without going into the different answers to that question&mdash;either a parent has the right or he has not the right.  I maintain that he has the right, and that fluoridation of water is imposing a medication into the potable piped water of this country and whether parents like it or not, their children will have to take it.</P>
    <P>If the matter were left to the local authority, it is one of these cases in which you would have wide representation, far wider representation than in a Parliamentary institution. Just to take my own county, there are five Deputies in Wexford and 21 members on the county council.  Is it too much to ask the Minister to leave it to the county council with the wider representation of people coming from all areas so that if a matter comes up for consideration and discussion, the people can see their local representative and discuss it with him?  There are 21 people in my county to put the point of view and it is better to have these 21 people rather than five.  They are <Col N="1896" /> living in the immediate district in all cases and it will be easier to see them and to put the point of view in relation to this matter.  For that reason, I think the Minister should take another look at Section 2.  He would find a reasonable measure of support in the House if he did so, but naturally it would be with some reservation.</P>
    <P>It is quite likely that there are other dangers besides this matter of fluorine in the water.  I think it is the tendency, with better standards of living, more money available, with children getting a bigger allowance of money than they did in their father's and grandfather's time, for them to be able to buy things dangerous to them from the dental point of view.  In my opinion, the worst thing for children's teeth are biscuits. They are even worse than sweets and nowadays, in the buses and along the roads, there is hardly a country district in Ireland where you will not see a child eating a biscuit.  These are some of the things largely responsible for dental caries here.  If the Department wants to deal with matters such as that, it would be a far better approach to have courses of instructions and lectures about them, about the things that should and should not be eaten by children.</P>
    <P>However, we do not seem to do the things that are important to our health in that way here.  We seem to be for ever asking for something in which a parental state will take charge of the lives and habits of our people.  I have referred to this matter before in this House and I feel that I must refer to it again here.</P>
    <P>Several societies have issued statements with regard to the addition of fluorine to water supplies as is intended in this legislation.  They have issued statements in which they suggest that it is injurious to the body. I am not inclined to agree with a number of these statements.  I am not inclined to agree, from my knowledge of the matter, that it may have an injurious effect on the kidneys.  It is also suggested that it may have an injurious effect on pregnant women. But I do think that one effect it is <Col N="1897" /> likely to have is the hardening of bone or the laying down of new bone.</P>
    <P>The laying down of new bone is a condition that takes place in rheumatoid arthritis and I feel that we have to consider the possibility of whether, over a long period, the introduction of the fluorine into the system may not have that effect on individuals. While you might be taking care of dental caries in our younger people, you might be building up rheumatic troubles in our older people.  Certain Deputies may get up and say that is wrong.  When dealing with a matter like rheumatism, one must realise that it takes place over a long period. Fluorine has been increasingly used only over the past seven or eight years and would it not be a terrible thought that we made it mandatory on the Irish people to drink fluorine in water thereby building up further troubles for them in the matter of rheumatism? There is no need for me to draw the attention of this House to the fact that this country is the seat of rheumatism, due to our damp climate.</P>
    <P>Having said quite a lot about this Bill and the dangers that may arise from it, I should like to say that there is one good thing in it, that is, Section 6, which lays down that it will be the duty of each health authority to carry out a dental survey.  To my surprise, and I must congratulate the Custom House on this, I find that Section 2 reads that nothing in that section shall be construed as an obligation on any person to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible for examination.  There is hope for the officials of the Custom House when they can appreciate the fact that the individual has some rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular reason for intervening in this debate.  I received from the urban council of Tipperary a letter asking me to vote against this Bill for two or three reasons.  When replying to that letter, I told them that I intended to vote for the Bill and I gave my reasons.  The three reasons they gave for objecting to the Bill were the introduction of a poisonous substance <Col N="1898" /> into water, the question of unmeasured doses, and that it was compulsory medicine.  I wrote to them that I was informed that the quantity of fluorine would be in the nature of one-hundredth of a grain in a pint of water.  Even at present there is about half that quantity in the water we are drinking and on the question of unmeasured doses, I pointed out that the person who would drink a couple of pints of water in a day would be doing well and that the maximum amount of fluorine he would be taking would be one-fiftieth of a grain.</P>
      <P>We have had compulsory medicine for the past one hundred or more years.  One of the developments that was of the greatest possible benefit to the country was very bitterly opposed up to the second decade of this century.  I refer to smallpox vaccination which was compulsory up to a short time ago and which was objected to in Deputy Esmonde's county in a very strenuous way, despite the fact that all the medical men in county Wexford were strongly in favour of compulsory vaccination.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Esmonde, are asking the Minister not to make this mandatory on local bodies.  If the measure is worth while at all, then it should be mandatory.  If it is to be condemned, then we should not pass the Bill.  If, however, the House passes the Bill for the benefit of the health of our people ultimately, then every public water supply in the country should be compelled to fluoridise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the number of councillors they have in county Wexford, and the number of Deputies.  He suggested that it is they who should decide whether or not county Wexford should fluoridise the water supply.  A number of public bodies probably share the water supply in county Wexford and it would be rather difficult if Wexford town, for example, wanted to fluoridise the water supply and people in other areas using the same supply did not want to fluoridise.  If this is to be useful at all, I can see no point in preventing people having the benefit of <Col N="1899" /> it.  I am satisfied from the advice that the Minister has had that it will be beneficial.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, I do not think we are doing anything wrong in making it possible for those who want to use the public water supply to do so.  It must be remembered that many people have their own water supplies and it will not, therefore, be necessary for them to use this water, if they object to fluoridation.  I understand the water will be tested to find out the fluorine content at the moment and, if it is deficient, that deficiency will be made good to the extent of one part per million.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied with this Bill. Before I sit down, I should like to give the Minister notice of the fact that Tipperary Urban Council wrote to me and asked me to vote against the Bill.  I replied and said I believed the Bill would be for the benefit of the people and I would vote for it.  I want the Minister to be aware of the wishes of the Tipperary Urban Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have grave doubts as to the wisdom of the Minister and the Government asking for the passage of this Bill in its present form.  Like Deputy Esmonde, I think it is due to the Minister to express a measure of appreciation of the care he took and the detail into which he went in presenting his case.  Again, like Deputy Esmonde, I was impressed by the fact that the Minister seemed to feel that he was coming into the House not just to urge acceptance of a non-contentious measure, which had a really sound and widespread case behind it, but rather in the atmosphere of one defending the case he proposed making to the House.  Unfortunately, I missed hearing the Minister's statement because of a certain amount of accidental shuffling which went on yesterday. What I have read of it impressed me for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to refer to certain portions of the Minister's statement later. At this stage, I shall content myself with commenting on the fact that the Minister's presentation of his case <Col N="1900" /> appeared to be rather that of one who was on the defensive.  I am not in a position to assess in any authoritative way the pros and cons, but I do not know whether or not it was necessary for the Minister to be on the defensive in presenting this idea of fluoridation of water.  I believe there is need for caution.  I believe that what is being urged from this side of the House and what seems to be implied&mdash;it is rather more explicit than that, though&mdash;in the report of the Fluorine Consultative Council should be accepted by the Minister, namely, instead of coming to the House with a mandatory Bill, as the Minister has done, he should come with enabling legislation, a permissive Bill enabling local authorities to fluoridise water supplies, if they decide that it is proper to do so.</P>
    <P>The Fluorine Consultative Council expressed a doubt as to whether local authorities have that power under existing legislation.  For the reasons which they gave in their report, they felt legislation should be enacted to enable local authorities to inject fluorine into water supplies, if they thought it desirable.  I think the Minister knows, and I pay the Minister the compliment of supposing that the various delays in introducing this legislation were due to the fact that the Minister was well aware, that there were two sides to this question.  The Minister delayed presenting the Bill, I assume, because he wanted to check as far as he possibly could personally the pros and cons.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to be an authority but I met a deputation who are interested in this problem of pure water supply.  I listened to the arguments they advanced.  I was very impressed. These people were not just a collection of cranks riding a hobbyhorse. They were a group of sensible citizens who had done a vast amount of research and had gone to endless trouble to present a true picture of the position as they saw it.  They were only too anxious to give the benefits of their research and their views to anyone interested in them.</P>
    <P>From the study I have been able to put into the matter, the position <Col N="1901" /> as I see it is, as Deputy Kyne mentioned earlier, that this matter is one which has given rise to widespread controversy and left widespread controversy in its wake.  There was widespread controversy throughout the United States of America.  Some of the authorities there accepted the idea; others rejected it.  Some of those which had accepted the idea at one time subsequently rejected it.</P>
    <P>In England, I understand that the report of a body similar to the body set up here recommended the introduction of fluorine into water but recommended it on an experimental basis, that a number of authorities should be set aside, so to speak, as guinea pigs and that it should be tried out on them first before it became general.  I understand that the position in New Zealand, referred to by Deputy Esmonde, is that the legislation there is simply enabling or permissive legislation and that the various local authorities or what correspond to our health authorities here, take their decisions on the matter by means of popular referenda in the local authority areas.  I understand that the most recent referendum carried out there&mdash;I think it was in Auckland, although I am not certain &mdash;rejected this idea of introducing fluorine into water supplies fairly emphatically.</P>
    <P>I understand that in some of the European countries the weight of opinion was against introducing fluorine into water.  I believe that in Sweden the volume of opinion was against the idea.  I may be mistaken in that but certainly in some of the European countries where it has been considered, it has been turned down.  In at least one of them&mdash;I think it was Norway though I am not sure&mdash;the question was brought to the Supreme Court by objectors to it and the objectors were upheld in the courts.  Does the Minister wish to say something?</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's version of it.  I am not claiming I am accurate in that.  I know that in some countries it has been accepted and in others it has been rejected.  In some countries and some continents, you have it accepted in portion and rejected in others.  I am merely trying to recite the facts, as I believe them to be, in a broad way to make the point which I believe is a valid point, that this whole matter is at the moment the subject of lively controversy. It is not something that can be regarded as settled practice in any one country in the world.  There are those who support it and those who violently oppose it.</P>
      <P>Those who support it do so naturally on the grounds which were so well advanced here by the Minister when introducing this Bill, because of what they believe to be the beneficial results in dealing with the problem of dental decay.  I think it has been conceded that it is urged not as a cure for dental decay but as a preventative in certain age groups.  The feeling of those who support the idea of introducing fluorine into water supplies is to overcome a problem which is widespread in the world and which affects us here just as elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what is to be said in favour of it.  Those who support it will have their statistics to help in their arguments. Equally, there are a great number of people who oppose it and while there are supporters of the scheme on medical grounds, there are also those who oppose it on medical grounds.  There are various medical arguments advanced against it and there are also ethical arguments advanced against it.  I shall not go into&mdash;indeed I am not in a position to evaluate&mdash;the medical arguments either in favour or against the scheme, but I think it is only right that all of us in the House should recognise that there are medical arguments, both for and against, that there are those who say that while the introduction of fluorine in the water supplies will help <Col N="1903" /> to delay or prevent dental decay, there are those who say it will introduce what they call fluorosis or mottling of the teeth, that if the intake of fluorine by people is stepped up, you will have another problem on your hands.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Esmonde has already pointed out, there are those who argue that a stepping-up of the intake of fluorine will have an adverse effect on certain types of kidney disease, on people afflicted with rheumatism or rheumatoid diseases of one sort or another.  All those arguments are there.  I am not in a position to say whether they are strong arguments or not, but one of the points which can be made, and is made, against this idea is simply that no one is in a position yet to evaluate properly the advantage one way or the other, that the whole thing is still at an experimental stage, that no one can claim it is anything more than experimental and that it will take far longer than five, seven or ten years to establish positively one way or the other which way the merits lie.</P>
    <P>In that set of circumstances, it certainly does seem to me to be all wrong that we should, by legislative action, take a positive stand which makes it mandatory on local authorities to go in for this scheme, whether they like it or not.  In his references to the ethical argument, I think the Minister put up as fine a bit of special pleading as ever I heard or read.  The ethical argument, as I understand it, against this is that a person has a fundamental personal right to his bodily integrity, on the one hand and, secondly, that so far as we here are concerned, there are certain constitutional rights laid down for parents.</P>
    <P>The particular Articles in the Constitution, as I recollect them, which deal with personal rights, on the one hand, and parental rights, on the other hand, are Articles 40 and 41. The Minister, in dealing with that in his introductory speech, posed this question:</P>
    <P>But does the fluoridation of public water supplies in fact violate <Col N="1904" /> individual rights?  It is highly germane to the argument to point out that the public water supplies do not belong to the individual; they belong to the community.  Such rights as the individual may possess or enjoy in them arise from his membership of the community with which his lot is joined.  As an individual he has no right of veto over the decisions of the community...</P>
    <P>Will the Minister seriously claim that there is any decision of the community or of any community on this question of introducing fluorine into water?</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the Fluorine Consultative Council was established prior to the last General Election, but can the Minister or any other Deputy in the House honestly say that there was one election speech made in any part of the country about the question of fluoridation of water?  Was there any Party in the House who set out as part of their policy, even in the wildest scrawls produced in support of some of the supporters of the present Government, the fluoridation of water, or said that Fianna Fáil stood for the fluoridation of water supplies?  Was there any Deputy on this side of the House, or on the Labour or Independent benches, who included that as part of his policy during the last General Election?  I am quite certain that there was not a single Deputy mentioned it, or thought of it during that election.</P>
    <P>May I point out to the Minister that the community did not get an opportunity of giving a decision on this matter.  It is only specious pleading that the Government represents the community, and that they can make up the minds of the community on this matter and push a mandatory Bill through this House.  I do not think that is good enough.  We are now in the month of April and in a couple of months time there will be local elections throughout the country.  Surely the Minister could take the opportunity at these local elections of submitting this matter to the people?  Every local body in the country is to get an opportunity of changing its personnel in the month of June and, if the Minister and his <Col N="1905" /> Party feel this is a matter with which the community is vitally concerned, and I believe the Minister does believe that, why not submit it to the people in conjunction with the local elections and let the community take its own decision?</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde pointed out, if there is any question of ownership in the piped water supplies, they are in the ownership of the local authorities and consequently the local authorities, which are to be elected in the month of June this year, should have a say in this matter as to whether or not their water supplies are to be used in this particular manner.</P>
    <P>Later in his statement, referring again to the question of the ethical argument, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Moreover the individual living in a community has his duty to all his fellows.  He cannot deny them the right to protect themselves against disease.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to re-read that sentence.  Is the Minister suggesting that people who have put up reasonable arguments against this measure are denying the community the right to protect themselves against disease?  There is no question of that. No one is saying that you may not apply fluorine individually, that the individual should not be allowed to get it by individual treatment.  That is not being suggested.</P>
    <P>The argument put up is an objection to using the public water supplies to force people to take fluorine whether or not they want it, to force adults and children alike to take fluorine, whether or not the adults want it themselves, or whether or not they want it for their children.  It is no answer to a serious argument of that sort to put a gloss on it by advancing the argument that you are endeavouring to deny the community, or anyone in the community, the right to protect himself against disease. That is not in question.</P>
    <P>When we talk of disease in this context I think it is both relevant and necessary to point out that dental <Col N="1906" /> decay, which is the target we are aiming at here, is not in the same class as, say, tuberculosis or some other type of contagious or infectious disease. Dental decay, as I understand it, is not a communicable disease at all, and the fact that one person has it does not mean that another person is going to get it from him.  He is not a carrier of the disease in that sense; consequently it is not a question of making a community effort to wipe out a communicable disease which spreads from one person to another.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to advert to that fact because the Minister later in his statement said:</P>
    <P>And where that disease is so widespread that it constitutes a grave menace to the general health of the community he must, in charity and as a matter of social obligation, at least acquiesce in the steps which the community takes to protect itself against it.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment suggest that the Minister deliberately intended to mislead but that kind of statement certainly seems to create the impression that the Minister is talking about a disease which can be spread in the community from one person to another.  Let us get that out of our minds because that is not in question here.</P>
    <P>There are various other arguments which can be put up.  I am not going to emphasise them unduly because I feel quite certain that I am right in my belief that the reason the Minister delayed the introduction of this Bill is that he wanted to go into these arguments himself and weigh them up, one against the other.  I do not believe the Minister, no matter how agile or active his brain may be, is in a better position than any of the members of this House to judge on the merits of the case.  I do not believe the ordinary Deputy, or even the medical Deputy, is yet in a position to adjudicate on this question because, as I say, it is still only in an experimental stage.  That is principally the reason I think this House would be making a very grave mistake by making it mandatory on local authorities to use their water supplies in this way, and to make it obligatory on the <Col N="1907" /> person who wants to drink a sup of water to imbibe additional fluorine.  I understand from the Minister's reference, when Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde was speaking, that the cost involved will be something in the region of, I think, 3½d. to 7d. per head per person in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>That, I think, in Dublin would average out at something in the region of £10,000.  It is no small sum, and I have a recollection of another Minister for Health giving an estimate in connection with another measure in relation to health which in the event was not proved correct.  I would be very much afraid that the present Minister might be grossly underestimating, not intentionally, the cost of this scheme.</P>

    <Title>Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1959&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).  New Section.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>Before section 12 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  If, on the hearing of an application for the grant of a certificate entitling the applicant to receive a seven-day licence in respect of any premises, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Court that the applicant is at the date of the said application the holder of a six-day licence in respect of the said premises, it shall not be open to the Court to refuse the said application.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section, the District Court shall be the appropriate Court.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Dillon.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before progress was reported, I was dealing with the amendment by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Lindsay relative to the plight of the six day licensee.  There was one argument advanced, one indeed of very many arguments about this matter over the past few months, against the claims of the six-day owners.  That was the fact that under existing law an area exemption order confers no benefit on them but benefits the seven day licence holders alone.  That argument was used to prove that the seven-day men are now, and always have been, in a better position than the six-day owners.  It was used also to minimise the argument advanced by those of us who are in favour of the six-day men that this Bill is giving a benefit to one section and not to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I point out in that connection that in most small towns and probably in nearly all the villages in rural Ireland the number of area exemption orders obtained in the course of a period of five years is infinitesimal?  I cannot recall when an area exemption <Col N="1909" /> order was obtained in several towns in my own county.  Indeed, I cannot recall when there was a gathering within licensing hours of as many as 1,000 people in the towns I have named, apart from the occasional football match.  Therefore, the benefit these towns derive through area exemption orders are nugatory and the facts so prove.  That means that one is back again to the compelling argument that under existing law, drinking that is done on Sundays is, in the main, illegal, whether it is done in six-day or seven-day premises and that as a result of this Bill it will be made legal in seven-day premises alone.</P>
    <P>Another argument advanced against the representatives of the six-day holders' organisation for some time past was their failure to appear before the Commission.  The plain fact is that these men did not realise that their position would be affected at all.  Let us say that they did not concede that their position could be affected in the way the Bill as originally drafted would have affected it.  I would go as far as to say that those who lack sympathy with them because of their failure to appear before the Commission have changed their minds, have been forced by the facts to change their minds, that is, where they have examined the facts dispassionately and have kept their ears and eyes open.</P>
    <P>At one stage, I felt that the amendments that were to be introduced by the Minister might have met the claims of the six-day men but it soon became apparent that they would not and that the basic injustice remained.  The mere fact that these amendments were brought in as a result of representation is adequate proof that the framers of the Bill recognised that there was some form of injustice in the Bill as originally drafted.  If I say now that, even with the amendment, which, of course, I support, that basic injustice remains, I do so in no spirit of acrimony but from a profound conviction and from a fairly comprehensive personal examination of the situation in the west, the midlands and the south, but not the north of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I shall, therefore, conclude my remarks on the subject because I feel <Col N="1910" /> that no very useful purpose can now be served by going back over the whole argument in detail again and again.  I shall conclude then by saying that I believe injustice is being done in the name of justice and that if the object of this Bill is to give the people of Ireland a licensing law which will have their respect and which, therefore, will be enforceable, then in this section the Bill will fail.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay said that if there were 2,000 people in a town where there were three or four seven-day licensees and 50 or 60&mdash;or, for that matter, 20 or 30 six day licensees, the Guards might as well retire to the barracks.  I would add this much to what he said: Is it fair to ask the Guards to try to enforce a law that is so demonstrably unenforceable and so demonstrably unfair and is it fair to lay the Guards open to the opprobrium that will surely fall on them if they attempt to enforce a law which has not the consent of more than ten per cent. of the people?</P>
    <P>I believe that the case in favour of these men is no better now than it was when this Bill was drafted.  I know, and the House knows, that the Minister agreed to introduce certain amendments designed to ameliorate the injustice the Bill as originally drafted would have perpetrated.  I say out of deep conviction that the Ministerial amendment will not remove that injustice but will merely lessen it and that the only way in which it could fairly be met would be by the introduction of an amendment, if not exactly on the lines, very nearly on the lines of that we are discussing now.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already the position of applicants for licences should this amendment be defeated and the existing amendments go through.  It might be remembered that there is another section in this Bill under which a person who acquires two licences may, subject to certain provisions about suitability, and so on, set up a licensed premises in a country area.  That means that the available pool of licences will be plundered, not merely by the six-day holders but by their friends in the country in competition <Col N="1911" /> with them.  Therefore, whatever concessions are being given to the six-day men will likewise be available to men in competition with them, a kind of competition created by the provisions of the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>I am not saying, of course, that I have any objection to the provision about rural public houses; that is a completely different matter.  I am merely pointing out that under this Bill these people will have put up against them a form of competition which was not, to say the least of it, thought about when the Commission was conducting its deliberations.  At least in that respect the six-day men cannot be accused of hanging back but ultimately, whether they saw it or not, whether they came up to the Commission or not, the fact remains that if an injustice is being done to them it ought to be remedied.  It is not enough to say to a man: &ldquo;You saw what was coming or, if you did not, you ought to have seen it.&rdquo;  What is more important is that, whether he did or not, an injustice should not be done.  I can very well understand that view but perhaps the position was not sufficiently explained and I believe the amendment proves that it was not. I would appeal to the Minister to leave this matter to the House to decide for itself.  I am satisfied with this Bill as it stands except in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I should like to see changed but I am convinced that for very many reasons it cannot be changed.  However, I believe there is a question of justice involved here and that we might very well be allowed to express our convictions particularly those of us who feel them very deeply and would not express them if they did not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment or some variation of it should be accepted by the Minister.  If the Bill goes through in its present form, great injustice will be done to the six-day licensee.  It has been suggested that the Ministerial amendment makes it easier for the six-day man to purchase a seven-day licence which happens to <Col N="1912" /> be for sale.  I am speaking for a part of the country with which the Minister for Justice may not be as well acquainted as I and other Deputies from the West are.  There are many six-day licence holders who are barely making a living and who have not the £600 or £700 which, I understand, the seven-day licence commands on the public market.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister for Justice a long time.  Although he is on the opposite side of the House I cannot associate him in my mind with the kind of Minister who would stand over an injustice.  Perhaps the facts of the case have not been brought home to him but my view, and that of people who are familiar with this business in rural Ireland, is that this Bill will allow the seven-day licensed premises to crush out of business the six-day premises.  That is not an over-statement.</P>
      <P>The Minister may tell us that the six-day licensees were not vocal when the Commission was sitting.  That is understandable.  I do not think the six-day licensees ever visualised the effect of this legislation.  It is not easy for the ordinary person down the country, the farmer or business man, to foresee these things.  It is all very well for those in the legal profession who have that training to visualise the effect of legislation but I, and many others besides, never visualised that the Bill would have this effect.</P>
      <P>In most cases those six-day licensees have a grocery and hardware business. Many people in the country purchase groceries, hardware, necessaries for the house and farm on Sunday after Mass because it saves a journey perhaps of two or three miles.  This provision means that the six-day customers must go to the seven-day premises to make such purchases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister is taking a very necessary step in abolishing the <i>bona fide</i> trade but the Minister is re-establishing something pernicious and much more difficult for the Guards to deal with.  I am not saying one word against seven-day licensees. They must make their living as well as the six-day licensees.  Several <Col N="1913" /> Deputies have spoken of the injustice that will occur.  The Minister may think it a hard word to use but there is no other word for the situation which will arise if this provision is accepted.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the Minister objects to this amendment or my amendment following.  My amendment may be a little blunter in its wording but it has the same effect as this amendment.  Does the Minister visualise what will happen under this amendment?  The Guards will have to stand outside every six-day licensed premises to see that they do not open on Sundays.  Deputy Flanagan instanced the case of a town where the vast majority of the licensed premises are six-day premises with only two, three or four seven-day premises and suggested what would happen when there would be a huge crowd there on the occasion of a football match or some other gathering like that.  The Guards will be absolutely powerless and the six-day licensed premises will be just as full as ever before.  Their doors will be beaten down by people who are perhaps hungry and who cannot get refreshment.</P>
    <P>As a result of a question I put down on the 20th May last I know that two counties in particular, Mayo and Monaghan, were outstanding in the allocation of licences in the past.  Mayo has 418 six-day licences against 388 seven-day licences.  Monaghan is just about in the same proportion, 104 six-day licences against 66 seven-day licences.  In the town of Ballaghaderreen the count is 56 six-day licences against 4 seven-day licences.  I think I am not very far wrong when I say that these are the figures; at least these figures have been given to me.</P>
    <P>If the amendment were imposing a charge on the Exchequer or doing an injustice, I would be slow to back it, but in actual fact the Minister in this Bill is giving a free gift, so to speak, or giving liberty to the seven day licensed premises to open on Sundays.  Now the six-day man must close up completely on Sundays and cannot open his doors under any consideration.  I hold that that is a very serious injustice and that it will have the effect of crushing the <Col N="1914" /> six-day man out of business.  Over the whole country, there are 1,424 six day licensed premises against 10,561 seven day licensed premises and I cannot see why the Minister would not concede this point and make all of them equal.</P>
    <P>The Minister is abolishing one evil, a nasty evil&mdash;that is the <i>bona fide</i> traffic&mdash;and he is establishing a more serious one in my opinion.  I do not want to introduce a note of acrimony into the debate but I think that the suggestion of Deputy O.J. Flanagan that the matter be left to a free vote of the House was the best suggestion made since the debate on this amendment opened.  A majority of the House can scarcely be wrong.  The Minister's advisers may say that this cannot be done or that there are good reasons for opposing it.  The Minister is establishing something much worse and more sinister than the <i>bona fide</i> trade in my opinion, something the Guards cannot possibly control.  I would ask him to reconsider his whole attitude to this section.</P>

This is about the only section in the Bill with which I disagree and I think the amendment is one he should seriously consider. We heard many speeches from all sides of the House on the Second Reading, some in favour of the Bill and some against, but, with the exception of the Minister himself, we have not heard one speaker against this amendment, not a solitary speaker.  Not only have we had speakers from all sides of the House in favour of the amendment but we have now on our side in favour of this amendment those who were advocates of temperance.  We have them now lined up on our side.  I would ask the Minister to pay serious attention to that.</P>

      <P>I am referring to <Col N="1915" /> the last speaker, Deputy Blowick, who is proud of the fact that he is an advocate of temperance.  Yet he is in favour of the amendment.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter seriously.  First of all, he could try to find out why we had six day licences at all in this State.  My recollection of the law is this that up to the battle of the Boyne there was a &ldquo;free-for-all&rdquo; on Sunday; one could have a drink at any hour on Sunday.  That was the law.  Shortly after the battle of the Boyne, in the year 1695, an Act was passed compelling licenced premises to close during the hours of Divine Service.  That was the law as it stood. I think the Minister actually mentioned in his opening speech that in 1695 licenced premises were first compelled to close during the hour of Divine Service and that hour varied according to the place and the denomination of the Divine Service.  That continued, so far as my recollection of the law goes, with very slight amendments down to the year 1878.</P>

      <P>I do not know why the Deputy should mention Clontarf. I am giving him a little history of the law in so far as it relates to licensed premises.  That is the law on the statute books which I just checked within the past five minutes.  That is the law of 1695; I think it was in 1690 that we had the battle of the Boyne.  I am sure that some gentlemen here would be glad to remember that date.  The 1695 Act was the first Intoxicating Liquor Act I could find which prohibited the opening of licensed premises on Sunday. It confined the closing to the hour of Divine Service.  In 1878 an Act was introduced in the reign of her Majesty Queen Victoria which compelled licensed premises to close on Sunday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to treat this matter seriously.  There is no use in our going on record as speaking <Col N="1916" /> in favour of this amendment&mdash;because this amendment means quite a lot to the six-day licenced holders throughout the country&mdash;and trying to laugh it out of the House.  We are trying to be serious and to convince the Minister that the amendment is not put down in a frivolous manner.  It is not in any frivolous manner I speak to him.</P>
      <P>In 1878, by an Act of Victoria, all licensed premises were compelled to close on Sundays with the exception of those in certain cities.  The cities specified were Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Belfast.  With the exception of premises in those cities, all other licensed premises had to close on Sundays.  In or about that time we first heard of six-day licences.  Publicans were then, I think it was 1878, given for the first time the option when applying for a renewal of their licences to apply for six-day or seven-day licences.  In view of the fact that they could not open on Sunday in rural Ireland, to save the licence duty, many of them opted for a six-day licence. That was the first time we heard of six-day licences.  To save a few pounds of licence duty they opted for the six-day licence to save one-seventh of the licence fee.</P>
      <P>Another good reason for it was that if they retained the seven-day licence, the only person they could supply was a lodger in their own premises.  Then we had the 1902 Act which tied their hands completely.  Having opted earlier, they could not then go back to the original seven-day licence.  They had to retain whatever licence they had got, either the six-day or the seven-day licence.  We can understand why we found them with these six-day licences in 1902.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We broadened our outlook from 1902 onwards.  I think it was in 1906, in the reign of Edward VII that we went further.  We had not reached the stage where we would permit Sunday opening.  We compelled all publicans to close public houses, except in cities, at 10 o'clock on a Saturday night and to remain closed until Monday morning.  In those days, there was an advantage in <Col N="1917" /> opting for a six-day licence.  Then, as we got our freedom down here and enacted our own laws, we brought about the hours of trading on a Sunday.  We introduced the <i>bona fide</i> trade which permitted certain individuals to have a drink on seven-day licensed premises.  We immediately struck at the licensee who opted and was enticed to opt for a six-day license earlier, once we gave his colleague, the seven-day licensee, the right to serve a <i>bona fide</i> traveller.</P>
    <P>Now we are going further.  We are giving his next-door neighbour the right to remain open on a Sunday. We are extending his licence and at the same time we are giving no extension whatsoever to the unfortunate six-day licensee, his next-door neighbour. That is something that was never visualised.  It was never even thought of when the six-day licence was created.  Away back, when we created the six-day licence, the difference between it and the seven-day licence was something very nominal &mdash;an hour's trading on a Sunday. Now we are creating a very big gap between the six-day and seven-day licensees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan pointed out that certain villages in the West of Ireland have no seven-day licences whatsoever.  He mentioned that in one village there are three six-day licensees.  Now, we will compel people, to whom we are giving the right to have a drink on a Sunday, to go a distance to the nearest seven-day licensed house in order to exercise the right which we will confer on them by this Bill when it is enacted.  It is very unfair.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, if he cannot see his way to accept the amendment, to do what Deputy Seán Flanagan suggested, namely, to leave it to a free vote of the House.  On the Second Reading, most people advocated that it would benefit the tourist industry if we had extended hours on Sunday for the partaking of intoxicating liquor.  I agree with that.  However, why must we confine it to certain areas only?</P>
    <P>The most conservative observers of Intoxicating Liquor Acts was the Isle <Col N="1918" /> of Man.  One was not permitted to have a drink in any licensed premises in the Isle of Man on a Sunday.  They have stolen our thunder.  Yesterday, in one session only, the House of Keyes enacted legislation permitting the licensed premises to remain open on Sunday up to 10 p.m. during the holiday season.  They see the advantage from the tourist point of view of permitting people to have a drink on Sunday.</P>
    <P>Visitors to a place, be they anglers, such as they would be to the areas mentioned by Deputy Seán Flanagan or be they visitors to a seaside resort such as in Connemara, Kerry, Donegal or other places, would appreciate the extension of drinking facilities.  Why should we victimise one place or one licensee more than another?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do what Deputy Seán Flanagan asked&mdash;to leave it to a free vote of the House. Remember, we would never have heard of six-day licences if, when they were created, those publicans realised that some day we would enact legislation to leave it a free-for-all on Sundays for certain towns.  Those people would never have opted for six-day licences but would have retained their seven-day licences which, for the first time, in 1876, they had the chance of opting.  They were poor.  They were glad to save the one-seventh licence duty.  That is the sole reason why they opted.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment or, alternatively, to leave it to a free vote of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of that Commission.  I have to agree that the case for granting six-day licensees the same facilities as the seven-day licensees was never put properly.  Certainly that is true as far as I am concerned.  I was amazed when I met deputations of representatives of six-day licensees to hear of the repercussions that this legislation would have on them.  I will not use the word &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; but it appears to me to be most unfair.  They stated their case and, having listened to it to the best of my ability, I am of <Col N="1919" /> the opinion that it is most unfair to give one set of people a right, which they never had before&mdash;the right to sell drink on a Sunday to people in their own town and in the immediate neighbourhood&mdash;and to deny it to others.  They never had that right before in the country and now they are getting it.  That will have a very serious effect on the livelihood of a great number of people.</P>
      <P>I represent Roscommon.  I was not aware of the position in Ballaghaderreen until it was brought very forcibly before me by my constituents. I did not realise that some public houses could open legally on a Sunday and others could not.  People who had been in the habit of drinking in these six-day houses must now go to the 7-day licensee for their drink on a Sunday.  Those who know the country will have to agree with what has been said about illegal drinking on Sundays in six-day and seven-day licensed houses.  Everybody knows that was the case.  Now, it will be legal for one set of people, who never had the right before, if the Minister does not have another look at this matter and try to meet the situation.</P>
      <P>The new situation will mean that some people who had no licence to serve drink on Sunday to the people in the neighbourhood will now have the right to do so while others will not.  In my opinion, that is most unfair.  I was very interested indeed to listen to the history of the licensing laws from Deputy O'Donnell.  If I understood him correctly he said there was no <i>bona fide</i> trade in the early part of the century.  Was I right in that?</P>

      <P>Very great harm will be done to the six-day licensees. On the Second Reading, I expressed some doubts as to whether the Minister's proposals in a later part of the Bill would meet the situation.  I am afraid now they will not.  Some time ago, I met a deputation of six-day licensees.  One of them told us that he put an advertisement in the paper for a licence when he saw this proposal from the Government and he got only one answer.  The person wanted £800 for the extinction of one licence. As far as I remember, the man who wanted that was from Wexford.  It may be that, in a couple of years' time, these places may become extinct.  It may be for sale.  In the meantime, there will be a sort of cut-throat competition going on, with bad blood all round.  This whole problem should be looked at again.  I see no reason why the amendment now before the House or something like it ought not to be accepted.  The Government ought to give an indication that they are prepared to have another look at the situation.</P>
      <P>I had a Bill in 1943.  I accepted amendments because they were argued in such a convincing way.  I was told by some of my colleagues that I gave in.  I would not accuse the Minister, as others accused me, of giving in. He has a mind open enough to use Parliament for the purpose for which it was set up and listen to the case put forward and against.  If he is satisfied that a case was made for reexamining the whole thing, he ought to have another look at it and let us hear from him on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People like me and members of the Commission were not aware of the effect this would have.  I was one of those who signed the Majority Report. I hope Parliament will be treated as it ought to be treated, as a place where the case for and against a problem will be well considered.  If the Minister and the Government are satisfied that a re-examination can be made, they should carry out that re-examination and come in with a proposal that <Col N="1921" /> will at least mitigate the hardship that will surely be inflicted on a very big number of people in this country, particularly in my own constituency. Naturally, I am interested in this matter because of the number of these houses in my constituency, but I hope I am public-spirited enough, even if there were no such houses in my constituency, to speak against an injustice in any other part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was specifically framed to deal with the sale of intoxicating liquor, to forbid its abuse and to try to give reasonable freedom for its use.  Especially was it framed to curb abuses.  As far as the Bill has progressed in the House, we have dealt effectively with the major abuses.  I cannot understand how the Government can insist on including a section for which there is no need at all.  I thought that the major abuse was the <i>bona fide</i> public houses in the precincts of Dublin.  We have effectively dealt with that.  That trade will be abolished when the Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>Why then should the Government persist in including a section which will eventually cause financial hardship and distress to a certain section of the community?  The Minister and his Department ought to know the position.  I suppose the Minister for Lands should know.  The Minister for Justice must be completely out of touch with the real position in the rural areas if he does not realise that the six day licensee and the seven day licensee do business on a Sunday.  They do that illegally.  By cutting away this trade from the seven-day licensees, you will immediately curtail their incomes by one-seventh because they do as much business on Sunday as on a weekday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is realised all over the rural areas.  These breaches of the licensing laws take place not because of any viciousness or any love of lawbreaking, but rather because of custom and usage.  It has become a practice, especially in the rural areas, that locals are admitted to the seven-day licensed premises, thus breaking the law and whatever customers have been accustomed to going into the six-day <Col N="1922" /> licensed premises on weekdays are admitted on Sunday.</P>
    <P>Let us take the case of the six-day licensee and his customers.  The customer goes to the six-day licensed public house every day during the week, but on Sunday, if this section is incorporated in the Bill, he must have his drink in a seven-day licensed public house.  I am sure that when he goes there for one day of the week, he will not enjoy the drink on a Sunday because he is in a very embarrassing position.  The publican will not have seen him for the six days before that. Therefore, he will be not a little embarrassed to serve him and I am sure that embarrassment would eventually cause the person to desert the six-day licensee.  He will continue, therefore, to leave his trade in the seven-day public house.  Thus, the six-day licensee will eventually lose his trade altogether.  As most of these houses are family businesses, these people will have to close up.  That will cause them to emigrate because most of the owners of these houses have no other means of livelihood.  If they lose a certain amount of trade, they must close up.</P>
    <P>Outside the towns, in Mayo, anyway, there are several places where there is an isolated public house which usually has a six-day licence.  There are about ten of them all over Mayo.  I feel sure that the Minister for Lands realises that.  I have a list here given in answer to a Question showing those isolated places in Mayo&mdash;Partry, Newbrook and Coonard.  In my own parish, there is a public House which has a six-day licence.  It serves a big hinterland and is a fishing centre.  What will the people who frequent that public house do on Sunday?  They will have to go to Castlebar, three miles distant, to have a drink.  The cure will be worse than the disease.  There are very many instances of such premises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lindsay spoke about the enforceability of this new law.  How well the people of Mayo remember this word &ldquo;enforceability&rdquo; because for 70 years the law, as it now stands, was enforced rigidly in certain parts of Mayo.  What were the consequences? <Col N="1923" /> All over the whole area, you had a brooding air of resentment, disappointment and frustration.  You had non-co-operation with the Guards and a passive antagonism to all law at that time.</P>
    <P>When this law was rigidly enforced, you had the greatest number of unsolved crimes.  New Guards shunned the place just as they would shun a leper.  They would not come there and transfers were very frequent.  If we want to bring about a recurrence of these conditions, we shall include this section but if we do not, we shall accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>The laws we make here should be of the widest possible legal scope.  They should embrace everything.  They should be realistic and just, but I do not think there is anything realistic or just in a law which gives us freedom and at the same time, makes it legal for a man to have a drink in one public house at a certain hour on a certain day, while another licensee next door cannot serve a drink at the same hour of the same day.  If he is willing to pay for that concession he should get it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland said that the case for the six-day licensee was not presented in time, or was not presented to the Commission.  There was a necessity all right to present it to the Commission but it is now being presented here by Deputies from both sides of the House to the man who is the enforcing authority.  He can accept this amendment or reject it.  He has been asked by his own followers and by those on this side of the House to accept the amendment.  If he does not accept it it will not be passed because the Government side is the stronger side.  I appeal to him now to accept the amendment, or at least to give it a trial on a free vote of the House.  If he gives that concession, a free vote of the House, I am sure that the amendment will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Some licensing ghosts or bogeys have been invented in the course of this debate which I think must be laid if we are to get back to realities.  Before I deal with a number of them, however, I should like to place <Col N="1924" /> on record the effects of the amendment standing in the name of the Minister, in so far as it is relevant to the amendments now before the House.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, the existing law is that the person who holds both a six-day and a seven-day licence in the same or an adjoining district court district may have the seven-day licence transferred to the six-day premises. Very few people own two licensed premises and, in practice, this provision means that a six-day licensee must look around for a seven-day licensee who is willing to sell.  The procedure of transferring the licence is cumbersome as the law stands and can be costly since the licence cannot be transferred from the seller to the buyer unless there is a nominal sale of the seven-day premises.  Provision has to be made, of course, in the agreement drawn up that the seven-day premises will revert to the seller as soon as the licence is transferred to the six-day premises.</P>
      <P>As a first step towards facilitating six-day licensees, the Minister is going to simplify this procedure and provide that it will be sufficient for the six-day licensee to obtain the consent of the holder of the seven-day licence to have the seven-day licence extinguished.</P>
      <P>The second concession that the Minister is proposing under the amendment, No. 52, is that instead of having to acquire the seven-day licence in the same or an adjoining district court district, it will be sufficient to acquire one in any part of the State. As a third concession, to meet the six-day situation, the Minister is proposing that a six-day licensee should also be able to acquire a seven-day licence by extinguishing either one other six-day licence in the same district court area or two other six-day licences elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of these concessions, I think that at this point I need comment only on one, that which proposes that a six-day licensee may obtain a seven-day licence by extinguishing either one other six-day licence in the same district court area or two other six-day licenses elsewhere.  The House will be aware that the argument advanced on behalf of the six-day licensees is that <Col N="1925" /> with the provision for general Sunday opening, six-day licensees will be put out of business; that their licences will become valueless overnight.  I do not accept this argument but, even if there were something in it, the proposal the Minister is now making will go a very long way to meet it.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with the reasons if the Deputy is patient for a few minutes.  I want first to explain to the House, and put on record, the effect of the Ministerial amendment proposed for the express purpose of meeting the objections made by the Deputy and others on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's proposal under this amendment will allow each of these publicans the option of remaining as he is or of acquiring another licence and thus getting a seven-day licence or of selling his own six-day licence.  He has these three choices.  I think that perhaps it would be well that the House should realise at this stage the differential, which is and always was the law, between six and seven-day licensees.  Indeed the only one that really got down to this in its origin was Deputy O'Donnell when speaking to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies invented some fairy tale&mdash;I do not know where they got it&mdash;that this idea of a six-day licence has come down to us from the day when a land agent had charge and that if he did not like the appearance of the applicant he might give him a six-day licence.  Of course what Deputy O'Donnell said is quite true.  Under the Licensing Act of 1872 it was provided, in the case of an applicant for a new licence, or the transfer or renewal of a licence for the consumption of intoxicating liquor, that the applicant could ask the Court to insert a provision whereby he would be entitled to a reduction of one-seventh of the ordinary excise duty.  Therefore, the six-day <Col N="1926" /> licence was a creation, by choice, of the licensee himself.  That is something that seems to have been lost sight of in this debate.  It was not something imposed by anybody on him.  It was a money saving device.  I am quoting the Act under which it originated.</P>
    <P>The individual had the right in ease of himself, of his own outgoings, to have the licence reduced by one-seventh. That was the origin of the six-day licensee.  The individual who in those days wanted to retain the seven-day licence did so retain it.  Let Deputies not forget the fact that these seven-day licensees, and their predecessors in title down through the years, have been paying one-seventh more than their neighbours in six-day licensed premises.  It is not to-day or yesterday that this differential between the premises and their outgoings and what was paid by their occupants occurred.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to realise, when they talk about doing justice as between all people concerned in this business, that the seven-day licensees have in fact been paying, and their predecessors in title down through the years have been paying, one-seventh more in licence duty than the six-day licensees.  That differential was not the only differential because anybody who purchased seven-day licensed premises down through the years paid a higher price for these premises.  They paid a higher price for the seven-day premises because the seven-day premises could trade an extra day in the week, so far as the <i>bona fide</i> traffic was concerned.</P>
    <P>The people who acquired the seven-day licences, who purchased their premises themselves, or their predecessors in title, since 1872, in fact paid not alone the additional licence duty but paid a greater fine or purchase price for their premises.  The differentiation did not end there, because by virtue of the fact that his premises were a seven-day licensed premises, when the people came along from Ely Place to revalue and when the question of the valuation of his premises came up, he was valued on the basis of being a seven-day licensee.  That was a matter that was and had to be taken into consideration <Col N="1927" /> by the Circuit judge in assessing his new valuation; and on that valuation down through the years he has been valued more and therefore is paying more rates, being more highly rated than his six-day licensee neighbour.</P>
    <P>Every law since 1872 continued the differential between the seven-day and the six-day licensed premises.  When we had our area exemption orders, which special exemption orders were granted on Sundays for general opening because a large crowd was expected in some town for some event, that area exemption order could apply only to seven-day licensed premises.  The six-day licensee was not entitled ever to open all down through these years on Sunday.  He never had any exemption of any kind or the same facilities, the same rights, to operate on a Sunday as the seven-day licensee, and of course he had not to pay the outgoings or incur many of the expenses in the acquisition of his premises as the seven-day licensee had.</P>
    <P>All down through the years, the six-day licensees and their predecessors in title, so, had less to pay, had never in fact operated on a Sunday, and the differential was always maintained between the two types of premises.  Now let us be clear on this, that under the law under which the six-day licences were created, whereby the people then in occupation of seven-day licensed premises, by their own choice, got their licences restricted to six-day licences, there was no licence for the seventh day. The premises were completely delicensed on the seventh day, and the usual charges that lay against a seven-day licensee for trading after hours on a Sunday, did not apply to six-day licensees.  The charge against a six-day licensee who sold drink on a Sunday was a charge of shebeening. He was in exactly the same position as somebody who never had a licence but brought home a barrel of porter and started operations in his own carthouse.</P>
    <P>It seems that this position as between the two different types of <Col N="1928" /> licensees and their origin has been completely forgotten by Deputies to whom I have listened tonight.  Let us be clear on this: when we shed any tears about the poor widow in a six-day licensed premises, those tears might equally be shed for the poor widow in the seven-day licensed premises.  Let us also remember that as a result of this differentiation, an Irish Parliament gave power many years ago now, away back in 1927, to a six-day licensee to become a seven-day licensee by purchasing a seven-day licence and having it transferred to the six-day licensed premises.</P>
    <P>That provision was contained in the 1927 Licensing Act, as well as I can recollect, for the first time, to enable the six-day licensee to purchase a seven-day licence and have it transferred and to become a seven-day licensee; but the six-day licensee was restricted to his own immediate licensing area under that Act in getting a seven-day licence.  That was not, I understand, in the original 1927 Act as introduced in this House, but in the course of the discussion, that provision was inserted to enable the six-day licensee, if he so desired, to become a seven-day licensee by purchase in his own immediate licensing area.  What I want the House to appreciate is that the equity between the six and seven-day licensees was preserved by the House at that time under the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>Then in a later Act when the law was again being amended and this matter was again under discussion, this provision, I understand, was not included in the original Bill as introduced in the House, but again to deal with this situation, that was extended, and a provision was brought in enabling a six-day licensee who wanted to become a seven-day licensee to purchase a seven-day licensee not alone in the immediate vicinity, in his own licensing district, but in an adjoining licensing district.</P>
    <P>Down through these years, these sections have been operated, and progressive six-day licensees have gone into the market and have bought these seven-day licences <Col N="1929" /> and have had them transferred to their premises by their own efforts.  They considered that it was good business for them and they turned their six-day licensed premises into seven-day licensed premises.  They paid for the seven-day licences, and that operation had at least moved towards the objective which every licensing commission, and indeed everybody who has ever considered this matter, always had in mind, that is, to try to reduce, or to have a procedure that would tend to reduce, the number of licences.</P>
    <P>I think everybody in the country agrees, and particularly the trade itself, that there are far too many licences in the country, far more than are necessary, and every commission that has considered this matter had that aspect in view; so that when we come to consider this matter, I want the House to realise that in every Bill dealing with the licensing laws that has been introduced since the foundation of this State, this differential between six-day licensees and seven-day licensees has been clearly recognised and the equity of the seven-day licence has always been recognised and protected.</P>

The seven-day licensed premises were entitled by the law of the land to serve all people within the specified hours on Sunday, outside the three-mile radius of their location.  The seven-day licensees, as I have pointed out, were entitled to the benefits of area exemption orders when they were applied for a specific purpose in any area in this country and only seven-day licensed premises were entitled to these benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may know more than I do but the fact that I have had personal experience should not excite comment.  Let me point out that this matter between the six-day and seven-day licensees was considered by at least two Commissions and we must give these Commissions credit for being able to assess the situation just as well as anybody in this House.  This was a matter for their consideration.  As I understand it, they heard the evidence and the arguments pro and con and in both instances the Commissions preserved the equity of the seven-day licensees as against the six-day licensees.  They turned down the arguments&mdash;certainly they did not accede to them&mdash;which have been put in this House.</P>
      <P>I quote from the 1925 Commission which rejected the arguments which have been made here on this Bill for the conversion of six-day into seven-day licences:</P>
      <P>The bar licence should include the present publican's six-day and early closing licences and the beer retailer's &ldquo;on&rdquo; licence.  While we considered that from the point of view of simplicity it might be desirable to abolish those restricted licences and grant to the owners full bar licences, we felt that on the whole it would be unwise to increase the facilities for drinking and to enhance the value of such properties at the expense of neighbouring competitors.  We recommend accordingly that no extra privilege should be granted to the holders of the present early closing six-day and beer retailer's &ldquo;on&rdquo; licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that this Commission pointed to the fact that if they granted what the six-day people asked they would enhance the value of six-day premises at the expense of seven-day premises.  The Commission also had this question under consideration although I have listened to <Col N="1931" /> Deputy Boland saying that no case was made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true. The case was not adequately put to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it was adequately put or not we have this evidence at all events from this Commission that they considered it.  I am sure that the Commission were not people who came from the moon; they knew this country and the licensed trade as well as people in this House.  This is what the people on the 1957 Commission had to say:</P>
      <P>The provisions of the 1927 and 1943 Intoxicating Liquor Acts governing the transfer of a full licence from one premises to another were considered by us in connection with representations made on behalf of six-day and early-closing licence holders with a view to the removal of the restrictive trading conditions in their licences ; having regard to these provisions we are not prepared to make any recommendation in the matter.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear, therefore, that this Commission have given us practically all the recommendations before the House in this Bill.  Having duly considered the position of the six-day licensees <i>vis-a-vis</i> the seven-day licensees they decided in their wisdom that they were not prepared to make any recommendation on the matter. In other words, they recommended that the existing equity that was there from time immemorial for the seven-day licensees should be preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy would call it, but they say that having considered the matter they were not prepared to make any recommendation about the six-day licensees.  I think it must be apparent to anybody that this meant that having considered the matter they found no case for the six-day licensees to be put on the same basis as the seven-day licensees.</P>

      <P>The provisions made by the Minister to meet the case put forward for the six-day licensees have gone a tremendously long distance in my view to meet the arguments put on the Second Reading of this Bill. Let me make this clear.  This is the first time that in the case of sale or transfer a six-day licensee could possibly acquire the value that is given to him in the Bill.  Let us realise that the six-day licensee's means of becoming a seven-day licensee were very limited and restricted under the law up to now and the whole picture completely changes when you contemplate the liberal provisions made for him under the Bill.  A provision existed in the licensing Acts&mdash;and was exercised some years ago&mdash;with the intention of doing away with many of the redundant licences.  Under the provisions of the law, the State paid what they considered to be the value and the cost was put on the remaining licensees.  Under that provision the total amount of compensation was £50,000 with about £10,000 in expenses. Because there were so many redundant licences they found that they were paying out a lot of money for nothing.</P>
      <P>The lowest amount paid in my own county of Mayo under that provision was £23 but the price varied from that to Galway £35, Cork £36, Cork borough, £36 and County Clare £150.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give the dates of these transactions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>They would certainly be over 20 years ago.  I shall have the date before I finish.  But making allowance for the depreciation of money since those days, these prices <Col N="1933" /> were an indication then of the amount it cost in practice to eliminate some of these licences.  The date, I am now told, was 1929.  The point I am making is that at the time the redundant licences were acquired by the State for as low as £23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not give, from his own knowledge, the prices of licences within the past year and a half?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might be quite until I finish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is surely entitled to make his case without interruption.  There has been a barrage of interruptions since he began to speak.  He is entitled to speak, as is any other Deputy, without being interrupted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy is anxious to prevent me putting the Minister's point of view on these amendments.  Let me say this: never under the law we enjoy here was it possible for a six-day licensee to sell his six-day licence since the foundation of the State, except under that one provision, whereby the State acquired it, and the result is that in very many towns there are a considerable number of redundant six-day licences.  You have the change in the character of the premises; you have drapery people with licences; you have chemists' shops with licences; and you have the mixed businesses Deputy Dillon mentioned. I suggest, from my own knowledge, that a number of these licences in mixed businesses are maintained for the sole purpose of catering for people who come in to buy other commodities.  The licensees are not people&mdash;as has been represented here &mdash;in the main, who are solely dependent on the public-house business as an occupation.  A very large number of them are people to whose business the six-day licence is merely incidental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill, the individual six-day licensee can become <Col N="1934" /> a seven-day licensee by acquiring, as was formerly the case, a seven-day licence in the same licensing area or in adjoining licensing area but he can also go from Cork to Donegal to purchase a seven-day licence and have it transferred to his six-day premises and thereby become a seven-day licensee.  He can go from Cork to Donegal and acquire two six-day licences and have these transferred to his six-day premises and thereby become a seven-day licensee.  In his own licensing area, he can acquire one six-day licence&mdash; which was never the position before&mdash; and thereby become a seven-day licensee.</P>
      <P>Not alone that, but the procedure has been simplified to such an extent that the purchase price of the six- or seven-day licence must be drastically reduced.  Under the law as it stood, when a six-day licensee tried to become a seven-day licensee by purchasing a seven-day licence, he had to have two conveyances because at the vital stage when it came before the court for the transfer of the seven-day licence to the six-day premises, he had to be the owner of both premises and the licences of both premises had to be in his name.  That entailed two conveyances. There was the conveyance of the old premises with the seven-day licence attached to it to the six-day licensee.  On that conveyance, he had to pay the stamp duty&mdash;not the cost of the consideration of the licence but a stamp duty on the deed of the value of the whole premises, plus the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, having come to court and having got the order from the Court on production of that conveyance transferring the seven-day licence to his own six-day premises and a consequential order extinguishing the seven-day licence of the premises which he notionally bought, he then had to make another conveyance back to the man from whom he bought the seven-day licence and the second conveyance also had to be stamped, not on what he alleged was the consideration but on what the Revenue Commissioners regarded as being the market value of the premises involved.  The costs in these cases rather depended on the <Col N="1935" /> value of the premises, not the value of the licence or the amount paid for the licence.  The cost varied from £50, to what I have been informed at least was up to £150 in the same transaction.</P>
    <P>Instead of that cumbersome procedure, it is provided here that by this simple transfer, by going to the court with proof that the owner of the seven-day licence consents to have that seven-day licence extinguished as far as his premises is concerned and transferred to the six-day licensee&mdash;and all that can be done without these double conveyancing procedures to which I have referred&mdash;the applicant can have his seven-day licence.  That must mean a considerable reduction in the cost of the six-day man becoming a seven-day man.  The fact that a six-day licence for the purpose of transfer or sale now has in the immediate licensing area, the same effect as the transfer or sale of a seven-day licence formerly had, must mean a tremendous easing in the position of the six-day licensee who wants to become a seven-day licensee.</P>
    <P>We know that there are hundreds of redundant licences in the country.  I think Deputy Dillon suggested that about 1,000 six-day licences will have to be dealt with under the provisions of this Bill.  I do not think the figure is even as high as that for the purpose we are concerned with here.  I want the House to appreciate that there are six-day licensees who would not become seven-day licensees, if you gave them all the tea in China and my colleague, Deputy Kenny, in speaking here tonight mentioned one publican as being a six-day licensee who, to my knowledge, before I came into Government, refused to purchase a seven-day licence when it was offered to him and who would not have a seven-day licence if you made him a present of it because he does not believe in operating on a Sunday.  He would much prefer to fish in Lough Mask.  Many of us, I am sure, would prefer to be there rather than dealing with this matter.  We have a number of people, as Deputy Kenny knows, in our town who do not, and would not, operate on Sunday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many who operate on Sunday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1936" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that there are not people who do not operate on Sunday.  I am getting down to the figure given by Deputy Dillon, that we have 1,000 to deal with.  I think the number for the whole of the country is about 1,200 which would include restricted licences as well as six-day licences.  That figure would include early closing licences and other forms of restricted licences.  My information is that there are approximately 1,200 six-day licences, seventy early closing licences and 260 six-day early closing licences in force, out of a grand total of 11,800 publicans' licences.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the House that the people Deputies are concerned with would probably be very many fewer than the number of 1,000 given by Deputy Dillon.  Assuming that the figure of 1,000 is correct and taking the case on that basis, we now have 1,000 publicans who, if they so desire, are free to roam from Dublin to Donegal and purchase seven-day licences, if they so wish, under the facilities now being provided by the Minister.  They are getting these facilities which they never had before.</P>
      <P>I have had the experience during the past fortnight or three weeks of speaking to a man in my own town who has two licences for sale, a seven-day licence and a six-day licence, which are of no value until the House passes this Bill.  In chatting with him over the matter in his own house as to the value of the licences, he informed me that he would try to get rid of his seven-day licence before all the six-day licences he knew to be for sale come on the market.  His view was that the value of the licence, if the Bill went through, would be drastically reduced.  That is the view of a man who is in the market with two licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made that the price of licences would reach a figure which they never reached before.  I have had some experience of this matter of dealing with the sale and transfer of licences in my time.  I have seen them range in price from £75 to £300.  That is the highest <Col N="1937" /> figure I have seen in my part of the country paid under the law as it was. My view at the moment is that the moment this measure comes into operation, that immediately a six-day licence is as good as a seven-day licence for the purpose of transfer in the local area and as good as two six-day licences in the country generally, the cost of procuring a seven-day licence will be reduced by 50 per cent. That is my own personal and sincere view.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Deputies, considering the equity that has always been there and the differential that has been always there, the extra amount of money paid by these people for their licence, the extra purchase price paid by the seven-day licensee and the extra amount paid in rates and taxation by the seven-day licensee, that they should consider whether it is equitable for the House, by a stroke of the pen, to devalue the seven-day licensee after what he has paid by giving the six-day licensee the same right as the seven-day licensee has enjoyed, to trade on a Sunday.</P>
    <P>Let me put to Deputy Dillon the case of a seven-day licensee who operates a <i>bona fide</i> trade as the law stands and who makes a business of it.  He is there, and he can open his door under an area exemption order when there is a sporting fixture in the town and he has been paying for these privileges through the years in the price of his premises, in his licence duties and in his rates.  Is it fair that, by allowing his neighbours on each side of him who are six-day licensees to become seven-day licensees, the House should thereby devalue the premises for which he has paid?  Is the House not thereby being unfair to him and is the House not annulling a principle which has preserved this equity between these people since the year 1872?  That is what Deputy Dillon proposes to do.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is also proposing to put these people, without any expense to themselves, on the same basis as the seven-day licensee has been since 1927 when he purchased the seven-day licence under the law of the land, as it then existed.  While it may be said that these people, the six-day licensees, are <Col N="1938" /> bound to lose custom or some money under the Sunday operation, and I accept that there may be something in that and I would be prepared to go a bit of the way with the Deputy, I would ask him to realise that these people always lost money on a Sunday because they could not open on a Sunday.</P>

It is a town in which there are very often big football matches.  For a number of months in the year it is the exception rather than the rule not to have an area exemption order applied for and operated in relation to these matches.  Of course, only the seven-day licensees can keep open.</P>

      <P>At all events, what I want to assure the House is that I have witnessed hundreds of people paying their few shillings to hackney drivers to run them out to the halfway house, to Turlough and elsewhere, places which Deputy Blowick and Deputy Kenny know well.  I am sure those people would not go to that expense and travel that distance if, as has been suggested here, every six-day licensee in the town was prepared to cater for them.  While we have had a picture of the law not being enforced, there has not been, as that picture would suggest, the flouting of the law suggested here on both sides of the House.  I would be the first to agree that there have been breaches of the law, but the picture painted here is not the correct picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One speaker referred to lapsed licences.  It is very, very difficult <Col N="1940" /> under our law to revive a lapsed licence.  First, the licence had to be in existence in 1902; the premises have to be identifiable as being the same, or approximately the same, as they were then.  In addition to that, the applicant runs the hazard of opposition from the Garda.  There may be opposition on the basis of the number of licensed premises already in the area.  Sometimes there is opposition from the Church.  Sometimes others come in to object to the revival of the licence.  My experience has been that it is very, very difficult to revive a licence.  If my memory serves me correctly, it was only by a decision of Mr. Justice Martin Maguire that it was laid down about eight years ago that there was an equity in lapsed licences under the 1902 Act.  His decision was subsequently upheld.  That was the first time that that decision was taken.</P>
    <P>The case made about a rush to revive lapsed licences does not rest on a sound foundation.  The Courts are very slow to revive a lapsed licence ever since that equity was held to be there.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we are providing that, where a licence has lapsed for five years, it cannot be revived two years after the passing of this Bill. But, whatever may be the difficulties or the facilities under which a lapsed licence may be revived, the fact remains that under the law, and certainly under case law, there is a right to apply to revive such a licence. That right will be extinguished after a certain period under this Bill.  I think rightly so.  The probable reason for that provision is that anything which tends to decrease the number of licences should be tried.  It is held that people should not be encouraged, having let licences lapse for a great number of years, to come back and try to revive them.  The whole trouble with our licensing laws and the licensing trade generally, apart from enforcing of the law, has been the extraordinary number of licensed premises.  Many licensees have been tempted by economic circumstances to keep open at unearthly hours in order to make money they would not normally make in fair competition <Col N="1941" /> with the man running his business in accordance with the hours fixed under law.  Under these amendments the House is attempting to create more seven-day licensed premises.  I find this completely illogical remembering how the argument has run up to this. Some people now arguing in favour of Deputy Dillon's amendment voted against any extension of the existing drinking hours at an earlier stage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>It seems to me to be a completely illogical stand to take on this matter.  If the people against the extension of drinking hours really believed in what they were arguing in this House a couple of weeks ago and what they voted for in this House a couple of weeks ago, I fail to understand the logic whereby they now ask the House to extend Sunday drinking facilities.  Their proposal is to turn the six-day licensees into seven-day licensees, allowing them to open their doors on Sundays, thereby extending the drinking facilities for all and sundry in this country on Sundays.</P>
      <P>If Deputies really consider the justice of all sides in this matter, that we want to be just to the seven-day licensee as well as being fair to the six-day licensee, if they consider the way in which every Dáil from the foundation of this State has treated this question, I think to be logical they should accept the amendment put forward by the Minister and the amendment moved in the name of Deputy Dillon should be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to press this amendment because the Minister's case, I think it is manifest to everybody in this House, is a laboured effort to argue for something in which he <Col N="1942" /> does not believe.  He said at an earlier stage that one of the legs on which he stood was that, as Deputy Gerry Boland had pointed out, the Commission had reported in the absence of representation, that if the six-day licence men were interested in this matter they would have made representations.  They did not make representations, and I know why.  It was because they did not realise what the implications of this Bill were, and I did not realise them.</P>
      <P>The six-day man did not realise that it was proposed to throw open the door of every seven-day licensee in a rural town to his neighbour and to padlock the door of the six-day man.  The present position is that the seven-day men and the six-day men illegally sell drink on Sunday, but what we are proposing to do in this Bill is to throw open the door of the seven-day man and to padlock effectively the six-day man's door.  They did not realise that and I did not realise that.</P>
      <P>May I add that although the Minister may have been for a number of years a rural solicitor I have been for thirty years a country publican.  If there is any one in the House who knows the details of this trade, I know it.  With all that knowledge, I frankly confess I did not see the implications of this until it dawned upon me what actually was going to happen in the town I live in and in the towns I represent in the Country Monaghan.  The view I now express, as the Minister for Justice knows, was amply vindicated to him by some of the six-day publicans in his own office in my presence, who put to him the case that this development would wipe them out of existence.  He heard that representation made, not by Deputies in this House but by small six-day publicans who waited on him in his own office. Deputy Mooney was there the day the deputation waited on him and he heard the same representation being made.  The Minister himself said that a shrewd man in Castlebar assured him that the provisions of this Bill will depreciate very substantially, according to his estimate, the value of a seven-day licence.</P>

      <P>For sale.  Therefore, the difference between the Minister and ourselves in regard to the injustice to be done to the seven-day licensee is merely a matter of degree.  He is going to, according to his shrewd companion in Castlebar, hit them a couple of wallops and the Minister says he proposes to hit them a heavier wallop.  I make the submission that neither the Minister nor the shrewd man in Castlebar is right.</P>
      <P>What is the fact?  The plain fact is that 80 per cent.  of the <i>bona fide</i> trade in rural Ireland during the past 50 years has been an illegal trade.  The Minister himself says that he saw the queues assemble to get into the cars to drive out to public houses outside the three mile limit.  I assert that every single one of those customers was trading illegally.  There is no right under the existing law for any man to travel for the purpose of drinking; he may drink for the purpose of travelling. He is not permitted by the existing law to hire a hackney car and drive out to a public house four, five or six miles away to drink and then come back.  Every man who did that broke the law and the publican who served him broke the law.  I submit that 80 per cent. of the <i>bona fide</i> trade done in rural Ireland at present is an illegal trade, just as illegal as the six-day man who opens his back door and serves his customers in the kitchen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned, and I do not think Deputies are concerned, with making legal points at the expense of one another.  But we are concerned with the circumstances of our own neighbours.  There are only about 1,000 persons involved.  The Minister says they are fewer.  Think of what you will do if you wipe these people out. There is no use talking about the trade done on the occasion of a special exemption order.  These six-day licence men are not concerned with the transient traveller who comes to town on the occasion of a football match. They are not interested in the legitimate patron of the <i>bona fide</i> trade. The people they are living on are their neighbours, and what we are doing is this.  Here is what we are providing in respect of the strictly limited number <Col N="1944" /> of customers they have who come to them after Mass on Sunday or come to them in the afternoon, who use their public houses as houses of call for leaving messages, for parking their horses and carts, for leaving in a bag or an umbrella, for leaving in their prayer book after Mass while they go down the town.  That is what they use these houses for.  They are going into them at present in violation of the licensing law&mdash;half of them get drink and half of them do not bother to get drink&mdash;but they use them as houses of call in the towns they visit.  You are going to padlock that door now and the only place they can make a house of call legitimately is the neighbouring public house, the doors of which are wide open.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity to go to the back door now.  At present, if they went to a seven-day house or a six-day house, if they were neighbours, they could only go illegally.  Now it is legal to go in through the open doors of the seven-day house on a Sunday.  but it is not physically possible to go, legally or illegally, into the six-day house because the Civic Guards are to be instructed to watch them most vigilantly. The result of that will be that you will not only deprive the six-day men of the few shillings they earn on Sundays, but you will wipe them out of business.</P>
    <P>The people who call on Sundays to seven-day houses will not be let into the seven-day houses to enjoy the kind of convenience I am describing if they are only fair-weather friends of the house, if they are going to come only on the day no other house is open.  If they want to enjoy these amenities in the seven-day house they have to call on Sundays and weekdays, on the market day as well as Sunday.  Mind you, market day is the day when they will give them most custom.  Sunday is very frequently a day that will give them no custom.  Fifty per cent. of the people who go into the public house on a Sunday use it as a house of convenience but they are there on Fridays and it is there they do the entertaining of neighbours they meet on the streets. Force them out under this Bill and they will lose whatever modest profit <Col N="1945" /> they would otherwise be making, and their customers will be forced from them.  I believe that the Minister for Lands knows just as well as I do that we are not dealing here with licences. We are dealing with homes.  There are a lot of people in this category who have small, and I am sorry to say, dilapidated houses and they are just managing to carry on.  Take their trade from them and they cannot afford to stay in the houses they are in.</P>

      <P>I do not expect Deputies from the City of Dublin to understand what I am talking about but I know that the Minister for Lands must know. He knows the towns of Swinford and Ballyvary; he knows North Mayo, South Mayo and Monaghan.  Deputy Mooney also knows that what I am saying is true.  It seems to me so crazy because by inadvertence&mdash;and I am convinced it was by inadvertence&mdash; this position has been created, there should be all this blooming fuss and bother about putting right something that means the difference between survival and extinction for, I say, 1,000 small publicans.  The Minister says 500 or 600 but let us split the difference and call it 800.  All I am asking is to let these 800 small family premises open and earn what they can.  What earthly sense can there be for arguing against it?</P>
      <P>I have not met a single seven-day publican in Ireland who is so avaricious as to say that he grudges this to his six-day neighbour.  I have not met one and, mind you, Deputy Mooney ought to have the courage to say that he knows there are towns in Monaghan where there are six-day and seven-day licences side by side.  I doubt if he has met a seven-day licence holder in Monaghan who grudges this to his six-day neighbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last word I want to say is this. If you force these people&mdash;and there is only a small group of them throughout the country&mdash;to the point of destitution that they cannot go on paying their licences and they have to part with them, it must be remembered that whatever little nest egg those people have consists of the little homes <Col N="1946" /> they live in, and they could not give them away if their licences were withdrawn. I am thinking of one house in the main street of Ballaghaderreen known to Deputy S. Flanagan and if it has any value its sole value is that it has a licence.  If the licence were taken away from it tomorrow I do not think any sane man in Ireland would accept a present of it.  I know the man living in it.  He was born there and has lived all his life in it. I knew his mother though I do not think Deputy S. Flanagan did, and I knew his grandmother.  They were poor people and how they did exist is a mystery to me but, as long as they kept open, they were able to live.  In the last analysis, if all came to all, that man could sell that little house and spend his remaining years of life with neighbours, but do not force him into the position of having to drop the licence so that he could not give the house away.  If that happens he is a pauper.</P>
    <P>I am not making the case that the Fianna Fáil Party are ravening wolves out to trample these people into the dirt.  I know some of them do not realise the full implications of this but Deputy S. Flanagan and Deputy Mooney know the circumstances I am talking of.  Deputy Mooney knows them better in Monaghan than I do because he lives in Monaghan.  Yes, that is true.  I have never had to conceal that fact for 25 years and they put me at the head of the poll all that time.  I know the circumstances as well as Deputy Mooney knows them and I think he ought to raise his voice and be heard on this matter.</P>
    <P>I think the very difficulty that the Minister for Lands has had in making the case he sought to make, and which it was his duty to make in supporting his colleague, the Minister for Justice, is evidence that he knows we are right.  He is floundering along. Some of his arguments were pretty flimsy and he was driven to pretty extravagant extremes to try and prop up the case he was making because he does not believe in it.  I have appealed on many occasions on and off over the years, not always without <Col N="1947" /> success, to have it recognised that this is a deliberative assembly.  No one can honestly say that if this amendment of ours is rejected the Irish nation is going to disintegrate. The country will run on very much the same as if nothing had happened but there will be a number of small homes throughout the country that will become familiar with poverty and destitution.  Is there any compensating benefit on the side that can be set against that inevitability?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Lands, and most of their colleagues know that we are not making this case for fun or for political purposes.  There are not 1,000 votes involved in the whole of Ireland. There are 10,000 seven-day licence holders and we are fighting a case for what the Minister says is approximately 600 to 800 families against the powerful vested interests, as he believes, of 10,000 seven-day publicans up and down the country.  Why are we doing it?  It cannot be because of a desire to win votes because all the votes are on the other side.  If the Minister's diagnosis of the situation is correct we are doing it for much the same reason as Deputy S. Flanagan and Deputy Mooney would like to do it.  Maybe I will persuade him to do it before the night is out.</P>

I do not want to see these small people injured?&rdquo;  There is no grave reason why he should adhere to the decision which, up to this, he has maintained. Why does he not say: &ldquo;Let Deputy Blowick, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Lindsay withdraw their amendments and I will meet them on Report Stage?&rdquo;  Cross your heart and hope to die, is the majority of the Fianna <Col N="1948" /> Fáil Party not anxious to hear that?

      <P>I hope I am worthy of that tribute.  In this matter I am endeavouring to ensure that I do not <Col N="1949" /> do an injustice to the greater number of people involved in this whole problem.  There are 10,000 odd seven-day licensees and about 1,400 odd six-day licensees.  If we were foolish enough to allow an automatic grant of a seven-day licence to each of 1,400 people, we would be increasing the number of seven-day licensees to something over 11,000.  I do not think that is desirable.  The object of every Government since the establishment of the State has been to have a continuous, even though it may have been a slow, reduction of the number of licensed premises.  That was a good aim to have pursued. That is what we are trying to do here. Far from being unjust in this matter, we are making a very generous gesture to the six-day licensees by the ways and means we are offering them to secure seven-day licences.  That is very fair.  Originally, the area for the purchase of a seven-day licence was rather restricted.  On the case made in the House, we propose to facilitate in a number of ways persons wishing to secure a seven-day licence.</P>
      <P>As a first step we are proposing that a six-day licensee need only obtain the consent of a holder of a seven-day licence to have a seven-day licence extinguished, instead of having to have the licence transferred to his own name.  We are in this way simplifying the law in respect to the manner in which the six-licence may be converted.  If a six-day licensee can succeed in having a seven-day licence in any part of the State extinguished he may become a seven-day licensee.</P>
      <P>The second way to become a seven-day licensee under our proposals will be to extinguish a six-day licence in the same District Court Area and the third way will be to extinguish two six-day licences anywhere in the State.</P>
      <P>There are thousands of these licences to be got, I am informed, all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish my sentence before you say I am saying something wrong.  I am saying that I think they are doing themselves an injustice by the campaign which they have been pressing in regard to this question because as a result of the publicity which they have received, naturally&mdash;it is a human weakness&mdash; the owners of these dormant licences will begin to think in terms of much higher prices than they had been before this Bill was introduced.  That is why I think they are not doing themselves justice.  They are probably pushing up the price.  I do not know whether that will operate or not but we are taking the precaution that, when this Bill will have been enacted and will have been in force for a period of two years, these licences will expire.  It means that the people who are wise enough to realise that the period is limited may be anxious to get rid of these licences and, from that point of view, I do not think there will be any great difficulty for any six-day licensee who is sufficiently alert to go after licences of the type I have mentioned and secure one seven-day licence in any part of Ireland or two six-day licences in any part of Ireland or one in a district court area.  I think that is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be fairly clear to the House now that we are not accepting the <Col N="1951" /> amendment.  I am satisfied that the amendment which I will move when we have dealt with this matter will bring the necessary relief to the people we are discussing at the present moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully sympathise with the Minister and agree with him that there are too many licensed premises in the State but I wholly disagree with his method of reducing the number because the Minister is forcing on six-day licensees a war of attrition: they have either to go out of business or involve themselves in an outlay of money for the purchase of a licence and 99 per cent. of them are not in a position to do that.  That is the first point.</P>
      <P>The second point is that most six-day licensees have alternative means of livelihood.  They have a grocery business or a hardware business, which helps them to make a living.  The injustice done under this Bill is that not alone will the six-day licensee be deprived of the few shillings profit he makes on whatever drink he sells but his other means of livelihood will be taken away.  As the Minister should know, in the country districts, apart from drink altogether, a good deal of business is done on Sundays in selling other commodities.  If the six-day man is forced to close on Sunday and if his customers have to go to the seven-day man for their bread and other goods, one cannot expect them to go back to the six-day premises on the other days of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands and the Minister for Justice have told us that it is necessary to reduce the number of licensed premises.  It is unfair that that reduction should be confined to six-day licensees.  The Minister for Lands told us there was a differential between the two.  There was always a differential but that differential occurred away back ninety years ago. Those seven-day licensees who opted for a six-day licence, are dead 60 or 70 years, and are the people who bought these premises to be victimised now simply because of something that happened away back in the past?  I can draw a parallel between such a person and, say, a farmer's son of 90 <Col N="1952" /> years ago who married the neighbour's daughter, set up a home and got his rood of ground to till potatoes.  That man's descendants are congests in some area and the State has power to spend money, through the Land Commission, to relieve his poverty because he cannot do it himself.  If a person opted for a six-day licence 70 years ago and we penalise today the successor in title to that licensed premises that is bad law.</P>
    <P>What appals me is that the Minister for Justice himself does not seem to grasp what an enormous injustice will be done to the six-day licensee down the country.  He does not seem to realise that it will be almost impossible to enforce the law when this Bill is enacted.  He has said: &ldquo;We shall enforce the law rigidly.&rdquo;  More power to him for that, but he is going to place a Guard outside the six-day public house in order to stop people from doing business on a Sunday while the same Guard must allow the seven-day licensee to open.  I cannot see how that law will be enforced.  It will be a blessing to the legal men because disputes and prosecutions will be the result.  It was difficult enough to enforce the law under the <i>bona fide</i> system but it will be twenty times as difficult under this measure.  The Minister while remedying one defect is creating a much worse, in fact a sinister one in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands made great play with the argument that the seven-day people opted for the six-day licence because it meant a saving of one-seventh of the licence fee over the year.  The Minister for Justice told us here, and it is a fact, that some six-day licensed premises are paying more for the annual licence than the seven-day men.  Two things will emerge from this measure if it goes through. One is that the six-day men will bear all the cost of the elimination of the surplus public houses.  The second thing is that it will put a great number of them out of business.  Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Kenny quoted instances of places where for five or six miles around there are only six-day licensed premises.  Leaving the publican out of it altogether, take the number of people who like a bottle of <Col N="1953" /> stout on a Sunday.  That whole area will be deprived of that amenity which the area a few miles away has.  If the seven-day premises were interpersed fairly regularly throughout the rural districts the Minister might have some case to put up, but as it is he has none.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought still to consider allowing this amendment to go to a free vote of the House.  The Minister for Lands referred to several commissions which considered this question. However, one fact has clearly emerged since the last Commission sat and that is that the last Commission did not visualise the injustice that such a Bill as this would visit on the heads of many of the six-day licensees.  The Minister for Lands, too, admitted that he did not think it would have that effect and the Commission can scarcely be blamed for not foreseeing it.  Not until the Bill came before the House did anyone think it would have this effect.</P>

I can assure the Minister it is not a case of exerting pressure such as might be done by other groups.  I think the six-day licensees fell down on the job that they did not make their case.  However, it is quite clear the Minister&mdash;I take him to be a fair-minded man&mdash;does not realise at all the consequences of this measure.  If he did he would not have hand, act or part in it.</P>

      <P>The more one considers the humbug that has been going on here during the discussion on this Bill the more one laughs.  Deputy Blowick spoke about the man who likes his pint on a Sunday.  Twelve years ago Deputy Blowick marched around that lobby, followed by Deputy Dillon, to prevent that man getting his pint in any part of rural Ireland on a Sunday. By their votes they ruined the prospect of getting any respect for the licensing laws.  All that was sought on that occasion was that the couple of hours enjoyed by the city men would be given to the rural publicans.  Deputy Dillon did not want that.  He has spent the last fortnight or three weeks on this Bill shouting about the daring attempt to extend the hours; the hours are too long.  The hours were always too long for Deputy Dillon.  Somebody in Monaghan who was dumb until Deputy Dillon found a tongue for him in the past month comes along now to him to make the case which for the past 12 months he had an opportunity of making before the Commission which was prepared to listen to him.  These 1,000 publicans with six-day licences holders were dumb.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the seriousness of this problem, and the anxiety of the people in the northwestern end of my constituency, I feel it is time to see if I can focuse the attention of the Government and get them to start to consider and examine what is at stake.  For that reason, I asked the Minister for Finance today:</P>
      <P>...whether he has under consideration the survey of that portion of the Corrib catchment area known as the Corrib-Mask section of the Galway-Mayo borders, which was cut out; and, if so, what are the prospects of having this work completed so that work may be continued on the completion of the whole scheme as originally intended.</P>
      <P>I was rather shaken when I listened to the reply given to me by the Parliamentary Secretary which reads:</P>
      <P>The survey of the Corrib-Mask catchment will be undertaken as soon as opportunity offers but at present I cannot say when we will be able to reach it.  Having regard to our present commitments, I fear that it will not be possible to have the scheme ready to proceed on completion of the works at present in progress on the Corrib-Clare scheme.</P>
      <P>That was about the first time I had heard the name of the Corrib-Clare used, in so far as this catchment was concerned.  I was anxious to find out the reason why this area was left out originally.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary the following supplementary Question:</P>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell me the reason, if any, for the decision to by-pass the most flooded area in the catchment?</P>
      <P>His reply was:</P>
      <P>I would not agree that it was decided to by-pass this area but it would appear that this section was included in the original catchment and at some stage it was decided to postpone it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> Everybody realises that postponements are dangerous and I take it the term &ldquo;postponed&rdquo; is just another way of saying &ldquo;by-passed&rdquo; because nothing can convince me&mdash;and I do not know anybody who could convince the people of this area&mdash;that it was not deliberately by-passed.  The catchment area is something that was created by God Himself, and it cannot be split up as it is a particular type of unit.</P>
    <P>The scheme was originally outlined to cover, in addition to the Clare-Corrib end, the Mask which covers part of Connemara, the north west portion of my constituency and a pretty big area in the south east Mayo end on the Shrule side.  How at that time the eyes of anybody could be closed to this serious problem is more than I can understand.  In 1947&mdash; everybody will recollect that was one of the wettest years in our history&mdash; areas were flooded which people never before saw flooded.  The area, to give a brief outline, comprises Ballintleva, Caherlistrane, Headford, Killnamanagh down to Kilconley and then back around to Shrule.</P>
    <P>The problem there is equal to the problem of the Shannon, and that is saying a big thing, but the difference between this area and the Shannon is a big difference.  The Shannon is a problem on which thousands of pounds have been spent in bringing in foreigners to try to relieve it.  It is a problem which has engaged and continues to engage the attention of the people of Ireland year after year. The Army are brought to their assistance to help to relieve people along the flooded Shannon area.  The Shannon is bordered by the counties of Offaly, Roscommon, Galway and, I think, Longford and Westmeath. That is a very big area.  Those counties are all deeply interested and, of course, I suppose the politicians are not very slow in raising their voices about it.</P>
    <P>Here in this Corrib-Mask area we have, as I have said, a problem equal to that of the Shannon.  I have some figures with me relating to that problem.  In 1947, nine families had to leave their homes and some of them <Col N="1957" /> could never return because the houses fell down shortly afterwards.  Twelve families lost their crops entirely&mdash;12 apart from the nine who also lost their crops.  A further 35 families suffered serious losses.  I think that indicates very clearly the serious problem which exists there.</P>
    <P>We had, at that time, no funds to call upon.  I was one of the people mainly responsible for organising a committee which set out, as the saying goes, with our hats in our hands, to try to collect a fund for the relief of those people.  We met with fairly generous support and people contributed even better than we expected.  We had to find housing accommodation for many of these families.  We provided bedding for them and we had to find accommodation for their livestock.  We had to bring other comforts to the people and we had to bring food to many whose potatoes were covered by the floods.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Shannon flood situation is a problem but this is not. That is the difference between the two. This is something that could have been solved quite early by allowing the catchment area stand as it was. What I am trying to find out from the Parliamentary Secretary is: why was part of the catchment dropped? Why was the most flooded portion of the whole catchment&mdash;and the most flooded portion of any part of Ireland outside the Shannon&mdash;dropped altogether? I have no doubts as to why it happened and I know many people who think with me.</P>
    <P>We are pressing to-day to get the Government to bring forward this scheme and to try to have it, as it should have been, included in the original scheme.  My effort to-night and the efforts of the people I represent are to try to get the Government to go ahead as fast as they possibly can.  That is why I am making a special appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary.  We are all very much afraid that if the machinery moves out from the present Corrib-Clare scheme, it will not be an easy job for us to get it back.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said today: &ldquo;Having regard to our present commitments,I fear that it will not be <Col N="1958" /> possible to have the scheme ready to proceed on the completion of the works at present in progress on the Clare-Corrib scheme.&rdquo;  I had been watching the development in regard to drainage. I saw the survey of the Moy started. Later, I saw the survey of the Suck started.  During all that time I realised that all those things were being done at the expense of the Corrib-Mask portion of the Corrib catchment area.</P>
    <P>I have an idea that Deputies and I suppose Senators and everybody who used their influence from other counties had come to this conclusion. I suppose they were perfectly right in forming the opinion that, because of all the propaganda that had been made out of the Corrib, because of all the big lettering on the walls and on the streets of certain towns in my area, any Deputy or other interested person passing through would be fully convinced that all the money in Ireland was being squandered in County Galway.</P>

      <P>I was more than amazed to find out, when I attended a Shrule Drainage Board meeting quite recently, that this Drainage Board comprised of a body made up between the Galway County Council and the Mayo County Council, could spend only a few hundred pounds a year trying to do minor relief.  The minor reliefs they can do are very temporary&mdash;cutting rushes, and so on.  The expenditure of a few hundred pounds on drainage of that kind can achieve very little. I was amazed to find that Deputy Blowick, who was a member of the Coalition Government, stood by and slept while this was being put across him, as it was put across him.</P>

I would ask any of those people to take a trip around that area at this moment to see the position now and then to try to realise what the position was a month or two months ago when people were flooded out.</P>
      <P>Because the propaganda there was not as strong as that from other areas, because they did not do as much shouting as the people along the Shannon, very little notice was taken of them.  I want to put a few questions to the Parliamentary Secretary and I should like to have an answer to them. It might help to satisfy my mind a little about this problem.  The questions are:</P>
      <P>1.  Was the whole idea of the 1945 Drainage Act not planned on the basis of catchment areas of natural watersheds?  I believe they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  When the engineers were engaged <Col N="1960" /> on what is technically known as the plotting work in the area, did they include the Corrib-Mask in their work and report to headquarters?</P>
    <P>3.  If they did so, how is it explained that, in the design which was prepared in the office, one of the most flooded districts in the catchment area was excluded?</P>
    <P>4.  If the engineers who did the plotting work excluded this district, how did the engineers who prepared the scheme fail to detect this serious omission?</P>
    <P>5.  If the area referred to is part of the Corrib catchment, does this mean that the only effective natural way of relieving it from flooding is by treating it as part of the Corrib catchment?</P>
    <P>6.  Could it in fact be included, from an engineering point of view, in a neighbouring catchment for drainage purposes?  I do not think so.  I do not think there is a possible chance of having it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with Deputy Killilea, but I could not give a more favourable reply than that which I gave, a reply which was in accordance with the facts as we find them.  Since I became Parliamentary Secretary, I have repeated in the House a good many times and I want to reiterate to-night that we do not at any time propose to change the priority list set out for arterial drainage.  If we did, we would have debates on the Adjournment every night and we would have people asking us to go ahead every time the Dáil met.  I, therefore, have the greatest sympathy with Deputy Killilea because I cannot give him a more favourable reply.  I do not propose at this stage to make a political football out of the arterial drainage scheme.  The scheme is moving smoothly.</P>
      <P>The Corrib catchment was known as the Corrib-Clare-Mask catchment, as stated by Deputy Killilea.  The survey commenced on that catchment in 1948.  So far as I can ascertain and as I am informed by my technical advisers in the Office of Public Works, is was intended to take the catchment as a whole, but in November, 1950, the decision was taken by the then Parliamentary Secretary to exclude portion of the scheme.</P>

The Mask portion was dropped.  The work commenced in April, 1954.  It is now proceeding and will take about three years to complete.  When the survey staff were finished with that work, they naturally moved on to other catchments on the priority list.  It would be a bit too much to expect that they should leave the Moy, the Inny and the Boyne and go back to do further survey in Galway where obviously they were content to do with portion of the scheme as was then decided upon.</P>

I want to put the facts as I find them before me now.  It would not be fair to withdraw the survey staff from the other catchments on the priority list and send them back to do further work in Galway.  They must wait until such time as the other schemes on the priority list have been completed.  The Inny is now completed; the Moy is about to be officially opened; and the Boyne catchment survey is nearing completion.  Taking all these jobs on the priority list schemes into consideration, it would not be fair for me now to assure Deputy Killilea or Deputy Donnellan that the machinery can be retained after the present Corrib portion of the catchment is completed because it would not be possible to have the other portion of the Corrib-Mask, as it is now known, ready to commence at that time.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any point to be served by any recriminations as to what happened in the matter.  I am giving the facts as I find them.  The decision was taken but not by me.

      <P>The case which Deputy Killilea makes with regard to <Col N="1964" /> the necessity for the work is, I am quite sure, in accordance with the facts as given in the report in these files which I have been looking over recently.  But many people have come to me recently with regard to various other catchments.  They have been able to make equally as good a case for their areas.  If we started to chop and change now, we should land ourselves in queer street with regard to the programme. It is a programme of great magnitude.  It is going smoothly.  Let us not start changing it.  If we do, we shall get nowhere.  Although I should like to be able to give better information to Deputy Killilea, it would be wiser to leave the priority list as it is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea addressed a number of questions to me.  What I said to a great extent covers them.  It was one catchment area originally.  We are all agreed upon that.  It was decided to proceed with only portion of it in 1950. The survey continued on that portion. Plotting took place and the design work made out.  That was treated as a separate catchment.  It commenced in April, 1954.  It is now proceeding and will take approximately three years more to complete.  In the meantime, schemes like the Moy have gone into action.  The Inny will shortly commence and the Boyne survey is nearing completion.</P>
      <P>There are various other catchments from Donegal to Cork listed on the scheme.  Various other Deputies would like to have their schemes commenced next year, if that were possible. The decision is that we must keep to the priority list.  The best I can promise is now that we have increased the tempo in the carrying out of this programme, we can further increase it as time goes on and we may be able to overtake or surpass the timetable made out.</P>

    <P>*Sur-tax assessed for 1959-60 is payable on the 1st <i>January</i> 1961, and does not, therefore, affect the yield for 1959-60.  It is presumed that in this case the reference to an increase or reduction in the rates charged in that year is to be taken as a reference to the rates charged in respect of the previous year, i.e., 1958-59, the Sur-tax for which is payable on the 1st January, 1960 (i.e., in 1959-60).  The other two years are dealt with similarly.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Note.</i>&mdash;Income tax and Sur-tax receipts for any year consist of tax payments made <i>in that year</i> in respect of tax due for various years. For example, the Income Tax receipt for 1959-60 consists of Income Tax paid in respect of (a) the year 1959-60, (b) the year 1958-59 and (c) various <i>earlier</i> years.  The Sur-tax receipt for 1959-60 consists of Sur-tax paid in respect of (a) the year 1958-59, (b) the year 1957-58 and (c) various earlier years.</P>
    <P>The estimates given in the above table are of the increase or reduction which would have occurred in the receipt for that particular year if the rates <i>for that year</i> had been increased or reduced by 10 per cent.  The increase or reduction in a <i>full year</i> would be greater.</P>

    <P>(a)  Includes £726,154 for export losses on butter of the 1957 season's production in respect of which no contribution was payable from the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund.</P>
    <P>(b)  Eleven months to 29th February, 1960.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" /> As regards the second part of the Question, when the estimate of expenditure for 1960/61 was framed, it was impossible to estimate the quantity of butter likely to be available for export or the price which would be obtained.  The provision must, therefore, be regarded as an interim one, pending the establishment of the Irish Dairy Produce Board as envisaged in the White Paper of December, 1959, on Export Marketing of Irish Agricultural Produce.</P>

    <P>The total expended in the various categories does not correspond with the amount expended under the Acts as it is affected by the extent to which stocks of capital stores are run down. The amounts have therefore been expressed as percentages of the total cost of telephone capital works in each year.</P>
