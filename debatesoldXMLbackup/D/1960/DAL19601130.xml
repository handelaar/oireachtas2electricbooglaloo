      <P>In September, 1958, my Department approved of a proposal of the local authority to replace the existing unsuitable dispensary premises at Mahoney's Avenue, adjacent to Grattan Hill, Cork.  The local authority subsequently suggested the acquisition of a site which I considered unsuitable and they are at present endeavouring to obtain an alternative suitable one.  My Department will deal expeditiously with any such proposal when received.</P>

      <P>In April, 1957 my Department approved of a proposal of the Tipperary (South Riding) County Council to purchase a site in Dundrum for the erection of a dispensary.  The site has not yet been acquired and I understand that the delay has been occasioned mainly by difficulty in establishing title to the property.  This difficulty has now been resolved and it is expected that the local authority will acquire the site shortly and be in a position to proceed on their own initiative with the erection of the dispensary on the basis of a standard plan approved by my Department.</P>

      <P>I have caused this whole question to be reviewed this year in consultation with the other Departments concerned.  As a result I am satisfied that for administrative and other reasons the total abolition of duty on such parcels is not practicable.  The concessions previously available have however been substantially extended and are now as set out in my reply to a Question asked by Deputy O'Malley on the 26th October last.</P>

    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that customs officers at Dublin Airport are extending the practice of demanding receipts for the purchase price of articles of clothing in the possession of passengers arriving there so as to prove the origin of the goods, notwithstanding the fact that the goods may have been purchased several months previously and that receipts are not normally retained by individuals; and that goods bought in Ireland have, pending the production of receipts, been seized as suspected contraband from persons who have spent short periods in England; and if he will arrange for the discontinuance of this practice which is causing hardship and resentment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the general practice of the Customs to demand receipts for the purchase price of articles of clothing in the possession of passengers arriving at Dublin Airport.  Where, however, a passenger claims that a dutiable article was acquired by him in this country and the examining officer has reasonable ground to suspect that it was acquired abroad, it is the officer's duty to ask the passenger to substantiate his claim, whether by the production of the relative receipt or otherwise.  The detention of articles in such cases pending investigation is <Col N="316" /> rarely resorted to and only where the circumstances fully warrant it.</P>
      <P>Customs requirements at the Airport are kept under constant review and, I am satisfied, are no more onerous than is necessary in the interests of reasonable security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that on several occasions recently the Revenue Commissioners have had to apologise to persons from whom they wrongfully seized goods and retained them?  Furthermore, is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the recently-appointed lady customs officers at the Airport are discharging their duties with aggressiveness and insolence and have mishandled this whole matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say they have had to apologise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the apologies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, out of seven cases in which articles were detained within the last three months, six were subsequently found to have been smuggled.  In the one remaining case it was found that the person concerned actually had other smuggled goods in his possession at the time.  It is true to say that lady assistants have been appointed to the service.  That was done as a result of very definite information that privileges afforded in certain cases were being very much abused.  I am not satisfied that the officers are carrying out their duties otherwise than as expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary cause further inquiries to be made?  Is he aware that, to my personal knowledge, recently a lady entering here, a resident of Ireland, had a dress extracted from her case and was charged with smuggling it?  On being assured that she bought it in Dublin, she was required to show a receipt, which of course she could not get because the dress had been six months purchased.  She got a letter from the firm which supplied the dress and it was subsequently surrendered by the <Col N="317" /> Customs authorities.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary not aware that there is a considerable volume of complaint at present of excessive zeal in this matter, and would he not cause a special inquiry to be made so that a more reasonable attitude might be adopted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary interest himself in a case where a person coming into this country presented himself to the Customs and submitted a piece of clothing alleged to be a gift?  The Customs authorities accepted it and have refused to return it to him.  Surely that is not in the spirit of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is perfectly satisfied that everything possible is being done to ensure that the utmost courtesy is extended to the people concerned and particularly to tourists, but Deputies will appreciate that these investigations were found necessary because there was what I might call a racket operating and, if some action had to be taken, it was taken with the least possible upset to passengers or to traffic generally.  If there were exceptional cases where people suffered as a result, possibly that could not be avoided but these were very exceptional cases.  In fact, information would go to show that such cases were practically nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary now concedes that additional measures have recently been initiated. May I ask if he will not call for some review of the situation in the light of present information in order to see that zeal is not being carried to excessive lengths?  Nobody wants to protect smugglers but at the same time ordinary people should not be affronted at the airport and other landing places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not denied that special measures have been taken in that lady searchers have been appointed but I have also pointed out that the position is kept under review constantly to ensure that there is no excessive zeal on the part of those carrying out such duties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the value of goods seized from passengers at Dublin Airport in the latest period of three months for which statistics are available, and in the corresponding period in 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period of three months ended 31st October, 1960, the estimated value of dutiable goods seized from passengers arriving at Dublin Airport was £1,225.  The figure for the corresponding period of 1959 was £11.</P>
      <P>In addition there were in both periods seizures of unascertained value of goods prohibited to be imported under the Acts relating to diseases of plants and animals, censorship of publications, explosives etc.  These totalled 397 in the three months ended 31st October, 1960 and 163 in the same months of 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not correct in believing that over comparable periods seizures increased from £11 to over £1,100?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct&mdash;in fact to over £1,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That does suggest that great zeal is being displayed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It also suggests the need that there was to take some special measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not think that some degree of balance should be necessary in this matter?  Is it desirable, for the protection of the revenue to the extent of £1,000 approximately, to create an atmosphere of extreme discomfort and annoyance to the average members of the public passing through the ports? As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, if the seizures made amount to over £1,200 that must represent a very small fraction of the total number of persons passing through the airport and the other points of landing. Is it prudent to create an atmosphere of extreme discomfort and offence for the vast mass of legitimate travellers in order to have the <Col N="319" /> satisfaction of producing these seizures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true, as has been suggested, that extreme measures have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The utmost courtesy prevailed throughout the exercise of these duties which brought in the extra amount in revenue.  As I said before action was only taken as a result of the knowledge and in the light of the knowledge available to the authorities that there was certain organised smuggling on a fairly large scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister call the seizure of £1,100 worth of goods in three months reasonable evidence of an extensive conspiracy among the businessmen and travellers to smuggle? This is fantastic.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary think that £1,100 worth of seizures represents evidence of an elaborate conspiracy to smuggle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it certainly <Col N="320" /> justifies any extra measures that were taken and furthermore I wish to point out that persons who are not involved with smuggling find no difficulty whatever in passing through any of the ports.  They are not unduly harassed by any means.</P>

    <P>Instead of being curtailed, credit for agriculture is being expanded. Bank advances for agricultural purposes have increased from £18,834,000 in July, 1958, to £28,247,000 in July, 1959, and to £33,012,000 in July, 1960.  This represents an increase of <Col N="323" /> 75% between 1958 and 1960.  During the last accounting year of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the twelve months ended April last, a record amount was issued, the total being 2,084 loans amounting to £805,000.  To aid the expansion of the Corporation's activities I propose to introduce in the near future legislation to enlarge the borrowing and lending powers of the Corporation.</P>
    <P>As regards social services, the new scheme of contributory old age pensions will commence in January and various increases in other social welfare benefits have been or are being made under recent legislation.</P>

For instance, there is a hangover from one year to another; persons sentenced in one year may not be committed in that year for one reason or another; in some cases the Probation of Offenders Act may be applied and, also, sentences might be remitted on appeal or might be wiped out in some other way; but there is definitely a relationship.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the reply given by me on 2nd November <Col N="330" /> to a question put by Deputy Cunningham, I have so far this season refused all applications for licences to import feeding or milling oats in order to facilitate the disposal of stocks of good quality home-grown oats, for which there is a demand.  Growers, in their own interests, should market without undue delay such quantity as they may have for sale.</P>
      <P>While the position has not changed since then I would inform the Deputy that I may find it necessary to license imports of oats later on during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that certain people in this country will not use Irish oats or anything of Irish manufacture.  Is the Minister aware that there is a large number of farmers who have disposed of oats at less than £1 per barrel and also a number of farmers who have oats on their hands for which they cannot get sale?  Would the Minister assure the House that except in the most extreme difficulties no feeding oats will be imported?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is conscious of the fact that in any season such as the one through which we have passed there is always bound to be this type of campaign on behalf of those who have and those who want. Those who grow oats, whether in sufficient quantity to meet requirements or not, will naturally wish to see the prohibition retained so that the price will be driven up for them.  There are other interests to be considered, too. There are the oatmeal millers as well as the horse breeders and trainers.  In all this matter one has to try to keep a balance that is fair.  I am naturally anxious to protect to a reasonable extent the people who grow oats here <Col N="331" /> and that I am prepared to do.  However, as I have indicated, those who have oats should offer it for sale when the price is reasonably good because I cannot, and will not, hold my hand for them forever.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any public concern about the matter referred to by the Deputy in his question in connection with the operation of air services between the principal Irish cities.</P>
      <P>The air service between Dublin and Shannon has been in existence since 1946 and there has been no expression of public concern as to its impact on the economics of the rail services between Dublin and Limerick.</P>
      <P>As regards the projected air services between Dublin and Cork and Dublin and Belfast, experience elsewhere has shown that the use of such internal services is largely governed by considerations arising from fare differentials as between air and surface transport.  The existence and value of time differentials and frequency of service between the two forms of transport also play an important part in determining the mode of travel most acceptable to travellers' personal requirements.  Apart from selective factors such as these, experience shows generally that new air services generate a considerable amount of new traffic and that the proportion of traffic diverted from other forms of transport is usually not appreciable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The internal air services to be <Col N="332" /> operated between Dublin and Cork and Belfast will provide connections from Cork and Belfast through the Aer Lingus network to Britain, Europe and also to North America.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Railways Acts, a very wide range of accidents on the railways <Col N="333" /> must be reported to my Department.  The number of accidents so reported in the year ended 30th September, 1960, was 478 consisting of 391 personal injuries, mostly of a minor kind, 68 derailments, 11 diesel fires and 8 other accidents.</P>
    <P>The great bulk of the derailments were of a minor kind involving goods wagons engaged in shunting operations. Seven passengers were injured in one main-line derailment; no other personal injuries were associated with derailments.</P>
    <P>The diesel fires caused no injuries. The total number of accidents reported in the year is not greater than normal. Derailments and fires on trains have, however, been the subject of special examination by C.I.E. in consultation with the Railway Inspecting Officer of my Department.  I am keeping in close touch with the position and I am satisfied that C.I.E., in consultation, as necessary, with the Railway Inspecting Officer, are taking all necessary remedial measures to minimise the incidence of these occurrences.</P>
    <P>The accident figures are related to some 12-million passenger journeys per annum involving about 340-million passenger miles and to approximately 60-million loaded wagon miles per annum.  Very few of the personal injuries, moreover, arose from train accidents and the figures include all sorts of minor mishaps occurring on the railway.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital necessary for the purchase by Aerlinte Éireann Teo. of aircraft for the transatlantic service is being provided by the Government by way of investment by the Minister for Finance in Aer Rianta Teo.  The latter company in turn takes up, for cash, an equivalent number of shares in Aerlinte Éireann Teo.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question I am fully satisfied that such investment in Aerlinte is justified.  This view, I may say, is amply supported by the increases in transatlantic traffic and by American Tourists' expenditure in this country.</P>
      <P>American tourist expenditure is increasing at the rate of $1 million a year.  A greater increase is only possible if more capital is invested in transport and other tourist services. This capital expenditure will <i>inter alia</i> (1) markedly increase the consumption of agricultural produce each year; (2) add notably to employment in hotel and other services.  The interest on the total capital invested in transatlantic aircraft will represent only £2 15s. Od. per terminal passenger taking the number estimated for the single year 1965.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the unfinished state of cottages at Foxford, County Mayo, and that their present state is a danger to the health of the tenants and the public generally; and if he will state when they will be <Col N="338" /> completed, and if the water and sanitation will soon be supplied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Two groups of county council cottages at Foxford have been provided with chemical closets pending the provision of a sewerage system for the town and one of the groups has not yet been connected to the public water supply. These sanitary arrangements do not constitute a danger to public health.  It is the intention to provide full services in all the cottages when the sewerage scheme for Foxford is completed.  It is expected that this scheme will commence early in the new year.</P>

Schemes differ in detail and it is not indicated in every scheme if such allowances are excluded. No scheme provides specifically that children's allowances are to be included in income assessable for rent.</P>

In the course of that discussion I intimated that I considered it equitable to allow a claim where the break in employment in any year is not greater than one month.  I have expressed the same opinion to all local authorities who have approached me in the matter. I do not consider that a statutory provision to the effect suggested by the Deputy is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Kyne</b> asked the Minister for Local Government whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that the closing of the Waterford-Tramore railway line and the substitution of a double-decker bus service will result in an enormous increase in road maintenance costs to ensure safe travelling conditions and in a consequent huge increase in rates which will have to be paid by the ratepayers of the city and county of Waterford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the city section of the Waterford-Tramore road is concerned, I understand that the City Engineer considers that there is a possibility that the road may deteriorate under heavy traffic but that he was unable to give a quantitative estimate of expected damage.  The additional Córas Iompair Éireann traffic will be considerably lighter than that envisaged by the City Engineer, and the technical information available to me does not indicate that it will cause appreciable damage.  If extra maintenance does become necessary, the Corporation may charge the usual proportion of the expenditure to the Main Road Upkeep Grant.  Prior to any announcement of railway closing the Corporation had submitted proposals for flood-relief work in relation to this road.</P>
      <P>I have received no communication from Waterford County Council in regard to their section of the road, but the same general principles apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the City Engineer estimates that the maintenance increase per year will be as high as £5,000 for that portion of the road?  On that basis, it is to be assumed, with double that portion in the county, that the increase in rates for the balance of the county road will be £10,000.  That will be a total of £15,000 per year increase to be paid by the ratepayers in Waterford.  C.I.E. <Col N="343" /> are losing only £3,000 a year on the rail service.  Surely the Government cannot accept this false economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this road passes over a swamp? Is he aware that his Department is giving a grant to the Tipperary County Council of £54,000 to do a road of I mile and one-eighth?  This road is over 2 miles long.  Is the Minister aware that if this heavy bus service is put on this road over a swamp, the road will cost over £100,000?  Would the Minister consider it worth his while sending some of his engineering staff down to Waterford to consult with the Borough Surveyor?  The Borough Surveyor has already stated that the short portion within the city will cost at least £5,000 a year to maintain due to bus traffic being put on the road.</P>

Deputy Flynn was present in the House on Wednesday last and his death on Thursday night came as a shock to all of us.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy has represented the Constituency of Sligo-Leitrim in the Dáil continuously since he was first elected at the General Election in 1932. He has also served the people of County Leitrim as a member of the Leitrim County Council since 1925; he had been Chairman of that body continuously for over 25 years up to the date of his death, and he served on a number of its Committees.</P>
      <P>Since his youth he was actively associated in the nation's struggle for freedom&mdash;in Sinn Féin, in the Volunteers and in the I.R.A.  He underwent more than one period of imprisonment and participated in a hunger-strike.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn was one of the quietest, kindliest and most unassuming of men.  He will be sadly missed by his colleagues in the Dáil and, indeed, by all the members of the House, but he will be missed most of all by his constituents, for whose interests he worked untiringly both as a Deputy and as a member of the local bodies on which he served.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this amendment, which I am moving on behalf of Deputy Declan Costello, it seeks to give effect to a principle which we have tried to maintain in regard to this Bill as a whole.  The plain fact is that once a <Col N="360" /> community gets involved in the whole complex of rent restrictions, a whole series of inequities build up over the years.  We have had rent restriction in this country in one form or another for over 40 years.  We all know perfectly well there are many deserving landlords here whose premises are set at uneconomic rents and whose circumstances demand sympathetic consideration. On the other hand, we all know that as a survival of the whole system of rent restriction you have many families living in controlled houses and if there were any serious increase in their rent, their economic survival would become virtually impossible. The ideal condition is that there should be enough houses for everybody, and perhaps a modest surplus, so that rent agreements between tenants and landlords would be fair and equitable agreements between willing vendors and willing purchasers. But so long as the shortage of housing accommodation continues there remains this residual problem of hardship on landlords and hardship on tenants.</P>
    <P>Our approach to this Bill has been that we sought to divide these cases into three broad categories&mdash;the circumstances of the sitting tenant, the circumstances of the vacated premises and the circumstances of the premises that have never been subject to rent control at all, those subsequent to 1941.  We have felt that the post-1941 premises are reasonably provided for and that, in the case of premises constructed prior to that vital date, on their being vacated it was reasonable to allow landlords to have some equitable adjustment of the rent receivable in respect of these premises.</P>
    <P>In that connection it is right to recall to the Deputies on all sides of the House that the word &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; in this country has become so associated in the minds of our people with ancient historic events connected with the Land War and so forth, that people are liable to forget that a considerable number of the landlords affected by these Rent Restriction Bills are in fact people in very modest circumstances who have been left small properties out of which to get their living.  You <Col N="361" /> frequently discover on investigation of who a landlord is that you are dealing with an elderly widow or elderly people in straitened circumstances who have a very exiguous income from rents receivable in respect of small parcels of property commonly bequeathed to them.  That should not close our minds to the other fact, and that is when you have had rent restriction operating over a period of 40 years a large body of enterprising speculators have bought houses subject to rent control, and the purchase price they paid for those houses was calculated in the knowledge that the premises they were purchasing were subject to rent control.</P>
    <P>Those are merely two complications of this extremely complex and difficult subject.  Then you come to the premises that are occupied by people in very modest circumstances and who, maybe for 20 or 25 years, have been paying what everybody is prepared to concede today is, in their present circumstances, an uneconomic rent. You have got to weigh the equity to see that substantial justice is done. pending the realisation of ideal justice. But you cannot have on the road to reform a social revolution every morning. If sitting tenants are to be made subject to pretty stiff rent increases, what seems to be a trivial matter to Members of this House may be a very severe burden on people in modest circumstances.</P>
    <P>Half-a-crown may not be much to any of us sitting here but it may be a very grave burden on people living on small premises many of which fall within the category of occupied premises under existing rent restriction law.  Nor should we forget that into this category of sitting tenants, as I understand it, will fall a considerable number of small shopkeepers who are transacting business on a minimal scale, who may find an increase in rent to be the last straw that breaks the camel's back.  I refer to people who do a little trading in vegetables or sweets or in businesses of that kind, which scarcely qualify for the description of a shop and yet is the sole means of survival for a little family trying to maintain its independence and is succeeding in doing so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> We feel that in trying to unravel this 40-years-old tangle of rent restriction and control we ought to accept the principle that for the present a sitting tenant should not be subjected to the arbitrary increase in their rent. There is provision in existing legislation, as I understand it, that where a landlord carries out a certain type of repair he may have recourse to the appropriate authorities to have an adjustment in the rent fixed which bears a relation to the capital cost of the repairs he has carried out.  But this is a proposal for a general, all-round increase in rents on sitting tenants.  I do not deny that you will find cases in which it is a very hard thing&mdash;much harder on the proprietor&mdash;to deny him the right to this flat increase than it would be for the sitting tenant to pay, but hard cases make bad law and taking the general picture, we feel that there should not be an arbitrary right to increase rents in respect of sitting tenants.</P>
    <P>This is not the last Bill that will ever be passed in regard to rent control; it is by no means the first and the general tendency has been towards the relaxation of control and, as our supply of houses and accommodation approximates more closely to the total demand, the need for rent control will steadily decline.  We feel, in existing circumstances, the balance of equity and of good social progress demands that there should be that concession in respect of sitting tenants.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may say that there are cases of the most acute difficulty in which the rent paid by the tenant bears no relation to the economic value of the house and that the landlord urgently requires relief.  Such cases may exist&mdash;I have no doubt some would come to light if a detailed investigation were made&mdash;but there are two prospective avenues open to the landlord in those circumstances.  One is the effluxion of time which means that ordinarily the tenant will move out leaving the premises vacant and the landlord greater freedom to adjust the rent in respect of an incoming tenant. The other is, if the landlord urgently wishes to get control of the premises <Col N="363" /> and is in a position to do so and is able to afford it, it is usually possible to offer some monetary inducement to the sitting tenant to secure a vacant premises when the landlord can make adjustments in accordance with the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Even with those two reliefs present to our minds, we must not close our eyes to the fact that there may remain certain hard cases and in respect of that, all I can say is that one has to balance one evil against another.  I suggest that we would be gravely mitigating the inconvenience or hardship which would arise from a proposal to increase rent on all sitting tenants in the country if we abandon that proposal and accept the proposition that these arbitrary increases will not be allowed in respect of sitting tenants whereas in respect of vacant premises or post-1941 premises there will either be a degree of freedom or total freedom to settle the rent as between tenant and landlord.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that it is not present to our mind&mdash;and it should not be present to the mind of any fair-minded Deputy&mdash;to represent all landlords as being wealthy proprietors as opposed to tenants who are universally impoverished or in straitened circumstances. Nor would it be honest to make the alternative case that all landlords are people who own these premises and have seen their incomes depreciating over the years, because that is not true.  A great many of these premises were acquired subject to rent control and therefore any arbitrary increase in rent is a purely uncovenanted benefit for the person who bought the house 10 or 15 years ago and who paid a price for it that had regard to the existence of rent restrictions. We should not dismiss from our minds that even though we accept the principle that there should be no increase on sitting tenants that does not create a rigid, unalterable situation between proprietor and tenant because there still remains open the remedy provided by the effluxion of time on the one hand, which may result in the tenant voluntarily moving away or the possibility of the landlord on the other <Col N="364" /> hand making some deal with the tenant to relinquish his tenancy for some modest capital sum.</P>
    <P>I am not seeking to suggest that this proposal is founded on any basic ethical principle; I am simply trying to commend to the House a remedy for an existing situation, in which we cannot escape, no matter how we approach it in legislation, from a residue of hardship somewhere.  Our aim is to produce the minimum hardship and to effect the maximum reform, and I think the Government would be wise to accept the principle which the amendment seeks to affirm. If the terms of this amendment do not conveniently produce it, it would be very easy on Report Stage to find a suitable form of words to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to point out that the amendment deals solely with premises let solely for business purposes. In approaching this problem the Government, first of all, considered the Conroy Commission's recommendation on the matter.  That Commission said that they could see no reason why the Rent Acts should continue to apply to purely business premises.  At present these Acts apply only to a very limited number of these business premises that is, to purely business premises let on less than yearly tenancies.  Any purely business premises let on longer tenancies are outside the scope of the Acts.  The Acts apply also to premises which are mixed premises; in other words, to lettings made for both business and residential purposes.</P>
      <P>The theory of the Rent Acts, the purpose which informs the legislation, is to extend protection to tenants in regard to one of the necessaries of life, namely, their residence, their home, the roof over their head.  There is a separate code of legislation dealing with business premises.  Those who occupy business premises are protected by the Landlord and Tenant Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is confusion of thought to regard the Rent Restrictions Act as being properly applicable to purely business premises.  As I say, the Conroy Commission could see no reason for continuing <Col N="365" /> this control and the Government agreed with the recommendation of the Conroy Commission, but the Government were careful to retain control in any case where a residence was involved.</P>
    <P>In the case where we are removing control, that is, the purely business premises, we are giving the tenants affected immediate access to the benefits of the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  In other words, they can procure a 21 year lease at a fair rent.  If that rent cannot be agreed between himself and the landlord, then it will be settled by the court.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to suggest that we are being unfair to the tenants of these types of premises.  We are removing the protection of the Rent Acts from these types of premises but we are immediately giving the tenants concerned access to the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  I think that is a perfectly satisfactory solution to the situation and it is the one recommended by the Conroy Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the worst features of this Bill is the decontrol of business premises.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the legislation dealing with rent control does not apply to business premises let on yearly tenancies or for longer periods, and that is so.  The type of premises which were controlled under the 1946 Act were the small businesses carried on on weekly tenancies where the tenant was trying to make, as best he could, a living out of a small business, perhaps in a back street in this city or in a small country town. We are now going to raise the rent on that tenant.  I see no justification for doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a theoretical argument which the Conroy Commission gave and which the Parliamentary Secretary has repeated, namely, that the Rent Restrictions Act was never intended to cover business premises.  The Parliamentary Secretary suggested that there is confusion of thought in believing that the Rent Restrictions Act could cover business premises.  If such confusion of thought exists, it has <Col N="366" /> existed for a great number of years and this Oireachtas, at the instigation of the Party which was forming the Government, of which the Parliamentary Secretary is a member, in 1946 continued the protection given to the small type of business premises with which we are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not terribly concerned with the wealthy businessman who is able to bargain and who may be in a strong bargaining position with the landlord, but I am concerned with the tenant of a small business who is trying to make his livelihood as best he can out of the business and who is not in a strong position even to bargain with the landlord or to pay an increased rent.  What we are doing in this proposed legislation is increasing the rent on all small businesses throughout Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not follow that because it is let on less than a yearly tenancy, it must be a small or unprofitable business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary does not accept my generalisation, I shall put it this way, that most of the small businesses with which we are all concerned, certainly with which I am concerned in the city of Dublin and with which, I venture to suggest, country Deputies are concerned in their own constituencies, are carried on in premises the rent of which is controlled.</P>
      <P>We are going to put up the rent on those people.  Why are we doing that? There is some theoretical argument that there was confusion of thought which has lasted for about 30 years. Why are we suddenly to find that we have been confused for all this period and decide to put this confusion right and increase the rents on all these tenants?</P>

    <P>We can argue the position with regard to private dwelling-houses.  The suggestion of the Government, which I do not accept, is that there has been an increase in the supply of dwelling-houses suitable for letting and that the dangers which are anticipated, namely, of extortionate rents being demanded, will not arise in the case of dwelling-houses. <Col N="367" /> That does not apply in the case of businesses.  There has not been an increase in the number of premises available for letting in the form of businesses that would warrant the decontrol of business premises.</P>
    <P>Take any of the back streets in the city of Dublin.  There are still the same number of business premises there and there will not be a great supply of business premises available to tenants who will have to face the alternative of giving up their business or paying a higher rent.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Rent Acts are meant to cover only the necessaries of life.  In fact, what we are doing is increasing the rent on premises from which the tenant earns money to pay for the necessaries of life.  I am sure there is not a Deputy who is not familiar with the small businesses selling fuel, tobacco, cigarettes, old clothes, all sorts of minor things, out of which the tenant is just able to make a living.  I see no reason why this legislature should increase that man's rent.  That is what we are doing.</P>

      <P>These tenants have absolute security of tenure.  They are perfectly content the way they are If they had to decide between a 21-year lease at 50 per cent. more rent and staying the way they are, I know which way they would choose.  There are arguments which can be put up in theory with regard to dwelling-houses and I do not accept them.  However, in regard to business premises, I do not see any justification for increasing the rent of such tenants.  It has been the boast of this Government that this Bill does not affect sitting tenants. When that statement comes to be analysed in more detail it is then qualified: it does not affect sitting tenants of dwelling-houses.  Why affect the sitting tenants of business premises? We are making a very modest suggestion in this amendment.  All we propose is to leave the <i>status quo</i> of sitting tenants.  If decontrol of these premises is insisted upon, decontrol <Col N="369" /> them in the future but do not decontrol sitting tenants.  That seems to me to be a reasonable suggestion. It is in keeping with the declared intention of the Government that they do not want to affect the position of sitting tenants.  I would ask the House to pass this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with one point made by Deputy Costello. He seems to imagine that merely because a business premises is let on a less than yearly tenancy it must automatically be a small, struggling business in a back street.  Of course that just is not so.  That is an oversimplification of the position.  Deputy Costello stated that he was not concerned with the large, wealthy businessman who is a tenant of a premises but his amendment does not make any distinction.  If we were to accept the amendment we would continue to extend the benefits of the Rent Acts to these large, wealthy businessmen who happen to have business premises which they occupy on less than yearly tenancies.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill, Deputy Costello spoke at some length and with a great deal of conviction about the expertness of the Conroy Commission which had been set up to deal with this problem, and berated the Government for not accepting certain of their recommendations.  He cannot have it both ways.  This is a clearcut recommendation of the Conroy Commission.  If they were an expert commission and if they were as good as Deputy Costello said they were on the Second Stage&mdash;and I have no doubt that they were&mdash;why can he not accept this recommendation as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello asks what is the reason for this.  Surely the reason is obvious to the House.  The rent of a business premises is a different thing altogether from the rent payable for one's residence.  Rent payable by a businessman for his business premises is one of the ordinary outgoings like rates, electric light and other overheads. It is not a necessary of life. The Rent Acts are there to deal with the rent of one's accommodation, a <Col N="370" /> necessary of life.  It is wrong to extend the protection of the Rent Acts to premises which are purely business premises.</P>
    <P>Why should one businessman, just because he happens to have a yearly tenancy, have to pay the full market rent for his premises while his next door neighbour, because he has a technically different letting, gets the benefit of rent control?  Why should landlords be expected to subsidise businessmen?  That is what it amounts to.  You are asking the landlord to subsidise the businessman who has a certain type of letting.  There is no logic in it and no justification for it.  I am reinforced in my opinion by the categorical recommendation of the Conroy Commission.  I cannot see any logic in the arguments which Deputy Costello is putting up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, I think the case made by Deputy Costello on this amendment is unanswerable.  It is no answer for the Parliamentary Secretary to make the point, which I grant him is a correct one but merely a debating point, that it is not only small businesses and poor tenants who have got the protection afforded by the Rent Acts.  I grant the Parliamentary Secretary that there are some wealthy tenants carrying on comparatively large businesses on their premises, that is, business premises that are held on a weekly basis and, therefore, controlled under the 1946 Act.  But by and large, certainly in the city of Dublin, the type of person who carries on a business in a lock-up shop or as a weekly tenant is a small businessman and any increase will mean a lot to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not discuss this amendment with Deputy Costello before he put it down but I take it he has not gone as far as he might.  There is a recognition that eventually decontrol will come.  It will come gradually but what Deputy Costello is suggesting is that, as far as people at present in occupation of these tenancies are concerned, we should not by legislative action here deprive them of rights which they now have, rights which both they and their landlords believed they would continue <Col N="371" /> to have when they acquired their interest in the premises.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary conceded last week in answer to a question by Deputy Seán Flanagan that any of these people who, under the terms of the Bill we are discussing, must rely on the provision which gives them a right to come under the Landlord and Tenant Act, will have their rents increased. I think the Parliamentary Secretary was realist enough to face that and to state it in this House.  I do not think it is right that we should force these people into the position that if they want to hold on to their premises, to hold on to a business connection which possibly they built up over a long number of years, they can only do that at the expense of an increase which as Deputy Costello mentioned, may be as high as 50 per cent. on the rent they are now paying.</P>

      <P>I have been a legal practitioner for 20 years and I know something about what a tenant, or anyone else, considers valuable, the respective merits of long leases and short leases, and protected tenancies.  I have no hesitation at all in agreeing with the viewpoint expressed by Deputy Declan Costello.  Many of the people in controlled business premises regard the fact that they are controlled under the Rent Restrictions Act as far more valuable than a 21-year lease, or a longer lease.  As Deputy Costello pointed out, the test of the accuracy of that statement is the fact that, if they did not have that, they would not have been at all shy about going to their landlord and saying: &ldquo;Look here.  The Legislature is protecting us by the Rent Restrictions Act.  We do not want the protection.  Give us a long lease instead.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many of them did that?  The Parliamentary Secretary says quite a number.  I should be very surprised if <Col N="373" /> he has any statistics at all to show that that was done voluntarily in any significant number of cases in the last 12 or 14 years in the city of Dublin.  I recognise that the tendency probably will be towards gradual decontrol. This Bill is one step in that direction. What Deputy Costello asks is that we should exempt from this provision the tenant who is in occupation of a small business premises at the date of the passing of this Act.  He does not ask that the protection sought should carry on to his successor in business, his legal personal representative, his next-of-kin, or anyone else.  All he asks is that we should be fair to the person who is in actual occupation now and not interfere with him in the way in which it is proposed to interfere with him in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered from something the Parliamentary Secretary said a short time ago that his objection to this amendment arises from the fact that there is no distinction between the large and the small businessman.  I feel the Parliamentary Secretary has some sympathy with the type of tenant for whom Deputy Costello speaks. Deputy Costello has confined himself in the course of the discussion on this amendment to the small businessman. If the Parliamentary Secretary's only objection to the amendment is that it does not differentiate as between the small businessman and the large businessman, possibly some compromise can be reached whereby the small businessman will retain the rights given to him by this Parliament over the last 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for my own and neigh-bouring constituencies, and as a legal practitioner over a number of years, I should like to disabuse the Parliamentary Secretary of the idea that tenants of small businesses are most anxious to get leases because they feel they might have some valuable commodity which could be the subject of commerce subsequently.  Most of these people have never heard of the Landlord and Tenant Act.  They do not know that a lease is of any use to them.  What they really want is to hold on to their present tenancy, subject to any small increase permitted by <Col N="374" /> this measure.  Deputy Costello does not attempt to speak for their heirs, assigns, or anyone else.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this amendment is eminently reasonable.  All it asks is that the small man should be left as he is to enjoy the frugal benefits of such profits as he makes selling matches and an occasional copy of the <i>Irish Press</i> and not forced to take a lease under the Landlord and Tenant Act at what the Landlord and Tenant Act is pleased to call a &ldquo;fair rent&rdquo;. Feeling from the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks that his objection to the amendment is because there is no distinction between the big business and the small business, I would ask him to pay some attention to the plight of the man with the small business, to show some consideration to him, and let the big businessman look after himself under the Landlord and Tenant Act.</P>

      <P>In many ways we seem to be chasing shadows on this amendment. The supporters of the amendment have made their case, a case based on a very strong expression of concern and sympathy for the small man.  The Parliamentary Secretary implied that he also is concerned with the small man but he has to overlook the case made on his behalf because he wants to get at the big fellow under this section.  I think everyone is genuinely concerned and sympathetic where the small shopkeeper is concerned. Surely it is not outside the ability of the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers so to re-draft the section as to meet the case made by the opposition for the small man while, at the same time, containing the case he apparently wishes to make.  He cannot have it both ways.  He cannot state that he has sympathy and concern in relation to the people mentioned but because the section deals with the big man he can do nothing.  Of course he can do something.  I appeal to him to have another look at the section from that point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express some opinions based on the little experience I have had.  There are various types of business.  When one talks about business one generally <Col N="375" /> visualises people with money in the bank, and that sort of thing.  There are thousands of one-man businesses. In the strict sense they are not businesses at all.  They are just a living.  Under this provision those people could be asked to pay excessive rents.  I believe landlords will avail of any opportunity given to them. It is all very fine to say the Court can decide.  Small business people, with little education, do not like invoking the law and it will be possible to blackmail them into paying a substantial increase in rent, the more so if they fear that a court action might involve them not only in their own costs but in the landlord's costs as well.</P>
      <P>The landlords are very clever and they can threaten and frighten people into paying substantial increases in rent.  I wonder has the Parliamentary Secretary any way of protecting those small people?  Suppose the landlord says to them: &ldquo;Your rent is up 50 or 100 per cent.&rdquo;, what protection has such a person?  If he goes to the courts he is likely to be faced with costs.</P>

      <P>In the case of the <Col N="376" /> small business, the rates are usually included in the rent and the people generally do their repair work themselves. In most cases there has been little or no costs on the landlord for a number of years.  I am talking about the small businessman who works on his own and who is getting a bare existence out of his shop, not about the man who makes £100 a week or so. Have you any protection for him? What protection have you for such a man against the landlord who will incur a bill of costs of £20 or £40?  These people have a habit of employing junior and senior counsel to fight their tenants.  I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should consider the case of these small people and there are quite a number of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment although some people imagine that businesses are divided into two categories, large and small.  There are a big number of interim businesses.  I have had experience of such tenancies in which the rent bears no relation whatever to present-day fair values.  I do not think it would be right to continue to subsidise these traders at the expense of the smaller business as well as the larger business.  Some provision must be made to enable the landlord to get an equitable adjustment of the rent in such cases.</P>
      <P>I join with the Fine Gael Deputies who have spoken in favour of protecting the small businessman.  If the Minister could bring in some amendment to give such protection I would be in favour of it, although I cannot see how he can do so.  At the same time I would say that the Minister should give the landlord the right to secure an adjustment in the case of the medium businesses.  If you pass the Bill as it is now and include all businesses in a less than yearly tenancy, the small man is bound to suffer unless some amendment can be thought of to safeguard his interests. If the Parliamentary Secretary can do that I shall be quite satisfied but I do not know if he can do it.</P>

I want to point out again the protection that we are giving in this Bill.  The present Rent Acts apply to purely business premises and to mixed premises.  We are retaining control in the case of the mixed premises and that accounts for a large number of the small business premises.  I want to point out to the House the situation that often exists. A landlord lets a mixed premises and the rent he gets is controlled.  The tenant sublets the business portion as a purely business letting and that letting is uncontrolled.  There you have the absurd situation of a tenant receiving from a subtenant a rent which may be considerably higher than what he is paying himself.</P>

If that cannot be done by agreement between the landlord and tenant, the court will fix a fair rent.  The Court will determine the open market rent and in doing so will take all factors into account.</P>
      <P>It is very significant that the Conroy Commission&mdash;which was a commission dedicated to control all dwellings, past and future, furnished or unfurnished &mdash;recommended this one particular form of decontrol.  In doing this they must have been influenced by pretty solid knowledge and belief when they, who were advocating a whole sea of controls, should have advocated this one drop of decontrol.  I think I can only repeat that we have not had a single representation from this type of person.  We have had representations about the Bill from the various interests but not a single occupant of this category has made representations.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Sherwin has a point and that the Parliamentary Secretary has not answered it.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that these small business men who are controlled under the 1946 Act are getting a fair &ldquo;do&rdquo; because they are getting security, a long lease, and a fair rent.  That fairly summarises the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The three blessings which the Parliamentary Secretary says he is bestowing on these tenants are, one by one, security of tenure, a long lease, and a fair rent.  They will have security of tenure only so long as we do not interfere with them.</P>

These people have security of tenure so long as we do not interfere with them under this Bill. The second blessing the Parliamentary Secretary proposes to bestow is the long lease and it is here, I think, that Deputy Sherwin is quite right.  Many of those people will not regard a long lease as a blessing.  They will be afraid of tying themselves up for twenty-one years.</P>

      <P>A lease cuts both ways.  If the tenant accepts a lease for twenty-one years at a considerably higher rent than he has been paying, he is going to be obliged for twenty-one years to bear the burden of that rent unless he can shuffle it off on somebody else.  But he may not be able to do that for many reasons. The character of the neighbourhood may have changed and he may be stuck with the lease for twenty-one years at a considerably higher rent.  If we leave him alone the position about his tenure is secure and he is not obliged to stay on the premises a day longer than he wants to.  He is not binding himself for twenty-one years and it is there, I think, Deputy Sherwin is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third blessing the Parliamentary Secretary says he is bestowing is that they are going to have a fair rent.  In fact it is recognised by everybody, including the Parliamentary Secretary, that the fair rent he is talking about is going to be considerably higher than those people are paying to-day&mdash;than they covenanted and contracted to pay when they went into the premises as controlled premises&mdash;premises that <Col N="380" /> were afforded the protection of the Act.</P>
    <P>It is not the landlord who is interfering. It is this House that is interfering. We are saying: &ldquo;You will be protected no longer; we are going to alter your arrangement with the landlord so that if you stay on you will have to pay a considerably higher rent than you are paying at the moment.&rdquo; The Parliamentary Secretary says this argument means that I am against a landlord getting a fair rent.  I am not, but I am against this House interfering as between landlord and tenant.</P>
    <P>Why should we step in now and alter the old basis and force the tenant to pay a considerably higher rent? Deputy Sherwin may be interested in one paragraph of the Conroy Report. It deals with the termination of a tenancy.  Paragraph 99 of the report says:</P>
    <P>The tenancy which a tenant can claim is a new lease for a term of not less than twenty-one years and not exceeding 99 years at a rent which the court estimates a willing lessee not in occupation would give and a willing lessor would take for the premises if vacant possession were given and if the supply of similar premises were sufficient to meet the demand.  The court will also have regard to the other terms of the tenancy and to the letting values of similar premises in the vicinity but not to any good will which may exist in the premises.</P>
    <P>There follows a sentence to which I would call the Parliamentary Secretary's especial attention:</P>
    <P>The rent under the new lease usually is considerably higher than the restricted rent permitted by the Rent Act.</P>
    <P>So the Parliamentary Secretary cannot avoid, if he accepts the Conroy Commission Report, as indeed he does, accepting the position that the rents of these unfortunate people will be considerably higher than the rent payable under the protection afforded by the Rent Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put <Col N="381" /> two questions to the Parliamentary Secretary: (1) whether the Government has inquired what percentage increase is likely to occur when tenants get rents fixed under the Landlord and Tenant Act and (2), if so, what that percentage is likely to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done our best to estimate what the effects of this are likely to be and I think Deputy Costello should realise that to attempt to ascertain a percentage of that nature is just absurd.  The only thing we do stand on is that it will be a fair rent&mdash; that the provisions which we are making immediately available to this type of tenant are such that they will be entitled to retain their premises at a fair rent which will be decided by the court, taking all factors into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that we are going over the same ground again.  I want to reiterate the fundamental principle in this matter.  There is no doubt in my mind that it is the principle the Conroy Commission had in mind when making their recommendations.  The Landlord and Tenant Acts are there to regulate the affairs of business tenants.  The Rent Restrictions Acts are there as a social necessity to cover the position of people occupying certain premises for the purpose of their own residence, <Col N="382" /> to provide themselves with a roof over their heads.  The Rent Restrictions Acts are properly applicable to that type of living accommodation; the Landlord and Tenant Acts are properly applicable to business premises.  By this provision and by rejecting the Deputy's amendment we are simply transferring this type of premises to where it belongs, namely, to the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts, which cover all other business premises with the exception of this type of premises.</P>
    <P>Deputies are wrong in thinking we are dealing only with small business premises.  That is not the issue.  This category is covered by the type of letting. It can be big or small.  It is misleading to attempt to convey to Deputies that this refers only to small business premises.  There are large and small business premises already outside the scope of the Acts, and there are large and small premises within the scope of the Acts.  We are taking all business premises, which are used solely for business purposes, and putting them where they properly belong, namely, under the scope and provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts.  I think we are quite justified, in theory and in practice, in doing that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (d), page 5, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;or&rdquo; in line 8 down to and including &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; in line 10.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete certain words in Section 3, subsection (d).  As I understand it, this subsection (d) provides that certain dwellings would be excluded from the provisions of this Bill and excluded from the Rent Restrictions Acts.  I am aware that over the years dwellings which come under the heading of fully furnished apartments or part-furnished apartments, are not covered by the Rent Restrictions Acts but the terms of this subsection appear to extend the conditions and circumstances which would exclude dwellings from the Act by the statement &ldquo;or use of furniture, or for the supply to the dwelling of heat, hot water, fuel, electricity or any other commodity...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he agrees that this interpretation is correct and whether this subsection would have the effect, in the case of a dwelling let under what is called a reserved rent, of excluding such dwelling if, for instance, a landlord provides heat only in some form, or if he provides hot water or fuel or electricity as any single item.</P>
      <P>My concern arises from the fact that over the years tenants in furnished apartments, tenants in dwellings let on the basis of being furnished, did not have the protection of the Rent Restrictions Act and there was the problem also of those tenants who were covered under the term &ldquo;part-furnished.&rdquo; In hundreds of cases there has been the experience of part-furnished meaning the installation of a chair, bed, table, or one or two other articles of furniture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> I moved the amendment specifically to clear up the concern I have in this matter.  If the subsection would permit a landlord to avail of the provisions so as to have a dwelling taken from under the protection of the Rent Acts and this Bill, I would insist on pressing the amendment but if the Parliamentary Secretary can explain that it is for some other purpose and would not have that effect so far as the tenants are concerned, I would be prepared to look at it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Larkin is under a slight misapprehension as to the exact effect his amendment would have.  This is not a new provision.  Identical words were inserted in the 1946 Act and all types of accommodation of this nature have been out of control since then.  If we were to accept the amendment and to delete these words we would bring all that type of accommodation under control.  In some cases we would control it for the first time and in other cases we would bring it back into control.  These exact words were inserted in the 1946 Act&mdash;14 years ago&mdash; and since then there has not been a single word of complaint about them. I think that I can assure Deputy Larkin that there is no danger of the sort of thing he visualises happening.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, the wording of paragraph (d) is such that the installation would have to constitute a substantial installation.  It would have to be of such a nature that when the Court would apportion the rent at least 25 per cent. would be attributable to it.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances, I think I can have no hesitation in assuring Deputy Larkin that there is no danger at all of this paragraph being used as a device to take accommodation which, properly speaking, should be within the Rent Acts outside their scope.  I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment because it will have the effect of bringing all this type of accommodation, which was never intended to be within the scope of the Rent Acts, under control.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) page 5, to delete paragraph <i>(e).</i></P>
      <P>The section as it stands at the moment contains a very objectionable feature which was fully debated in the Seanad.  I do not think there is any great need to traverse the same country again in the Dáil, but we should like to stress the fact that we regard it as quite objectionable that a house which will continue to be controlled after the passage of this Bill can at a future date be decontrolled by the simple expedient of the owner taking up occupation in the house at any future date.</P>
      <P>The words used in the section to which I refer describe a house which &ldquo;at the passing of this Act is occupied by the owner thereof for the purposes of his own residence or thereafter becomes so occupied.&rdquo;  Whatever case might be made&mdash;with which we would not at all agree&mdash;in respect of a house actually occupied by the owner at the time of the passing of this Bill, no case at all can be made in respect of future occupation by the owner for any time at all.  There is no time specified in the Bill.  It appears to me to be open to all sorts of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The owner of a house on which the rent is controlled can by some device or other occupy it for a time, conform with this Bill, and immediately thereafter there is absolutely no control on the rent of the house for future lettings.  In referring to occupation by the owner no period is mentioned in the Bill.  It does not say that he is to occupy it for five years or one year <Col N="387" /> or a month.  My interpretation is that all he needs to do is to move in there for a week or even for a night and he will satisfy the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Some case may be made in relation to a house that is at present occupied by the owner.  A case can even be made for the owner who <i>bona fide</i> subsequently takes up occupation of his own house.  But, the thing is wide open to all sorts of abuse.  If the section is not redrafted it will give rise to all sorts of devices by people who would wish to avail of them to have a house which they now own, which is let under a controlled rent, decontrolled forever, to the detriment of subsequent tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would just wait a moment, I shall mention some of them.  If a landlord treats a tenant in a certain fashion he can wear him down gradually so that he will get out of the place.  On the other hand it might pay a landlord well to entice the tenant out by passing over a sum of money and the tenant may be in a position that £10 or £20 might be a large amount of money to him at that time and could be enticed out in that way.  It is to all that sort of abuse that I am referring the Parliamentary Secretary when I ask him to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Casey in the amendment for these general reasons, that there have <Col N="388" /> been, as far as this city is concerned over a number of years, various attempts by unscrupulous landlords to get possession of premises for the purpose of having matters dealt with in such a way that subsequent tenants will not have the protection of the Rent Acts.  In this section, as Deputy Casey said, if the owner of a house obtains possession, even though he may be an owner of a week's standing, that house forever is free of rent restriction.</P>
      <P>It has not been unknown for landlords, apart from using non-cooperation almost approaching terrorism in some cases, to use economic inducements, where tenants and their families may be in serious necessity, in order to get possession of a dwelling-house. As far as I can see, if an owner of a house to-day proceeds to sell the house to somebody else that person, being the owner, can come along the following day and seek to get possession for his own residence; he can vacate the house again, re-sell it and then the house is no longer controlled.  The effect of this section appears to be that the owner need only be in possession for five minutes&mdash;it does not specify who the owner is or suggest that the owner should be of long standing and <i>bona fide</i> and then the house is no longer covered by the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a loophole in this desirable social legislation.  An increasing number of tenants would find that they were being exposed to various types of pressure in connection with the houses which they were occupying. It is not easy to accept that they have protection of the law which would guarantee them against losing them the tenancy of their house.  If the owner fails to carry out some essential repairs, the tenant may not be able to afford, because of the high legal expenses, to take the landlord to court to compel the owner to do what is required of him.  The house may deteriorate to such an extent that the tenant may lose hope of ever succeeding in having the house put into a habitable condition. I am not suggesting that all landlords are bad; there are some good ones but the history of landlords in <Col N="389" /> places like the city of Dublin is a very murky history and the tenants need all the protection these Acts can give them.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary to use the word but if one read the newspapers of recent weeks in which it appeared that local authorities have been seeking permission under C.P.O. to acquire property for clearance areas, one would discover from the evidence given on behalf of the landlords that the properties the local authorities were seeking required an expenditure of only a very small amount of money.  As against that, the evidence on the other side, which has been substantially accepted, was that thousands and thousands of pounds would have to be spent before these properties could be put into repair.  In other words, quite a number of landlords will not do anything for the tenants.  This section provides a loophole.  It gives an encouragement to owners to endeavour to obtain possession.</P>

      <P>What did Deputy Costello say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the fears expressed are fully justified.  We are proposing here to decontrol certain types of houses.  First of all, we are decontrolling houses which are now in the occupation of their owners. There may be an argument in favour of that and I understand that objection is not taken here to that.  But the section goes on to say that we will decontrol forever a house which, after the passing of this Act, comes into the occupation of the owner.  It may be quite reasonable to argue that if a person gets a house into his possession by reason of the death of the tenant, or by reason of his being able to buy out the tenant, or because the tenant has left the country, or for some other reason, that house should become decontrolled because the landlord goes in and resides in it.  What the proposers of these amendments fear, and their fears are justified, is that there is a loophole in the section which will permit a person to exercise his rights under this section not in a <i>bona fide</i> fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section could be strengthened and the fears expressed could be overcome by the addition of the words <i>bona fide</i> to the section.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary examine <Col N="391" /> the section between this and the Report Stage with a view to seeing how it can be amended so that the loophole that now exists can be filled. What we must do is to ensure that there are no possible defects in the Act which would enable unscrupulous people to obtain unfair advantages. As I read the section, if there is anybody in occupation of a house that house is decontrolled for good and all after the 31st December and if he lets the house on 1st January he will let it at a decontrolled rent.  If a person is able to get possession of a house at 31st January next and if he resides in it for one day he will be able to relet it in the beginning of February at a decontrolled rent.</P>
    <P>What we have to cover here is <i>bona fide</i> residence by a landlord.  If,<i>bona fide</i>, a landlord gets possession and resides in the premises at the end of January, 1961, and thereafter, for some reason or other, decides to relet, a case may be made for having that re-letting decontrolled.  But there is a loophole at the moment for an unscrupulous use of this section.  It would be quite simple for a landlord to sell premises to a man-of-straw and that man-of-straw could go into possession for one night on an undertaking to re-sell the premises to the landlord.  It would be perfectly simple for companies to devise methods of getting their premises decontrolled. The Parliamentary Secretary would be wise to consider the loopholes and the dangers very carefully and to take steps now to guard against them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The fears expressed are quite unrealistic.  There are three things involved here.  First of all, there is the Labour Party amendment to delete paragraph (e) altogether.  Is that being withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCasey" hpid="Mr. Casey Mr. Casey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Costello is misinterpreting the views of the Labour Party.  The second element is that there is a climate of opinion which thinks it is all right to remove control from houses which are owner-occupied at the commencement <Col N="392" /> of the Act&mdash;the 31st December next&mdash; but that future cases in which the owner goes into occupation should not be decontrolled.  Are the Labour Party also pressing that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Costello is, I think, prepared to accept the principle of paragraph (e) but he feels that there are loopholes in it.  I shall deal with that first.  I am assured that the addition of the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; would add nothing to the effect of the paragraph.  I cannot accept these amendments because they cut across the fundamental purpose of the Bill. One of the underlying principles of the Bill is to achieve as much decontrol as possible without interfering with the rights of any existing tenant.  If we accept that principle&mdash;it is a valid one, and one which can be defended on any ground&mdash;then, surely, we must accept paragraph (e).</P>
      <P>There are two different types of case. One is that of a man occupying his own house.  The house has never been let.  There is no question of an existing tenant and no question of interfering with rights.  All we say is that if the house is let in future it shall not be subject to control.  That should be acceptable to the Labour Party because the Labour Party is anxious to increase rented accommodation and to have more rented accommodation available. If that house is controlled, it will never be let because the owner-occupier will not bring himself within the scope of rent control.  If we remove it from rent control, there is every likelihood that at some stage the owner-occupier might be encouraged to let at whatever rent he can get, provided he does sot require the house for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then the case of a man who, for some reason or other, gets control of his own house and goes into occupation of it.  The wording of the section is quite clear; it says for the purposes of his own residence.  There is no question of a trick or a person occupying the house for 24 hours, or a week. A landlord would be very foolish to try that, especially if he maintained another residence, because it would be <Col N="393" /> open to the tenant to go to court and prove the landlord had not occupied the premises for the purposes of his own residence and the landlord would almost certainly find in such a case, after incurring the expense of the litigation, that the premises were controlled, the rent reduced and security of tenure provided for the tenant.  He would be very unwise to take such a risk.  To anticipate that happening on any scale, or at all, is unrealistic indeed.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the Seanad, there is another reason the fears expressed here are unrealistic.  A very large proportion of landlords could not avail themselves of these provisions, even if they wanted to, for the purpose which the Labour Party fear.  Limited companies certainly could not occupy premises for their own residence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not against adding them but I am advised that they are unnecessary.  Deputy Casey spoke glibly about the case of a landlord who would get possession by some device or another.  We have the whole provisions of these Rent Acts to make sure that tenants of controlled dwellings are protected from arbitrary ejectment.  How does Deputy Casey visualise that an unscrupulous landlord will get possession against the will of the tenant, and then go into fictitious occupation and have the house decontrolled?  I am quite certain that this will not happen at all.  If in any of these houses which become decontrolled by virtue of the landlord going into occupation, a room or a flat is subsequently re-let, that room or flat is brought back under control again.</P>
      <P>I feel that the provision is quite reasonable.  It is not unfair that a man should be entitled to go into his own house for the purpose of his own residence and that is all we are proposing to do here.  I do not give any credence to the argument that this provision could be used as a device or a loophole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any provision in this Bill which provides for a man to go into his own house.

      <P>If this Act is passed and comes into force on December 31st, 1960, and if I buy a house on the 1st March it becomes my property. If, on the 1st April, I go into possession of that house it becomes decontrolled. Having regard to the number of cases where people buy houses and go to live in them and then discover that they do not suit them and want to leave them, it would be difficult to decide under what conditions a person would be <i>bona fide</i> taking possession of a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> This section provides for rent decontrol of houses that in other circumstances would continue to be controlled. That is the objection we have to it.  It could encourage unscrupulous landlords to take advantage of the provisions of the section to have houses decontrolled.  I do not know about the legal position of limited companies but I do know that there are many people who own a number of houses.  What is to prevent such a person acquiring possession of a house, saying it is for his own occupation and then saying that it does not suit him to take possession of that house?  This subsection does not provide machinery for such a person to get possession of a house but, if he does do so, the house becomes decontrolled.</P>

He goes and rents that house to a tenant and that tenant knows only that the house has been occupied by a person who is now leaving it and going to live in another house.  The house has <Col N="396" /> become decontrolled and I do not know what opportunity there is for the incoming tenant at that stage to do anything about it.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should look at his position again because it seems that there is a very major loophole in this section.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the question of the Labour Party looking for more rented houses. Perhaps the Labour Party is in the same position as Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael in doing that.  I do not think that any of us are interested in people looking for profit rents from tenants; I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary suggests that the Labour Party is interested in such people.  If he does he will very quickly be corrected.</P>

A large number of people cannot afford to buy their own houses and this proposal is to try to secure that there should be rented accommodation available for such people.  If, by removing this type of house from control, we can ensure that the people who own them will let them we shall be ensuring an increase in the supply of rented houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be open to a tenant to go to court and establish that the landlord did not occupy the house for the purposes of his own residence but merely as a device and therefore have the court declare the premises to be still controlled and fix a rent for it, almost certainly a reduced controlled rent.  That is the whole protection in this matter.  A landlord who <Col N="397" /> has a house which is free from control would be very foolish to leave himself open to be saddled with a tenant at a controlled rent.  If the landlord did not want the house genuinely for his <Col N="398" /> own residence he would relet it as a controlled dwelling or sell it.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate, to be moved in connection with this Bill, is to enable grants to be made by my Department towards the cost of works on derelict sites, which will help to improve the appearance and amenities of towns, villages and countryside.  Despite the efforts which have been made, especially in recent years, too many of our towns <Col N="399" /> and villages present an image of drabness, which is bad for ourselves and for our vital tourist industry.  With the increasing mobility of our own people and of tourists, the eyesores presented by derelict sites are observed by more and more people every year and have been the subject of serious criticism by visitors.  It is particularly important that our tourist resorts should raise their standards.  I know that there are difficulties and that much effort is required to reach the standard achieved by, say, Glenties. The initiative of individuals and local development associations can be of great practical value in supplementing the efforts of local authorities and I would like to think that we may look forward to the growth of much fruitful co-operation in the interests of better community environment.</P>
    <P>The grants scheme together with the Derelict Sites Bill, 1960, deals with one aspect of the subject of amenity.  I have been reviewing the general question of amenity and the powers of local authorities under the Town and Regional Planning Acts to secure the preservation and development of amenities.  These powers can be fully exercised only where a planning scheme has been made and approved. From my review of this problem and indeed from my examination of the Dublin Town Planning Scheme, I am satisfied that radical changes in our town planning law are necessary.  This is not the time to discuss these matters: I am simply mentioning them to indicate to the House that the present proposals are but the first instalment of a more fundamental campaign to improve the physical development of town and countryside.  The House will be given an opportunity at a later date to discuss this wider problem.</P>
    <P>It will be noted from the supplementary estimate that the grants will be payable to local authorites, private persons, local development associations and other bodies.  The grants will be 50% of the approved cost of the works, subject to a maximum grant of £100.  No grant will be payable where the approved cost of the works is less than £30.  The cost incurred <Col N="400" /> by local authorities and local development associations in acquiring sites may be included in the cost of works for grant purposes.</P>
    <P>The sites in respect of which the grants will be payable are sites which are or are likely to become dangerous or injurious to health or to the amenities of the neighbourhood by reason of their objectionable or neglected condition or by reason of the presence on the sites of ruinous buildings, debris, etc. This definition is less restrictive than the definition of &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; for the purposes of the Derelict Sites Bill, 1960.</P>
    <P>Works which will be eligible for grants include:</P>
    <P>(a)  demolition, clearance, levelling, fencing, walling, paving, surfacing, grassing, planting, and/or</P>
    <P>(b)  amenity works such as provision of shelters, seating, toilets, tennis courts, playgrounds, car parks or other amenities which will be available for use by the public.</P>
    <P>Some derelict sites may be suitable for the erection of houses and the grants will be available for the demolition and clearance of any ruinous buildings or walls on such sites.</P>
    <P>Details of the scheme of grants will be forwarded to the local authorities through whom applications for grants must be made.  If the applicant's proposals are acceptable to the local authority, the local authority will send on the application to my Department. It will be a condition of the grants that satisfactory arrangements are made for the future maintenance of the works.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Scheme with confidence to the House and I am sure that Deputies on all sides will do what they can to make the Scheme a success. This is a new Scheme and it is impossible at this stage to make an accurate forecast of the expenditure on the grants.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Supplementary Estimate is for payment of grants which may fall due in respect of completed works before 31st March, next. <Col N="401" /> I propose to include in the Estimate for Local Government for 1961/62 a larger provision for the payment of grants in that year.</P>
    <P>The object of the Bill is to enable more effective action to be taken to secure the clearance and improvement of derelict sites.  The definition of this term in the Acquisition of Derelict Sites Act, 1940, was so restrictive that the majority of these eyesores were technically outside the scope of the Act or could be excluded by works or use which fell far short of the desirable clearance.  We are all aware of the deplorable result.  Despite local authorities' grave concern with the problem of derelict sites their efforts have been generally ineffective.  Many of them have pressed for a very wide definition of &ldquo;derelict sites&rdquo; and an endeavour has been made to meet this requirement in the Bill insofar as it would not be inconsistent with the accepted principles for the assessment of compensation in respect of such sites.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to repeal the Act of 1940 which enabled Local Authorities to secure the clearance of derelict sites only by acquisition or the threat of acquisition.  A different approach is now proposed.  While it is hoped to spread the net wider, the aim will be to secure voluntary clearance and improvement of objectionable lands and buildings.  That is the purpose of Section 2 of the Bill and of the preliminary notice for which it provides. I think we may expect local authorities to make extensive use of this procedure and that property owners who are forgetful of their obligations to the community will be induced to face up to their responsibilities.  The scheme of grants, which is covered in the supplementary estimate should greatly facilitate this approach to the problem and should go a long way to relieve any hardship which might be imposed where the local authority have to invoke their powers of enforcement.</P>
    <P>These powers are necessary to ensure that owners who undertake to clear their sites will, in fact, do so.  Sections 3 and 4 provide also for cases <Col N="402" /> where no undertaking or no satisfactory undertaking is received by the local authority.  The power to require works to be carried out is a new feature in legislation affecting derelict sites but the principle is long established in other codes such as the Housing and Sanitary Services Acts.  An appeal lies to the Minister for Local Government against any requisition under Section 3.</P>
    <P>A general power to acquire derelict sites compulsorily or by agreement is provided by Section 6.  It seems inevitable that some cases will remain where acquisition will be the only satisfactory solution, e.g., where the site is abandoned.  Compulsory acquisition will be by means of vesting order. This provision of the Act of 1940 is being retained because it is particularly appropriate to derelict sites, being both expeditious and inexpensive.</P>
    <P>A local authority proposing to acquire a derelict site compulsorily will be required to give adequate notice of such intention and the occupier or any person having an interest in the land may lodge an objection with the local authority within one month. Where such objection has been made and is not withdrawn, compulsory acquisition cannot be effected without the consent of the Minister.  The Bill provides that such consent shall be refused if the Minister is of opinion that the land, which it is sought to acquire, is not a derelict site.  He may, however, consent to the acquisition of part of the land if that part is a derelict site.  The Minister is also empowered under Section 8 to refuse consent if he considers that the local authority should adopt either of the alternative procedures provided under the Bill, i.e. acceptance of an offer of voluntary clearance or requisition to carry out works.</P>
    <P>The remaining Sections of this Bill are generally similar to provisions in the Act of 1940.  Compensation for derelict sites acquired compulsorily may, in default of agreement, be determined by arbitration.  The basis of assessment remains the value of the site, less the cost of clearance and levelling.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Derelict sites have been eyesores in this country for many years and, as the Minister has rightly pointed out, particularly to tourists. Familiarity sometimes makes one less observant and we Irish possibly do not note sufficiently the derelict sites throughout the country.  It is a good thing that they should be cleared up. When these sites were first built on they must have been regarded as valuable sites.  Otherwise, buildings would not have been erected on them. I hope that many of them will have buildings erected on them again after demolition and clearance.</P>
      <P>I always thought that local authorities did not carry out the duties imposed upon them under the 1940 Act. The Minister has stated that all that they could do was to compel the owner to clear a derelict site or threaten to do so.  I am afraid I know very few local authorities who exercised the powers conferred on them under the 1940 Act.  That was a tragedy.</P>
      <P>There are a few things in the Bill with which I do not agree.  I take Section 1, which gives the local authority power to acquire land which in their opinion is likely to become injurious to the amenities of the neighbourhood by reason of its objectionable or neglected condition.  Why acquire land?  I know no land in this country that by reason of its condition is more objectionable to the amenities for tourists than the sides of our roadways where bentweed and all other classes of weed are permitted to grow and are never cut down by the local authority.  There is no greater sinner against the objects of this Bill than the local authorities themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under one Local Government Act they have power to compel owners of roadside hedges to cut them and, if they do not cut them, they may prosecute them or, alternatively, they may cut them themselves and charge the cost to the owner of the land.  There is nothing more injurious to the amenities of a neighbourhood than uncut hedges.  Let local authorities put their own house in order before they intervene in others.  If they would compel owners of land to cut hedges <Col N="404" /> and if they remedied all the other things which are injurious to the amenities of neighbourhoods they would be going places and would be doing a great deal to help tourism.</P>
    <P>Why should they acquire land?  I can imagine a small farmer, through inability to avail of the advantages of the land reclamation scheme, finding his land becoming swampy and boggy and being unable to rid it of growth and the local authority saying: &ldquo;We will declare that gentleman's land a derelict site&rdquo;.  That would be a very bad thing.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister signify at this stage that this will be a reserved function and not an executive function?</P>

Remember, and it is very important to remember, that if the local authority are to exercise the powers conferred on them by Section 3 and if they are to seek compensation for the clearance of the site, they must first of all submit an estimate to the Minister and the Minister must sanction the amount which he is to give by way of grant for the clearance.  In other words, the Minister has given a decision before an appeal reaches him as to whether the site should be cleared or otherwise.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is a derelict site.  I know many farms in the Deputy's own parish which an inspector from the Custom House would declare a derelict site if he got the opportunity, and in my own, too, simply because they have not the capital to use on them, simply because they cannot take advantage of the land reclamation scheme introduced by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister.</P>
      <P>This right of appeal is a very important one particularly when you look at Section 8: &ldquo;Objection to compulsory acquisition of derelict sites.&rdquo; Again the objection is to the Minister who is depending entirely on reports of what he describes as his experts. There is not the slightest doubt that he has experts but there is no greater expert on the location of a derelict site than the man who is living in the locality where that site is.  His advice should be sought in these matters before confirmation of compulsory acquisition is given by the Minister I would ask the House to consider Section 13 which says:</P>
      <P>(1)  A local authority may use any land acquired by them under this Act for any purpose connected with their powers and duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They may use it.  This could be a very simple method of acquiring land. This could be a very simple method whereby the county manager, without prior consultation of any description, could acquire land for many purposes <Col N="410" /> and objects.  That is something which worries me very much indeed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that throughout Ireland there are many towns which on account of the derelict sites in them are eyesores.  He quotes the example of Glenties. Glenties is a progressive town which had not to clear one derelict site in the whole town.  The local committee merely had to compel the local authority to clear up the property of the local authority, that is the market house and the court house.  That is all they had to do to become the premier town in this competition for three years in succession.  I know other towns.  There is one town in the Minister's own area, the town of Ramelton where there are derelict sites, some of which are owned by very prosperous people and which should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>The two objections I have to the Bill are: first compulsory acquisition of land to be used by the local authority for any purpose they wish, and secondly, no right of appeal other than to the Minister who depends entirely on reports of his officials as to what decision he will come to.  That is unfair.  Those are two matters which I should like the Minister to look into between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter.  I think we are a little premature with the Money Resolution.  We are providing a sum of money to cover the period from now to the 31st March next.  Does anyone here think that any local authority will, before the 31st of March, implement any one section of this Bill or clear one site under this Bill when it is enacted.  I think the resolution is premature and that the Minister, as he said in his opening speech, would be time enough in introducing a Money Resolution when he is introducing his annual estimate next March.</P>
    <P>I should like to see advantage taken of the Bill.  I think it is a very good thing that compensation will be given to those who demolish those derelict sites.  There is one question I should like to ask the Minister.

      <P>I agree.  That might help to abolish these reconstruction grants on very old houses.  If people are paid to demolish old buildings and rebuild, they might go into the larger grants and rebuild instead of just reconstructing.</P>
      <P>I am not opposed to this measure. I welcome it.  There are only two things to which I take objection&mdash;the compulsory acquisition of land and the right of appeal.  I am not suggesting the person of the Minister is wrong, but I think it is wrong that any Minister should have to depend entirely on the reports of officials in order to come to a decision on such an important matter as to whether or not a man's field is derelict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good Bill. Any discussion which focuses attention on the tremendous problem that exists with regard to derelict sites is a good thing.  I am encouraged, too, by the fact that the Minister described this measure as being the first instalment&mdash;to quote his own words&mdash;of a more fundamental campaign to improve the physical development of town and country.  It is true that we have had other legislation in former years to deal with the problem of derelict sites.  For various reasons the problem has never been approached in such manner as would suggest that local authorities are in earnest in their desire to cure these scars and heal these eyesores in country, town and city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the changes proposed are not revolutionary they represent an improvement in the powers vested in local authorities by the Derelict Sites Act of 1940.  There has been a good deal of discussion as to the undesirability <Col N="412" /> of derelict sites, especially in tourist areas.  There is nothing so disappointing to visitors as seeing so many derelict sites, so many fallen-down houses, so many houses in a very bad state of repair, so many vacant lots.  I am all in favour of this measure, here in this House and outside it, because I believe that, if the problem is approached in the proper spirit, we can make these derelict sites much more attractive in a very short time.</P>
    <P>This legislation is in the same category as most legislation emanating from the Department of Local Government.  Most of the legislation is enabling legislation.  Too often we have local authorities clamouring for legislative permission to do things.  On the other hand, there are many local authorities and many individuals in local authorities who are not prepared to use the instruments given them by this House to do things, or correct things, in their own particular areas. If local authorities do not approach the problem of derelict sites with the same enthusiasm as members of this House do, this Bill will not be worth the paper it is printed on.</P>

      <P>Just a moment.  Will the Minister point out to me where the power to deem a site to be derelict or to acquire land is made a managerial function?  I may have missed it in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did say it was a managerial function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless it is made a reserved function, it is a managerial function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I plead with the Minister to make it a reserved function.  It is not that I distrust managers as much as Deputy O'Donnell seems to distrust them in this particular instance; county managers have come to learn the importance of consulting public representatives. Whether it is that they want to become better administrators, I do not know.  Whether they do it for their <Col N="413" /> own protection, I cannot say.  But I cannot see any county manager declaring sites to be derelict without prior consultation with the members of the local authority.  I do not say that is a good reason for giving this absolute power to the county manager.  The Minister would be wise&mdash;indeed, he would gain the support of the members of local authorities&mdash;if he left these two particular acts as a function of the elected members.  I do not believe managers would want the power of declaring sites derelict or compulsorily acquiring land.  The Minister should consider conferring these powers on the elected representatives.  The fears &mdash;in some cases legitimate fears&mdash;of Deputy O'Donnell may then be allayed. I do not believe there will be widespread declarations of sites being derelict or widespread compulsory acquisition. Members of local authorities are very representative of their areas and they will be careful to ensure that no wrong is done to any particular section or any particular individual.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy O'Malley said, that if the Minister persists making these a managerial function the members of the local authorities may invoke the section too seldom invoked by them, Section 4 of the Act of 1955, or 1956.  That was a piece of legislation introduced here by Deputy O'Donnell. Local authorities can, by resolution, prevent the manager from doing something they think should not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any real objection to the appeal provision in this Bill.  I do not see how much further we can go than an appeal to the Minister.  I have some experience of appeals in town planning and the officials of the Department and the Minister have approached such appeals in a very fair way.  Generally, there has been no widespread criticism of the decision.  I say &ldquo;no widespread criticism&rdquo;.  There may be particular criticism.  I do not wish to enter into the controversy between the Minister and the ex-Minister with regard to the approach in deciding appeals.  Whilst the Minister should never declare himself to be entirely dependent on the reports of his officials, I assume that he follows the normal pattern; he has regard, as his predecessors have had <Col N="414" /> regard, to the reports of his officials and then, as his predecessors did, he makes up his own mind.</P>
    <P>It has been necessary from time to time for the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary to visit a particular area believing that the reports he had before him were inadequate and that he would be better able to make up his mind if he visited the locality which was the subject of a town's planning scheme. By and large, I think the reports that will be submitted will be sufficient.  I think that any report by the aggrieved person, the officials of the local authority and the officials of the Department will be sufficient to enable any Minister to make up his mind without visiting the site which it is proposed to declare derelict.</P>
    <P>It may happen that he will be required to visit the site, but I believe that the members of the local authorities will concern themselves about that side of the problem, and will, I hope, be the determining factor if the Minister decides that these two functions should not be reserved for the manager.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I have not examined the Bill in detail in respect of this problem but perhaps the Minister will tell me whether the Bill covers it.  In the last 20 or 30 years the motor car population of this country has increased by thousands and thousands.  The Minister is aware of the problem caused by the wear and tear on the roads of the country by reason of that increase but in that regard there is compensation in the increase in the road tax received.  However, another problem arises and that is what people do with their old and discarded cars.  One of the greatest eyesores in the country is where a field or a plot is covered with 20, 30, 40 or 50 shells of old cars which have been left there, not for weeks or months, but for years.</P>
    <P>They are an eyesore which is every bit as bad as the derelict sites in the villages, towns and cities.  I do hope that the Minister has given power to the local authorities to deal with a situation like that.  I do not think it is good enough for a locality to be <Col N="415" /> scarred in such a fashion and made so ugly with dozens of shells of such cars.  That sort of picture detracts from the amenities of any locality.  I trust that in this measure power is given to local authorities to deal with a situation like that, to require the owner to take these old shells away or to do it themselves and present the bill to the owner.</P>
    <P>I know it must be difficult for the garage proprietors to dispose of junk of that sort.  It is bulky and difficult to get rid of but there must be ways and means of having such stuff disposed of.  So long as we allow these people to carry on in this fashion they will never make an effort to get rid of such vehicles.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stresses what is required to be done with the derelict sites in the towns.  The character of many of our towns has changed and I might say that many of the towns are now out of character.  I could quote one example, Wexford town, where there are many derelict sites by reason of the fact that many old houses had become derelict and had to be levelled. Many of the streets in Wexford town show gaps where these houses have been levelled and so the general character of the streets has changed.  I think it undesirable that we should have the pattern of a town like Wexford where we have a whole shell of old buildings with many gaps in between, and that the town should be represented by so many thousands of corporation houses all looking similar.  I believe that, as far as planning by local authorities is concerned, in the building of local authorities' houses we have done an extremely bad job.</P>
    <P>There may be some Deputies who will say that in respect of a particular town they have preserved its character and have not made it as ugly as I have described it.  I do say that, so far as the building of houses in the last twenty years is concerned, we do not seem to have approached the matter from the point of view of preserving the character of the town or even of putting a different, or nicer, face on it.  That is not so much a problem for decision on this Bill but I would urge the Minister in turn to <Col N="416" /> urge local authorities to try to fill in these derelict sites in our towns and cities by building houses on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister states, with regard to sites that have been declared derelict, that the local authority may, if necessary, provide that shelters, seating accommodation, toilets, playgrounds and so forth be erected on them.  If the Minister or the local authorities do not take the initiative it will merely mean that derelict sites will simply be fenced off and there will not be much improvement.  I do not know if this problem is covered by the Bill but certain local authorities are afraid to demolish old buildings because it seems that there is some Act which says that if they demolish an old building they are responsible for the adjoining building for so many years. If they take down a house and if there is any danger to the adjoining house the local authority is responsible for its repair and upkeep; they are responsible to see that it will not be damaged. As long as that state of affairs remains, local authorities will be very reluctant to demolish that type of house.</P>
    <P>As far as the Supplementary Estimate is concerned, I suppose the figure does not make much difference in present circumstances because we do not know to what extent the local authorities will avail of it.  However, £5,000 seems to be pretty small even in view of the fact that we have only four months of the financial year to go.  The Minister says that the maximum grant that can be given is 50 per cent.  of the cost or £100.  I think £100 is a very small sum.</P>
    <P>I say that with my tongue in my cheek because in my view any suggestion that comes from a Minister for Local Government will be followed by the local authorities asking for much more money than it is proposed to give.  I suppose one could consider this as a windfall for the local authorities who, under present circumstances, got no assistance at all in these matters.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we must be thankful for small mercies.  I should like to stress again that if the Minister and <Col N="417" /> this House show initiative in approaching the problem of derelict sites with enthusiasm, it will not be worth anything unless the local authorities approach the problem in the same way because there is a very serious case for tackling the problem of derelict sites both in town and country.  I hope that as a result of the Bill and the financial assistance offered we will, in a short time, have done something about the derelict sites that have been like scars and eyesores in the countryside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a step in the right direction though I cannot help feeling it is a pity we have to buy the co-operation of local communities.  We could take the town of Glenties, which the Minister knows well, as an example of this local co-operation. They did their work themselves, presented the town for the annual competition without any grant and it is a pity that other areas could not follow this worthy example.</P>
      <P>However, the provisions of this scheme may help many local authorities to be more co-operative.  Deputy Corish referred to the abnormally high number of eyesores that disgrace our countryside.  There is one type to which I would like to refer&mdash;the large country mansion which is bought by an enterprising speculator, usually for the purpose of taking off the roof, taking out the floors and windows and leaving a gaunt shell standing.  Can such an individual or company be proceeded against under the terms of the Bill, because I think that kind of thing creates the greatest eyesores in the country to-day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another type of eyesore which is unfortunately becoming more familiar as each month passes.  I am referring to derelict houses and cottages <Col N="419" /> in country towns and villages. Due to economic conditions our country towns and villages are falling more and more into disrepair, and it is quite certain that this tendency will become greater as the young people emigrate and the old people die off.  I wonder if, under the terms of the Bill, the local authorities will be given sufficient powers to remedy that state of affairs, due entirely to economic conditions.</P>
    <P>I must say I share Deputy O'Donnell's views about the definition of land.  The Bill says that a derelict site means any land on which either there are no buildings at all or the buildings are temporary structures or in a ruinous, dilapidated or dangerous condition.  I would suggest that land on which there are no buildings could quite easily be a field or other kind of open space retained by a property owner for some further development and that under the terms of the Bill it would be open to local authorities to designate the place as a derelict site.  I wonder if the Minister would satisfy the House that the property in such open spaces of that kind would be safeguarded.  I know that later in the Bill the Minister is being given powers to refuse an application from a local authority if he is satisfied a site is not in fact derelict.  That is an important point.</P>
    <P>I wonder, too, if we should make money available for the provision of tennis courts and similar sporting amenities.  I feel the community should themselves provide these amenities and that local organisations should make their own arrangements in that respect. I wonder if including in the Bill provision for the giving of grants to establish tennis courts is not creating a very bad precedent.  Personally I would rather see these amenities provided by the sporting and voluntary organisations who have managed to provide them down through the years. If we provide tennis courts it might not be looking too far ahead to the day when we will be asked why we should not provide soccer pitches, hurling pitches, rugby pitches and so forth.  I think in that regard the <Col N="420" /> initiative might be left to the local voluntary organisations to provide these things for themselves.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister made reference to the present unsatisfactory position of the Town and Regional Planning Act.  I think his disquiet was corroborated by a reply which he gave me last week when I asked him the number of local authorities which had in fact adopted town planning schemes.  Apparently only one in the whole country has done so to date, Dublin.  It would be a step in the right direction if the Minister overhauled the existing Act and, having done so, insisted that the local authorities concerned should put it into effect within the stipulated period.</P>
    <P>Generally I welcome the principle of the Bill.  In common with other Deputies, I hope it will encourage local authorities to take the initiative in clearing up the many derelict sites which disgrace our countryside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface what I have to say by remarking that in general I hold little brief for town planning, especially when it cuts across the personal interests of people, and particularly when it interferes with the private businesses of people in towns and prevents them from expanding. However, this is not the occasion on which to debate the pros and cons of town planning as such.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that this Bill will confer many benefits.  Much has been said here about the effect on tourists of these numerous eyesores.  It has been stated that tourists object to seeing so many derelict buildings on their tours throughout the country, and rightly so.  But to my mind this Bill should not be introduced simply to satisfy the aesthetic pleasures of tourists, but rather should it be introduced for the prime benefit of our own people.  It is they who are most vehement in declaring that these derelict sites should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk not only about the scarcity of houses but even about the scarcity of sites on which to build houses in our towns.  It is obvious that if, under this Bill, many derelict sites are removed, that will automatically provide more good sites for the <Col N="421" /> building of new houses.  That is one of the especial benefits which should result from the enactment of this Bill. There are also many derelict buildings of various types in the country area. Sometimes they are outside the fences and sometimes inside them.  If they are removed they will provide not so much additional building sites but additional land, which is also very important.  We are often reminded that agriculture is our prime industry, and there is a possibility that this Bill will provide, perhaps only in a small way, additional land with agricultural potentialities.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, a former Minister, referred to this matter of land and questioned the wisdom of putting a clause in the Bill entitling a local authority to take over land if it decides, in its wisdom or otherwise, that it is a derelict site.  If I interpret correctly what the Deputy said the local authority have power to put that land to any use they think fit.  I should like to ask the Minister could he give an example of land which is a derelict site.  I am referring to land which is just ordinary land on which there is no building or structure of any kind.  It may be termed a derelict site because many weeds are growing on it, but the remedy in that case is to enforce the noxious weeds legislation.  I do not think any local authority, or anybody, should have power to acquire land and use it for any purpose they think fit just because they think it comes within the category of being a derelict site.</P>
    <P>It seems that the manager will have executive powers in this business of declaring a site to be derelict.  I would endorse what has been said by Deputy Corish when he suggested that before making any Order declaring a site to be derelict the manager should confer with his local council.  To a certain extent I see the wisdom of making it an executive function.  You may have the case of Mr. X whose site is being threatened with being declared derelict. Naturally he will contact the various councillors and seek their support in his cause.  Councillors being human beings, political human beings, will come down on the side of their <Col N="422" /> political friends in all probability. That has been the pattern through the years but the county manager is more or less a neutral person in this case and, to my mind, he is the person most fitted to decide whether a particular site should be declared derelict or not &mdash;I do not mean that from the technical point of view but from the neutrality or authoritative point of view&mdash;the manager having received the report of the local surveyor on the case.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, £30 cash is the minimum grant that may be given or at least no grant will be given to a job that costs less than £30&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>Suppose a small farmer has an outhouse or a cattle shed beside the road.  It is for practical purposes a derelict site as it presents a very unwelcome sight for passers by.  He has no practical use for it&mdash;I am assuming this&mdash;and it has been declared a derelict site.  The man must knock it down.  He either loses his own time to do so or he delegates his son or a workman to do it. That costs money.  He is a small farmer.  I do not know what it would cost but it could cost, say, £14 and he would not qualify for any help.  I think you could multiply that case many times over the country, outhouses, or even half-demolished cottages with just bare walls standing. It would take very little to knock <Col N="423" /> them down with a pick-axe or a heavy hammer but that man will probably have to carry away the rubble that will result from demolition and that would cost money, perhaps £10 or £12.  Under this Bill he will not qualify for any grant.  I think the Minister should reconsider that aspect of the matter and act accordingly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Russell referred to the likelihood of ambitious projects such as tennis courts, car-parks and amenity buildings being initiated.  All these are very good in themselves but I contend that the main purpose of the Bill is the clearing of derelict sites and it should stop there.  The aim of the Bill is to encourage people to demolish eyesores lying about the country and I do not think it should perform a second function in so far as it might very easily set off another spiral of local government expenditure on the provision of these amenities.</P>
      <P>Obviously, when a derelict site has been cleared it will cost money to transport the rubble or debris.  Will the grants cover the cost of such transport to, say, a local slobland? Will that be included in the full estimate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell seemed to think that the appeal provided for in the Bill should not be to the Minister but that there should be some sort of tribunal of experts.  I think that was the gist of his remarks. I think the provision for appeal to the Minister is proper and laudable when we remember that the Minister has his experts in the various fields who, I presume, will visit the derelict site, examine the pros and cons of the case and report back to the Minister.  It would involve too much if we set up further tribunals for such purposes as this.</P>

    <P>In regard to the £5,000 Supplementary Estimate which is being discussed in connection with this Bill, like Deputy O'Donnell, I do not think that there will be much call for these <Col N="424" /> grants before the new financial year begins on the 1st April.  That prompts me to refer to the new buildings that we see going up throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Suppose an industrialist or business firm intends to build a new structure in a town and they see a number of old houses that have not been condemned officially and are not derelict sites, what is to stop the industrialist or the firm from asking the local authority to declare such an area a derelict site?  What is to stop the big businessman from qualifying to receive so much money when he clears the site before he builds on it?  Up to date, he would not get any grant to demolish ruinous buildings on the site where he is going to put a new building but under this Bill, he will.  I do not begrudge the grant but would like to have the matter made clear.  Such persons would confer a dual benefit on the community, first of all, by providing employment in the new building work and they would also clear derelict sites and make the area generally more acceptable.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the Minister if this Bill will encourage or result in the appointment of additional inspectors to go around the countryside to find out if certain places are derelict sites or not.  I presume it would be the function of the local surveyor to do this.  It is my earnest hope that will be the case and that this will not result in having further staff in the various local authorities.  Generally speaking, I welcome the Bill and I hope it will have the results and benefits that we all expect.</P>

      <P>The Derelict Sites Bill, 1960, would not have been necessary if the 1940 Act had been operated as envisaged by those who introduced it.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to clarify beyond doubt the definition of a derelict site.  Various local authorities have tried to acquire land compulsorily, different procedures were adopted and different interpretations given by law agents.  That is the reason, in my opinion, for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with an area in which <Col N="425" /> £1,000,000 is to be spent on housing in the near future, Limerick Corporation were told by the legal adviser that it would take 20 years to acquire the sites.  The sites are being acquired and the necessary steps are being taken at the present time, even without the assistance of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I admit that under the 1940 Act, before a site could be acquired in urban areas, the site had to be in a ruinous condition and the buildings on it a danger to the public.  That was a let out clause.  The definition in Section 1 of this Bill will do away with that.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to define beyond doubt what a derelict site is. I respectfully submit that when we are dealing with this matter we should make a good job of it.  I do not think we have done so.  I have not a legal mind but I can see that this Bill will give rise to different interpretations.</P>
    <P>Under Section 1 &ldquo;derelict site&rdquo; means any land on which either there are no buildings or all the buildings (other than sheds, huts and other temporary structures) are in a ruinous, dilapidated or dangerous condition and none of the buildings is being used as a dwelling.  That will have to be amended, if the Minister wants to make a proper job of it.  It is faulty. Suppose I have a cottage, a little gem, in the middle of a huge devastated area, with motor cars piled up on one side and a tumbledown mill or ruined cottages or houses on the other side. I can hold up acquisition of the entire area under the Section as it stands.  If I have a little cottage on the land, Section 1 (a), sub-paragraph (i) goes by the board.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraph (ii) describes any-land &ldquo;which is or is likely to become injurious to health or to the amenities of the neighbourhood by reason of its objectionable or neglected condition.&rdquo; Paragraph (b) (i) refers to land consisting of buildings which are not being used as dwellings and the sites thereof, means of access thereto and any yards and gardens attached thereto, which are in a ruinous, dilapidated or dangerous condition.  That will have to be clarified.  A great deal <Col N="426" /> of worry has been caused to rate-payers and people awaiting houses by various interpretations of legislation by law agents.  The purpose of the Bill is to clarify but the definitions in Section 1 are not doing that.</P>
    <P>Under Section 2 subsection (3) a local authority may enter on the land if works which have been specified in an offer have not been carried out and the land continues to be a derelict site.  If after the specified period the work has not been carried out, the local authority may enter on the land and carry out the appropriate work and recover the cost from the owner.  The local authority may do those things or they may not.  A person may have a derelict site which is ruining the approaches to the city, town or village.  He gets five months to carry out the appropriate work, which is reasonable, and at the end of that period, if he has not done so, the local authority may enter on the land, carry out the work and recover the cost.  Consider the temptation in that case for the owner to canvass members of the local authority to use their good offices with the county manager not to recover the cost or not to enter the land.  The provision should be stronger.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4 the amount recoverable may not exceed the amount of the estimate.  The local authority may, however, remit all or part of their claim, if they see fit.  That is very bad.  I can see many difficulties. I may not be giving the correct interpretation to the section but I do not think so.  It is not fair that a member of a local authority can be put in the position that a person can say to him, &ldquo;I own this site.  The local authority want £100 from me.  Will you do something for me at the next meeting of the council?&rdquo; Members of local authorities should not be put in the position of having to do anything about such matters.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with compensation. It is on the same basis as the 1940 Act.  The compensation is paid on the value of the land less the cost of clearing and levelling but the period for claiming compensation is being extended from three months to 12 <Col N="427" /> months.  What is the purpose of inserting that provision?  I do not mind if the period of compensation were extended to two years.  For instance, there might be some person in Australia who might not have any knowledge of this.  However, if a person is in Australia he should have disposed of his land long ago.  What I want to ascertain from the Minister is this: could the owner of the land&mdash; if he could not I do not mind&mdash;hold up the local authority taking possession of the site in question by saying: &ldquo;Until I am paid for my site&rdquo;&mdash; hitherto it was free&mdash;&ldquo;you may not take possession.&rdquo; I doubt that he can but is there the possibility?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell was very worried because he thought a county manager might without the knowledge of the local authority acquire a site and declare it a derelict site under the terms of this Bill.  If that happened would it not be possible for the local authority, under the measure which Deputy O'Donnell himself brought in, the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, to invoke the section which could compel a county manager to carry out the wishes of a local authority?  Deputy O'Donnell said they could not because they would not know what he intended to do.  He would have it done before they could pass the necessary resolution. If Deputy O'Donnell read this Bill he would see there was the statutory requirement of notices in the public press, and the local authority would have power to require a manager to do as they wished.  Most managers act in a common sense way but, as in the case of district justices, there are peculiar cases in county councils.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell launched an attack on the Minister because every town planning appeal was not examined personally by him.  It would be a sad day if every town planning appeal were to be examined by the Minister for Local Government.  You can imagine the rejoicings and the preparations which would be laid on by the interested parties in Glenties <Col N="428" /> or any of these other places down South if they thought a Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only stating the facts as I see them and trying to refute the point which Deputy O'Donnell made and which, in my opinion, is completely fatuous.  When county managers in the past told us that there was difficulty in finding out who owned certain property, that there was property on the hands of different local bodies for years and they could not find out who owned the houses, who paid the rates?  The occupier was rated but supposing it was unoccupied, who paid the rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement in regard to the Town Planning Acts in general is one of the most momentous statements, reading between the lines of what is said, that I have heard for many a long day in this House.  I tried to take down what he said.  He said he had been reviewing the general question of the powers of local authorities under the Town and Regional Planning Acts to secure the preservation <Col N="429" /> and development of amenities.  He said: These powers can be fully exercised only where a planning scheme has been made and approved.  From my review of that programme and from my examination of the Dublin Town Planning Scheme I am satisfied that radical changes in our town planning laws are necessary.</P>
    <P>How right the Minister is and how long it took.  I have been talking here year after year on Estimates of the Minister for Local Government about ugly buildings in our beautiful cities. I often referred to the honky-tonk Grafton Street was turned into.  Under the Town Planning Act provision was made in relation to building.  We have our eminent town planners and our eminent architects in Dublin.  They can go down to Trinity College and U.C.D. and lecture the young students on the appreciation of Georgian architecture and the proportions of the Doric column.  Nevertheless they let these monstrosities get through.  It is hard to get a housing scheme through or a scheme of flats.  There is a great deal of red tape involved where the so-called architects of local authorities are concerned, but look at what they allowed in this city alone.  They desecrated Dublin, and the damage is done now.</P>
    <P>That is true not only of Dublin but also of Limerick and Cork.  The House knows what I mean.  I do not wish to close main streets to shops but one does not require a very great knowledge of architecture to realise the lack of taste and dignity in many of the buildings that are permitted to deface the principal streets in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Town Planning Acts are being amended.  Indeed, the sooner a comprehensive measure is brought in the better it will be for all concerned. I may not enter into the ramifications of town planning on this measure but, until such time as town planning is adopted by every local authority and until such time as local authorities and the public generally are clear on town planning, dissatisfaction and injustice will prevail.  I doubt if any member of this House, I doubt if even a senior counsel, could tell me that, if I apply <Col N="430" /> to-morrow to the Limerick Ard Comhairle, the City Council, the county council, for the sake of argument, for permission to erect a shed to house greyhounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had adverted to that.  May I say that sheds for greyhounds are not very desirable along the approach route to a city.  I doubt if a refusal to permit the erection of such sheds is legal, even in the case of bodies which have adopted an interim town plan.  There have been very definite challenges in the courts in the past, with success to those who challenged.  If anyone cared to challenge a refusal for permission to build he would undoubtedly succeed.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell and others criticised the fact that the Minister was looking for £5,000 by way of Money Resolution.  I think it is a good thing that Money Resolution will be passed because it will enable local authorities and private individuals to start planning straight away.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to give power to local authorities to require owners of derelict sites to carry out certain improvement works.  I do not know that the Bill goes far enough. In my city there are several unsightly embankments.  They are covered with weeds.  They are dangerous.  They could collapse at any moment.  Subsection (3), paragraph (i) of Section 2 provides that a local authority may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) by their servants or agents enter on the land and carry out the works and may claim, by demand in the prescribed form given to the owner aforesaid, the expenses incurred by them under this subsection,</P>
      <P>The embankments to which I refer were once the responsibility of a Mill Race Committee.  That committee is defunct.  I should like something to be done to meet the case of these embankments. Ours is a major tourist area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> It will not be possible, of course, to get after a defunct committee to make them pay up.  All I can see at the moment is a continuation of the present position.  I think this measure should include some provision to cover such cases as these.  As far as I can see the Bill is aimed at John Citizen and not at the powers-that-be.  I should like the Minister to include provision to enable these embankments to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the dumping of old cars.  In certain areas unsightly boat hulks detract from the amenities of the areas in question. These old hulks could be broken up and given to the poor as firewood. They should not be left there to rot.</P>

      <P>I welcome this measure.  It is overdue.  Derelict sites, particularly in towns and tourist resorts, are badly in need of improvement. There are many in my own area and they are increasing in number as a result of emigration.  If the local authority were to take over all the derelict sites&mdash;derelict houses and derelict farms&mdash;in West Cork they would have a big job on hands.</P>

      <P>They are there in their thousands from Bantry to Castletownbere. I should like to protect owners of property, even if they are the owners of derelict sites.  I know that there is power in the Bill to appeal to the Minister but even though that power is in the Bill there would always be the temptation of wire-pulling and of bringing pressure to bear if it is not fully agreed between the parties to give away a particular site.  Where compulsory acquisition is necessary I feel that the owner of such a site should have the right to appeal to the local district justice.  He is above politics, he is above wire-pulling of any description, he would be disinterested except to carry out the law for the good of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The owner of the derelict site would be protected in that respect by having <Col N="432" /> the right to appeal to the district justice or to the circuit court judge. I think the district justice in each area would be able to deal with such a case.  I think it would give confidence to the people that they would be dealt with in a fair and just way, that they would be protected by the courts and that no county manager would have the power to go in and take their property compulsorily without them having any redress whatever.</P>
    <P>I do not consider the appeal to the Minister is sufficient protection at all even though I believe that the Bill is 100 per cent. necessary for the removal of derelict sites in cities, towns and tourist resorts.  I know that tourists from England and America go around taking photographs of these sites.  They display them in their own countries to show how backward we are in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>They have such sites themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they have but they show these photographs to indicate how backward we are.  I believe that it is necessary to clear these derelict sites.  I have seen rusty, corrugated iron sheds in towns that ought not be there.  The necessary steps should be taken to acquire them and put them in a proper state of repair so that they would be presentable to the people at home and to the tourists who come here.</P>
      <P>I know that one person may not agree with another in regard to what is a derelict site.  Who is to decide what is a derelict site?  Is the sole responsibility to rest on the county manager?  If he sees ragwort or thistles growing in a field he may look on that field as a derelict site whereas a farmer might look on it as a good field.  That is why there should be an appeal to the courts so that there would be some other person to decide whether the owner is aggrieved because of the compulsory acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there will be great developments in the region of Cork City in the near future as a result of the building of Cork airport.  Town and regional planning will be very essential there and every step should <Col N="433" /> be taken to ensure that the whole area is developed along the right lines so that when people come off the planes at the airport the neighbourhood will present a decent appearance.  Perhaps it will be necessary to acquire the derelict sites in that area for the construction of the approaches to the airport. I should like the Minister to amend the Bill to give the necessary protection of the law and the courts to the people.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is one which will do a good deal to benefit our towns and our countryside and help our tourist industry. I do not agree that where disagreement occurs the matter should be referred for decision to the district justice or to the courts at all.  The value of each property is so small that it would be foolish to encourage people by legislation to engage in costly litigation and to bear expenses in connection with what really are items of trivial value.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Bill goes far enough; perhaps I am wrong. There is provision in the Bill for certain matters which I intend to mention. First of all there is the question of the abandoned railways.  I wonder if there is power in the Bill to do away with these eyesores.  There is nothing which mars the appearance of a place so much as these abandoned railways which are overgrown with weeds and which are used as dumps by the local people.</P>

      <P>You people have quite a few memorials too.  Seriously, that is a matter which I think should be covered in the Bill.  I admit that it is going to be a very big job. Arising out of that we also have abandoned railway stations, small houses and buildings and tracks which have been allowed to fall into a very bad state.  The same applies to railway bridges across roads which have fallen into disuse and are an eyesore to the public and a hazard to traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have said in regard to railways applies also to canals.  I should <Col N="434" /> like to see provision in the Bill to deal with canals although the Minister for Transport and Power has indicated that these will be developed for inland fishery purposes.</P>
    <P>Among our greatest eyesores are hoardings erected on roads entering and leaving towns.  In fact advertisements on such hoardings are the greatest eyesores we have.  They have been erected in a haphazard way and without any regard to the appearance of the countryside or to the appearance of the town or village near where they are situated.</P>
    <P>Another matter giving great concern and which caused a lot of annoyance in towns which entered for the Tidy Town Competition, are what I call car graveyards.  These are usually on the outskirts of towns but in many cases they are situated right in the centre of the town.  It will be difficult to deal with these cases because not alone have you scrap cars and lorries but also disused cars and other vehicles.</P>
    <P>Supposing the local authority steps in, as it will have power to do when this Bill becomes law, and removes the scrap from the site and disposes of it somewhere&mdash;and what a problem that will be&mdash;can the owner come along and say that in the removal of the junk the local authority got rid of a number of cars capable of being put to use again?  That will, I am afraid, create a problem to which I would like the Minister to give his attention before the Committee Stage of the Bill.  There are several other points I mentioned which I think the Minister should also examine before we come to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say on this measure is connected with something that does not appear in the Bill at all.  In this legislation the word &ldquo;site&rdquo; seems to refer to land only and not to water.  I would point out that there are several derelict canals, lakes and so forth which should come under the provisions of the Bill.  The last Deputy referred to what the Minister for Transport and Power was doing about providing fisheries in canals, but I do not think the Deputy <Col N="435" /> had in mind the canals inside the Dublin city boundary.  These waterways are only dumping grounds for dead dogs, cats and all sorts of . They are also full of weeds and many children have been drowned through being caught in those weeds.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister put something about areas occupied by water into this Bill.  I would point out that the Liffey was a filthy river up to a short time ago.  Nobody would take responsibility for cleaning it and it was necessary for me to suggest in the Dublin Corporation that the Corporation would take legal action against the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  I am not sure whether the Corporation have any power in future to compel the Port and Docks Board to keep the river clean.  Surely a local authority should be given power to see that either the Port and Docks Board or whoever is responsible for a river should keep the waterways clear of filth.  I suggest that the Minister inserts a provision in the Bill dealing with water.</P>

      <P>I feel that the introduction of the Bill at this time is very desirable.  Moreover, a large number of voluntary bodies who entered the competition, which Bord Fáilte has been sponsoring to beautify our towns, find considerabe difficulty in getting their efforts brought to fruition mainly because the existence of derelict sites militates considerably against them. Accordingly, I was particularly pleased to hear the announcement of the Minister some weeks ago on the propose introduction of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to remedy difficulties and anomalies which existed in the previous Act.  I <Col N="436" /> agree with another speaker who pointed out the ineffectiveness of the existing Town Planning code.  That, of course, is a matter for another day but it is all the more reason why this Bill should come along at this time. There are many difficulties under present legislation to be remedied. There is a general tendency, and a very praiseworthy one, nowadays on the part of voluntary committees in towns and villages to try to make them more attractive to the eye and generally to introduce much needed amenities, particularly at seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>It is the experience of all of these committees that they are prevented a good deal from providing these amenities very often because of lack of land accommodation.  Land is becoming a more and more difficult problem, whether it be good or bad. At the moment there is no town or village which has not a number of derelict sites.  The great difficulty seems to be to acquire ownership of these sites.  In fact it is sometimes more difficult than in the case of good land.</P>
    <P>That is something I cannot understand. I have had experience of it in my own town where there is a very energetic local committee who took on the job of entering for the Tidy Town Competition.  By and large, they got all the necessary co-operation from the people of the town and from landowners in general.  But there were a few black spots&mdash;cases of derelict house sites for which either no owner could be found or, as in one case, where the owner was found but was not willing to give the necessary facilities for the acquisition and improvement of a highly objectionable site.  This Bill will go a long way to meet such a situation particularly when the Minister is introducing a scheme of grants to enable local authorities and voluntary bodies to provide certain very desirable amenities on these sites.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have expressed doubt as to whether the Bill contains sufficient definition of what a derelict site is.  I have in mind particularly quarries and refuse dumps <Col N="437" /> while other speakers have referred to car dumps.  No doubt the Minister has taken the existence of such places into consideration and has provided that the terms of the Bill will adequately deal with them.  However, if the Minister has any doubt on that point, I would respectfully suggest to him that the measure should be re-examined and if amendments are desirable to provide for such contingencies, they should be introduced now.</P>
    <P>One Deputy stated that the appeals machinery was not equitable.  I believe it would be a complete waste of time to have any kind of appeals machinery other than that of an appeal to the Minister.  Litigation before the Courts is costly and can be very uncertain.  I believe that, by and large, appeals coming before the Minister are decided equitably to the satisfaction of all concerned. The Minister is not infallible in these matters but he is in a position to have all the facts before him and give a decision in the light of those facts.  I do not think he will weigh the scales in favour of the local authority. In fact, I would say that he would, if possible, give the benefit of a doubt to the appellant.</P>
    <P>A suggestion I would put to the Minister is that he should make clear where the initiative lies in this matter of clearing sites.  The Bill does not state whether the members of the local authority or the county manager may take action.  I can see the possibility of friction between members of local authorities and county managers if that point is not made clear.  Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that the less say members of local authorities had in the matter of appeals and asking the county manager to make orders, the better.  I thoroughly agree. Even though we complained in the past that we were not in a position to clear these derelict sites, I am afraid that now, when we have sufficient scope, local authorities will be reluctant to act in certain cases where the sites are the property of local people who might raise objection.

      <P>Might I just clarify a point made by Deputy Sherwin which I think may be misinterpreted? When the Deputy asked whether or not water and waterways were included in the Bill, I said they were.  I feel the House may have felt that the word &ldquo;water&rdquo; should have been mentioned in the Bill.  The fact is that, under the Interpretation Act, land includes water as far as the effects of the Bill are concerned.  Therefore, water is effectively included.</P>

      <P>This is one of these Bills that sound excellent on paper.  A Bill is introduced in Dáil Éireann dealing with derelict sites. The idea is that the State or the local authorities should have the power to take over anything they consider to be a derelict site.  I think Deputy Sherwin has brought out very well that the question of what is actually a derelict site will lead to a good deal of controversy.  If we pass this Bill we are giving to the local authorities &mdash;and, I suppose, to the Government as a whole&mdash;a good deal of power to go in on any person's land, on any private ownership, and to declare it a derelict site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people when they come to consider derelict sites must think of what Deputy Sherwin has just been talking about, the Dublin canals. Since C.I.E. gave up the use of these canals they have been overgrown with weeds.  They are literally rotting with them and they are more or less cesspools which are injurious to the health of the community as a whole.  This Bill enables the local authority, which I assume in this case to be Dublin Corporation, to go in and take possession of the derelict sites concerned, or force the owner of the site to do a job on it or, in the event of his failing <Col N="439" /> to do the job, to do the job themselves and make him pay.</P>
    <P>Does this mean that if we pass this Bill&mdash;the Minister has just clarified the position by saying that water is included&mdash;probably the first order will be that Dublin Corporation, if they are doing their duty, will order C.I.E. to clean the canals?  That seems to be a rather long-winded way of going about things.  I am merely citing this as one particular instance.  I would imagine that the health authority in Dublin already has such power, looking at it from the medical point of view of the injurious effect these cesspools have on the health of the people, without having to come to the Dáil with a Bill for derelict sites.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the bedsteads? They would not be injurious but they are very ugly to look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point I would find difficult to answer. Anyway, in so far as they dam up the canal and lead to further growth of weeds, they probably would be injurious to health.  In rural Ireland and in the towns you see many sites with houses on them, houses which the local authorities have condemned.  The people who own those houses have not sufficient financial means at their disposal to pull them down and build other houses on them or even to repair them.  I know of many instances where local authorities have been asked to take over sites like that and have refused to do so.</P>
      <P>This Bill, as I read it briefly yesterday evening, seems to me to impose on private owners the liability that they may be taken over by a local authority, but it does not seem to impose on a local authority the obligation to remove eyesores for which they themselves may be responsible.</P>

Tá mórchuid díobh imithe ar shlí na fírinne.  Dá bhrí sin, ba mhaith linn rud éigin a dhéanamh chun cabhrú leo, ach níl fhios agam an bhfuil an tairiscint seo oiriúnach chun rud mar sin do chur i bhfeidhm.  Tá fhios agam, mar a dúras an oíche faoi dheireadh, go bhfuil eolas againn go léir go bhfuil an deacracht sin ina aigne ag an Aire agus go bhfuil sé toilteanach i mo thuairimse rud éigin a dhéanamh más féidir é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>When discussing this motion last week, I made reference to the fact, of which everyone in the House is aware, that the Volunteers in their time spent a number of years fighting for the cause of freedom, working for it in special ways, or in prison, and in consequence some of them in the public service are retiring on smaller pensions than they would otherwise have received. In some cases they have a small military service pension which shows that they were active Volunteers and whenever they were allowed that pension it could not count, of course, for a pension in the public services.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the scattered remnants of the old I.R.A. at present are deserving of our financial support. An effort was made to provide for those who were in necessitous circumstances by bringing in the Special Allowances Act which, I think, was welcomed by everyone but, unfortunately, the means test attached to it is such that many deserving people cannot benefit and the reference made in this motion&mdash;that the Government should introduce certain amending legislation to ensure a reasonable standard of living for the Volunteers in their declining years&mdash;may not be necessary.  That, perhaps, could be done by regulation&mdash;the question of adjusting or amending the means test. If a man provided a residence of his own, a little cottage or something like <Col N="442" /> that, he would be entitled to draw the allowance but there is a figure of £3 or some such figure counted against him in his own home as free maintenance.</P>
    <P>I think that there are many aspects of the Act, as it applies, that should be reconsidered.  I know that the Minister is very anxious to do something for those who have service pensions of less than £1 per week, but the difficulty is how to do it equitably and in accordance with the laws and regulations at present in existence.  I am sure the Minister has already given consideration to the matter but, at any rate, there is a request from those of the old I.R.A. organisations now left to give special consideration to members with small weekly or monthly amounts.</P>
    <P>I believe members on all sides would like to give that recognition to the survivors of the fight for freedom. They spent a great part of their young lives, risked everything they had, lost opportunities perhaps, in many cases, of providing good careers for themselves in life and some of them had to take the emigrant ship.  Others had to fit into whatever positions were available at the time.  We should all cooperate in trying not to drag on this question any longer but, instead we should try to finalise it now because in a few years it will not be necessary to consider it.  Few, if any, will be left to avail of whatever amendments may be made in the laws now applying to them.</P>
    <P>There is nothing further that I need say beyond renewing the appeal to the Minister to consider favourably acting on the lines indicated in the motion or introducing legislation or making regulations so that those who did so much against great odds to attain our freedom would not be deserted by the few comrades who are left in their declining years.</P>

      <P>There are very few people in this House and in the country who do not agree that, if possible, the old soldiers of the Republic would get a well deserved increase.  Motions of this kind are always subject to the suspicion that political kudos may be the ultimate aim rather than benefit for deserving people.  I am glad to say that there are many in this House who served the Irish Republican Army and I am certain that there are many good spokesmen yet who will agree with me that if and when this country can afford more the men so well deserving of recognition will get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to say that any Party or any Government could do more for the soldiers of the old I.R.A. than the present Government.  There is no doubt in my mind that we are knocking at an open door in so far as the <Col N="445" /> present occupant of the Ministry of Defence is concerned.  Although a young man, he is fully appreciative of the fact that the men of the old I.R.A. and the women of Cumann-na-mBan, backed as they were by a then united people, a fearless and courageous people, were one generation in 700 years.  It is quite true to say that every generation for 700 years had had registered protests against foreign occupation of this country but it remained for the men of the old I.R.A. to ensure that the enemy had to get out of this country whether they liked it or not.  They were tough times, trying times.  Many thousands of people occupied the jails and dungeons of this country.</P>
    <P>Many thousands went through the hardships of fighting an enemy; though they were badly armed and had no reserves of any great account behind them.  The actual number on active service, that is, whole-time men, brigade staffs, divisional, battalion and company staffs, was 5,456 on the 11th July, 1921.  The numbers in jail were very considerable.  It is quite true to say they were neglected until 1934 and unfortunately many of the men who should have qualified for pensions did not take it seriously enough.  There were many cases of men who were unable to give correct dates and whose officers were killed or went to other countries.  Many of those who should have qualified for military service pensions did not apply either through shyness or through being over-conscientious when they had to take an oath or, as I have said, because their officers were not there to verify for them.</P>
    <P>There was another reason, too, why some persons did not qualify.  There were some cases where men were deliberately denied their service because of jealousy, either political or personal. It was a shame and a disgrace and the people responsible for it will go down to their graves as men who have been traitors to their own comrades because of jealousy, political spite or something of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Minister <Col N="446" /> knows that is perfectly true.  I can truthfully say I have never yet and never will deny any man his right no matter what his political affiliations were and no matter what side he took in the Civil War.  Even in cases of personal enmity I have never failed to verify a person where necessary.  I mention this because even at this late hour it might be possible for the Minister to have an investigation into certain cases.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider seriously the question of giving at least a gratuity to many of the men who were refused military service pensions.  Even a small gratuity would assuage the feelings, which were hurt no doubt, of those men who gave good service but were turned down through no fault of their own.  As I have urged on many occasions, I now appeal to the Minister to consider these marginal cases and, where justified, to give a gratuity of even £10 or £20 a year covering the years of service to the country.</P>
      <P>Very often it was not the men who pulled the trigger who freed this country. Without the men who guarded the flying columns, without the men who carried the despatches, who made the dug-outs and knocked down the bridges, our freedom would never have been achieved.  The men who knocked down the bridges, a major operation, when there was no hope of blowing them up were indispensable. They risked their lives in knocking down bridges leading to important military strongholds of the armed forces of occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have every confidence in the Minister. My experience has been that wherever there was a doubt he gave the benefit of that doubt.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the granting of a small gratuity to the gallant old soldiers who were refused full recognition or who did not prove sufficiently well that they had the military service demanded by the board.  Very often the divisional and brigade officers had no knowledge whatsoever of the service of these men.  The special allowance granted to old I.R.A.  men has been unquestionably one of the greatest boons to my <Col N="447" /> old comrades.  In the winter of their lives it is good for them to know they are not without some recognition, and fairly substantial recognition, and that they will not die in any of our city homes because of financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>While I am greatly in favour of the special allowance to men who deserve it, I abhor the fact that many men who were never in the Irish Republican Army are now in receipt of special allowances.  Once they are, it is very difficult to take them from them. It is disgraceful and it is up to every member of this House and every former member of the I.R.A. to ensure that the fraud will stop.  It is painful that men who would not be even of numerical value are in receipt of £80 or £90 a year.  I do not know how their consciences can help them to enjoy it.</P>
    <P>The same applies to some Cumann na mBan members, although there were some splendid girls who would perhaps have qualified for service but who did not make application.  It is hateful and will not be easily forgotten that people who are not entitled to pensions are getting them here, there and everywhere.  The officers who verified for them have a lot to answer for.  They might as well steal the money as certify that So-And-So was a member of the I.R.A. and fully entitled to a military service pension, and append their names to something which was false, dishonest and disreputable.  That has brought more disfavour on the old soldiers of the Republic than anything else.  It has left a worse taste in their mouths than anything else.  I refer to this getting of special allowances by people who are not entitled to them.  I believe these special allowances were one of the best things ever given to the old soldiers.  But they should be respected.  They must be dealt with honourably.  Otherwise we shall have discredit brought on certain men who in the past were immune from trickery or fraud. Unfortunately, some few have loaned themselves here and there to a certain course of conduct.  Fortunately cases <Col N="448" /> are exceptional.  But even one is too many.  One in a brigade is too many. One in a division is too many.</P>
    <P>I believe we are knocking at an open door.  I know that when the economy of the country will permit it better pensions will be given.  There have been substantial increases over the years.  When the economy of the nation permits it further increases will be given.  These men have never been forgotten.  It would be catastrophic if they were forgotten.  There are people who will claim, I know, in the years to come that by some miraculous method of theirs this country gained its freedom.  Let us never forget that the credit for freeing this country rests with the officers and men of the Old I.R.A.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for a motion of this kind at the moment.  This Government has never ignored the demands of the old soldiers.  All through the years better pay and better pensions have been provided for them.  There was an increase of 5 per cent. in the last Budget.  There was an increase in the previous Budget.  The increase may appear small, but small sums mount.  Deputy Tierney should withdraw this motion now.  Many of us on this side of the House and many on the other side of the House will never forget the old soldiers.  It is an unjust criticism of a Government that has done so much for the people concerned to move this motion here.  It almost amounts to a vote of censure.  It is the Minister's responsibility to cater for our soldiers, old soldiers and serving soldiers, in a manner worthy of Irishmen.  I know that there are grievances here and there and I appeal to the Minister, if he can at all, to alleviate the hardships suffered by some of the old soldiers who were refused military service pensions.  I sincerely hope he will try to do that. If he would even give them a small gratuity, that would indicate that they had service of no small measure.  I hope the young people, particularly the young Deputies here, will always appreciate that it was not the people who passed pious resolutions who freed this country but rather the soldiers of the I.R.A., whose numerical <Col N="449" /> strength was no more than about 50,000.</P>

Ba ceist don Moltóir é <Col N="450" /> na pinsin éagsamhla do shocrú agus má shocruigh sé sin pinsean níos aoirde a thabhairt do dhaoine áirithe ná do dhaoine eile, ní bheadh sé im thuairim ceart ná cóir dhuinne an bhreith sin do chur ar ceal.

    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Davern of people who did not get pensions and of the rejection of other people who, from the facts, should have got them, I can only say that there has been a number of opportunities given to everybody to establish whether or not they had service qualifying them for pensions. It may be a fact that some people who had, in fact, got the service did not succeed in establishing it but they all got more than one opportunity to do so and there is no reason to believe that if they could not establish it on previous occasions, when the events were fresher in people's memory, they would be more successful now if the matter was reopened.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the reopening of that question would be a very big matter indeed and would be more difficult now than it was a few years ago.  I cannot undertake to reopen the whole question of military service pensions again.  I think that anything that could be done in that respect has already been done and if people failed to establish their service then there does not seem to me to be any way of assisting them to establish it now.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the case that has been made in general, I should correct one or two misapprehensions under which the mover of the motions appears to have been labouring.  He mentioned in connection with the increases given in the last two Budgets that it later developed that if <Col N="452" /> an unfortunate pensioner was in receipt of another pension the last one was cut and, in effect, he got nothing at all.  I got the impression that he was referring to special allowances when he made that statement, and I can assure him that those Budget increases were not taken into account with regard to special allowances and, as far as I am aware, they are not taken into account with regard to social welfare benefits either.</P>
    <P>The mover of the motion apparently did not accept my interjection that people who applied under the 1934 Act could not have applied earlier. After I had corrected him on that point he asked me if that was my interpretation and later on he said he could not follow that line of argument. This is neither my interpretation nor my line of argument.  It is a fact that the 1924 Act provided only for people who had pre-Truce service and service on one side in the Civil War.  Therefore, either pre-Truce service only or pre-Truce service and service on the other side, would not qualify anybody under the 1924 Act.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy MacEoin that when the 1934 Act was passed it was open to the Government to make it retrospective and to pay the previous ten years' pension but financial considerations and other matters involved obviously ruled that out and they still rule it out.  It is one thing to provide for a pension of an annual amount and another thing to try and collect ten times that amount and pay it out as a lump sum.  The Government at the time was prepared to face up to the question of giving these pensions but obviously they did not feel that they could face up to the prospects of providing ten times the amount as a lump sum.</P>
    <P>I hope and believe that I am as sympathetic as any Deputy in this matter.  I would be the last to suggest that the amount of even the largest military service pension is adequate in relation to the service to the nation given by the people who achieved the independence of this part of the country.  I do not suggest that for a moment and I should like to be able to undertake the task of making all <Col N="453" /> those pensions as nearly equitable recompense as possible.</P>
    <P>No Government has attempted to do that.  They realised that the country would not be able to face up to it. What is suggested in this motion is a completely new approach in regard to the Military Service Pensions Acts.  As I have said, neither in the 1924 Act nor in the 1934 Act did the Government do anything more than give a recognition of service.  The pensions were never intended to be on a scale adequate to maintain the pensioner or even to have a significant effect on his standard of living.  They were intended merely as a recognition of service.  It is a fact that, when the pensions were originally granted, most of the recipients were in the prime of life and were in a position to work and build up the new State which they had created.  For those who, because either of disease or wounds arising from their service, were unfit to do that, provision was made under the Army Pensions Acts for disability pensions.</P>
    <P>There is no point in suggesting, as a number of Deputies did suggest, that pensioners have been given less than £1 per week to live on.  I do not think anything is to be gained by making statements such as that.  Deputy Giles suggested that there are such men in our workhouses today awaiting the last call.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The special allowance provisions of the Army Pensions Acts should eliminate the necessity for that.  I admit they do not do much more than that.  They are intended to do that and they should ensure that what Deputy Giles suggested does not happen.  I agree that the vast majority of the military service pensions are of very small amounts but I maintain that nobody is solely dependent on his military service pension to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are something in the order of 9,700 military service pensions under £1 per week and to prove the point I <Col N="454" /> have made, though there are 6,000 odd special allowance holders, there are only 1,100 of those who also have military service pensions.  That appears to me to be definite proof that of the 9,700 military service pensioners who have less than £1 per week pensions, there are no more than 1,100 at the very outside who have no other means outside of their military service pensions and who have to depend on the provisions of the special allowance in order to maintain themselves.</P>
    <P>Also in the administration of Social Welfare benefits an allowance of up to £80 of military service pension is disregarded for the purpose of the Social Welfare benefits.  Therefore it is clear that there is nobody in fact depending on a military service pension of less than £1 a week in order to exist.  There is also preference given in State and local authority employment to old I.R.A. men.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to suggest that the lower pensions should be raised to at least £1 per week and leave it at that. Of course, you cannot leave it at that because in all justice to those who got higher pensions they would have to be raised proportionately.  It was a fundamental principle that the pension granted was in proportion to the service assessed by the referee and I do not see how you can increase the lower pensions up to £52 a year and do nothing in respect of pensions that are just above that.  Obviously, if there is to be an increase it must be an increase all round and I certainly would not attempt to increase some of the pensions and ignore the others.  To increase the pensions all round would be financially virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>Running through the remarks of the Deputies who spoke was the statement that the numbers of military service pensioners are getting fewer every year.  It is of course true that in the past few years that has unfortunately been the case.  They have not, however, been getting fewer for as long as Deputies might think, because up to 1958 pensions were still being granted.  Since the work of the referee came to an end, however, there have been no additions, only reductions, in the ranks of pensioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> In the past few years the amount paid has been going down.</P>
    <P>But the total payable in military service pensions and special allowances has not been going down.  For instance, from the year ending March 31st, 1955, to the year ended March 31st, 1960, there was a reduction in the total amount of military service pensions of £52,294 but in that same period there was an increase in the total of military service pensions and special allowances of £44,998.  So in actual fact, the total spent in that way has been increasing.  Accordingly, the whole problem is not becoming easier financially on any Government that has to provide the money.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin, Deputy Davern and other Deputies stated that in so far as I or the Government are concerned they were pushing an open door in this matter and that they felt if there was anything possible we could do in this respect it would be done.  I think the record of this Government shows that this is the case.  The special allowance provisions of the Army Pensions Act were introduced in the first instance by a Fianna Fáil Government to cover cases of hardship and later the only increases ever given in military service pensions were also given under Fianna Fáil administration. In 1953 there were increases in pensions not exceeding £100 per annum of 50 per cent. and pensions over that figure were increased on a diminishing scale.  The present Government in its last two Budgets have given increases in military service pensions of 6 per cent. in 1959 and 5 per cent. in 1960.  Their combined effect was something over eleven per cent. and even though each of them, taken separately, was small, at least, the evidence is that, in so far as it is feasible in relation to the economic position of the country, this Government accept the principle of increasing military service pensions.  I can assure Deputies that, as far as I am concerned, I shall always endeavour to see that, so far as possible, military service pensioners will share in whatever benefits it is possible for the Government to give at Budget time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> I can only conclude by pointing out to the House that this motion, in asking that military service pensions be adjusted so that the pensions, of themselves, would assure an adequate standard of living, is calling for a completely new approach which would involve a great amount of money.  I would also point out that that approach seems to be unnecessary so far as the vast majority of military service pensioners are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is.  I have pointed out that that is an unrealistic approach.  All pensioners would have to get a proportionate increase because the pensions are based on the service given by the pensioners as assessed by the referee, the statutory authority for assessing such pensions. If a man who according to the referee is qualified for only a small pension has that pension increased two or three times, it is obvious that those who were assessed as having better service than he would be entitled to better pensions.</P>
      <P>I was saying that so far as the vast majority of pensioners are concerned there is really no necessity for this motion.  I have shown by the figures that the majority of people receiving military service pensions have been able to provide for themselves since that time.  Of course, that is what it was understood they would have to do when these pensions Acts were brought in originally.  Those who are in very great need are covered by the special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts and by the different Social Welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> I think the answer to this motion was given by Deputy MacEoin.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Minister will tell us that the Government have, in effect, put this motion into operation because of the special allowances provisions of the Act and that, in that way, they are guarding against undue hardship on the members of the old I.R.A. who are well down financially, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is the answer to it. The question of the adequacy of special allowances is being looked into at the moment.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies referred to the severity of the means test.  Since I came into the office as Minister for Defence the means test has been relaxed in a number of respects, and it may be that there is a case for relaxing it in other respects also.  I believe that is the way to give effect to what Deputy Tierney has in mind. There is not a case, on economic grounds at any rate, for the increase of all military service pensions.</P>
    <P>The case has been made for those in very bad circumstances, but that has already been covered, in so far as it is possible to cover it, by the special allowances.  The adoption of the motion would not improve conditions for those who are most in need.  In fact, it would mainly benefit those who are not so much in need as to qualify for special allowances.  I can only ask the House not to press this motion in view of the fact that the special allowance provisions are there and in view of the fact that there is ample evidence that this Government is prepared to see as far as possible that any benefits it is possible to give will be given to military service pensioners as well as to other deserving sections of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister sits down, I should like to revert to Deputy Davern's assertion that there are people who had medals and were not entitled to them.  What are the Minister's intentions regarding such people and is it intended to take any action against them?  Might I <Col N="458" /> ask the Minister also is it not true that his predecessor in the Fianna Fáil Benches in 1947 said that the Military Service Pensions Board had concluded their work, but in 1948 it commenced again and continued to 1958?  Does the Minister not agree that in 1948 representations were made to him showing there were cases like those mentioned by Deputy Davern, cases of people who were entitled to pensions but who had not got them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to medals, we cannot undertake to investigate every medal already on issue but in the case of every new application for a special allowance the question of whether the medal was duly awarded or not is reinvestigated.  If any other case comes to notice, either through a perusal of files or in any other way and if it is a doubtful case, the award of the medal is reinvestigated. If it is found not to have been duly awarded, then the special allowance is stopped in that case.  In the case of any new application for a special allowance the matter is investigated as meticulously as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of reopening the cases of people who failed to qualify for military service pensions, it is a fact that that matter was again taken up under the 1949 Act and that the investigation concluded in 1958.  It is also a fact that not just at that time but continuously I get representations in respect of people who, it is stated, should be entitled to pensions but who failed to get them.  As I have said, there is no reason to suppose that people who failed to establish their entitlement to military service certificates on a number of previous occasions would succeed now so many years after the events which would qualify them for a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to be brief. Like other speakers from these benches, I welcome this motion.  I understand and appreciate it and I am sure that the proposer of the motion had the best intentions in introducing it.  If not, I should be the first to challenge <Col N="459" /> it, if I thought the old I.R.A. men in receipt of pensions were to be paraded before this House and regarded as mendicants.  My own approach to this motion is somewhat different from that of the other speakers who have already spoken.  I believe that the whole history of the 1924, 1934 and 1949 Acts and all the Acts to date has been the main cause of disrupting a great deal of the unity we had in the Volunteer movement and more so, in many respects, than that unfortunate period of 1922-23.</P>
      <P>When the 1924 Act was passed, as already mentioned by the Minister, it required pre-Truce service and service with a particular side immediately after 1921.  The 1934 Act came along to try to even up or give a remedy, or a &ldquo;fair do&rdquo; to those who took the Republican side, those who had pre-Truce service and who had service in the Republican movement during the Civil War.  I remember that in 1927 it was the policy of the Party to which I am attached to parade and to use as effectively as we could the question of military service pensions granted under the 1924 Act and when the 1934 Act was introduced, the then Taoiseach, who is now President, gave as his reason for the introduction of that Bill, the requests he had received from men who qualified under the 1924 Act or served in the National Army.  He said that they maintained that if they were deprived of the pension they would consider it a great hardship. Subsequently the '34 Act came in. Like the '24 Act the 1934 Act had peculiar conditions attached to it. Under the 1934 Act you had as the first referee, the late Judge O'Connor, and it was left to the referee to give a definition of what was known as &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently the late Judge O'Donnell was referee.  Under all referees since the coming into operation of the 1934 Act, as one of the senior officers of the West Limerick Brigade, I was one of the verifying officers and I saw immediately the great disadvantages arising from the clash over differences in their definitions of active service.  It was very <Col N="460" /> hard to understand who was qualified at all.</P>
    <P>The Government of 1949 brought in an Act to amend and extend the 1934 Act and we were all hoping that many of the cases that were considered border line cases and which did not qualify under the service definition of the late Judge O'Connor or the late Judge O'Donnell and the subsequent referees might then qualify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We had hoped that the 1949 Act would remedy all the border line cases.</P>
      <P>I said that my contribution to this debate would be somewhat different from that of other speakers.  The people I am interested in all the time and who apparently are not covered by this motion at all are the borderline cases taken in under the 1934 Act and the subsequent Act of 1949 which remained in operation until 1958.</P>
      <P>Let us be very honest and sincere about this.  It is agreed that it is not a question of whether you are getting £10, £12 or £15 or what you are getting per year by way of military service certificate or award; the main and fundamental thing to my mind that affected the Volunteers was the fact that they got recognition.  Whether that recognition carried a monetary reward of £10 or up to £100 did not really matter so long as they got the recognition they were entitled to get. The sore point and the one that hurt a good many of the Volunteers entitled to that recognition is that they were the people who were regarded as border line cases and did not fit within the scope of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that we had in Dublin a meeting of all the brigades in the country when the late Judge O'Donnell was referee.  We tried by a concerted uniform action to get from the referee a clear definition of what active service <Col N="461" /> would be accepted.  We went back to the various brigades with a clear understanding that it was not necessary to have been in an armed engagment in all cases, that men who were key men whether in the intelligence service, outpost service or in the special services, would qualify, provided that for the three months before the Truce they were continuously engaged in that type of service.  All of us who came to Dublin from the various brigades went home very satisfied that we had absorbed 95 or 98 per cent of the men we were interested in.  But a change of referee came and that definition of service went by the board.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Tierney had the best intentions when he introduced this motion.  When I first read it I said: &ldquo;What can the present Government do to meet this particular demand?  It would mean legislation.&rdquo; I said this because you could not at the moment give an increase to a particular number of people in receipt of pensions of a certain amount without applying it to all who are qualified under the 1924, 1934 and the 1949 Acts.</P>
    <P>We have just heard from the Minister that at the moment we have 9,700 old I.R.A. men in receipt of pensions of less than £1 per week and that we have 6,000 in receipt of special allowances. Of the 9,700 people that Deputy Tierney had more or less covered in his motion only 1,200 would qualify for the special allowance. To do so they had to satisfy the conditions of the Act as regards their medical condition and as regards means.  If they were not able to satisfy the investigation officer that their means were less than the annual amount that they were entitled to get under the Act, they would not qualify. If they were under 70, they had to produce medical evidence that they were suffering from some infirmity and unable to work or earn a livelihood.</P>
    <P>The point I wish to make is this.  I do not agree at all with Deputy Giles and I am sorry to hear that there are any of the old I.R.A. men in what are called the workhouses of county Meath.</P>

These were the men who made it possible for the active service units to operate.

    <P>Deputy Tierney might have the best intentions in advocating that people in receipt of military service pensions of less than £52 per year should get more.  I am glad to hear from the Minister that the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government were not negligent, unheeding or unmindful of their position.  The three increases that have been granted by Fianna Fáil Governments from 1953 to the Budget of 1960 to members of <Col N="463" /> the Old I.R.A. who were in receipt of pensions of less than £1 per week represent a total increase of 61 per cent.  In addition, special allowances were introduced principally to meet the cases that Deputy Giles has mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not agree <i>in toto</i> with what Deputy Davern said, that there are people in receipt of special allowances who are not entitled to them.  That may happen in South Tipperary and in other brigade areas but as one of the two senior surviving officers of the West Limerick Brigade I can say that any man in my brigade area who is in receipt of a special allowance is fully qualified and <i>bona fide</i> and had the requisite service to entitle him to a medal for qualification purposes for that special allowance.</P>
    <P>That special allowance was also introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government to protect men who had continuous association with the Volunteers for the three months prior to the Truce and to ensure that in the winter of their years they would not be allowed to die in poverty or have to seek refuge in a public institution.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the special allowances with which I do not agree. I refer to the severity of the means test.  The means test is applied much more severely and exactingly than in the case of old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and other social benefits.  We would be doing something of practical value for people who are in receipt of medals and who on reaching the age of 70 years will become eligible to special allowances, by modifying the means test.  If an applicant is in receipt of and old age pension one half the amount is calculated against him.  If his wife receives an old age pension that amount also is calculated as income.  The result is that the amount of the special allowance is very small in that case.</P>
    <P>We should all join in pushing the open door to which Deputy MacEoin has referred.  The first step would be to ask the Minister for Defence to instruct the people who administer military service pensions to modify <Col N="464" /> the severity of the means test in special allowance cases.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Tierney, who, I am sure, has put down the motion in all good faith and with the best of intentions, that the men who are in receipt of even small pensions are very pleased because they have got recognition for the service they gave during the Four Glorious Years.  They are the one section that did not get fair treatment both from this Government and from the people who were in office on two occasions.  The definition of service was left to referees who had the status of circuit court judges and whose definitions of active service varied.  In the West Limerick Brigade area the men who are in receipt of pensions, no matter how small, are glad to have them.  They are conscious of the fact that on three occasions they got from a Fianna Fáil Government increases which represented a total increase of 61 per cent. They are quite happy and satisfied with what they got but I do plead for the men who have a case in respect of the special services they rendered in the pre-Truce period and who were denied service certificates.  The majority of them are approaching the time when they can apply for special allowances.  As we have this opportunity of discussing Old I.R.A. pensions, I would ask the Minister to modify the means test and give these people the recognition to which they are justly entitled.</P>

      <P>The motion that is before the House raises a matter which is of concern to many Deputies in relation to the people affected.  It is true to say that in relation to persons in receipt of military service pensions efforts have been made from time to time to meet the case that can be made on their behalf. Certainly, for many years their case was entirely neglected and they were amongst the forgotten soldiers of the country until the first Inter-Party Government came into office.  It was at that time that some effort was made to appreciate the difficulties that these people had to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion deals with the persons <Col N="465" /> in particular hard luck and difficulty and suggests that there should be some effort made to alleviate their difficulties.  I certainly feel that this motion should commend itself to the House and should have the sympathy and understanding of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the motion to &ldquo;a reasonable standard of living&rdquo; We all know that even with the best intentions in the world if a pension is fixed or a particular sum of money is allocated under circumstances in which rising costs begin to eat into the real value of money, difficulties are occasioned in providing what the motion asks for, a reasonable standard of living.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because in the reply today to a Question put down by Deputy Kyne and myself the Minister said:</P>
      <P>So far as the City section of the Waterford-Tramore road is concerned, I understand that the City Engineer considers that there is a possibility that the road may deteriorate under heavy traffic but that he was unable to give a quantitative estimate of expected damage.  The additional Coras Iompair Éireann traffic will be considerably lighter than that envisaged by the City Engineer, and the technical information available to me does not indicate that it will cause appreciable damage.  If extra maintenance does become necessary, the Corporation may charge the usual proportion of the expenditure to the Main Road Upkeep Grant....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident that the technical information to the Minister is not sufficient. The portion of the road I mention&mdash;and I am speaking for the Waterford City Council&mdash;is from the junction of the Tramore and Cork roads out to what is called the Blackrock and is about two miles long. That road crosses a swamp and it was <Col N="466" /> with great alarm that the people of Waterford read in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 8th November that portion of the Dublin-Limerick road which was a mile and one-eighth long would cost £54,000.  It says here: &ldquo;Built on the bog it cracked and slanted according to the conditions of the bog.&rdquo;  It also says: &ldquo;The scheme was undertaken by North Tipperary County Council, who received a 100 per cent. Government grant of £54,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To say that this road crosses a bog is an understatement.  It crosses a swamp and I am grateful to the <i>Irish Independent</i> for their timely photograph in today's issue showing the road, which crosses the swamp, completely flooded.  A train is also crossing the swamp but it is on a higher bank than the road.  That is the portion of the road with which I am concerned. The part of the road from the Blackrock to Sheeps Bridge and leading into the county will be dealt with by my colleague Deputy Kyne.  It is a matter for the county council of which he is a member as well as being a Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Minister said today that the additional C.I.E. traffic would be considerably lighter than that envisaged by the City Engineer.  The City Engineer's envisaging of this traffic was due to his being a member of a deputation that was led by the Mayor of Waterford to meet Mr. Frank Lemass, General manager of C.I.E.  I happened to be on that deputation.  He told us that at the peak period there would be 20 buses on this road.  There would have to be twenty and there might have to be thirty buses on this road.</P>
    <P>When the new road is flooded the traffic must go up the old road as they call it.  That is a secondary road, portion of which is also in the city, and that road will take some punishment from the buses.  When there was a bus service on it away back in the thirties it cut the old road to pieces.  These two roads, the old road as far as Cows Bridge, and the new road as far as the Blackrock and Sheeps Bridge are in the bailiwick of the Waterford Corporation. Seeing that the mile and one-eighth of road crossing the bog will <Col N="467" /> cost £54,000, it will cost nearly £100,000 to put this new road in order and goodness knows what it will cost to make the old road fit to carry this traffic.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take immediate steps to deal with this situation.  It is reasonable to suggest that he should send some of the officers of his engineering section to Waterford at the earliest possible moment to consult with the city manager and the local officials.  He will discover that I have not exaggerated in the least about this. There are the facts in the <i>Irish Press</i> and the photograph in the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister says that if this extra maintenance becomes necessary, and it will become necessary, he will put up the usual proportion of the expenditure. That is imposing a burden on the taxpayers in respect of a service that C.I.E. should be doing.  The Waterford city ratepayers will also have to pay their portion and that is one of the principal reasons why they are alarmed about it.  The memorandum we received from C.I.E. told us that the railway is losing £3,000 a year.</P>

      <P>It may be said that in the summer time during the peak period this road would not be flooded. I would remind the Minister that during August which is the peak period for tourists going to Tramore the tides run very high.  I have seen big tides coming up on to that new road.  If we had some August showers, and it may have been noticed that in recent years we have had some showers in August, the situation would be aggravated.  Recently there were some gala Sundays in Tramore and with the ordinary motor traffic it was almost impossible to get into Tramore. I do not know what would happen if 20 buses were put on the road and only for the train service that was there to relieve that situation I do not know what the people would have done.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this two-and-half-miles of road&mdash;a good part of which is shown in the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash;would cost a great deal of money to maintain.  The moneys will have to come out of the Road Fund and from the ratepayers in Waterford. I appeal to the Minister, therefore, to send his engineering experts to Waterford to consult with the City Manager and the Waterford Borough Surveyor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason why I join with my colleague, Deputy Lynch, on this adjournment debate is because of that portion of the reply given today which stated that &ldquo;the additional Coras Iompair Éireann traffic will be considerably lighter than that envisaged by the City Manager and, the technical information available to me does not indicate that it will cause appreciable damage.&rdquo; That was stated on behalf of the Minister today.  I should like to join issue with the Minister on that.  I realise that his colleague today had to reply from a brief prepared by the Department. The fact is that the Minister must accept responsibility for what his Department says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask a few simple <Col N="469" /> questions.  Have any of the Minister's officials examined this road?  Have they evaluated the consequences if the proposed increased traffic goes on the road to replace the rail service, with particular reference to the traffic over the summer months?  It was stated that &ldquo;the traffic will be considerably lighter&rdquo;.  That means that the Waterford Borough Surveyor is wrong in envisaging heavy traffic.  Last Thursday week a deputation waited on the General Manager of C.I.E. Speaking about replacing the traffic carried by the railroad, he said that buses would give as good a service and &ldquo;To accomplish this up to 20 buses will run simultaneously at times of peak demand&rdquo;.  He expressed the view that buses would provide a greater facility for commuters to the extent that they would carry them beyond the present rail terminus to stopping places more conveniently situated to their places of employment.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the point now that 20 double-deck buses will use this road simultaneously.  This is a seven and a half mile stretch of main road, a good proportion of which runs through a bog.  Of that seven and a half miles two and a half miles are in the corporation area.  I am speaking now mainly for the county council area. The borough engineer, Mr. O'Carroll, has estimated the cost of the increased maintenance to the corporation.  He is quite unprejudiced.  He is a qualified engineer of long standing.  He has no axe to grind.  He says that, as far as he can judge, the cost of increased maintenance will amount to £5,000 per year.  From my previous experience as an Alderman of Waterford Corporation one penny in the £ brings in something in the neighbourhood of £140.  It is easy to calculate from that what the increase in the rates will have to be in order to meet the increased cost of maintenance of this road.  Our county engineer has made no report but, assuming Mr. O'Carroll is right, our proportion will be in the neighbourhood of £10,000 because we will be responsible for twice as much.  The total cost of maintenance will be £15,000.  Contrasting that figure with the estimated loss of £3,000 to C.I.E. <Col N="470" /> in the operation of the railroad there certainly seems to be some false economy somewhere.  I mentioned that at Question Time today.  I think it is not irrelevant to stress the fact that this attempted saving on the part of C.I.E. is foisting an additional burden on the city and county ratepayers of Waterford.  I do not think that is reasonable, and I believe the Minister should indemnify us in some way.</P>
    <P>I have referred so far only to maintenance. To put this road into proper condition to carry double-deck bus traffic it will be necessary, I am informed by the City Engineer and the City Manager, to expend a very large sum indeed.  I quote from the statements made at the deputation: &ldquo;We believe it will cost £100,000.  We must remove Sheep's Bridge, build a new bridge, take out various turns, and widen the road at various parts.&rdquo; Perhaps the Minister will give a grant. I sincerely hope he will because the employment content would be very welcome in such a scheme as this.  It is mainly on the question of maintenance charges that objection is taken by the people of Waterford.  They do not want to lose the railway, but I do not propose to argue the pros and cons of that.  I shall confine myself to the cost of maintenance, estimated by the Borough Surveyor at £5,000 per year.  The most the corporation will get is 40 per cent. In the county area it will be £10,000, and the most we will get is 40 per cent.  Even if it were 50 per cent. there would still be £7,500 to be found each year by way of rates.</P>
    <P>That road is subject to flooding. Luckily for us, a photograph appeared today in the paper produced by Deputy Lynch showing the flooding on that road.  What happens when the road is flooded?  An alternative road is used.  This road has not the Minister's sanction to carry bus traffic, except in an emergency.  The result of all this is that the Waterford ratepayers will have to foot the bill in order to subsidise C.I.E.  Does anyone think that is either fair or reasonable?  Will anyone believe C.I.E. cannot pay dividends when they transfer their burdens <Col N="471" /> to the shoulders of the Waterford ratepayers?</P>
    <P>In conjunction with Deputy Lynch, and on behalf of the people of Waterford, I join in protest against this imposition on the people of Waterford. I was present at the county council meeting when a motion was passed and I was present at the meeting of the Waterford Corporation when a motion was passed.  In justice to the Waterford Corporation and the county council the Minister should state what he intends to do.  We do not propose to shoulder the burden if we can possibly avoid it.  C.I.E. have the same rights as every other road user in the country.  Provided they pay their tax they have every right to use the roads. Is it fair or reasonable, however, to throw a burden on the city and county of Waterford?  All the Waterford Corporation gets out of the Road Fund is a miserable £5,000.  Will the Minister indicate that he regards this as a serious motion, an attempt to draw his attention to something to which attention needs to be drawn? Will he have the matter investigated and give it the sympathetic consideration I believe it deserves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the seriousness of the motion is concerned, I have no doubt whatever that the Deputies interested in this matter are quite serious in bringing it to the notice of the House, to my notice and to the notice of my Department.  This falls into two parts.  There is the question of flooding on a particular stretch of that road. In regard to that flooding, before ever the question of the closing of the railway arose, there was an application in my Department for some financial assistance to remedy or abate the flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That proposal is, at the moment, under consideration in the Department. We will leave that for the moment and deal with the direct matter which has been brought under notice to-night and that is the question of the impact of additional traffic that it is alleged will be thrown on the road from Waterford to Tramore in place of <Col N="472" /> the railway line.  In so far as that matter is concerned, let me say straightaway that some of the facts and figures emerging from the two Deputies who spoke here to-night have not been made available by their engineer's report to my Department.  They have quoted figures of £5,000 for the Corporation's stretch of road and £10,000 for the county council's stretch of road.  None of these figures has been given to my Department in the only engineer's report we have got.</P>
    <P>The next thing is that in so far as the matter has been raised by the manager writing to my Department and enclosing his engineer's report, no real case has been made in regard to this matter at all.  The partial case made is based on figures which, from our information, are not the only figures which have emerged in regard to the amount of additional traffic expected.  The figures we have got so far, and which I understand are C.I.E.'s estimate in this matter, would give us to understand that the alternative service to substitute for the rail service would involve 17 services in each direction in the winter and 25 in summer.  In addition, might I say that it is understood that an additional five ton lorry will be required to meet C.I.E.'s additional freight traffic on the road.</P>
    <P>Those figures are subject to correction, as are any other figures quoted in this matter, but from them it would appear that there must be a heavy lorry traffic using that road and the addition of a single five ton lorry, which would be necessitated, is not going to be regarded as an additional major stress on the road.  The point is that I have available to me those figures which Deputies do not seem to have got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing what the Taoiseach told the Deputy or what the Deputy understood.  What I am quoting here is what we have got so far officially from the Corporation by way of a report from the engineer and his manager.  That report speaks for itself. It is far from complete and could not be regarded as a firm application for <Col N="473" /> anything under any head.  The figures which we have available to us are not figures submitted by your engineer or your manager.  They are figures that we ourselves have got together along with the fact that our own road inspectors are fairly familiar with this road.  As a result of the report sent by the manager and with the intimate knowledge they have of the road we have gone into the matter.</P>
      <P>The report has been inconclusive because of the lack of any really fundamental case and because of the lack of information as to how the road is constructed, what is its subsoil and what is beneath it.  That information has not yet been given to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be right. There may be 30 feet of bog beneath it but so far as the facts given to us by your engineer are concerned that has not been elicited from his report. That is a fundamental matter with regard to what daily stress the road will stand in the future.  It is a fundamental matter and it is elementary that it should be known.  We have not got that information.</P>
      <P>Again, and I say this in no manner of discredit to the Deputy or the other people concerned, it is not a matter for my Department to go down there and prepare your case for you.  The demands on my Department are great and it is a matter for them to bring those demands down to realistic proportions rather than to have to go out and ascertain what your case is.  It is because of that lack of information that my reply to the Question and the supplementary information given to you to-day may appear to conflict with what the Deputy believes to be the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those facts, as the Deputy knows them, have not been made available to us.  If your case is all you say it is <Col N="474" /> and all that you believe it to be the first thing that must be done is to submit every bit of information to the Department.  That is the first thing to do and it has not, up to the moment, been done.  Over and above that are the figures I have given for the Deputy's information about the proposed services which will be necessary to substitute on the road for the rail passenger and freight services.  I have mentioned those figures, without tying myself to them, to show that without the additional information which I have mentioned there could not be said to be that great impact on the road that the Deputies would have us believe.  They may prove to be right and it may be proved that those figures are wrong.  I do not know but the only figures I have are figures which do not indicate a massive increase of traffic on the road.</P>

      <P>I want to point out that it is not a question of accepting or not accepting.  This matter was raised to-night in the usual way because of the unsatisfactory nature of the reply to the Question.  The reply is based on the known figures as we got them and on the case presented by the manager.  The point is that the most has not been made of your case, whether it be good, bad or indifferent. It is rather in the nature of a preparatory case: it is in the form of an inquiry rather than an established case. It will be for all of us to consider the case when we have all the facts and figures fully documented with the elementary information as to when and how the road was originally constructed and what is beneath it.  When we have that information we can sit down and decide what to do.</P>
