    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this last night, the Minister again adopted an attitude which, in my opinion, is of no help either to those in favour of the Bill or those opposing it.  It is strange that the Minister should on this section again take advantage of attacking people outside just because they hold different views from his and just because they may write <Col N="1180" /> letters to the daily newspapers with which the Minister does not agree.  He finds it more suitable to spend his time here attacking those individuals and groups.  I believe it is far more important for the Minister to try to put up his own case and stand by that, rather than adopt his usual tactics of attacking and abusing everyone who does not agree with him.</P>
      <P>I have little to say on this section. We have discussed it for a long time. In the end, we realise that the Minister, because he has the advantage of being able to steamroll this through the House, will get his way in spite of the fact that the case he put up contains many defects.  The Minister should be far more capable of dealing with the matter in a gentlemanly manner, particularly when it is of such importance to the people of the country.</P>
      <P>I personally agree with subsection (4) of the section.  We find it stated that &ldquo;nothing in subsection (4) of this section shall be construed as imposing an obligation on any person to submit himself or any person for whom he is responsible to examination,&rdquo; etc.  Still, we cannot get away from the fact that that provision, which is essential, must demonstrate to the Minister how weak his case is all the way through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried to direct my remarks to the position as it will affect the people in rural areas.  Should it happen, certainly without any support from me, that the people in these areas should decide they will not agree to their school&mdash;going children submitting to these tests, what does the Minister hope to secure out of a survey?  If the survey is to be carried out successfully, surely it should be based on reasons which in themselves will show whether or not there is justifiable reason for the Minister adopting the attitude he has adopted in connection with this aspect of the matter?  I believe that such a survey cannot succeed for the very simple reason&mdash; and the Minister himself must know this&mdash;that in a large number of rural areas, where these school children live, there is no such thing as a piped water supply.  All the way through on this section the Minister has not enlightened the House, nor has he <Col N="1181" /> made any attempt to enlighten the House, as to what should happen in the areas where there is no such thing as a piped water supply.</P>
    <P>I believe we are wasting the time of this House discussing a measure which cannot give to the people the results which the Minister may hope for himself.  In dealing with any particular section of the Bill it seems hopeless to consider it from the point of view of fair criticism when we have a Minister attacking everyone who may differ from him and who, in a childlike political fashion, seems to find it suitable to praise those who are in favour of the matter and abuse those who do not agree, and also when we have a Minister who found it convenient last night to attack those sections of the community in America who, according to him, stampeded on the publication of a statement as to whether or not a certain individual in America was using fluoridated water.</P>
    <P>What has it to do with us what they do in America?  One thing they did not do was make it compulsory. My argument all the way through is that the administration in any country have not found it necessary to make this compulsory.  Why then should the Minister abuse everyone who tries to adopt a fair line of criticism to show that the results anywhere else do not justify the Minister in his direct criticism of all concerned?  It is a waste of time discussing even this section with a man who already knows the result of the vote in this House.</P>

      <P>We have just listened to an excellent example of Satan reproving sin.  I am being attacked by Deputy Desmond as being abusive.  I think the House has seldom listened to a more unrestrained example of reckless misrepresentation and abuse than that to which we have just listened from the Deputy.  I protested again in this House, as I am entitled to protest, against the manner in which a statement I made in the House had been bowdlerised by the gentlemen associated with the Pure Water Association.  They wrote to <Col N="1182" /> the press and they said this: &ldquo;The Pure Water Association wishes to draw attention to the following statement made by the Minister for Health on Thursday, 27th October, in reply to the Second Reading debate.&rdquo;  Then they go on to quote what purports to be a statement of mine.  It is a partial statement and, not only that, it is a distorted statement, because they add words which I did not say and they delete words which I did say.  They presented the people with an incomplete and distorted statement of mine and am I not entitled to protest, Sir, when that sort of thing is done in the public press?</P>
      <P>Is it abusive for me to point out here that my statement was truncated and altered by the members of the Pure Water Association?  Was I abusive in so doing?  Surely I am entitled to protect myself against the misrepresentative methods used against me.  For doing that, I was attacked by Deputy Desmond.  The Deputy may wish to blacken me in the eyes of the people for his own particular political purposes but he has no right under that smokescreen of abuse to try to conceal the truth from the people. That is what the Deputy is doing.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is opposed to this measure.  He is entitled to be opposed to it, if he so wishes.  He spoke against the Bill on the Second Reading.  This is a deliberative assembly in which we all have different views about matters which come before us and I do not object to the Deputy making a speech against the Bill.  What I do object to is that misleading statements are quoted by those opposing the Bill. When these statements are characterised by me as being fallacious and misleading, I am charged with being abusive.  I hope the Deputy will not again afford me the opportunity of taking exception to the manner in which he has approached this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He stated yesterday that I attacked the people in America who had been opposed to fluoridation.  I did not attack them but I did quote what I think are authoritative words issued by the Government of the United States of America on this matter.  I <Col N="1183" /> quoted what was put forward as the reason why there had been a slowing down of fluoridation in America.  The House will remember that Deputy Ryan has occupied quite a considerable portion of its time on every Stage of this Bill and on every section of the Bill so far debated.  In making his case against it, he emphasised that certain insignificant communities in America, having adopted fluoridation, have abandoned it.</P>
    <P>Having referred to these few little insignificant communities, he spoke of 60 million people being opposed to it. In order to refute that statement, I quoted from an official publication of the United States of America in which the Secretary of State for Health, Education and Welfare, Mr. Arthur S. Flemming, said this&mdash;and I hope that if Deputy Desmond is receptive to argument and has not taken up the attitude which he has purely because of political bias, he will listen to what the Secretary of State has had to say:</P>
    <P>Intensive reasearch over a quarter of a century shows conclusively that water containing a proper amount of fluoride reduces dental decay by about 65 per cent. Equally conclusive research has demonstrated that controlled fluoridation is completely safe, causing no bodily harm of any kind.</P>
    <P>The point which those opposed to this measure must put to themselves is this: dental decay is rampant in this country; a survey in 1952 revealed that it could be said that 99 per cent. of our young people and adolescents have suffered in some way from dental caries.  Here we have a measure which has been tried under strict control in America for 15 years, but on which there has been investigation and research for 70 years.  About it, the Secretary of State for Health says that intensive research over a quarter of a century shows conclusively that water containing a proper amount of fluorine reduces dental decay by about 65 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to put this question to Deputy Desmond.  He represents many workers in his constituency.  Dental <Col N="1184" /> caries is not confined to any particular social or economic stratum of society. It is as common among the workers as among the better classes and it is rampant in both.  The question I am now putting to Deputy Desmond and to those associated with him is whether he is prepared to continue his opposition to the introduction of a process in this country which will safeguard the children of the workers of his constituency by a 65 per cent. reduction in this horrible disease.  That is the question he has now to put to himself.  I am putting that question to him and do not let him get up here and say that in doing so, I am being abusive. I am putting the question to him straight and I am not whinging or whining about it as he was.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of State for Health went on to say:</P>
    <P>Equally conclusive research has demonstrated that controlled fluoridation is completely safe, causing no bodily harm of any kind.</P>
    <P>The question arising here is whether that is going to be accepted for what it is worth as an authoritative statement issued by a recognised authority carrying with it responsibility for anything it may say, responsibility to the Congress and to the people of the United States.  Are we to have this sort of thing dished out to us here all the time that the Dáil will be occupied in debating this measure?  It is a question of authority against irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>In the same publication, reference is made to the progress which fluoridation has made.  It is admitted that, in the past two or three years, progress has been slowed down.  I shall quote now from the second section of the official American document on fluoridation:</P>
    <P>At first glance the acceptance of fluoridation during the last eight years appears satisfactory.  A closer look, however, reveals that most of the gain has been made in the larger cities.  Sixty-six per cent. of the nation's cities with populations of more than half a million and 32 per cent. of the cities with populations between 10,000 and 500,000 <Col N="1185" /> have fluoridation programmes.  By contrast only 17 per cent. of those communities having populations of 2,500 to 10,000 and 5 per cent. of communities with populations of less than 2,500 have such programmes. Consequently, most of the people benefiting from this measure live in the large cities.</P>
    <P>It is very relevant in connection with that quotation to remind the House of what I had to say about some of the towns which Deputy Ryan alleged yesterday had abandoned the process of fluoridation, having accepted it.  From the list of 76 towns solemnly trotted out as arguments to influence Dáil Éireann in considering this measure, we find that in Knoxville, Iowa, 356 people voted for fluoridation and 868 voted against it in a referendum.  In Genesco, Illinois, the figures were 988 against and 422 for; in Greensboro, North Carolina, the figures were 5,545 against and 4,326 for; in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, there were 1,550 against and 1,117 for.  The &ldquo;for&rdquo; and &ldquo;against&rdquo; in those communities do not count for very much because they are some of the backward communities, the fundamentalist communities in America.  They are communities in which they know nothing; they are the communities in which the Ku Klux Klan are a force in America; and they are the communities Deputy Ryan asks us to weigh against the 66 per cent. of the cities of the nation with populations of more than half a million, and 31 per cent. of the cities with populations of between 10,000 and 500,000.  We are asked to put them against the communities that have resources and knowledge and have had this matter fully investigated. We are asked to allow their record to be buried under this mass of infinitesimal communities which the Deputy has trotted out.</P>
    <P>I want to get back to Deputy Desmond. Deputy Desmond accuses me of having attacked the Pure Water Association yesterday.  I have shown that my remarks yesterday in relation to that association were directed to the fact that they had wilfully and deliberately truncated my speech and <Col N="1186" /> interfered with my statements in this House in order to mislead.  That is what I said.  The Pure Water Association has this to say about the report issued by the World Health Organisation:</P>
    <P>...the Minister made it clear that he was relying for the accuracy of this statement on a single sentence culled from an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; report issued by the W.H.O. in 1958.</P>
    <P>First of all, that is not true, because, in opening the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill, I cited and quoted extensively from the reports of commissions of inquiry set up by sovereign States to investigate this problem, so that I was not relying merely upon the report of the Expert Committee appointed by the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond, who is anxious to protect people from abuse and misrepresentation, might direct his mind to the next quotation.  I am quoting now from a letter which was deliberately written by the Pure Water Association:</P>
    <P>The sentence in question is extremely misleading&mdash;indeed it might almost be characterised as dishonest &mdash;and it is completely undocumented.</P>
    <P>What is that?  Is it an attack upon the World Health Organisation?  That expert committee is charged with misleading the people, the world, those who are concerned&mdash;yes, the Deputy may smile, but it does happen to be the people of the world&mdash;with the health of the world communities.  It is engaged in fighting disease in Africa, Asia and Europe.  It is not a matter to be taken lightly that the Pure Water Association should make a charge against that Organisation to which we contribute very heavily and which has, I am glad to say, readily availed of the highly expert advice, help and assistance which we have been able to give them.  My Chief Medical Adviser has just returned from a most important assignment in Indonesia where he endeavoured to establish a health service more or less on the lines of the service we have.  His efforts have been the subject of very complimentary letters to me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> The fact that the World Health Organisation has been attacked in this way is not a matter which can be taken lightly by any responsible public man. Therefore, when the World Health Organisation is charged by those who are opposing this Bill with misleading the public and with making statements which are tantamount to being dishonest and completely undocumented, we are entitled to challenge the <i>bona fides</i> and the credibility of the people who make those charges.  I have already challenged their representative in this House.  I have already shown the extent to which Deputy Ryan will endeavour to mislead this House.  I know, of course, that he is merely the mouthpiece of those people and that what he says is supplied to him by them.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and it was said by Deputy Desmond, that there is no proof that this process will be of any value.  I hope I am not misrepresenting the Deputy; I do not want to.  The Deputy apparently takes the view that fluoridation will not do what its advocates claim for it.  He apparently takes the view that it will not restrict and limit the incidence of dental caries in the community to the extent that I said, namely, that two children out of three have a reasonable chance of growing up at least to their early years at school without being affected by the process in their permanent teeth.  If he takes that view, I take it that it is because he has been impressed by the statements made here and by people outside this House that there has been no sufficient control over the experiments which have been carried out and that the reduction in the incidence of dental caries cannot be explained by the presence of fluorine in the water or by the ingestion of fluorine by individual children.</P>
    <P>Just this morning, I received a quotation from the Swedish International Press Bureau dated 12th November and headed <i>Science and Techniques.</i>  It says that fluorine in drinking water may give 60 per cent. less caries.  It is from Stockholm, and it reads:</P>
    <P>The experiments to find out the <Col N="1188" /> effect of fluorine added to the drinking water as a means against caries, which have been going on in the city of Norrköping since 1952, are now nearly concluded and have given very promising results, according to an article in the Stockholm daily <i>Svenska Dagbladet.</i>  The investigations are claimed to be the most extensive of this kind carried out in the world, and the findings will be presented to the congress of the European organisation for fluorine and caries research in London in July, 1961.</P>
    <P>While the field work has been carried on by dental and medical authorities in Norrköping, the scientific work on the material has been conducted at the Royal School of Dentistry in Malmö by Professors Sven Sellman and Arvid Syrrist. One point of interest has been whether the need for dental care of children can be reduced.  At present about 60 per cent. of all Swedish children in the ages of 7-14 receive dental care from the Public Dental Service.  About 80 per cent. of all 7-year-olds suffer from caries according to the journals of the Dental Service.</P>
    <P>In the Norrköping experiments 500 children have been given fluorine in their drinking water without their knowledge, both at school and at home.  They have been compared as to caries frequency with another group of 500 who have received no fluorine at all.  Other smaller groups have been given fluorine in the drinking water either at home or at school.</P>
    <P>In the centre of interest has been a group of children who were born in 1952 and since then until they started school in 1959 were given drinking water with fluorine added. The amount of fluorine added has been 1 mg. to 1 litre of water. Already in 1955&mdash;three years after the start of experiments&mdash;a 20-30 per cent. decrease of the caries frequency was noted among &ldquo;fluorine drinking&rdquo; children.  It is, however, estimated that the figure will increase to some 60 per cent. after a prolonged treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> I hope the Deputy who is concerned to oppose this measure because he does not believe that fluoridation will safeguard the teeth of our children will study that highly-controlled scientific experiment.  He will see that people who drink water to which fluorine has been added are much less liable to dental caries than those who drink water to which it has not been added.</P>
    <P>I think that when he has studied that experiment he will modify, if he cannot change his mind in the light of the facts presented to him, his opposition to this Bill, and that he will not oppose it merely because it is introduced by the person who now happens to be Minister for Health. The Deputy, in this House and on other occasions, has said that however good a measure might be, so long as I was associated with it he was prepared to oppose it.</P>

      <P>Oh, no&mdash;not just so succinctly.  The Deputy has harked back to 1/-, if he remembers it, on a number of occasions and has given that as his ground for opposing any measure with which I am associated. We heard a great deal from Deputy Ryan yesterday and we have heard on several occasions about the Holy Father's allocution.  There, again, we have a fair example of selective quotations.  The Deputy, in the role of the Devil, sanctimoniously quoted Holy Writ.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Ryan wants to sprout horns and a tail he is quite at liberty to do so.  I did not <Col N="1190" /> say he is the Devil or Satan.  I said he had adopted a role and was playing a part.  I shall repeat what I said. I said that Deputy Ryan, in the role of Satan, sanctimoniously quoted from an allocution of the late Holy Father, Pius XII, delivered to the First International Congress on Histopathology of the Nervous System on 14th September, 1952.  I take it that that is the source.</P>
      <P>Let us see the position.  What was the Holy Father talking about on that occasion?  He was not talking about fluoridation.  He was not talking about a process that had been in operation. He was not talking about the artificial fluoridation of water.  He was not talking about naturally fluoridated waters, either; that goes without saying. He was not talking about a phenomenon that had been studied for over 70 years, the scientifically ascertained fact that the presence of the minute quantity of fluorine in water greatly reduces the incidence of dental decay in children's teeth.  He was not talking about the artificial fluoridation of water, a process which has been in operation in major States and major cities of America, some of them for 15 years.  Not at all.</P>
      <P>He was talking about something quite different.  He was talking to this First International Congress of the Histopathology of the Nervous System and he opened his address with these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This First International Congress of histopathology of the nervous system succeeded in mastering a subject truly vast.  It was deemed necessary by the exposition and demonstration of thorough investigation to place in an exact perspective the causes and first beginnings of the diseases of the nervous system proper and of the diseases described as psychic.  Furthermore, a report has been presented and an exchange of views organised on the subject of the known facts and of the recent discoveries in the lesions of the brain and other organs lesions which are the causes of nervous diseases as they are of mental diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further on, having expatiated on <Col N="1191" /> that and expressed the full implications of what was being done, he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For the moral justification of new processes, new experiments and methods of research three principles are invoked: (1) the interests of medical science; (2) the individual interests of the patients under treatment; (3) the common interest of the community, &ldquo;the bonum commune&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We now state the question: these three interests&mdash;considered each one apart or at least all three together&mdash;have they an absolute value as the motive and justification of the medical treatment, or do they find their value only within determined frontiers?  To this we shall try to give a short reply.</P>
    <P>What is the reply?  The reply concerns itself entirely with new techniques in the treatment of mental and nervous diseases.  It was addressed to questions like leucotomy or those other surgical operations which, by altering the constitution, the structure of the body and, in particular, the brain, can change the personality of an individual.  That Allocution had nothing whatsoever to do with the questions we are discussing here.  Yet, it has been trotted out by Deputy Ryan trying to play upon the natural piety of the Irish people and upon their readiness to accept and obey the words of the Holy Father.</P>
    <P>This is not the first occasion upon which this question was raised.  It was raised before the Consultative Council and they had this matter considered in the proper quarter, where the full significance of the teaching of the Church in relation to matters of this sort was properly appreciated, and where the wisdom and the teachings of the Church were not going to be misapplied for the sake of scoring some sort of political triumph.  Here is what the Council had to report on that matter.  I shall read paragraph 37 again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Council received representations to the effect that flouridation of public water supplies was unethical. The main grounds for objection were <Col N="1192" /> that it was mass medication, a usurpation of parental rights by the public authorities and an interference by the public authority with the integrity of the human body.</P>
    <P>These are the three grounds of objection. These are the three grounds upon which people have endeavoured to raise this bogey of unethical procedure here.  They were fairly studied by those who were consulted and as a result of the consultation this is what the Council says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>These objections were carefully considered and advice was sought and received.  The Council is satisfied that there is no ethical objection to the flouridation of public water supplies within the margin of safety recommended in this report.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have kept the House but it was necessary in order to ease the public mind that the arguments which have been used in this House against this proposal should be shown for what they are, hollow and empty, and where they appear to be most impressive, that they are impressive only because they suppress the truth like Deputy Ryan's statement about the President of the United States, like his statement about the 60,000,000 people in America who would not have flouridation, like his statements with his misleading quotations from the Holy Father.  These are the things which influence honest, simple Deputies like Deputy Desmond to the extent that they give rein to their personal prejudices against the Minister for Health and try to make him stand against medical progress in this country.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like him to take to heart the words which Secretary Flemming adopted as his own&mdash;because they appear and are quoted by him in his statement&mdash;the words of the Secretary of the American Medical Association who described the opposition to flouridation in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In addition to the sincere opposition which merits respect, there is the usual hue and cry from those who take every opportunity to discredit medical science and legitimate public <Col N="1193" /> health progress.  They bring all manner of irresponsible charges&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>including the allegation which we have heard in this House on the Second Stage of the Bill from Deputy Ryan&mdash;</P>
    <P>including the allegation that fluoridation is promoted for commercial profits by those who manufacture the chemicals and machinery and that irresponsible scientists and public officials have been &lsquo;bought&rsquo;.  The ridiculousness of such a charge evaporates into thin air when one merely looks at the official and professional bodies that have endorsed fluoridation.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Desmond will read that statement and will ponder it and then see if he can in conscience continue to support Deputy Ryan in his vexatious opposition to this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The modest purpose of the Opposition in regard to this section is that a decision to fluoridate a water supply should be left to the local authority, rather than that the Minister should be invested with the power to direct an authority to fluoridate its local water supply, and many I suggest that the very passion that has been generated on both sides of the House is one of the very strongest possible arguments for leaving it to be determined by the local authority? If we charge the Minister for Health for the time being with the duty of making a coercive order which may tear a parish into two feuding groups, using as violent language as has been used on both sides of the issue in this House, can anyone imagine that we are conferring any benefit on the community which we thus tear into two feuding, raging factions?  I cannot think it is so.  I can well imagine if I were a member of Carrickmacross urban district council or Clones district council and was in favour of fluoridating the water supply but found that 45 per cent. of my neighbours in that area were passionately opposed, and that my best arguments could not persuade them that it was a desirable course to pursue, I would advise the majority of 50 per cent. of the community, for peace sake, not <Col N="1194" /> to thrust this new procedure down the throats of the 45 per cent. of our neighbours who were passionately opposed to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister today, in what I think was an extravagant moment, chose to describe Rhinelander, Wisconsin, as a Ku Klux Klan town.  That sort of language is fantastic.  These relatively small communities in the United States of America to which he has referred are just like the small communities in our own country, like Carrickmacross, Ballinasloe, Clonmel, or any of our smaller cities and towns and, though they are small, that fact in itself seems to me to argue most powerfully for this House refraining from extreme intervention in their domestic affairs, possibly with the best intention of conferring some benefit upon them but with the inevitable end result of bringing dissension, ill-will and ructions into a peaceful community, out of all proportion to the public benefit conferred by the process envisaged in the Bill.  I think we are in a rational Parliament, and to hear the Minister for Health describe a bad tooth as a dreadful disease reveals a lack of detachment and objectivity on his part which causes me some concern.</P>
      <P>I have heard it argued by excellent authorities that the ultimate destiny of a child's or, indeed, an adult's teeth, is determined long before he is born.  The character of a human creature's teeth is largely determined <i>en ventre sa mere</i>&mdash;it is very largely the diet of his mother and the care with which here pre-natal clinics have been carried out that ultimately and irrevocably condition her offspring's teeth, but I do not believe that we in this House are qualified to conduct an inquiry into the whole question of the genesis and incidence of dental caries, and I think there is a great danger in passionate arguments about these matters, producing what appear to be authoritative opinions carefully selected to support the case one is concerned to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember not many years ago&mdash; certainly within the past ten years&mdash; there was a powerful and raucous school of thought prepared to convince <Col N="1195" /> us all that cortisone was a panacea for almost all human ills.  Every arthritic and rheumatic person was to leap out of his bed and chase around Phoenix Park if he got cortisone. Almost any obscure medical condition that defied diagnosis was subjected to a course of cortisone treatment.  Indeed, I remember a very dear friend of mine who got it and died, and it was only discovered after it was in use for some time that the limitations and advantages of cortisone were very great and that, while it did confer some striking benefits, it had considerable handicaps which have since very seriously circumscribed its use in medical treatment, but the Minister for Health argues strongly that in regard to fluoridation experiments, they have continued for 70 years. That is news to me.  As far as I know, this business of artificially increasing the fluorine content of water was only initiated relatively shortly before the last World War, though I may be wrong.</P>

      <P>I think there were experiments made on the fluoridation of water in America and Canada before the first World War, and I have been watching this matter with interest. What I want to emphasise is this: I am not prepared to argue for or against fluoridation.  I think there is a powerful case to be made in favour of it but I am constrained to listen with patience and respect to the passionately held views against it.  All I am arguing for is that we should not take it upon ourselves in Dáil Éireann to direct a rural community that has its own local authority to fluoridate water without any regard to the feelings of the people for whom it is charged with the responsibility of providing a public water supply.  Now, if the Minister had accepted that principle <Col N="1196" /> on the First Stage of the Bill, there would have been no serious opposition to his proposal.</P>
      <P>The Minister waxes very eloquent about Deputy Ryan consulting persons outside this House, listening to representations from persons outside this House in regard to this Bill, and bringing such views to the attention of the House.  I should like to ask the Minister what useful purpose does a Deputy serve if he does not bring the views of his constituents to the attention of the House and, if he finds himself in sympathy with the views of the constituents who approach him, has he not a public duty to bring them forcefully to the attention of Deputies?</P>
      <P>I recently addressed a letter to every vocational body in this country whose name and description I could find, asking them to furnish me, as Leader of the Fine Gael Party, with their observations on any impending legislation so that legislation in this House might be more intelligently discussed. The Government, having as much information as they want, and having the organisation to get it, bring their measures before this House.  The Opposition Parties do their best to examine and constructively to discuss them but it appears to me the Opposition Parties would be greatly sustained in the discharge of that duty if persons who believe that pending legislation will affect their interests would inform them of their views so that they could be brought before Dáil Éireann, argued out here and expounded by those who had sympathy with the views of the interested parties who had submissions to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister does the House no service if he suggests that a Deputy in any way betrays his trust by bringing the views of his constituents to the attention of this House, and by doing it with emphasis if he finds himself in substantial sympathy with those views. One fact emerges from this whole Bill, and that is that, on the subject of fluoridation, there can be as passionate views held, for and against, as we have heard from the Minister and Deputy Ryan.  I ask reasonable Deputies here in the face of that fact without going any further into the determination of the merits of the arguments put forward, <Col N="1197" /> pro and con, does not that fact of this profound and passionately felt difference argue powerfully for the proposal that we should leave this matter to the local authorities concerned?</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputies that if the Minister for Health becomes convinced tomorrow that on the evidence of the surveys conducted in Ballinasloe, Clonmel and Carrickmacross, he has authority to make an Order for fluoridation and the local authorities say to him: &ldquo;Listen; a majority of the people here agree with you that fluoridation would reduce the incidence of dental caries in the children, but they also know that it will create dissension and ill-will out of all proportion to the benefits you hope to confer; we, therefore, having weighed up all aspects of this question, would prefer to provide additional dental care for the children of the parish and at least for the present to eschew fluoridation,&rdquo; does this House consider it desirable that the Minister would have not only the right but the duty to say: &ldquo;Without any regard to what your views may be, this is good for you and you must do it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a mistaken view.  I have a good deal of sympathy with the Minister's view on the merits of fluoridation, but I think he has become so obsessed with it that he is allowing himself to be carried away.  It is indicative of the state of mind he gets into when he rises up and passionately says of Deputy Ryan that he is casting himself in the role of Satan quoting Holy Writ.  I differ from Deputy Ryan in thinking that is disorderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it really is.  I often called a man worse things than that, but I find it very unbecoming in the Tánaiste and Minister for Health.  If everybody who gets up here and speaks his mind is to be described by the Minister as the devil quoting Holy Writ, it is very offensive and it certainly does not help in the dispassionate consideration of legislation. I do not think it was meant to help in that direction.  It was meant to indicate to any other person who intended to intervene against the Minister that the Minister was quite capable of getting rough and that, if <Col N="1198" /> he got rough, by the time he had finished with him he would have wrecked his reputation.  Well, now, pipe down, because that cuts no ice on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>If we wanted to tear the Minister to pieces we could scatter them to the four corners of Heaven and not leave a rag on the Minister's back when we were finished with him.  I do not think that is necessary in the discussion of fluoridation of water.  But the possibility that a man of the Minister's long experience in public life could find himself boiling up into the passionate indignation he displayed at half-past ten this morning suggests to me most strongly that it is folly on the part of this House not only to give the Minister the right but to impose upon him, or any successor of his, the duty of going to a small rural community or any other organised community where there is deep division, marked by the same passion as the Minister himself showed this morning, and directing them to adopt this procedure because he thinks it is good for them, without any regard to the depth of feeling that may influence a minority in that community who are opposed to this procedure.</P>
      <P>I urge on the Minister to bear this in mind.  Those of any community who want fluoridation have always the comforting knowledge that, if a local authority will not provide it, they can go down to the chemist, buy fluoride tablets and arrange for their children to have them.  Their depth of feeling, no matter how reasonable, cannot correspond to any degree with the depth of feeling of somebody who to us may appear utterly unreasonable but who passionately feels that his children ought not to be forced to consume artificially added fluorine in the water.  The person who feels that finds himself in the position that he cannot avoid the consequences of the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to stop and think for a moment.  People are, perhaps, inclined to be a bit irrational in a matter of that kind.  I agree with the Minister that sometimes, after having used all possible forbearance, the public interest demands that you say to them: &ldquo;In the last analysis we shall have to <Col N="1199" /> override your feelings.  We have done everything we can to explain to you that no evil can eventuate from this and we have failed to convince you, but the public interest demands that we override you in this matter.&rdquo;  But we ought to have regard to their feelings. Unless there is some supreme interest involved, we ought to be very slow to disregard them altogether.</P>
    <P>As I said on the Second Stage, no ethical question is here involved.  If there was a question of pure ethics involved, then we would have to argue not only against this House having the right to impose fluoridation but any town council or body representative of a community, however small and closely knit together, having that right. But I do not think there is an ethical question involved.  I think it is a social question.  In that regard I was a bit shocked by the Minister's contemptuous reference to the communities referred to by Deputy Ryan.  I agree they are small communities, but they are the kind of communities we have in Ireland.  We have only about four or five big cities here.</P>
    <P>Ninety-five per cent. of the public water supplies in Ireland are in communities such as the Minister described contemptuously as &ldquo;backward, Ku Klux Klan towns in America&rdquo;.  I think the Minister is as familiar as I am with Iowa and Wisconsin.  I think that, on reflection, he will agree with me that to describe the rural communities there as &ldquo;Ku Klux Klan towns of America&rdquo; is offensive and contemptuous.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Ku Klux Klan was ever heard of in the State of Iowa or in the State of Wisconsin.</P>
    <P>La Follette must turn in his grave to hear his constituents described as Ku Klux Klan&mdash;and by the Tánaiste who ought to know better&mdash;but, apart from the offensive animadversions on these communities to which Deputy Ryan referred, am I not right in saying that more than 90 per cent. of the public water supplies in this country are in an exactly similar condition? Am I right or wrong in saying that in a community of that kind good feeling and neighbourly forbearance and goodwill will in many <Col N="1200" /> cases be more important than the benefits which it is claimed fluoridation of water supplies will provide?</P>
    <P>It is for these communities themselves to determine that issue.  I think the Minister would be right if he brought in a Bill to make it possible for these communities to do that for themselves, if they thought it necessary. I think he would have been right to bring in a Bill to remove any doubt that might have existed as to whether that power was already there or not.  I think he is going that much too far in seeking to centre the power in his own office and I believe if he did forbear from that extremity&mdash;and it is very important that the House should remember that our own Commission never advocated it; the body we set up, and which the Minister has quoted, to examine the whole question of fluoridation of water never went beyond the proposal that they thought the Minister should make it possible for any local authority who wished to introduce this into their own community to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  I dealt with that when the Deputy was not here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studied it and, in my judgment, that is as far as they were prepared to go.  Certainly, that is as far as the report goes.  I think they were right: I think the Minister determined that he would cut the Gordian knot and go the step further. That decision has evoked extremes of opposition to the whole concept which has produced from him corresponding violence of language in defence of this procedure which would operate to alienate my sympathetic mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the truth lies between the two extreme positions that have been taken up in this House and I suggest to the Minister that a great deal of the misunderstanding and the violence of feeling could still be averted if, even at this stage, he determined as a first step to convert this into a permissive Bill.  There is nothing to prevent us from returning to this matter in five or ten years if the permissive procedure yields no fruit and reconsidering the whole position, but it would be a step forward in the <Col N="1201" /> direction of the recommendations of the Commission, if a permissive Bill were enacted now.  To go beyond that now, I think, in view of the strength of feeling that undoubtedly exists, albeit in the minds of a minority, is unwise.</P>
    <P>I think the position is that you have an informed minority on one side strongly in favour of the recommendations of the Commission and an informed minority on the extreme other side passionately opposed, and a large amorphous body of citizens in the middle who really do not know anything about it and who probably do not much care.  In that situation, it would be wiser to have a permissive Bill at this stage and to see how far forward we could get and the Minister might have made more progress and might have carried conviction to more people than he anticipates now. If fluoridation proved to be a success in a wide area of the country, the growing volume of support for it would have inevitable consequences. If, on the other hand, we had the experience recorded by Deputy Ryan of certain areas where the communities tried it and have withdrawn from it, that would indicate certain lessons also.  I do not want to argue against it but there is no use closing our eyes to the fact that even accepting the Minister's case of the dramatic improvement in the incidence of dental caries which he claims&mdash;and which I am not prepared to deny&mdash;follows from fluoridation of water, there is the propagation of mottled teeth.</P>
    <P>I am only trying to put the case.  We must bear in mind that there is a cosmetic element in this matter.  A girl's front teeth are a matter of grave cosmetic consequence and could be a matter of grave psychological importance to a growing child.  Mottling of teeth can give rise to serious problems &mdash;I shall go no further.  That is one qualification of the benefit which the Minister so emphatically describes in the matter of dental caries.  I do not think all the truth of the story lies with the Minister or with the extreme opposition as expressed by Deputy Ryan; I believe a middle position more closely approximates the full truth.  I <Col N="1202" /> would welcome an experimental period based on permissive legislation and then a review of the matter to see if further powers are required.  I believe that if that course had been adopted at an earlier stage of this Bill, much of the immoderate language that has been employed on both sides would have been avoided and the real issues involved here could have been more dispassionately reviewed.  It is not too late for the Minister to mend his hand: if he does so, I undertake in advance not to say: &ldquo;When the devil is sick, the devil a saint would be.&rdquo;  If I did say that, of course, I should be thinking of the general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the last of the orators, my remarks may seem rather flat but perhaps a few flat remarks on this matter will help to bring the issue to a conclusion.  Is fluoridation of water compulsory medication? Is that the only way we can look at it?  A very minute quantity of a salt will be added to the water.  I should like to put this counter argument: may it not very well be, on all the evidence, that most of our water supplies are deficient from the point of view of the human element and that putting in fluorine is actually supplying a deficiency?  If you had to argue on the fundamentals of compulsory medication, it could be countered by the simple argument that you are merely supplying something to meet a deficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had, for instance, in the field of agriculture, cases where certain animals in certain quarters and on certain pastures were found to be suffering from certain defects.  It was found that the supply of some element &mdash;sometimes traces&mdash;remedied the deficiency.  Surely in these cases what you had was a deficiency in the environment? May it not well be that all this prevalence of dental caries in the human can be ascribed to a deficiency in the local water supply?  I only mention this particular approach; I do not want to pursue the matter.  I simply want to point out that it is very easy to pontificate and advocate forceful medication.  I wonder have the people who have done so considered <Col N="1203" /> that what is being done here is to supply a natural deficiency?</P>
    <P>Indignation has been expressed in regard to this extremely small quantity of a salt which occurs in natural water. Water in which this salt occurs has been found to be beneficial when consumed. This is merely the adding of the salt.  Probably in most samples of water, you will get extremely minute traces of fluoride anyway, because, as anybody who has taken the trouble of even reading a little elementary literature on the matter will know, there is no such thing as chemically pure water.  All water supplies have dissolved in them various salts in various concentrations and have present in them also other substances&mdash;possibly salts&mdash;some of which are helpful and others harmful.</P>
    <P>I think we would all agree that the function of a local authority is, first of all, to see that the level of harmful substances is kept down.  The addition of this relatively small quantity of salt which occurs in natural water used freely by humans elsewhere does not seem to me to raise any great moral or practical problems.  The problem is simply whether it is beneficial or harmful.  On the question of its being beneficial, the Minister has amply put a case, and that, so far as dental caries is concerned, has not been controverted.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Dillon. Dental caries, although it is not an immediate and killing disease, is a serious disease in the community.  It is a serious disability and has had serious repercussions on the health of individuals.  If that disease can be eradicated, there is a very substantial contribution made to the improvement, not only of the health of the individual but of the health of the community. Therefore, the beneficial effect that can accrue from the addition of this small quantity of fluorine in whatever form it is added&mdash;it will be in the water in the form of a fluoride&mdash;will achieve this object and can be commended on these grounds.  I do not think anybody can controvert that fact.</P>
    <P>The next question to be asked is: what are the disadvantages?  Having countered the argument by asking if <Col N="1204" /> it might not be the supplying of a deficiency, which everybody would argue would be a very legitimate thing to do, we have to ask if any harm accrues from the doing of this, apart from the mottling of the teeth.  That is a matter which I am sure the Minister will consider and I freely concede it is a point to be considered.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, there has been no evidence advanced anywhere that any deleterious effects can follow from the addition of fluorine to water.  It is not like the cortisone to which Deputy Dillon referred.  This is a matter of practical experience for a sufficiently long time to enable us to judge the effects and so far as I know, no allegation can be substantiated.  In fact, no serious allegation is made that any positive, harmful effects will result from the addition of fluorine to water.</P>
    <P>Let me ask this question.  Does the House think that Deputy Ryan, after his diligent digging up of cases in America, would have failed to produce here the charge and the allegation, if not the substantiation of it, that it was a serious threat to health?  Does the House think that he would have forborne to bring that here if he had the material available to make that charge?  I think that it is a very significant fact.  The fact that he was driven back to the type of argument he made is sufficient justification for me, if we had no other justification, for asserting that it is, as far as can be humanly ascertained, a perfectly safe matter to add this substance to the water supplies and that, being perfectly safe, we also know that it is positively beneficial. Surely, that must dispose of a large part of the arguments made against this proposal?</P>
    <P>Before I deal with what is really the substance of this section, I should like to make one other remark.  The amount of discussion that has taken place about this measure would seem to suggest to people who have no further information that we were, for the first time, embarking upon some horrible programme of doctoring water supplies.  The public should be informed at this stage and should know that all water supplies for modern communities handled by local authorities have to be doctored to <Col N="1205" /> make sure they are safe and proper for the community.</P>
    <P>They are doctored in several ways. The filtration process is in itself a doctoring, if one looks at it carefully. Adding chlorine to disinfect the water, because that is what it is, is doctoring. Water supplies have even been doctored in the interests of the pipes and nobody has said a word about it. There have been instances where really soft, natural water supplies were so soft that engineering problems in regard to the pipes ensued and hardening substances had to be added &mdash;substances for the addition of which much less case could be made from the human point of view than is made for the addition of fluorine.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to say all these things to dispel the fog of apprehension caused by these indiscriminate allegations&mdash;that silly little trick of referring to a substance as a poison which has been used here.  Deputy Ryan kept referring to this as a poison.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a poison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and so is chlorine a poison and we put it in the water.  So is the common salt which we use at the table a poison, if you take enough of it.  The fact is that using terms in this manner is a disservice to the community and creates unnecessary apprehensions.  It is to be deprecated in a responsible body such as this.  I was taken to task by a Deputy for saying that I relied on the technical experts and on the same evidence as the Minister advanced here.  I do not for a moment dispute that we should use our common sense in relying on expert evidence.  Let us rely on common sense.  I would say to those relying on common sense and digging into the expert field to go diligently into the subject and not talk through their hats about something of which they know nothing.  That is what has happened in the case of a number of the allegations in this debate.  If Deputies&mdash;and the people to whom I refer have enough education&mdash;would study the technical problem and be more responsible, they would do a greater service to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> I do deprecate this arousing of public apprehension when it is unnecessary. I would equally deprecate making the opposite case beyond what is warranted.  Therefore I shall not pursue the technical implications of this.  Let me repeat that, throughout this long debate, it has been admitted that the addition of fluorine to water is beneficial and it has not been seriously alleged that, beyond the mottling of teeth, which is a serious point to be considered, there is any allegation, let alone argument, that any harmful effect can follow.</P>
    <P>On the ethical argument, one point will cancel out another leaving us at the end where we were at the start.  On the substance of this section, could there be any greater justification of the course the Minister is adopting than the performance which has taken place in this House on this measure? Let me express a personal point of view; my own instincts would be to leave this matter an optional one as far as possible.  Let us face the practical implications of that.  What is the essential difference between our deciding it for the whole community and leaving it to the local authorities to decide for parts of the community? Will it not equally be compulsory medication if the local authority decides to do it?  I fail to follow the logic of that argument at all.</P>
    <P>It is merely avoiding the issue.  You do not solve your first problem by passing the buck to the local authority to argue the issue.  Let us face our problems here.  The very things that have happened in this House are the justification of what the Minister has done.  Take the long list to which Deputy Ryan referred.  In no case has he been able to give us the reasons why these groups which he mentioned departed from fluoridation.  There is no suggestion that any of these groups abandoned fluoridation of water because of any damage done to health; rather would it appear that it was perhaps because of some engineering consideration, because one of the reasons Deputy Ryan gave us was that of damage to water cocks.</P>
    <P>It may have been a financial reason, <Col N="1207" /> it may have been an engineering reason.  More than likely it was a local political reason&mdash;one group against another.  Do you not know very well what would happen here if the matter were left optional?  What would happen is that perhaps a Fianna Fáil councillor would propose fluoridation and the Fine Gael councillor would get up and oppose it or <i>vice versa.</i>  Once the responsibility of decision was placed on the local authorities you would have the same situation as we have here.  One Party might favour it and another Party would oppose it.  The whole lot, the pure water people and the impure water people, would descend on the council, as they have done here, and the net result would probably be to leave it to the county engineer.</P>
    <P>Let us be realistic in this.  It is good that the matter should be thrashed out here.  I am not objecting to anyone making his case.  I am not objecting to Deputy Ryan making his case.  He could have made it more moderately and I think he damaged his case by going as far as he did.  I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the matter should be argued out and examined in every way but I want to finish now.  I said in the beginning that I would be brief and I am afraid that I have not honoured my word in that regard.</P>
    <P>On the section, having disposed of the other matter, you are faced either with dropping the measure altogether, or perhaps making it an enabling measure or of doing what the Minister did.  I think it would be impractical to do otherwise than he has done and that we have no choice except to drop the Bill as a whole or to go ahead.</P>

      <P>He started off by countering the ethical argument which was made.  That argument is that people should not be treated like animals and subjected to mass medication against their wills, to direction by bureaucratic authority as to what medicine they will take and what medicine they will not take.  Deputy de Valera says that the human animal may suffer from deficiencies, just as any other animal, and that tests have been carried out which disclosed deficiencies in certain pastures and that by making up that deficiency the bullock or the horse is improved, thrives and fattens.  He argues that if that can be done for the four footed animal it can be done for the human animal. That is the very justification for the ethical argument against this measure, which is that human beings should not be treated like animals.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera's second point is that there is no concrete evidence to show that there are any harmful effects at all from fluoridation.  Does Deputy de Valera realise that one of the points argued in connection with this measure is the fact that there have been no statistics, no evaluation of the results to find out if there can be harmful effects, apart from the effect on teeth? It is conceded that fluoridation can have a harmful effect in so far as the mottling of teeth is concerned.  It is also conceded that it may make them brittle.  That is one of the points advanced but apart from that is the question of general health and whether it has a harmful effect on people suffering from the kind of diseases mentioned here during the Second Reading Debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am aware no tests have been made, no survey has been made, no statistics have been compiled and <Col N="1209" /> that is one of the reasons why we argue so strongly against this measure. In a later amendment it is suggested that that kind of survey should be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera said that but he said it without having fully informed himself of the facts.  A great number of people have expressed fears that it is harmful. There is no doubt at all about that.  I shall not waste the time of the House with quotations.  I could do so, because I have many quotations here in front of me.  That case has been made, and those fears have been expressed.  I should be satisfied to accept that they are not justified if the Minister, or anyone else, assures me that proper tests have been made which prove that the fears are not justified.  My complaint is that, so far as I know&mdash;and I have asked the Minister to give me the information if he has it&mdash;no tests and no specific survey have been made on the question of whether it could be harmful or have an adverse effect, apart from the question of teeth.</P>
      <P>I have dealt now with two of Deputy de Valera's points.  His third and main point is about as relevant to this discussion as a wasps' nest.  Deputy de Valera assures us in all solemnity that there is nothing to be afraid of because chlorine has already been added to water.</P>

      <P>There is a very big difference between adding a substance to water for the purpose, on the one hand, of purifying it, for the purpose of making it as Deputy de Valera himself said, safe and proper for communities to drink, and, on the other hand, adding a substance to water which is not designed for the purpose of purifying the water and rendering it safe for communities to drink but for the specific purpose of medicating the water supply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am satisfied the Minister understands the purpose for which fluroine is to be added to water, but whether he has made that clear to Deputy de Valera, I am not so sure.  It is not for the same purpose as chlorine is added to water.  As Deputy de Valera said, chlorine is added for the purpose of making water safe and proper for communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Deputy de Valera had the courage, in the face of the Minister's <Col N="1212" /> remarks on this Bill, to say that his own personal preference would be an optional Bill.  It is a pity Deputy de Valera did not interest himself in this matter at an earlier stage, because I feel that if he and some of his colleagues who think like him had discussions with the Minister in the calm of the Fianna Fáil Party room, we might have had a better Bill and one which would not give rise to the controversy to which this Bill has given rise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with Deputy de Valera when he says that, with the example of what has happened here, it would be disastrous if the Minister were to allow this measure to go through the House without making it mandatory.  If an assembly of the selected representatives of the people take so long to decide on this measure, we can well imagine what would happen in the various councils when this matter came under discussion. As Deputy de Valera says, one person would oppose another simply because someone else had proposed it.  People would also oppose it without the slightest knowledge of what is involved.</P>
      <P>I was rather puzzled by Deputy O'Higgins trying to split hairs so far as chlorine is concerned.  He almost suggested its purpose was not to prevent disease, which of course it is.  We introduce chlorine into water to ensure that people can drink it without danger to their health.  I cannot see any difference between that and introducing this very small quantity of fluorine for the same purpose.  I might mention at this point that I made a calculation to find out what that quantity is, because people are sometimes impressed by figures.  As I recollect, it means one grain of fluorine to 12½ gallons of water.  That is actually the quantity I make out is in it.  I am using the 480-grain measure for the ounce and it would be roughly one grain in 12½ gallons of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on another stage of the Bill, I think there is fluorine in water in many places and I rather think that in these cases the amount of dental decay is very much less than elsewhere. I am altogether in favour of compulsion, <Col N="1213" /> so far as this measure is concerned. I have not heard any ordinary member of the general public&mdash;not one solitary person&mdash;protest against this measure, notwithstanding all the talk about it here.  I meet as many of the ordinary people as most Deputies, living in the heart of the country and in a big town.  Not one solitary member of the ordinary general public has protested to me against this measure.</P>

There is a majority there against Fianna Fáil and if the matter is put to them&mdash;unless the Labour representatives divide on it &mdash;it may be carried.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Dillon make some kind of comparison with cortisone as if cortisone were an article which was established over the years, which had never changed, or anything else.  I remember when cortisone first became available to the general public.  I had occasion to order quite a quantity of it in a hospital with which I was connected.  Quite suddenly, it was changed and I was left with £50 worth of it on the shelves in that hospital. It took me years to get rid of it simply because the doctors would not use the old stuff.  After another couple of years, there was another change and I was left then with a lesser quantity.</P>
      <P>However, to talk about cortisone in the same breath as fluorine is the most fantastic argument that could possibly be used.  Deputy M.J. O'Higgins said there was nothing to show there was no harmful effect.  Just before the Deputy came in, the Minister read a statement which said quite positively that one of the peculiar things about it was that there was absolutely no dangerous effect from the use&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have heard the Minister subjected to terrific abuse here.  His reply has always been very mild.  I listened to Deputy Ryan accuse him of attempting to put poison into the drinking water of the people.  Surely nothing more vicious than that can be said in this House? I have come in contact with children and their teeth, to a much greater extent, I suppose, than most Deputies. It is shocking when a mother brings in her child with a bad tooth which is causing it terrific pain and torture.  It is shocking to see these children crying and bawling.  Either the dentist takes out such teeth or we try to give the children something in the form of various little tablets to ease the pain. I should think the Minister would be thanked by the people for introducing a measure which can guarantee to 65 per cent. of young people that they will not suffer from such dental decay in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They can add it to the 12½ gallons of water he mentioned. The Minister is trying to make this a compulsory Bill.  The first question I would ask is: how many nations have taken action such as the Minister proposes?  If he were following the majority of the nations, he might have <Col N="1215" /> a case.  The number of nations which have made this mandatory is very small.</P>
      <P>The Minister's attitude is completely unreasonable.  He has not convinced the House by any of his arguments that we should make this proposal mandatory.  We of Fine Gael have agreed to an arrangement whereby a permissive Bill would be put into effect so that the various communities could make their decisions just as happened in various towns in America, as the Minister himself read out last evening.</P>
      <P>I think it is just a case of stubbornness. Deputy Loughman tried to play on the point that Deputy Ryan mentioned that this is a poisonous substance. It is; it is deadly poison. Naturally, with small doses, the effect is not as great as if a large dose of this deadly substance were administered. It is only right to describe this as a coercion Bill.  It calls for the compulsory fluoridation of drinking water.  It does not give the local authorities who administer these water schemes the option of adding the fluorine to the water.</P>
      <P>Some people have mentioned that small doses are already available in supplies of water in certain places. That is only an opinion and an argument put forward here in support of making the Bill mandatory.  Would the Minister not be prepared to leave this matter to a free vote of his Party? If he did so, he could not come here and say he has full support in making the consumers of piped water supplies swallow this dose of fluorine in the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no public clamour for the Bill.  If we had not raised our voices here, it might have amounted to deceiving the public in giving them this dose.  That is the only way one can describe it.  Why not suspend this Bill until the general election and make it a national issue? Why not get a decision from the people as a whole?  Even in that case, a large number of electors will not be affected one way or another.  Why not let us have a decision from the <Col N="1216" /> community as a whole if the Minister will not leave it to decision by the various local authorities?</P>
    <P>The Minister read out figures concerning decisions reached in various towns where fluoridation was abandoned. It was remarkable to note the way in which only a few of those decisions came to a close vote.  The Minister mentioned a large community; I think there were 45,000 against and almost the same number for.  But that was only one example where the issue was fairly close.  In all other cases, the proposal to abandon fluoridation was carried by a majority.  When we find progressive nations like the United States and Great Britain not daring to put through a mandatory Bill, why should we try to set a headline for the rest of the world in a matter such as this? The problem has been considered for a long time in both the United States and Britain and both have decided against compulsion.</P>
    <P>Why should the Minister make fluoridation compulsory here?  In many countries, it was a 50/50 issue. It was not defeated in the majority of communities.  We can boast of having the purest and cleanest water it is possible to supply.  Why tamper with it, beyond disinfecting it?  Deputy de Valera tried to make the point that fluorine is a disinfectant.  Chlorine is a disinfectant; fluorine is not.  The consumption of fluoridated water, apart from benefiting the teeth, and that to a questionable degree, affects the human constitution.  In particular, it is supposed to affect the kidneys very adversely.</P>
    <P>We are in favour of permissive legislation. I think we are very reasonable in that.  Permissive legislation will enable local authorities to decide the issue for themselves.  In Great Britain, local authorities attempted to add fluorine to water.  Some were successful; others were put out of office by the people they represented.  The Minister will use his majority here to put this Bill through and every public authority will be compelled to add fluorine to water.  The inevitable result of this measure will be to cause contention <Col N="1217" /> in the local authorities themselves, and they will be much nearer to the communities affected.</P>
    <P>The date on which fluoridation will commence will be another cause of contention.  Some local authorities may wish to postpone fluoridation; some may not wish to implement it.  If the Minister is not prepared to make this an issue in the next election, would he not consider having a referendum now?  He should at least try to get a decision from the people, instead of using his majority here.  If he made the provision permissive, fluoridation could be put on trial for a year, or a number of years.  County councils which wished to add fluorine could continue to do so, so long as the community were satisfied.  Surely the Minister could devise a scheme to make fluorine tablets available free to those who require them.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that fluoridation will impose a charge on the rates and the cost of it will be much greater than the cost of supplying tablets to those who require them.  When fluoridation has been rejected by so many communities, there seems to be no sound reason why we should make it compulsory here.  The Minister has put forward here only those who support his own case.  He has not made a general case to convince us that his attitude in making this a mandatory Bill is justified.  I urge the Minister to think <Col N="1218" /> again.  He still has time to withdraw the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 7, before &ldquo;in&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or of the effect of fluoridated water upon people's health.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When speaking on Section 2, I mentioned that there was a later amendment tabled for the purpose of seeking the kind of review and testing the compilation of statistics which would prove a guide to the House and health authorities generally as to whether or not the increased intake of fluorine would have a harmful effect upon health.  This amendment is designed for the purpose of having that kind of survey made.</P>
      <P>As it stands, Section 6 imposes a duty on health authorities whenever required by the Minister, by a particular date which the Minister may specify, to make such estimates as may be directed by the Minister of the incidence of dental caries in their functional area or in a specified part of their functional area, either in respect to all persons therein or with respect to a specified class of such persons, and to furnish to the Minister particulars of such estimates as soon as may be after it is made.  This amendment suggests that in line 7 of the section, before the word &ldquo;in&rdquo;, that is, after the words &ldquo;dental caries&rdquo;, there should be added the phrase &ldquo;or of the effect of fluoridated water upon people's health,&rdquo; so that, if accepted by the Minister, the subsection will read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shall be the duty of each health authority, whenever and so often as the Minister so requires, to make, before such date as the Minister <Col N="1219" /> may specify, such estimate as may be directed by the Minister of the incidence of dental caries or of the effect of fluoridated water upon people's health in their functional area...</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment which certainly is not being moved in any obstructionist spirit or frivolous manner.  I have said earlier, and I believe I am right, that as far as I know, no tests have been made which are capable of demonstrating in a positive way that an increased intake of fluorine will not be harmful to general health, or harmful to classes and categories of people who are afflicted with a particular type of disease.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde and other speakers referred on Second Reading to suggestions that the addition of fluorine may be harmful to people with certain conditions, and I believe that it should be possible for the Minister's Department to make arrangements to put the suggestion contained in this amendment into effect without in any way cutting across the principle of the Bill, without in any way interfering with the administration of the Bill, which is in the form the Minister wanted it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to open discussion again on whether the whole question of adding fluorine to water can be regarded as something that is settled, or something that is still in an experimental stage, but I have said that it is not settled practice anywhere in the world, that it is still the subject of lively controversy in every continent and country in which it is considered, and that some communities which did adopt the practice have since discontinued it.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera on Section 2 asked, reasonably enough, why they had discontinued the practice, whether it was on medical grounds or because of the expense involved?  Quite frankly, I do not know the answers to those questions.  The Minister may know the answers.  He may have made inquiries to establish the reasons why a long list of communities discontinued the practice of fluoridating their water supplies, and it would certainly be relevant, <Col N="1220" /> both to the Bill and to the amendment, to know to what extent these communities were influenced by medical fears or by medical conclusions as to the effect of fluorine on general health and on the health of those with particular medical conditions.  That is an investigation which should be made.</P>
    <P>If communities abroad that have already been concerned in this question can help the Minister with information then I think that information should be sought and obtained but, irrespective of whether it can help or not, I believe he should take powers under the Bill to require a survey to be made of the type suggested in the amendment.  If he is serious about implementing the Bill, if he is serious in the faith he professes in the fluoridation scheme, I believe acceptance of the amendment would be helpful to him and the public.

      <P>This amendment is unnecessary.  Naturally, the Minister for Health will be very concerned to keep under observation any area where a fluoridated water supply has been introduced if only for the purpose of easing the public mind.  The difficulty about the amendment is that it carries the implication that fluoridated water will have some detrimental effect on people's health in addition to the benefit which it will confer by way of resistance to dental decay, especially among children.  I have already dealt fully with these allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is already made in the Bill, under Section 6, as amended, for the carrying out of surveys of dental caries, which surveys will be made before any regulations made by the Minister can become effective, and the section enables the Minister to continue to require local authorities to make similar surveys so often as he requires.  It is not necessary to make it mandatory on local authorities to go further than that.  From the beginning, as I said, the Minister will be concerned to keep the public mind at ease and to keep the general health of the communities who have the benefit of <Col N="1221" /> a fluoridated water supply under close observation.  But if, notwithstanding the reassurance which we can obtain from experience elsewhere, a question did arise at some time in the future as to the possible association between, say, fluoridated water and some ailment or disease, the appropriate body which the Minister might arrange to carry out a study of that condition would be the Medical Research Council, not the local authority, which would be equipped for the task and could engage the necessary expert personnel.</P>
    <P>The Deputy who put down the amendment, and Deputy O'Higgins, who spoke to it, have forgotten that the general health of the community is kept under continuous notice by the Minister for Health, in the first instance, by his Department, by the city and county medical officers of health and, most of all, by the medical profession generally.  Therefore, if it did happen that there was a particular association between an ailment or a disease and a fluoridated water supply, that would immediately come under the attention of the Minister, and he could not possibly refrain from doing what the amendment asks.</P>
    <P>We should consider the necessity for it, and I am taking advantage of the amendment to try and repeat again something I have already said at length.  This time I am going to quote the words of the British Ministry of Health in their Report for 1955. It is known, of course, that the U.K. Government sent a Special Mission to the United States in the year 1952 to study this matter.  As a result of that study and investigation the British Ministry of Health in their report for 1955 made the following comments:</P>
    <P>In the light of the reports on the North American studies and of other evidence that water containing one part in one million of fluoride has no ill effects, it has become evident that some of the medical examinations that were envisaged by the U.K.  Mission are not necessary. Research will, of course, continue so that more may be known of the mechanism by which fluoridation achieves such a beneficial reduction <Col N="1222" /> in dental decay; but this will be an effort of pure research, not a measure taken because of any likelihood of danger.</P>
    <P>I am repeating that because I want to give to the people whose fears may have been needlessly aroused in relation to this matter the reassurance contained in that Report.  It happens that I can carry the matter a little further.  In the course of the intensive study of the effects of fluoridation carried out in the United States, and to which I have referred, one significant research project was undertaken.  It was the study of the health experience of the adult populations in two adjoining towns in Texas.  What differentiated these two towns was the character of their water supplies.  One of them was a town called Bartlett, a small town.  A small town is, perhaps, a better subject for research investigation than a large city because the number of variables, although still very great, are much less when dealing with populations of 1,000 or 2,000 than with a population of 500,000.  In this town of Bartlett, which had a population of something over 1,600, the water supply had a natural fluoride content of eight parts per million&mdash; eight times that which is laid down as the maximum in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Then there was the adjoining town of Cameron, with a population of over 5,000, where the fluoride content was 0.4 parts per million.  That is like something we have in some parts in Ireland, although in our case I think the highest content is 0.3, that is, three-tenths of one part per million. The exhaustive investigation started in 1943 covered something over 270 people who had resided in these towns continuously for 15 years.  They were submitted during this investigation to medical, dental X-ray and laboratory examinations.  These individuals had the same method of life except they were drinking two different types of water&mdash;one a naturally heavily fluoridated water and the other water which was deficient in what was regarded as the optimum fluoride content.</P>
    <P>A search was made for evidence of arthritis, raised blood pressure, cataract, <Col N="1223" /> decreased acuity of hearing, occurrence of fractures, stones in the urinary and bile tracts, goitre and abnormalities of the heart and blood vessels.  The laboratory studies included examination of blood and urine.  The examinations were repeated ten years later on a smaller number of people because, naturally, some of the original subjects had left the town.  However, apart from mottled enamel it was found there were no clinically significant physiological or functional effects resulting from prolonged ingestion of water containing excessive fluorine, the excess being in the town whose inhabitants were drinking water containing eight parts fluoride per million.</P>

      <P>In America, starting in 1943.  I mention that just to show that wherever it has been possible to carry out experiments with comparable populations there has not been adduced, a single instance of the general health of the people being affected by drinking fluoridated water, even where the fluoride content was by our standards greatly excessive.  The only difference in the cases of these two populations was that the population drinking the naturally heavily fluoridated water suffered mottling of the teeth.  I may say that if one were to consider these towns to find the most pertinent factor which might have given rise to the abandonment of fluoridation wherever it had been carried out, it probably was the cosmetic effect of drinking an excessively fluoridated water supply&mdash;and it was probably the ladies' vote that determined that.</P>
      <P>I am not accepting this amendment. In any event I cannot accept it in the form in which it stands, but between now and the Report Stage I shall try some way of ensuring that this question of the effect of fluoridation on the general health of the people will be kept under continuous survey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I had practically concluded what I wished to say when the debate was adjourned. I was referring to Section 10 and at the outset, I think we should realise that the provisions of that section, when one examines it, must be considered to be as much in the interests of the tenants as of the landlords.  The first remark to be made in regard to this provision, which we can deal with in more detail on the next Stage, is that it follows rather closely a recommendation made by the Commission set up to examine this problem, a Commission set up not by this Government but by a previous Government from the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision will possibly be the centre of discussion in this Bill and therefore I content myself at this stage with pointing out that the problems from the tenants' side in regard to repairs had become more and more apparent as time went on.  One of the bad effects of the Rent Restriction Acts from the point of view of the tenant was that because of the controls, and particularly the controls in regard to the return the landlord got from his property, property was falling into disrepair and various steps had been contemplated, <Col N="1225" /> and some had been taken, to deal with that in the Housing Acts and otherwise, but for the unfortunate tenant of property falling into disrepair, there was a very real problem.</P>
    <P>This section will deal with that. There will be objection, of course, to the 12½ but against that there must be balanced the necessity to deal with the problem which the tenant has in regard to premises going into disrepair because of uneconomic considerations and the problems which tenants have had in regard to lack of repairs and these problems must be balanced and an equitable solution found as between landlord and tenant.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as this is a matter which no doubt will get most careful consideration on Committee Stage, I shall not elaborate further on it, except to appeal for as objective an approach to the Bill as possible.  We had such an approach, to a large extent, I think on the 1946 Act and I think the result issuing from this House was, by and large, a good one.  We can hope for an equally good result, if there is a cool and dispassionate examination of all the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The final remark I shall make in regard to Section 10 is this: remember that the tenant has certain rights and his existing rights are to some extent preserved in Section 40 or in some later section which gives him the right either to compel the landlord to repair or to deduct any sum which is recoverable. Therefore, this must be regarded as an increase given to the landlord for the benefit of the tenant and the tenant will have the power to enforce that for his own benefit.  In order to put the matter in perspective, all I shall say now is that although it may be considered from one point of view as benefiting the landlord, this section has very real benefits to offer the tenants.  It is a matter of finding a balance, to see what is the right solution and that balance can best be determined after the Committee Stage discussion.  I think I should leave the further consideration of the Bill to that Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion that has taken place on this <Col N="1226" /> Stage may, I think, be fairly readily divided into two categories.  In the first, I would put the arguments which have been directed to the principles in the Bill, the general policy of the Bill. The second category contains those arguments which have been advanced and which deal with the details of the Bill and its specific provisions and which, strictly speaking, are more correctly discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>If I take the discussion which we have had on the policy in the Bill, I think it can be dealt with under five main headings.  In the first case, it has been said that there should be no decontrol and that, so far as this Bill provides for any element of decontrol, it is a bad Bill.  The second point made was that the 12½ per cent. increase which is being given on basic rents is unfair, unjust and unnecessary. The point was made that this Bill is only an instalment and that what we are really doing is setting out on a programme the ultimate aim of which is to abolish rent control completely. Then we have the argument that the Bill will not achieve the objectives it sets out to achieve and, finally, we have what is possibly the soundest argument of all, that the Bill is very complicated and that we should try to simplify it as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal first with the suggestion that there should not be any decontrol.  To my mind, that proposition is completely indefensible. Every sound principle of national economics dictates that we should have the maximum possible degree of decontrol.  The reasons for that are fairly simple and indeed have been pretty clearly set out by the Capital Investment Advisory Committee. National capital is scarce and we are engaged in a programme of economic expansion which will use up to a greater and greater extent our available capital.  So far as capital is available, it should be used for productive purposes in accordance with that programme for economic expansion and anything we can do to save capital for productive purposes is good from the national economic point of view.  It follows that if we can do anything to preserve the existing stock of houses or <Col N="1227" /> to increase the supply of rented houses, we are following the dictates of good, sound national economic policy.</P>
    <P>In this regard we are not alone. The whole trend in western Europe is along these lines.  Deputy Costello seems to be under a misapprehension when he thinks that, in bringing in this Bill, we are going against the general trend.  I want to quote from a United Nations publication on housing published in May, 1960, and dealing with European Housing Trends and Policies in 1959:</P>
    <P>In western Europe, there was a continuing liberalisation of rent policy and therefore further rent increases during 1959.  The aim is generally the eventual abolition of rent control, for example, in Denmark, Finland, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Greece, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Rents of old houses have been progressively increased, the area of rent control reduced and, in two countries, Belgium and Finland, rent control has virtually disappeared in recent years.  Almost all western European countries have come to regard the upward adjustment of old rents as inevitable; most consider, however, that the termination of rent control in whole or in part should depend on the elimination of serious housing shortages.  The level of controlled rent has normally been increased in order to make possible more adequate repairs and maintenance and in some cases also to take advantage of a more favourable rent income relationship.</P>
    <P>I quote from that report to indicate the way our colleagues in western Europe generally are thinking about this matter and to show that the idea of a gradual relaxation of rent control in order to secure certain specific advantages is generally recognised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the aim of the Government here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall explain what exactly is the aim of the Government, if the Deputy will allow me to do so.  As I said, it is clear from the <Col N="1228" /> point of view of pure economic policy what could be done but when the Government came to consider this matter&mdash;and indeed they gave it long and anxious consideration&mdash;they had to bear in mind that this matter involves questions of social justice, questions of hardship, and that rent control is more than just a simple economic problem.  Rent control is designed primarily to protect the weaker sections of the community. Therefore, thinking of those two matters, the Government decided on this principle&mdash;and this principle is the foundation stone of the Bill&mdash; that we should endeavour to procure the maximum amount of decontrol, consistent with the avoidance of any hardship to tenants.  I think that is an eminently fair and reasonable solution, and, as I said in my opening remarks, it represents a compromise between two conflicting interests: on the one hand, the natural desire of any Government to procure the greatest economic advantage and to pursue the soundest economic policies and, on the other hand, the equally compelling motive of any Government, to protect the weaker sections of the community and to avoid hardship on those who are less well able to protect themselves.</P>
      <P>I want to make this point clear: we are retaining rent restrictions, by and large.  From some speeches made here last night, one would be inclined to think we were doing away with rent restrictions altogether.  In fact, we are not.  This Bill is a comprehensive measure of rent restrictions and while we are bringing about some small measure of decontrol, we are in a number of ways strengthening rent restrictions, closing up loopholes and giving a greater degree of protection to tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to be critical about this sort of thing and to come down heavily on one side, but I should also like to put this principle to the Fine Gael Party for their consideration. When we are talking of rent restrictions, we are dealing with private property, property which belongs to individuals. There is a principle that a man <Col N="1229" /> should be able to do with his own private property as he wishes, consistent with the general good of the community. If we can do anything to contribute to that principle without causing hardship or working social injustice, I think we should contribute to it and that the Fine Gael Party, if they examine the matter, will agree with that.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to a statement made by the British Minister of Housing on this point.  It was made recently and it did not enter into our thinking when we were coming to our decision because we had made our decision long before the British Minister made the statement.</P>
    <P>However, I think it is relevant that we should consider it because it struck me as containing a great degree of common sense.  In reply to Labour Party criticism, the British Minister stated he felt the real solution was, by more decontrol, to procure a greater supply of rented accommodation and that in fact increasing rent restrictions and the reintroduction of controls would have the opposite effect and was therefore completely undesirable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello, on this general matter of decontrol, dealt at some length with the fact that we propose to decontrol business lettings.  We do.  We propose to decontrol those business lettings which are controlled at the moment, provided they are pure business lettings; mixed lettings will still be subject to control.  In doing that, we are fortified by the decision of the Conroy Commission.  The Conroy Commission stated that it failed to see any reason why these types of premises should continue to be controlled.  It must be remembered that the impetus behind rent restriction legislation is to procure a social objective.  One of the fundamental needs of people is a roof over their heads and here we are introducing a form of price control for one of the necessaries of life.  That is the main moral justification for rent control.</P>
    <P>That does not apply to business premises.  A businessman, if he is to stay in business, should be able to <Col N="1230" /> pay the normal outgoings proper to the business, one of which is rent. There is no moral justification for applying rent control to business premises.  There is one important qualification to all this, that where&mdash; and I think this is the type of case Deputy Costello is mainly concerned with&mdash;there is a residence as well as a shop&mdash;in other words, where there is a mixed letting; where a small shopkeeper has a shop and lives over the premises&mdash;we are retaining rent control and I think that is a perfectly fair approach to the matter.</P>
    <P>The second major criticism levelled at the Bill was that the 12½ per cent. increase on basic rents which the Bill proposes to allow to landlords is unfair and unjustified.  Let me outline the background to this proposal.  The Conroy Commission sat in 1952 and at that time, eight years ago, it recommended an increase of 25 per cent. in the case of landlords liable for all repairs and 12½ per cent. in the case of landlords liable for part repairs.  Since then, repair costs have increased by 40 per cent. and even though they have increased by 40 per cent., we are still giving only 12½ per cent. in any case.  In other words, we are not going as far as the Conroy Commission recommended in 1952, despite the fact that costs have increased by 40 per cent. since then.</P>
    <P>I shall ask the Opposition to be fair about this matter.  Every section of the community has rights; landlords have had no increase in basic rents since 1926.  Now when you consider that all prices have gone up and the way wages have gone and the way the cost of repairs&mdash;the factor of paramount importance in this&mdash;has increased, a 12½ per cent. increase is very modest indeed.  Indeed, if we are to be criticised at all, we can be criticised for not going far enough on the side of the landlords.  This legislature will naturally be weighted on the side of the tenant.  Generally speaking, tenants are in a weaker position, less well off, and all of us will be more inclined to their point of view for that reason, but landlords have rights, too, and there are cases of hardship on landlords. Another point which we should keep <Col N="1231" /> in mind in this respect is that this reasonable, modest increase to landlords to enable them to carry out necessary repairs is in the long term interests of the tenant.</P>
    <P>All of us know that there have been cases where it was not worth while for landlords to do any repairs.  Good landlords and responsible landlords who wanted to look after their tenants properly just could not, from their income, look after their property as they wished.  In so far as this 12½ per cent. increase will contribute somewhat to enable them to do that, it is a good thing and in the interests of tenant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Our objection is that they will get the increase, whether or not they carry out the repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just coming to that point.  It has been said that we are giving a bonus to landlords, giving them 12½ per cent. increase, and at the same time, not compelling them to carry out repairs.  We cannot do any more in that respect than we have done.  First of all, we have Section 40 of the Bill&mdash;and indeed in this respect I would be more than grateful to Deputy Casey if he would read the Bill before he indulges in criticism of it&mdash; which empowers the court to award a sum of money to the tenant to carry out repairs where a landlord has neglected to do so.  That is important. Deputy Costello criticises that on the ground that the tenant has to go to court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. The general position is that the tenant can go to court and the court may award the tenant a sum of money to carry out repairs where the landlord neglects to do so.  Actually subsection (5) of Section 40 specifically reserves all the other rights which a tenant may have in this respect.  What are those rights?  First of all, as Deputy Briscoe pointed out, there is the sanitary authority to whom any tenant may apply on payment of 5/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> Then there is Section 61 of the Landlord and Tenant Act which provides that if a landlord is not carrying out the repairs, the tenant may carry them out himself and deduct the cost from subsequent payments of rent.  The tenant has also the ordinary remedy for breach of contract at common law.  That possibly is not as effective as the others but it is still there.  All these provisions are designed to see that landlords meet their obligations regarding repairs.  I think they are fairly comprehensive and fairly good, but if anybody else wants to suggest further safeguards, we can consider them.  I think there are enough and if landlords are not carrying out repairs which they should, then I am afraid tenants are falling down on the job by not insisting that the work be carried out.  In that case there is very little we can do.  We have provided several adequate procedures to enable tenants to ensure that these&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are not giving them what the Conroy Commission recommended would be fair and just.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy D. Costello mentioned the provision that the court will not recommend this sum of money to the tenant to carry out repairs where the house is too far gone. Again, in that respect, I can only say that we are following the recommendation of the Conroy Commission.  I think there is eminent justification for the recommendation.  It seems fair that where a House is obviously so far gone that money spent on repairs would be thrown down the drain, the court can refuse to give it.  It is purely at the discretion of the court and a matter for reasonableness.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the 12½ per cent. increase, I want to say this: naturally, since this Bill was introduced in the Seanad, we have had representations from many people about many aspects of it.  We have had a lot to do with it and Deputy Briscoe, who spoke on it, has had more than I to do with a very large body of tenants, the largest single group of tenants of a private landlord in the country.  In all the discussions which he has had with those people, and which we have had, there has not been one single complaint raised by interested parties about the 12½ per cent. increase.  That is only natural when you consider the position fairly.  I think the ordinary tenant recognises that his landlord is entitled to some increase and that 12½ per cent. is not an unreasonable increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point was made last night about <Col N="1234" /> old age pensioners and the poorer sections of the community.  All I can say about that is that it is a separate matter.  The care of old age pensioners and the care of these poorer sections of the community is a problem that we have always with us.  It is a question which a Government must always have regard to, which every Minister for Finance must think about when he comes to frame his Budget proposals and I am quite sure it will get the same earnest consideration in future as it has always received from Fianna Fáil Governments in the past.</P>
    <P>The effect of this proposal, as far as we can estimate, if no other factors enter into it, will be to increase the consumer price index by .35 to base 100 in August, 1947.  If that is shown to have any particular effect of hardship on the poorer sections of the community, that will be considered in relation to the constant care and consideration which a Government give to these sections of the community and in relation to the continual adjustments which they make in social welfare benefits and payments of one sort and another.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the poorer the type of person involved, the less the increase is.  Twelve and a half per cent. may be a big increase on £1,000, but as you go down to the cheaper type of accommodation and the smaller rents, it becomes relatively less important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no validity or sincerity in that argument put forward by Deputy Costello.  It would be practically impossible to devise a way of giving effect to that in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is another point about this.  I do not know whether it is being overlooked deliberately or not.  By far the majority of these people are housed by local authorities and are not concerned with this Bill at all.</P>
      <P>The criticism was levelled from the Labour Party, I think, in the main, that this was only an instalment, that we in fact were setting out to abolish rent control altogether and that this was the first step.  I reject that.  That is not so.  The decision of the Government in this regard is absolutely clear. They reviewed the whole situation, considered it as carefully as they could, evolved, as I say, the principle that we would provide whatever decontrol could be achieved without causing hardship to existing tenants.  That is the position and it goes no further than that.</P>
      <P>At any stage, any Government will keep these matters under review and if the interests of the economy and social justice indicate that there is a need for reintroduction of more restrictions or further relaxations of control, then I I have no doubt a good Government will act as they see proper at any given time in that regard.</P>
      <P>The next point of criticism was that this Bill will not achieve its objectives. I think it will.  In so far as we have set limited objectives, I think we shall succeed in achieving them.  We hope the Bill will bring about, first of all, an improvement in the existing stock of houses.  Do we not all know that the existing stock of houses is being allowed to go into disrepair, to become dilapidated and that generally there is a national loss in that regard?  The first objective we hope to achieve is that that situation will be arrested and that from now on this national capital in the form of a stock of houses will be preserved as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> Secondly, we hope for an increase in the supply of rented accommodation and that is a desirable objective.  We hope, as I said in my opening remarks, for very good results from the provision about self-contained flats.  There we are able to achieve that without causing hardship on any tenant.  These will all be new buildings and will be let <i>de novo.</i>  I think it is a very desirable provision.  I said we were particularly interested in it and we hope to achieve very good results from it.</P>
    <P>The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  They cannot say to us that we are doing too much and giving too much relaxation of controls, that the 12½ per cent. increase in basic rents should not be given and at the same time, criticise us that our Bill will not achieve its objectives.</P>
    <P>Those were the main points of principle on which the Bill was criticised and so far as those criticisms have been made, I have dealt fairly adequately with them.  I think the general policy of the Bill can be defended as being in the best interests of the nation and the economy generally and, at the same time, we can stand foursquare on the principle that we are protecting sitting tenants in every possible way and, indeed, improving their protection in many ways.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the various points of detail, as I may describe them, Committee Stage points, made by various Deputies.  Deputy Costello compared this Bill with the attempt made to achieve a certain amount of decontrol which started in 1926 and which was subsequently abandoned. There is no comparison at all.  The attempt at decontrol which was commenced in 1926 was made on a valuation basis and gave no protection whatever to sitting tenants.  There is the essential difference that in so far as we are attempting to achieve decontrol, we are doing it only in cases where no existing tenant will be interfered with in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello made two points on Section 31, subsection (3).  He mentioned a recent case in connection with the position of an administrator <Col N="1238" /> who was in possession or, indeed, of an executor who is not in possession.</P>
    <P>I must say that we were grateful to Deputy Costello for bringing this case to our notice.  We were not aware of it.  In the light of what he says, we shall consider these proposals further. The House will realise that we have done quite a bit to improve the situation in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, would the Parliamentary Secretary consider the position of executors?</P>

      <P>I mentioned that. There was, of course, the discussion which we had last night on the question of houses which become decontrolled and where there is a subsequent letting of a room or a flat in those houses.  I think Deputy Costello's fears in this regard are groundless. First of all, I want to state that our intention is quite clear.  We intend, where houses become decontrolled and a room or flat in the house is subsequently relet, that they should again come under control.  Apart from that, we shall make sure, with the Parliamentary draftsmen, that we achieve that effect.  Apart from that, the sort of situation which Deputy Costello envisaged last night is a little unreal&mdash;that all the tenants would suddenly die overnight and that the landlord would get vacant possession and seek to charge exorbitant rents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary leaves that point, could I refer him and his advisers to the 1944 edition of Mr. Coghlan's book on the Rent Acts, 1944, page 68 in which the cases dealing with this particular problem are digested and the cases which arose under the 1926 Act?  I think the Parliamentary Secretary, if he does that, will see the necessity for clarifying this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose legal science is not an exact one.  You never ultimately arrive at any point of <Col N="1239" /> finality on questions of definition and interpretation.  All I want to do is to state our intention and to say that I am assured by the expert in this field &mdash;the Parliamentary draftsman&mdash;that we have achieved our purpose.  I am prepared to consider it again and do anything I can to ensure that we achieve our purpose.</P>
      <P>There is no basis at all for the suggestion of a fair rent court.  The Conroy Commission rejected it and, I think, rightly so.  What we are trying to achieve in this Bill is certainty.  We want to fix rents with certainty.  By and large, that is a very desirable thing to do.  Everybody will know where they stand.  Tenants will have basic rents.  We shall avoid, I hope, if not almost entirely, certainly to a very great extent, any real volume of litigation. I am not accusing Deputy Costello or Deputy O'Higgins of wanting a lawyers paradise when they speak about such a court, but that is what it would be.  I think it is far more desirable to try to do what we have done&mdash;fix basic rents and have certainty in the position.</P>
      <P>There may be a little hardship here and there.  If there is, the provisions of Section 8 will try to deal with it. That is far more desirable and beneficial than any suggestion of fair rent courts.  You have to give some indication to the courts what a fair rent would be.  Once you do that, then you are back to all the provisions of the Bill.  We have achieved certainty and we want to keep it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello got himself tied up in knots about this question of grants. The position is quite simple although the language of the sections concerned may be a little technical.  We believe that landlords are entitled to a basic 12½ per cent. increase.  We have excepted two types of case.  In the one case, where a landlord has carried out exceptional repairs without taking a State grant to meet part of the cost, and has got the full benefit in the form of increased rents, we are not giving any increase.  He is not benefiting from this 12½ per cent. increase at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> There is another case.  There is the case where a landlord has carried out exceptional repairs and has taken the State grant.  In that case, the rent at present being paid will consist in part of the original rent and in part of an increase procured as a result of the special repairs, but that increase procured will already be very considerably reduced by the fact that the expenditure in arriving at that increase was reduced by the amount of the grant. In that case, all we say is: take the original rent and give 12½ per cent. on that.  You do not give any 12½ per cent. increase on the amount of the increase procured by virtue of the special expenditure.  That is exactly what the Conroy Commission recommended. I think it is perfectly sensible and fair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary refer me to the part of the Conroy Commission which refers to the grants and the question of 12½ per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do that before I finish.  Deputy Casey was concerned that we were freeing from control houses which were more than £30 valuation in Dublin city and £25 elsewhere of which the landlord subsequent to the passing of this Bill gets possession. He thinks dire results will follow from that.  It is quite clear that Deputy Casey has not understood what is involved and I am afraid that he has not thought very carefully about it.  In the first instance, a £30 valuation ceiling covers the vast majority of houses in this country.  The number of houses over £30 valuation is limited and the number of houses over £30 valuation which are rented is even more limited. When you introduce the further factor that a house must not alone be over £30 in valuation and rented and in the category of rented houses which are controlled but must also have come into the possession of the landlord subsequent to the passing of the Bill, then the number of houses concerned would be infinitesimal and will not have the slightest effect on the type of person about whom Deputy Casey is worried, namely, the person who has moved around the country in the course of his employment from town to town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" /> Deputy Casey should bear this in mind.  When a landlord gets possession of the premises, there is nothing to compel him to relet that premises as the law stands at the moment.  By virtue of the provisions of the existing law, a landlord will almost certainly not relet the premises because he would probably have to spend a certain amount on decoration for which he will not get increased rent.  He will have to let the premises at the 1914 level of rents.  The effect of the law at the moment is to ensure that in these cases a landlord will not relet. In this particular regard, we are aiming to encourage landlords to relet houses above these valuations of which they get possession and which they will repair and decorate and be in a position to get some return from the increased rent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin has concerned himself with a couple of points which are of very practical importance to the constituency which he represents and to a considerable portion of the neighbouring constituency which I represent. He was concerned about the question of key money.  All I can tell him in that regard is that the acceptance or demanding of key money by a landlord is a criminal offence and we provide in this Bill that any tenant from whom key money is taken can come along and recover it.</P>
    <P>I would like to make sure that Deputy Sherwin is not confusing key money deposited as security for rent. We think it reasonable for a landlord to demand a reasonable deposit as security for rent and we have provided that a landlord is entitled to demand security amounting to not more than three months' rent.  We are improving the tenants' position in this regard by making better provision for the return of these deposits.  Deputy O'Higgins brought up this point last night when he asked for an assurance that where there is a change of landlord the tenant will be able to secure the return of the deposit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider bringing in a provision making it invalid in a contract of sale to prohibit a requisition about deposits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1242" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will think about that but I am trying to make clear to Deputy Sherwin the essential difference between key money and money deposited for security for rent.  He had another point about an unscrupulous landlord who avails of the provision providing for caretakers' lettings to do injustice to the tenants.  I cannot be of very great assistance to him there. No matter what provision we could devise or enact here in this House, it is very difficult to ensure that landlords who are sufficiently unscrupulous will not get away with something.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Sherwin that he make the provisions of these Acts known to the tenants and that he would point out to them that the Acts are there to protect them, that they have available to them a useful protection under these Acts, that the courts are reasonable and that if they bring the whole facts before the courts they can be fairly certain that justice will be done.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin is concerned about the case of the landlord who refuses to accept the rent well knowing that working-class people are not inclined to look beyond next week or the week after and who hopes that by refusing to accept the rent for a considerable period and then demanding the arrears the arrears will not be there.  We shall consider that to see if there is anything we can do in that regard.  It might be possible to make some sort of provision that in considering whether to grant a decree the court will take into account to what extent the landlord has contributed to the situation in which the arrears arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the best protection is that tenants generally should know their rights.  So far as we can, in our capacity as public representatives, we should make sure that they do know about the Rent Acts, that they do know about these provisions and we should advise them, if they can afford it, to have proper legal advice and, if not, to make sure that the district justice or circuit judge is made fully aware of all the circumstances.  That is the most effective way in which unscrupulous landlords can be <Col N="1243" /> defeated.  The obvious answer is for the tenant to save the rent but, human nature being what it is, things may not always work out that way.  If tenants procure a postal order and post it to the landlord he would be in a very invidious position if he refused to accept it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins asked why we did not retain the power the Minister for Justice formerly had to nominate a distict justice to deal exclusively with rent matters in Dublin.  The position is as follows: The 1946 Act was passed before the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946, which made principal justices responsible for the regulation of the business of each division of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court.  The position now is that a principal justice and not the Minister nominates a particular justice in the appropriate division to be responsible for rent matters.  We also have this advantage, that whereas formerly when the Minister nominated one Dublin justice with sole jurisdiction, a Rent Act point which came up incidentally before any other justice had to be referred to that justice with consequential delay.  Now, any other justice can deal with a rent point should it come before him.  I think the deletion of the 1946 Act's provisions will make for better working.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to assure Deputy O'Higgins that the reference in Section 9 to Chapter 2 of Part II of the 1946 Act will disappear.  We shall bring in an amendment on Committee Stage to get rid of it.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 8, where Deputy O'Higgins was also concerned about the reference to Acts which have been repealed, I should like him to remember that Section 8 is a transitory section. We do not visualise that it will affect matters for more than a year or two years at the most.  It deals with cases where the rent is either too high or too low and the court will be asked to fix the proper basic rent.  All that should take place fairly quickly. Either the tenants or the landlords will move to have the position rectified. <Col N="1244" /> While it may be pointed out that we are, to some extent, making matters complicated by this reference to the 1946 Act I think it is unavoidable and that it should not lead in any way to trouble of the type envisaged by Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>I was going to deal with the question of deposits as security for rents and the case of the change of landlords, but as Deputy O'Higgins has made a suggestion in regard to that, I shall leave it over to Committee Stage. Deputy O'Higgins was also concerned with the wording of Section 9 in so far as the courts would have regard for the term &ldquo;state of repair&rdquo;.  I am not sure that the term &ldquo;state of repair&rdquo; does get over the difficulty Deputy O'Higgins sees.  I do not think it probably does, but I want to make clear that Section 9 will almost certainly not refer to houses at all.  Its operation will, I think, be exclusively confined to rooms and flats let in houses which become decontrolled and in which lettings are subsequently made.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat amused by the concern shown by Deputy O'Higgins about the fact that we were asking landlords to prove special circumstances when they sought to invoke the provisions of Section 8.  Deputy O'Higgins, and the Fine Gael Party generally, are taking the side of the tenant.  They object to the 12½ per cent. increase and they object to any form of decontrol.  Surely you cannot have it both ways.  If you are a landlord's man, be a landlord's man, and if you are a tenant's man, be a tenant's man.</P>

      <P>The difficulty we see is exactly the opposite.  There may be a kindly landlord who may make a letting at a low rent in special circumstances, <Col N="1245" /> but it is when that landlord sells his interest, or when it is transferred on death, that it is important that the special circumstances should have to be proved.  Almost certainly, a decent, kindly landlord will not invoke the provisions of Section 8, unless there were special circumstances. Some successor in title might well do so.</P>
      <P>A question was raised also with regard to the dangers inherent in the provision about a house becoming decontrolled where the owner is in occupation or subsequently comes into occupation.  Deputies were inclined to imagine there was a danger that landlords would go in for some form of fictitious occupation.  I do not think that is a very real danger when one considers that many landlords are limited companies or bodies corporate of one sort or another.  In a great number of cases, social and economic circumstances would prohibit landlords from indulging in that type of practice.  As well as that, if a landlord wanted to do that, he would be running a grave risk, because by entering into a fictitious occupation and ostensibly securing the decontrol of the house, then letting it to a tenant at a decontrolled rent, it would be open to that tenant at any stage to go to the court and prove the occupation of the landlord and his lack of <i>bona fides.</i>  If the tenant proved that the landlord occupied the premises for a day, two days, or a week, as some Deputies envisage, the landlord would be in a very serious position.  He would have sacrificed rights he legitimately would have under the Bill and he would almost certainly find his premises controlled again.  I think the landlord would be aware of that danger and would not be too willing to run that risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made a very good point with regard to the operation of Section 7 as to whether a letting subsequent to 1st February, 1960, could be regarded as being a letting made &ldquo;not more than three years before the 1st February, 1960.&rdquo;  I must confess frankly that that had not struck me or my advisers, and we shall be very glad to have another look at it.  I do <Col N="1246" /> not know if Deputy O'Higgins would care to tell us the results of his arguments in court on this point, and the decision.</P>

      <P>There is one question I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary.  Under the machinery of this Bill, some premises will cease to come under the Rent Restrictions Act and will come under the Landlord and Tenant Act.  There is provision in this Bill for that and I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary in view of the great difference between the two Acts in their method of assessment of rents, will it not have the practical effect of greatly increasing the rents on property which, by virtue of this provision, becomes subject to the Landlord and Tenant Act rather than the Rent Restrictions Act?</P>

      <P>In the first instance, a very limited category of properties is involved, that is, purely business premises let on less than yearly tenancies. Other purely business premises are not controlled at all.  Mixed business and residential lettings will still be controlled and these represent the great majority of the business premises now controlled.  Undoubtedly, the standards in the two Acts are different. I thought we would have been quite justified in removing control from those business premises and letting it go at that, but in an endeavour to be <Col N="1247" /> scrupulously fair, the Government decided to make the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act available to all of these premises.  I cannot attempt to estimate or speculate on what will happen.  I think there probably will be an increase but to what extent I cannot estimate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello asked me about paragraph 163 of the Conroy Report which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Owners who have taken advantage of these provisions of the 1946 Act are already receiving an adequate return on their actual expenditure on these exceptional repairs and it would not be reasonable to allow a percentage increase on that return.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 4, line 38, to insert &ldquo;halls, buildings and&rdquo; before &ldquo;offices&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to clarify the provisions of subsection (2) of Section 10 so that there shall not be any confusion or dispute.  A case could arise in which a hall would be included in a building erected as offices and it might be held that a hall contained in a multi-purpose building could not be included under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1251" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, in an effort to avoid confusion, this is going far beyond what the Bill originally intended to do.  We now extend the multi-powers of local authorities to acquire land not only for the erection of offices in which to carry on local government but also for halls or buildings&mdash;any buildings.  Why should a local authority have powers compulsorily to acquire land for the erection of a hall or a building?  I see the Minister's difficulty; he says that if a body like Dublin Corporation builds a wide range of offices and it is expedient to provide under the same roof an assembly hall, or something of that kind, he wishes to avoid the possibility of one of the functions of the general range of buildings being debarred owing to some ambiguity in the Bill.  That is a case that could be sympathetically considered.</P>
      <P>It is quite another proposition, however, to give a local authority in any part of the country power compulsorily to acquire land to erect a hall. Have they power under this to acquire compulsorily land to erect a dance hall?  They have.  But, if they have, and there are proposals before certain local authorities to build halls which will be primarily dance halls, then it appears to me that the word &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; will entitle them to acquire land compulsorily for the erection of any kind of building.  Does the House seriously think it desirable to confer on local authorities powers compulsorily to acquire land for any kind of building a county council or other local authority takes it into its head to erect?  I do not think they should have any such powers.  If I have a desirable site in the middle of the town in which I live and the local authority wants to build any kind of building &mdash; I take it &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; covers every kind of building&mdash;why should the local authority have power to acquire my premises and erect what they want on that site?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the origin of all this legislation was to enable local authorities to provide essential housing accommodation for people in their areas and special powers were provided in order to help local authorities solve an <Col N="1252" /> urgent social problem?  At first this Bill purported to extend that to the point of allowing local authorities to acquire land on which to build offices for the purpose of the better discharge of its work but now, by amendment, we are allowing an extension of that power for the purpose of a hall or any building.  Surely the Minister would need to justify that by something more cogent than the argument he put to the House on the question of ambiguity? Once a local authority has compulsorily acquired premises to accommodate offices for the due discharge of its work, surely the inclusion of an assembly hall in the office buildings will not invalidate the powers conferred by Section 10?  I would reluctantly be prepared to agree with that but I think it is going quite far beyond that to extend the powers in the manner outlined in this amendment, on the ground that it is seeking to avoid ambiguity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little surprised at the Leader of the Opposition making such a speech but I suppose he has not read the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill.  It was I on behalf of Dublin Corporation, with the knowledge and consent of the Manager, my colleagues and the law agent, who stated that the word &ldquo;offices&rdquo; as it appeared in this Bill, did not give us the full freedom of activity which we need, and I suggested to the Minister that he should incorporate a definition of &ldquo;offices,&rdquo; which is not something new.  It exists in Section 10 of the Local Government Act of 1898. That is how new this idea is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind interruptions because they might help me.  We want to build new civic offices and, in designing them, we may have to put in portion of a building which, if you like, might not be classified in court as limited to an office. Therefore, we want to be able to design our building in a manner that we can compulsorily acquire, if necessary, a piece of property adjacent to the site we have for that particular purpose and, at the same time, we do not want to be held up by somebody coming along saying: &ldquo;In the design for the civic offices there is a room for the councillors to meet which could not be classified as an office.&rdquo;  I do not think there need be any worries about a local authority going crazy and abusing this power beyond common sense.  Anyway, members of the Opposition should know that in any scheme we propose, we have to submit our plans, costs and everything for sanction to the Department of Local Government before we can proceed. That should be a sufficient safeguard in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe has made a case for an amendment entirely different from that before the House. Nobody could quarrel with offices being designed to contain a hall in which the council or local authority <Col N="1254" /> could meet, but that is not what this amendment provides.  It means that a local authority can go out and acquire land specifically for the purpose of building a hall, notwithstanding that there is not going to be, in or attached to that hall, one square inch of office space.  I do not see any reason on earth why local authorities should have compulsory powers to do that.</P>
      <P>The desirability of ensuring that an architect's design of local authority office buildings could be prepared in a proper way is a thing that could be achieved by a very simple amendment, but this amendment gives local authorities powers to acquire land for offices and any buildings of any sort, kind or description, not connected with offices in any way, and I see no justification whatever for giving compulsory powers for that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe has suggested that local authorities do not want to be held up, but does he remember it was because Hitler did not want to be held up that the last World War started? That is a very bad argument.  A proper definition, a proper drafting in the Bill, would get over any difficulty that might arise in design and would leave the situation in such a way that it would not be open to the abuse that obviously this section, if amended in a manner suggested, would be open to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that in the building we envisage there will be accommodation for cars?  There may be a couple of sheds provided for that purpose.  Could they not be called buildings as distinct from offices?  All I want is a sufficiently wide definition to enable us to build proper offices with the necessary accommodation for our purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection, if it means that an architect can design offices which have with them all such necessary and ancillary facilities required.  I object to giving power for compulsory acquisition of land for a hall alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the line taken by the Deputies were in accordance with the true position, I would be inclined to agree with them.  However, I do not agree that their reading of the amendment is correct.  As I understand it, and this is my intention, the purpose of inserting the words &ldquo;halls, buildings and&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;offices&rdquo;&mdash;and I think this is the normal procedure in many other such cases&mdash;is that the words should be read in the context of the meaning of &ldquo;offices&rdquo; in that section.  As has been pointed out, all county councils and county borough corporations already have this power under the 1898 Act, but they have it under the provisional order procedure which differs from the compulsory purchase order procedure which we discussed on Second Reading.</P>
      <P>One way or the other, it is the Minister for Local Government who will have to decide whether or not particular buildings and offices are in fact for the local authorities' use and are a necessary adjunct to their activities. It merely means that instead of the cumbersome procedure of provisional order we are applying here the C.P.O. procedure.  But, as I say, it is the Minister for Local Government who will have to decide whether these halls, offices and other amenities mentioned by Deputy Briscoe, such as car parks and so on, are a necessary and desirable adjunct to enable the local authority the better to carry out their business.  That is the context in which the amendment has been brought here and not with a view to giving greater scope to local authorities who might be presumed to take the view that they are entitled to build halls here, there and everywhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman have raised a point which fully deserves being looked into. It would appear it is not one that can be determined here on the Committee Stage.  I think some of the difficulty might be obviated if the Minister were to be good enough to say he would take another look.</P>
      <P>From what Deputy Briscoe has said about the 1898 Act, it would appear that that Act allows a local authority to acquire land for halls, buildings and such offices where they are necessary to carry out any of their purposes or duties.  If that clause were to be incorporated in this, I think it would get over the difficulty.  If Dublin Corporation need, as undoubtedly they do, a new council chamber and other assembly rooms, that is carrying out the powers and duties of the Corporation.  It is for that purpose that Dublin Corporation require the scope of this Bill to be rather wider than originally introduced.</P>
      <P>I would rather err on the broad than on the narrow side in relation to this. I think the likelihood of there being an abuse by local authorities, such as providing local dance halls on a commercial basis for making profit in competition with other reputable people, is most unlikely to happen.  If the councillors from one particular parish called for a dance hall or a community hall, they would have to convince all their fellow councillors. I do not think that would be likely unless there was to be a hall in every parish in the country, and I cannot see local authorities entering on all that expenditure.  At the same time, all the natural caution of councillors will prevent a grave abuse of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be as well if we tidied up the powers being incorporated from the addition of the words of the 1898 Act by restricting this power so that local authorities may use it only in <Col N="1258" /> connection with their own powers and duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not clear that it appears we are all of one mind?  The Minister tells us all he wants to do is to provide that if a local authority acquires property on which to erect offices, if there happens to be an old car park or bicycle park on it, it will not be open to anybody to query the propriety of taking over these appurtenances. If that is the purpose the Minister has in mind there is no difference between us.  It becomes merely a question of getting that purpose effectively expressed in the draft.</P>
      <P>I feel, and I have heard nothing to dissuade me from my conviction, that subsection (2) if it contains the amendment now proposed will read:</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a local authority consider that any land, whether situated within or outside their functional area, would, if acquired by them, be suitable for the provision of halls, buildings and offices for the local authority...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am persuaded that that gives a local authority power compulsorily to acquire by this very Draconian procedure of Section 10 which effectively sets aside the courts of law altogether and enables the Minister to do this virtually by order for the purpose of building a hall.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan may be convinced that the prospect of a local authority acquiring land to build a dance hall is unthinkable but it is at present in the process of being done by one local authority.  But in the circumstances they have to do it by negotiation&mdash;buy the land on which to build the hall. There is a long story involved in that which I shall tell Deputy Ryan some time when we have a moment to discuss it but if the local authority had compulsory power&mdash;or does any Deputy think any local authority in the country ought to have compulsory power to build a dance hall?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;buildings which are vital to the community.  I think, if they want to go out into wider activities, they should go and buy the land how they please, but they should not have that right against individual property-owners of compulsory acquisition under the exceptionally Draconian powers of Section 10 for such a purpose as building a hall.  It may be a good purpose but it is not an urgent, social necessity and it is a matter which can more reasonably be arranged by permitting the local authority to buy a piece of land or a suitable site from a willing vendor. That is the normal procedure and I am prepared to concede&mdash;as I think most Deputies are prepared to concede &mdash;that where essential, social requirements demand sites and a local authority cannot get them and the need for them is so urgent that the property-owners can almost blackmail the local authority by refusing to sell at anything other than a fantastic price, unless the local authority has compulsory powers the authority will be obliged to pay blackmail.  But what local authority can be blackmailed that cannot promptly get a site to build a dance hall?  They can simply wait philosophically until the first site comes on the market and in the meantime no serious inconvenience can be created for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be careful to preserve that distinction here because so long as we confine the granting of compulsory <Col N="1260" /> powers to local authorities&mdash;or, indeed, to Government Departments&mdash; to really essential purposes, that power will have the general consent and approval of the public.  If we start distributing that power to acquire your neighbours property for any purpose, I think a great many people will begin to wonder if such powers should be exercised at all.  I am certainly prepared to go on record as saying that I do not think a local authority should have power compulsorily to acquire property to build a dance hall.  I think a majority of the Deputies would agree with me.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to agree that I do not like the form of the Section 10 but I am also prepared to admit that compulsory power for a local authority to build offices for the due discharge of their work ought to be so drafted that if those offices contain an assembly hall or a car- or cycle-park or public lavatory or any necessary building&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of old age pension were increased as from 1st August last by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960.  There has not been meanwhile such a significant rise in the cost of living as would make it necessary or justifiable to impose on the community the further taxation which would be required to meet a further increase in these pension rates.</P>
      <P>In this connection I must point out that old age pension rates have been increased on no less than six occasions since June, 1951.</P>
      <P>These increases from the maximum rate of 17s. 6d. which then obtained were to 20s. in October 1951, 21s. 6d. in July 1952, 24s. in July 1955, 25s. in May 1957, 27s. 6d. in August 1959 and to 28s. 6d. in August 1960.  If the increases had been granted strictly in accordance with the cost of living figure the rates would have been 20s., 21s. 7d., 22s. 8d., 24s. 5d., 25s. 3d., and 25s. 10d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen that these increases have compensated or more than compensated <Col N="1264" /> for increases in the cost of living.

      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the Deputy is no doubt aware that the means of holders of qualification certificates must be reviewed when any change occurs in the circumstances of a holder, that is, acquirement of property, marriage, change of address.  The means of self-employed persons must also be reexamined periodically.  Apart from the other reasons mentioned the means of the holder of a qualification certificate must also be reinvestigated if his circumstances have not been reviewed for a number of years.</P>

Unemployment assistance was reduced in 10, 20 and 29 cases respectively and disallowed in 4, 14, and 8 cases respectively.</P>
    <P>Prior to September, 1958, the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes, where such were derived from the occupation of land, was based on values for stocks, crops, etc. adopted in 1940.  Since September, 1958, up-to-date values, as are used for old age pensions and noncontributory widows' and orphans' pensions purposes, have been applied to the assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>

      <P>The question of the inofficious will is one I have been considering and I hope to have it examined thoroughly in connection with other amendments of the law of succession as soon as time is available.  As I stated in the House on the 3rd instant in my opening speech on the Second Stage of the Charities Bill, &ldquo;we are aware that there are solid arguments for restricting the disposal of his property by a testator at the expense of close relatives&rdquo;.  The problem is by no means one to which there is a ready solution: and the examination that I intend to have made will include a comparative study of the different solutions adopted in other legal systems.</P>
      <P>We have no evidence that inofficious wills of the type suggested by the Deputy's question are being made to such an extent as to cause concern. By and large, the Irish husband in making his will is more than conscious of his responsibilities to his wife and children.  Indeed, it would be wrong to assume or imply that the position is otherwise.</P>
      <P>Proposals for a comprehensive Administration of Estates Bill to cover, <i>inter alia</i>, the descent and distribution of property on intestacy are at present under consideration.  From the practical point of view, this is of greater importance in this country, where approximately forty-five per cent of people with property to dispose of make no wills.  As the Deputy will be aware, a preliminary Act was enacted last year to deal with the procedure as to the devolution of property on death.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether in view of the high prices charged for pharmaceutical products he will appoint a committee under the Prices Act, 1958 to ascertain whether there is any justification for the present prices of such products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the information at present available to me this does not appear to be a case in which a Prices Advisory Committee should be appointed.  Enquiries made in the matter have included discussions in my Department with representatives of the Irish Drug Association.  The result of these enquiries, so far, tends to show that, with the exception of a limited number of proprietary preparations, prices here are approximately the same as those operating in the Six Counties and in Britain.  Enquiries in the case of the exceptional items mentioned are being continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is public disquiet at the prices charged for pharmaceutical products in this part of the country and that public uneasiness in that respect is not satisfied by a closed door discussion between the Department and those who produce these products? Will he, therefore, in order to allay public disquiet, arrange to set up a committee under the Prices Act for the purpose of having the matter <Col N="1271" /> examined in public, so that either present prices may be justified or steps taken to compel a reduction in prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>So far, the inquiries I have initiated indicate that the public disquiet is unfounded and such public disquiet as there may be seems to be caused by unfair comparison, in certain contributions to a newspaper, between prices here and prices in the Six Counties.  The unfair comparison I mention is that the cost prices to chemists of drugs in the Six Counties were compared with the retail prices charged by chemists in this part of the country.  However, over the whole area, any discrepancy between prices has been reduced now to ten per cent. and within that area I am having exhaustive inquiries made and I feel that I shall be in a position to allay any public disquiet.</P>

I understand that if the preparation of the electors lists for Dublin city were to be held up until the inspectors could call again to all households visited prior to that request it would not be possible to have the lists published on the date prescribed by statute, November 24th, and that it is not proposed to re-inspect these cases.  I am informed, however, that the Registration Officer has acted in accordance with the suggestion made in my Department's circular letter of 13th September last that the widest possible publicity should be given to the desirability of persons in the age-group concerned entering claims to be registered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>In view of the grave importance of this matter, will the Minister take steps to see that even subsequent to 24th November, those houses which were inspected prior to <Col N="1273" /> the direction from his Department will be directly notified, either by personal calls by inspectors or by notice, that while people in those households under 21 years of age might not be on the register as published, they have a right to have their names entered on it, because, as things stand, the likelihood is that they will not exercise the right?  In view of the fact that next year will probably be an election year, it is most important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say it was because I thought the matter was important that I took the steps which I took?  Those steps could not have been taken earlier in order to get in the Dublin city people, who are really the only people in trouble.  That difficulty was not of my making. Furthermore, I might say in regard to the register of electors and the preparation of lists, that it is a matter which comes within the province of the returning officer and the distance I can go to ensure that that course is taken is rather doubtful.  I have gone as far as I can go and if it will allay the Deputy's worries, I might also say that over the next few months every possible means of publicity will be brought to bear on this subject by me and by my Department and by any other agency we might employ.  The overall position is that we did what we could because we felt the matter is important.  We cannot compel the returning officer to do this, that or the other, but in the main the responsibility is his and the returning officers have co-operated fully with the request that was made.  We cannot hold them responsible for what was not done before the request was made and if the facts are gone into, as they will be later on in the House in relation to the electoral law, it will be seen that I cannot be held responsible, either.</P>

Even though the individuals have stated that the money was spent, that they had not got it, the local authority could not be satisfied that these statements were true and, therefore assess the rents on the basis that is is reasonable to expect <Col N="1278" /> that the tenants have some interest from an investment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>Land Commission records are not kept by reference to constituency areas. Apart from that, however, in the case of County Galway, Land Commission activities are heavily concentrated and involve numerous estates and holdings. Many of these properties are of very small acreage and include remnants of Congested Districts Board estates, lands surrendered by migrants and small residues of allotted estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that the extraction of the precise details requested would entail a disproportionate expenditure of staff time and labour which would not be warranted.  Moreover, as the position regarding lands on hands of the Land Commission is subject to constant fluctuation&mdash;<Col N="1288" /> depending on progress in intake and allotment&mdash;the extensive detailed information sought&mdash;even if staff were to be specially diverted to extract it&mdash; could well be out of date within a very short time.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, perhaps it would meet the Deputies' requirements to know that, in the entire of County Galway, the Land Commission have at present on hands, apart from substantial areas of mountain, turbary, etc., an aggregate area of some 3,800 acres of arable lands which is being utilised as a working pool for land settlement in the county.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to dispose of these lands with minimum delay.  In County Galway, during the last three complete financial years, the total area distributed by the Land Commission was 27,000 acres amongst 1,200 allottees.  The corresponding figures for the period since 1st January, 1960, are 6,660 acres divided amongst 424 allottees.</P>
    <P>If either Deputy is concerned about a particular estate and furnishes details thereof, I shall have the matter examined.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a <Col N="1291" /> Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions 51 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The Sub-Postmasters' Consultative Council was set up in 1956 to provide a means of regular consultation between representatives of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of the Sub-Postmasters' Union on matters affecting the remuneration and conditions of service of sub-postmasters. The remuneration of sub-postmasters has been fully discussed by the Council in recent years and substantial increases have been granted following agreements reached with the Union.</P>
      <P>Claims by the Union in regard to other conditions of Service are at present the subject of discussion at the Council.</P>
      <P>Sub-postmasters are contractors paid on the basis of volume of work done at their offices and they are not required to give personal service. Accordingly, it is not proposed to introduce arbitration for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the majority of sub-postmasters feel that they are not being adequately paid for their labour and also that the present system of meeting their views, as it was established by the Minister's late predecessor, gives them no option but to accept the Department's ruling?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Arbitration for sub-postmasters has been resisted since 1949, when the Union first made a claim, for the reasons I have stated. They do not come within the same category as the civil servants quoted. They are paid from £91 12s. 0d. a year to £1,649 a year according to the volume of work done.  The reasons for which arbitration for sub-postmasters was resisted in 1949 and 1956 are still <Col N="1292" /> considered valid and I cannot accede to the request made by the Deputy.</P>

I must say that there is no evidence that there is any dissatisfaction on their part.</P>

The records of my Department do not contain details of the sanitary arrangements in all national schools.  I am, therefore, not in a position to furnish the information requested by the Deputy.  I might mention, however, that in relation to all new schools and schemes of improvement of existing schools, it is the policy of the Department to have water-flushed sanitation installed wherever water can be obtained.  In furtherance of this policy water-flushed sanitation was installed in about 250 school buildings during the past two years.</P>

      <P>The returns furnished annually by the Managers of National Schools to the Department are not in such a form as would permit of the statistics requested by the Deputy being compiled.  Their compilation would involve the obtaining of special returns from all the schools in the country.  As this would entail the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time and work on the part of school Managers and the Officers of my Department, I am not satisfied that I would be warranted in arranging for the compilation of the statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, if it were generally agreed, as I think it would be, that classes of more than 25 pupils were evidence of overcrowding and inadequate staffing, is it not desirable that the Minister for Education should be informed of how widespread that practice was so that efforts might be concentrated on those areas to provide superior accommodation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister for Education is informed generally, and possibly even in a particular way, on this matter, but the statistics requested are not available. One reason given is that numbers on the rolls are classified by standards rather than by particular schoolrooms. <Col N="1300" /> Therefore, it would not be possible to get such figures accurately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about the existence of the problem, and very concrete steps have been taken and are being taken to remedy it&mdash;for example, the provision of additional school buildings and the making available of training facilities for additional teachers, male and female.  The problem is being attacked in a very determined way and with, I think, very good results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Without implying criticism of the Minister, perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;one sometimes forgets he is no longer Minister for Education&mdash;would direct the attention of his colleague to the fact that it seems to be desirable in the general interests of education that he should have present to his mind the schools in which the situation referred to in the Question has become chronic so that efforts to correct it by providing better accommodation and more teachers, if necessary, could be concentrated in those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy Dillon ought to know that if that word &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; were accepted, we would have about ten years' litigation in the courts as to the proper interpretation of the word.  I would ask him to let it go as it is.  There is no doubt that the elected representatives of any <Col N="1303" /> public body will not be frivolous in their requests for a compulsory order, that they will seek it for something that is stupid.  If, by chance, there happen to be a majority of stupid people on any local authority, surely the Minister is there to examine the proposal and either to agree or disagree with it?  Deputy Dillon might understand that this is a matter of great urgency.  Once this Bill passes this House and becomes an Act, we shall be able not only to give employment to many people who are unemployed but also to get on with this much-needed work for the efficiency and economy of our capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These arguments are irrelevant.  We are all agreed on what it is desired to express by this subsection. The Minister, I think, admits it when he proposes this amendment in the belief that the words &ldquo;halls, buildings and&rdquo; are governed by the word &ldquo;offices&rdquo;.  I put it to him, as set out in the amendment, that that is not so.  The subsection originally read:</P>
      <P>...would, if acquired by them, be suitable for the provision of offices for the local authority and...</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister, instead of the amendment he now proposes, to offer an amendment which would make that subsection read:</P>
      <P>...would, if acquired by them, be suitable for the provision of offices and halls or buildings ancillary thereto...</P>
      <P>or any words which will express clearly what the Minister says it is his intention to say.</P>
      <P>I can sympathise with a member of any public body who is anxious to press forward with a project.  Let us bear in mind that we are not legislating <i>ad hoc</i> for one project.  We are legislating to give a local authority what appear to be almost revolutionary powers of compulsory acquisition for certain public purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commonsense demands that if we are very materially to short-circuit the <Col N="1304" /> existing procedure for compulsory acquisition, we ought to be circumspect to see that we do not by inadvertence very widely extend the area in which the short-circuit procedure can be employed against property.  We have heard the view expressed by Deputy Dr. Browne that any public authority in this country ought to be allowed to acquire anything compulsorily. Let us be quite clear on this.  I dissent from that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all dissent from it.  That is why I say that the view expressed by Deputy Dr. Browne is the kind of view that precipitates ill-will, lack of co-operation and general civil <i>malaise</i> in town and country.  I think the purpose of this House should be to keep behind the idea of compulsory acquisition for proper objectives. That is why I urge on the Minister that he should turn this amendment around.</P>
      <P>Deputies have expressed incredulity that a local authority should seek to acquire land to build a dance hall.  One local authority in the country up to very recently was busily engaged doing that very thing&mdash;and acquiring it to build a dance hall in a town where already there were two commercial dance halls.  That is a matter which can largely be controlled by public opinion in the locality.  However, suppose you give a local authority power compulsorily to acquire somebody's land for so highly controversial a purpose, I think you are going far beyond what the generality of people will approve in the country.  I only mention that to rebut the view sustained by Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the bulk of us are substantially agreed on the limitations we would wish to retain on the power of a local authority compulsorily to acquire property.  I would urge on the Minister to meet us at least by saying that if we are apprehensive that the location of the word &ldquo;halls&rdquo; in the subsection as it is proposed to amend it by amendment No. 3 would widen the power more than any of us intend, then, between now and the Report <Col N="1305" /> Stage, he will look at this again and seek effectively to make the words &ldquo;halls and buildings&rdquo; be governed by the word &ldquo;offices&rdquo;.  If he does that, he will come a reasonable distance to meet us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before getting it or taking it, may I say that if this subsection were to read without the Deputy's proposed amendment, it would be:</P>
      <P>Where a local authority consider that any land, whether situate within or outside their functional area, would, if acquired by them, be suitable for the provision of halls, buildings and offices for the local authority...</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Halls, buildings and offices for the local authority&rdquo;: I want to make that quite clear.  The context is &ldquo;for the local authority&rdquo; in reference to all three words.  I want again to reiterate that my amendment does not give any new power to a local authority. No new power whatsoever is being given to a local authority, even though we may accept this amendment. The local authority already have powers of compulsory acquisition of land for halls, buildings and offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have compulsory powers for the acquisition of land for buildings, halls and offices.  All the amendment seeks is that the procedure in compulsorily acquiring land for any or all of these purposes should be changed.  The power to acquire compulsorily is already vested in the local authorities.  That is the real point.  It is merely a question of the procedure rather than the content.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says this power has been enshrined in previous legislation, albeit the procedure was somewhat different, has there been any <Col N="1306" /> judicial interpretation of these words? The Minister said earlier that he interpreted this subsection as amended to mean that the words &ldquo;halls and buildings&rdquo; are governed by &ldquo;offices&rdquo; and that they could be read only as meaning halls and buildings which were an integral part of offices.  If that is so, is there any decision to that effect founded on existing legislation?</P>

    <P>This amendment brings in Section 36 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, to get over the position that would obtain if that section were not included.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (6) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) (a) Where &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> (i)  an order is made by virtue of this section, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  there is a public right of way over the land to which the order relates or any part thereof,</P>
    <P>the order may authorise the local authority, by order made by them after they have acquired such land or part, to extinguish the right of way.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  an order made by virtue of this section authorises the extinguishment of a public right of way, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  apart from this paragraph, it would not be obligatory on the Minister to cause a public local inquiry to be held pursuant to Part I of the Second Schedule to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931,</P>
    <P>it shall be obligatory on the Minister to cause the inquiry to be held save where he thinks fit not to confirm the order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that an order cannot be made authorising a local authority to extinguish a public right of way, unless an inquiry has been held.  It also provides that a right of way may not be extinguished by a compulsory purchase order.  It can be extinguished only by a subsequent order, after the land has been acquired.</P>

Up to now, it required an Act of Parliament to extinguish a public right of way.  After the passage of this Bill, that can be done by order.  I should be grateful to the Minister if he would tell us why it is deemed desirable to depart from the existing practice, which is hallowed by long observance, in this relatively casual way?  I seem to remember an Act that was passed through this House within the past few years; I cannot remember absolutely now but it was a case in which some public body, some hospital, some board of governors, had to get an Act passed in order to extinguish a public right of way over land upon which they had been authorised to build.</P>

      <P>It should not pass through this House without the attention of the House being directed to it. This whole principle of compulsory acquisition was first accepted by this Parliament and its predecessors in order to enable local authorities to meet and overcome urgent social problems.  It was felt that where there was an acute shortage of housing, or where there was some urgent public needs which an unsympathetic proprietor of land might avail of to force up the price of his land, on the ground that the community could not afford to do without the amenity which they proposed to erect on it and would pay a fancy price, it would be better to decide that local authorities would have the right compulsorily to acquire that land and subsequently refer the question of fair compensation to an independent arbitrator. That is a principle which it took a long time to persuade the majority of people in many parts of the world to accept, but now it has been generally accepted.</P>
      <P>What I see in this Bill, particularly with reference to Section 10, is a general inclination to slither away from what I regard as the fundamental principle upon which all this compulsory acquisition legislation is built, and that is that there should be some urgent public need before the local authority or anybody else is authorised by Oireachtas Éireann to have recourse to compulsory powers of that kind. As the Minister now points out, we consented in 1931 to the extinguishment of public rights of way for a very restricted purpose, for the housing of the working classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> Deputies resident in cities will not be familiar with this, but I think the Minister himself ought to know what I am about to refer to now.  He knows the importance that attaches to a Mass path, which is what a public right of way is commonly described as in rural Ireland, and everybody knows the trouble that occurs when somebody tries to close one.  I have lived most of my life among neighbours who have known Mass paths that they never use, but the moment somebody places a few strands of barbed wire across one of these paths, the whole parish will travel quite a long distance to go over that Mass path. I remember myself cutting a wire that was put across a Mass path and I would do it again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was put across a public right of way, and I took particular care to travel that right of way until I was satisfied the person who wanted to sequester it unlawfully had abandoned his intention.  Most people in rural Ireland know the importance that attaches to such rights of way but, if it is demonstrated to them that it is necessary to extinguish a public right of way for a public purpose, they will consent, but they will not consent willingly to the casual extinction of what is here described correctly as a public right of way but in the country is ordinarily described as a Mass path.</P>
      <P>There are other public rights of way in addition to Mass paths, but I suppose 70 per cent. of the people living in rural Ireland know all about Mass paths, and I recoil from a wide extension of the purposes for which a local authority may, by order, extinguish such rights of way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am obliged to confess I much prefer the amendment now submitted by the Minister to the subsection as originally proposed by him and which I had marked for discussion here but, even at that, I think a word of caution is necessary, though I think I can see that, inasmuch as the Minister binds himself to holding a public inquiry in any case where he contemplates consenting to the extinguishment of a <Col N="1312" /> public right of way, he has come some way to meet us, and that the only case in which he does not impose upon himself the obligation of holding a public inquiry is where he has decided to reject an application to extinguish a public right of way. Therefore, I assume I can take it that no public right of way will be extinguished under this subsection without a proper public inquiry being held&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When we got this Bill in the City Council it was on advice from our law agent that I raised the point first.  I held the very view Deputy Dillon has been expressing and I stated, as quoted in Volume 184, No. 3, Column 443 of the <i>Official Report:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>We feel that is giving a local authority too much power.  We feel that such authorisation should only be given with the right of appeal to the Minister for Local Government by any person affected by our attempt to extinguish the public rights.  We feel that there might be some little safeguards included in this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested there should be an amendment introduced to give the very type of protection about which Deputy Dillon has been talking and the Minister has brought in a very severe safeguard because, if there is to be an acquisition of land on which there will be a closing of a right of way, then the Minister can say: &ldquo;You cannot close it.&rdquo;  That ends the <Col N="1313" /> matter but, if he is going to sanction the closing, he is inserting in the Bill a provision for the holding of a public inquiry before such closing takes place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon introduced many matters in relation to private dwellings but we are dealing with a local authority that wants to make progress and carry through development in the public interest.  It is not a question of acquiring something for private gain.  It is a question of a local authority, acting in the best interests of the community, acquiring a little piece of ground on which there may be a right of way, and it must extinguish the right of way to provide for the benefit of the community.  I remember when there used to be a right of way from Kildare Street to Merrion Square and I do not remember an Act of Parliament being introduced to close that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with legislation to empower a local authority to operate in the public welfare for the improvement of our city.  The local authority itself requested the Minister to take steps in his proposed legislation to control us so that we could not go mad about the thing and that we would have to have regard to private rights.  We shall probably have to exercise this section in connection with our town planning in the development of new roads in time to come. <Col N="1314" /> I do not know whether Deputy Dillon or I will be spared by Providence to witness some very good improvements in the creation of new throughways in our city.  Nevertheless, we are taking steps now to plan ways and means.  We shall have to knock down houses, extinguish rights of way, and so on, in order to get these amenities.  I do not know if Deputy Dillon was looking to see to what extent that applied in this legislation, but the principle is the same.</P>

      <P>This section is one to which I certainly take some exception.  As was pointed out in the earlier discussions on the two amendments proposed by the Minister, under this section, very wide powers of compulsory acquisition are being given to the local authority.  Deputy Briscoe feels such powers are necessary and should be given.  The House should appreciate what is involved in this section.  We have always, as a Party, been conscious of the need to give very sweeping powers to local authorities where there is a strong social or community need.  Accordingly, in the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, carried through from the days of the British Parliament to our Parliament here, there has been laid down a provision whereby if property is required for housing purposes, the local authorities desiring such property may acquire compulsorily, subject to Ministerial sanction.  That has meant that when they exercise their powers in that regard, the courts cannot be consulted and cannot interfere, and once a compulsory order under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts is made and there is an objection, then the Minister may order a local inquiry but on the Minister's approval of the compulsory order, it becomes final and complete.</P>
      <P>That has been tolerated because of the social need to provide for the housing of the poorer sections of the community and to meet the endemic housing problem that has faced this State over the past 40 years.  Here there is an extension.  We are giving now to all local authorities a similar power to acquire any land or any property for any purpose they think fit.  That appears to be what is involved in this section.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Where a local authority intend to acquire compulsorily any land for purposes outside the purposes of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the local authority consider it convenient to effect acquisition through those Acts, they may decide to do so.  I should like Deputies to appreciate what is involved in this.  It is not merely to deal with the problem facing Dublin Corporation.  That could have been dealt with by special legislation giving special powers to Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It could have been.  It has been done frequently in the past and the precedent is there. Possibly because of some office accommodation problem in Dublin, here is a section of general application introduced into this legislation.  Under this general section henceforth, if passed, any local authority in Ireland, provided they consider it convenient to do so, may decide to acquire any property for any purpose they think proper.  If they get Ministerial sanction, then the process of compulsory acquisition proceeds.</P>
      <P>I think this is going far too far.  As far as I know at the moment, it is unnecessary; and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's defence of the section.  If it appears that the section is thought necessary because of a particular problem facing a local authority, or even a number of local authorities, it is possible to give them that power in relation to their problem, but it should not be done in the way proposed in this section&mdash;to give a general power to all local authorities to acquire anything for any purpose. Once that power is passed, it will be used.  Let us make no mistake about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this section becomes law, every local authority will find it more convenient to acquire compulsorily under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, although the purpose of the acquisition has nothing to do with <Col N="1317" /> housing.  It will be quite simple: the local authority's compulsorily acquisition order will be confirmed by the Minister.  The only sanction against confirmation will be the usual local inquiry which generally will have reality only in relation to compensation but the convenience to local authorities of this power will be so obvious that it will be used.</P>
    <P>I know that often in legislation of this kind, we, as Deputies, in our different spheres of interest forget the fact that we are sent here not as representatives of local authorities but as representing a quota of ordinary individuals in our constituencies and it should be our duty to be an guard against the growth of bureaucracy. This is another example of the manner in which bureaucracy is creeping into our legislation.  It is more convenient from a bureaucratic point of view to provide a simple means of acquisition by local authorities.  The convenience is obvious and because, it seems to me, there is a particular problem facing some local authorities the solution from the bureaucratic point of view is to use that problem as an excuse for giving a power never before given, to all local authorities in the State.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is justified and I urge the Minister not to press this section on the House.  It should be possible, on reconsideration, to deal with any particular problems that face local authorities by <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, but I certainly would regard with some anxiety a power being given to all local authorities which excludes any review or examination by the courts which are envisaged under the Constitution, which deprives the person affected of any appeal.  I think that is wrong unless there are some urgent social reasons for it.</P>
    <P>I can see that there could be such a case.  This Parliament recognised it in the past in regard to housing: I cannot see that there would be such a case in regard to other matters such as acquisition for road purposes or provision of extra office accommodation for the local authority.  These things do not appear to me to have the urgent social need that housing has. Accordingly, I feel that this section is <Col N="1318" /> far too drastic and cannot be justified on any general ground.  It may be justified in particular instances, but, if so, particular <i>ad hoc</i> legislation is the solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I reiterate that no new power is conferred on local authorities under this Bill, whether as it was or as it is now proposed to amend it?  Might I refer the Deputy to Section 10 (1) (a) which says:</P>
      <P>Where</P>
      <P>(a)  a local authority intend to acquire compulsorily any land, whether situate within or outside their functional area, for purposes for which they are capable of being authorised by law to acquire land compulsorily&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is the really significant part of the measure which I think must have escaped the Deputy in his approach to the matter.  No new power of compulsion or compulsory acquisition is being conferred on local authorities. Listening to the Deputy, I felt for a moment that it was a plug for C.I.E., the theme being that any local authority may acquire land anywhere for anything at any time.  Nothing could be further from the truth, even though it was possible to conceive that local authorities would behave in such a manner.</P>
      <P>Let me refer to another point that was raised that all these things can be done anywhere by any local authority and that there was no right of appeal by anybody against any such proposals.  It is well to note that there are appeals and appeal procedures against all compulsory purchase orders, no matter under what guise they are made.  That appeal is in the last instance by review of the High Court after the confirmation of any such order by the Minister.  This facility may be availed of within three weeks of publication of the notice of confirmation.</P>

I am saying that is not so and that no additional or new powers are being conferred on local authorities and that that is clearly and without question stated in Section 10 (1) (a) of the Bill as it is now before the House.  Finally, all compulsory purchase orders can be reviewed by the High Court, subject to the appeal being brought to notice within three weeks after the confirmation of the order by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept in the slightest what the Minister says. There are new powers given by the section and they are sweeping, new powers.  At the moment, a local authority may exercise acquisition powers for housing, road-widening or as a sanitary authority or as a health authority but in relation to the purpose for which it is exercised, there are different procedures entailed.  So far as acquisition for housing purposes is concerned, it is the simplest acquisition power open to a local authority because the individual affected&mdash;and I want the Minister to consider what I am saying&mdash;has only his right to object at a local inquiry ordered by the Minister, under the provisions of the 1931 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> The individual <i>qua</i> individual in relation to his own plot of ground has no other remedy.  If he wishes, he can challenge the entire scheme in the High Court, as was done not so long ago, but the individual generally is interested only in his own property that is affected.  He is not concerned with the local authority's wide scheme and whether the scheme as such is desirable or not.  In fact, therefore, there is no effective remedy open to the individual through the courts.  This section as it affects the individual will be applied to the acquisition by local authorities of any property and, as I said, for any purpose.  The Minister said &ldquo;for the purposes for which local authorities are capable of being authorised by law to acquire.&rdquo;  Local authorities can be authorised by law here to acquire land for a variety of purposes.  They have wide powers at the moment and it is possible to give them extra powers, and under this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Surely that is going too far.</P>
      <P>The Minister says this is not giving them any powers they have not got already.  That is special pleading, may I say, with respect to the Minister. It is giving them powers they have not at the moment because it is giving them the right to acquire land without the individual being in a position to do much about it.

      <P>I understand Deputy Briscoe's problem and I understand the Dublin situation but this is a section which will be welcomed by those who seek to have the power to do things neatly and finally by simply writing a signature on a piece of paper. Of course it is neat, conclusive and final, but I do not think it is right. We should not be invited to wear blinkers, as the Minister suggests we should, and act as though we are not doing anything extraordinary.  We are.  We are extending very widely the powers of compulsory acquisition at present exercisable by local authorities and I object to the section.  I am not satisfied by anything the Minister has said that this section is justified and it is not right that the Minister should try to fob off the objection I have made by suggesting that these powers are already there.  They are not there. These rights are entirely new and I am not satisfied they are justified.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to Deputy O'Higgins that he should look at this matter from another angle. The local Authority acts in the interests of the community which it serves, and the local authority would never have <Col N="1322" /> need to request legislation even under the Housing Acts if they in the development of their housing policy to provide houses for the people who need them, did not meet people who wanted money, the money being regulated in their minds in accordance with the need; the greater the need the greater their demands.  There has to be protection of the community against this type of person.</P>
      <P>We may go ahead to acquire a certain amount of property for a very important scheme and we may find within a small part of that area one or two people who will hold the whole city up to ransom if the local authority has no means by which a reasonable arrangement can be brought about. Remember, this is not appropriation without compensation.  There are reasonable ways and a variety of ways of fixing compensation and we always find in our local authority that whatever we want to acquire has a very high price because the Dublin Corporation is a very wealthy body.  The whole community are shareholders in it.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Corporation&mdash;and I am sure the same applies to other local authorities, although I am surprised to hear certain references to them &mdash; is not a private institution for profit making, the directors and shareholders being the local representatives.  These are people who take their work seriously.  Deputy O'Higgins in a very subtle way suggested that members of this House had an allegiance and a responsibility to the citizens of the area that sent them here as distinct from their allegiance to the local authority.  There are members of this House who belong to both, who were sent to both, and we should, by virtue of being representatives of a local authority be better informed as to the need and the general welfare of the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin and I belong to different political Parties.  We have different views on many things.  We are both members of the Dublin Corporation and we invariably agree on matters which concern the city of Dublin.  It has nothing to do with his politics or mine but concerns the <Col N="1323" /> welfare and the wellbeing of our people.  There is too much&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is too much importance attached to the rights of private property without any regard to the duties of the owners of this private property.  A row was kicked up in regard to a business which could hold up the whole community under the present law, because we are now finding ways and means of dealing with the person involved.  We had laws in this country at one time where leases under Queen Elizabeth forbade under penalties Deputy O'Higgins or myself to improve whatever little plot of land we might have.  Today we have legislation which says that if I have a piece of property I can still go to court and get consent, if it is unreasonably withheld by my landlord, for the development of my property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We are still <Col N="1324" /> sticking to tags of that old system when we oppose legislation of this kind which is giving the representatives of a community certain ways and means of defending the rights of the citizens against rapacious property owners.</P>
      <P>When there is power given to the local authority through the elected representatives of the national Parliament, in the persons of the Minister for Local Government and the Government, as such, to see that there is fair play and that rights under our Constitution are guaranteed, people should not come in here not knowing the details of problems and concern themselves only with an inadequate approach to the modern development of society.</P>

      <P>I find myself having to examine this section to see whether it is necessary for the public good.  We represent the public good here and many of us have experience over many years of deliberate attempts by people who own property to obstruct the application of social legislation approved and passed by this House.</P>
