      <P>The statement referred to in the Question may be taken as giving a general indication of Government policy.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the tenor of the statement would give the impression that we are no longer one of the uncommitted blocs of the United Nations? Further, would he not agree that the reason for our present position and prestige in the United Nations Organi-sation is the fact that we have remained uncommitted to either the U.S.S.R. or the U.S.A.?</P>

It necessitates, however, fundamental changes in the sketch proposals which had been prepared and this aspect of the matter is at present being considered <Col N="917" /> in my Department.  Discussions will be held with the local authority in the early future with a view to determining the extent to which the original proposals can be scaled down.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the present system of valuation of buildings is materially retarding reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in some cases there have been valuation increases of the order indicated by the Deputy. Obviously this must happen if a nil or token valuation is replaced by one of say £50 or £100, according to scale of reconstruction or additions carried out. Increases, then, can and must occur where the net annual letting value of the premises is estimated to have been increased by the same degree, or where the previous valuation has been inadequate by reference to the net annual value of the premises as it stood prior to reconstruction, as often happens where such valuations have not been referred to the Commissioner of Valuation for revision at the proper time.</P>
      <P>Under the Valuation Acts relativity between valuations, especially as between those on old and new premises, can be attained only by local authorities including all out-of-date valuations in the Complete Lists of Hereditaments requiring Revision of Valuations which they submit annually, under statute, to the Commissioner of Valuation.  Rate collectors have the duty, and ratepayers the right, to submit to the secretaries of their rating authorities lists of the hereditaments in their respective districts which in their opinion require revision, and such lists are incorporated in the complete Lists submitted to the Commissioner; it is up to the rating authorities to require their collectors to seek out and report all cases that appear to need revision.</P>
      <P>The valuation of any premises made or revised under the Valuation Acts must be based on an estimate of the net annual value of the premises in its actual state.  I regard that as a fair system, and I would not favour the introduction of legislation to alter it The change proposed in the Deputy's Question would operate unfairly in favour of occupiers whose present inadequate valuations are out-of-date by reason of the omission of the local authorities to submit them for revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also remind the Deputy that increases in valuation of premises reconstructed <Col N="919" /> or added to are cushioned in favour of the occupiers by the generous temporary valuation or rating concessions given under the relevant statutes.</P>

      <P>On the grounds of efficiency, it is desirable that there should be some normal upper age-limit for recruitment by Government Departments through employment exchanges.  This applies even to casual employment as such employment may lead to regular and continuous employment.</P>
      <P>The age of 50 has been prescribed as the normal upper limit because only a person under 50 on initial recruitment could, by the time he reached the statutory retiring age of 65, have the minimum of 15 years' continuous unestablished service necessary under existing legislation to qualify for a gratuity on retirement.  Legislation is in contemplation which will reduce this qualifying period of 15 years and in connection with such legislation I propose to modify the 50 year age limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers (for the Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not available in the form specified in the question.</P>
      <P>The Commission have conducted formal Public Enquiries in relation to the supply and distribution of six groups of commodities and have made Fair Trading Rules in relation to twenty-one other groups.  The Commission's action in these cases was taken as a result of allegations of unfair trading practices or because the Commission felt that investigation was desirable.  The number of commodities dealt with at the Enquiries or in the Rules is well over one hundred and accounts for a high proportion of the total volume of transportable goods.</P>
      <P>The Reports of the Enquiries and the Rules have been published and, in addition, the Reports of the Enquiries have been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Commission also investigate complaints of restrictive trade practices without holding Public Enquiries or making Fair Trading Rules.  It is not possible to give the total number of such cases but the Annual Reports of the Commission, which are published and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, give particulars of the more noteworthy allegations of unfair trading investigated by them and the outcome of these investigations.</P>

      <P>The Fair Trade Commission conducted an investigation into the supply and distribution of proprietary and patent medicines, infant goods and medical and toilet preparations, and a report furnished by them was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in July, 1957.  It is, of course, open to any person to make <Col N="933" /> representations to the Fair Trade Commission about the operation of any trade practices that have come to light in the meantime and are alleged to be unfair or contrary to the public interest.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question relates to a statement made by me on the 10th October, 1960, that thirty-five factories were in course of construction on the 30th June, 1960. I am advised that, of the thirty-five projects, fourteen have commenced production in the period since the 30th June, 1960.  The names, locations and products or processes of the fourteen firms concerned are given in a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.  I am not free to give similar particulars in respect of the remaining cases as industrial proposals are treated by me as confidential until the stage is reached at which production commences.  It is for the promoters to decide whether to publish information about their proposals in advance of that stage.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to give individual employment figures in respect of private commercial firms.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>FACTORIES under construction on 30th June, 1960 which have come to notice as having commenced production since that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to.  Owing to the implementation of C.I.E.'s reorganisation programme there have been abnormal arisings of railway materials and special facilities have been granted to the Company for the export of that portion of the material which is reusable.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cargo of rails in question, the tonnage was 1,400 tons and the destination was Italy.  It would not be proper to divulge the name of the purchaser or the price paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The licence was granted after the position of those firms in this country who use scrap had been considered.  C.I.E. had provided Irish Steel Holdings, for example, with a very large amount of scrap.  It may be taken that export licence was granted under proper conditions.</P>

As regards the second part of the question, there is nothing to prevent a local authority, in collaboration with their rate collectors, from devising a scheme for the payment of rates by instalments.  Since, however, some doubt still appears to exist as to the power of local authorities to operate such schemes, I am arranging to have a circular letter issued to all rating authorities drawing their attention to the powers provided by Article 73 of the Public Bodies Order, 1946, and suggesting that consideration might be given to the formulation of schemes for the payment of rates by instalments which could be introduced in relation to the financial year commencing on 1st April next and future years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say that purchases by non-nationals who have been registered in the State for three years prior to October, 1947, are outside this duty, but in fact the Land Commission must know of purchases by companies of any land that is subject to an annuity.  This, in my view, covers at least 90 per cent. of agricultural land, and I do not think the purpose the Deputy contemplates to serve would be helped.  May I say that there is no great use in having <i>post factum</i> information on this issue? What would be required is power by legislation to restrict the free sale of land in future instances.</P>

      <P>Under the Rules and Regulations for National Schools the local manager is charged with the direct government of each particular school.  Certain minimum requirements in the matter of the duration of the school day are laid down by Departmental regulations. These regulations provide:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that the school shall be opened for the reception of pupils not later than 9.30 a.m.;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  that the school day may, comprise either one or two meetings <Col N="951" /> with a minimum of four hours of secular instruction in either case (reduced to three hours in the case of certain infant standards), and</P>
    <P>(c)  that formal instruction shall commence not later than 9.50 a.m. in a school in which there is only one meeting daily and not later than 9.40 a.m. at the morning meeting and at 2 p.m. at the afternoon meeting in a school in which there are two meetings daily.</P>

      <P>Under the Rules and Regulations for National Schools, it is the duty of the manager of every school to ensure that the school is adequately heated and that the out-offices are regularly cleansed and generally maintained in a sanitary condition.  To enable managers to carry out this responsibility, an annual <Col N="952" /> grant is provided by my Department to supplement the amounts provided from local sources towards the cost of heating and cleaning national schools and the cleansing of the toilet accommodation.</P>
      <P>I might add for the Deputy's information that these grants were increased in 1956 and again in 1959.</P>

      <P>In regard to national schools, while it may be that in some schools the children are encouraged to wear special school uniforms, I am not aware that it is the practice in any national school to compel pupils to wear them.  Such practice would be contrary to the official regulations for national schools. If any case of compulsion to wear uniforms in a national school is reported to me, I will have the matter investigated.</P>
      <P>Secondary schools are private institutions and questions connected with fees, uniforms, etc. are matters between the conductors of the schools and the parents of the children concerned.  I have no function in relation to them.</P>

      <P>May I make it quite clear that I already agreed that the Property Values (Arbitrations and Appeals) Bill, 1960, would be taken?  I am bound by my agreement unless the Minister for Finance is prepared to drop it.  Since then, I have received representations from an influential body of people who say they wish to consider this Bill more fully before it goes through.  The kernel of the whole Bill for the Minister would be Section 6.  So long as it is clear that there is no pending action which we are trying to stop under Section 6, I would be prepared to agree, when it comes on, that Section 6 would be supported by us as well and that nobody could bring any new action as from now until after the Recess.

    <Title>Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the House adjourned last week I was dealing with the implication of Section 2 (2) (c).  This is the most important part of the measure.  I should like Deputies to hear my interpretation of what powers the Government are likely to have if this provision is allowed to remain in the Bill.  The paragraph in question reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contingent is intended to replace, in whole or in part, or reinforce a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force serving outside the State as part of that International <Col N="956" /> United Nations Force and consisting of more than twelve members of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to embody permanent legislation.  If it is enacted in its present form, the Government may at any time&mdash;if there is a demand for our troops to take part in any United Nations affair&mdash;come to this House and have a Resolution passed empowering them to despatch 12 members of the Defence Forces.  They must first come to the House for the Resolution to get 12 members of the Defence Forces but if, the following week, the Government want to reinforce that number by 1,000 men they will be entitled to do so without coming to this House.  They are further entitled, without coming near this House, to leave that Force abroad for any period they wish or feel that Force is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have been misled by the subsection when they read it or heard the Taoiseach's opening statement as reported at Column 775 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 7th December, 1960.  He said:</P>
    <P>I indicated that it was proposed to ask the Oireachtas to pass a permanent Bill with a clause requiring approval of the Dáil by resolution before it could be given effect in any specific instance.  The Bill before us is of this character.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not of this character.  It will entitle the Government, once the Resolution is passed, to send any number of troops they like to the Congo.  If the Bill is enacted in its present form the Government will be entitled to send any number they like to reinforce the existing numbers in the Congo.  Next January, they may send 600 men, if they wish.  In March, they may send another 600 men, if they wish.  In May, they may send the rest of the Army, if they wish, but they need not come back at any stage to this House to seek authority on any of those occasions.  That is a most serious situation to allow.  Paragraph (c) which I mentioned makes nonsense of the statement by the Taoiseach that a resolution of this <Col N="957" /> House would be necessary whenever a decision was being taken to send forces abroad.</P>
    <P>This House, is entitled to have a discussion on the merits or otherwise of sending troops abroad.  If this measure passes into law, it will mean that next June if the Government decide to replace a battalion in the Congo with another battalion, this House will not be asked to comment on or approve of their action.  The country will not know anything about it, except that the Government have made a decision.  We shall have allowed the matter to have passed from our hands by this legislation.  I shall make it quite clear that Deputy Dr. Browne and I are opposing paragraph (c) of subsection (2).  We believe it is not the wish of this House or of the country that the Government should have the power on any occasion they wish to send any number of our troops abroad without consulting this House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his opening remarks also referred to the position with regard to length of service and as reported at column 780, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It will be understood, however, that, as in the case of the first contingent, the period during which the new battalion will be available in the Congo will not exceed six months.</P>
    <P>I do not know where in this Bill there is anything in writing to say that the service of any contingent abroad will be not more than six months, or three months, or 12 months.  It is not in the Bill.  Prior to its becoming legislation a period should be fixed and prior to that period elapsing, the House would then have an opportunity of discussing the situation and of saying whether, in our opinion, further contingents should be sent to a particular locality.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to our manpower in the Congo.  Two battalions have been sent and I think the combined strength of the units is over 1,200 men.  Our normal peace-time Army is supposed to be in the region of 12,000 men and at no time in the <Col N="958" /> past 15 years, have we had what we had hoped to have&mdash;a normal peace-time Army of 12,000.  The Army has always been around 8,000 to 9,000 in number and we have over 1,200 men out of that small Army in the Congo. It is estimated in military terms that to keep one soldier in the field at least seven other men are required.  Out of our entire Army, we have not at any time more than what I would call one full strength battalion, with all the necessary attachments in the line of cavalry and artillery units and so forth.  That is all we could afford to put into the field and the rest of the troops would be in the back lines engaged in various other duties.</P>
    <P>We should consider very seriously whether we are straining our resources here at home and whether we are being fair to the units which are being left at home, if we decide to send a certain number abroad.  I think we should not set out to compete with nations who have Armies 10, 15 and 20 times the size of our Army.  Let me say that on a percentage basis, we have contributed more troops than any other nation to the Congo.  On a percentage basis, not perhaps in actual numbers, of our total Defence Forces, we have made a bigger contribution than any other nation.  That is a point that should be considered not alone in regard to that aspect but in regard to the welfare and the conditions of our troops at home.  That should be taken into consideration as well.</P>
    <P>There is another point I wish to make.  I do not know if it has been thought about or discussed very much here, but I may tell the Minister for Defence that I discussed it with a number of Army officers.  Perhaps I am lucky enough to be in closer touch with men who would be on the active end of the picture than the Minister. It is on that basis that I propose to make these remarks.  What I have to say is in no way intended as criticism of our troops, but it is a well-known fact that our troops have no training whatever in bush or jungle warfare and even as far as police work is concerned.  While it could be argued, and fairly argued, that there was no time to give the first contingent <Col N="959" /> a reasonable period of training in relation to conditions existing in the Congo, there was no excuse whatever over the past six months for not giving proper advice or training to what may be replacements in the Congo.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me that the advice of some specialists who have experienced such conditions in other Armies should have been sought and, if necessary, they should have been brought here to give the full benefit of their advice to our young men who might be going abroad.  It is a well-known fact that the type of training given in our Army is related to completely different conditions from those which the men were likely to encounter.  There is no question about that.  Any Deputy who has been a member of the Defence Forces knows that that is true.  That is not a criticism of the Army, but it is meant to be criticism of responsible authorities who have not taken the necessary steps to give the proper advice and training in preparation for any decision to send troops abroad.  It is even alleged abroad that the Supreme Commander of the United Nations Forces is completely unfamiliar with the conditions likely to be met in the Congo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that arise on the Bill before the House at the moment? It appears to me to be a criticism of the operations going on at present, rather than a criticism of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see what is disturbing &ldquo;General&rdquo; Booth.  I want to make it quite clear that I have information direct from the Congo about the lack of training and lack of organisation that has obtained with regard to our troops.  It is beyond dispute that small contingents of our troops have been sent out for periods of 10 days on patrol.  It is unknown in any Army for those patrols&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The question of volunteering arises under Section 3 of the Bill.  I do not think the members of the Defence Forces themselves are satisfied with the volunteering arrangements. Some officers volunteered for duty in the Congo in the past because they felt it was their duty to do so and the same applied to the soldiers, but I know for a fact that a number of officers volunteered because they felt that, apart from feeling it to be their duty, if they did not do so, it could possibly have a reaction afterwards on their promotion prospects in the Army at home.  I know that very little discretion was used in some instances in the selection of some of the officers.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has time to have another look at paragraph (b) of Section 3, he might agree to an amendment. The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Permanent Defence Force (not being a member of the Permanent Defence Force specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection) has offered in writing, whether before or on or after the date of the passing of this Act, to render himself liable for external service during a specified period...</P>
      <P>What has happened up to the moment with regard to volunteering should not be taken into consideration when this Bill becomes law.  It is only when the measure becomes law that the question of volunteering in writing should be considered.  I know there is a difficulty with regard to the fact that a number of men in the Army did not at any time contemplate that they would have to do active service abroad and I am sure members of the House did not contemplate it, either.  On that basis, it would be unfair to enact legislation which would mean that these individuals could be ordered on active service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> What I want to get at is this: if a number of individuals volunteered in writing some months ago for duty in the Congo, nothing should be embodied in legislation to hold them to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows what we have in mind and I would like him to elaborate on it, because, if it will affect only those who volunteer from now on, I cannot see any point in embodying in legislation: &ldquo;... <Col N="963" /> whether before or on or after the date of the passing of this Act ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to say &mdash; and this goes back to what the Taoiseach said in his opening remarks &mdash; that we are all, in this House and in the country, very proud to be able to play our part in the work of the United Nations.  We are all very anxious to ensure that the high standing and good name that Ireland has amongst the newly-emerged African and Asian nations is maintained and not besmirched, and that we do not assist or condone the colonialism which is rampant in the Congo.  So far as those African nations are concerned, our history is one of oppression and partition, and we must not, in any circumstances, allow our troops to be used for the purpose of bolstering up partition in any of these countries.</P>
      <P>My words have reference to the Congo situation and particularly to the position in the province of Katanga.  I should like to make it clear that our troops and our officers who are stationed in Albertville, in Katanga, are perturbed at the moment. Recently, at least one very intelligent young soldier wrote home to the effect that the Belgians were trying to hold on to everything they had, copper mines, big business, etc.  The letter goes on to say: &ldquo;They are trying to make a Six Counties here and they brought in a gang of adventurers to train the Katanga army.&rdquo; That is from an intelligent young soldier stationed in Katanga.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Defence states that our duties in Katanga are police duties, I want him to understand that police duties in the Congo as far as the Irish are concerned are not to be those of aiding and abetting what I can only describe as the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Specials of the Congo under the control of a breakaway Premier, Tshombe.  The Taoiseach has to bear all this in mind when making his final request with regard to sending another battalion to this Province of Katanga. It is beyond dispute now that the province of Katanga is looked upon as the Six Counties of the Congo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the necessity for that motion, there is another motion of censure of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to be dealt with. The Taoiseach last week pointed out that the Government have at least decided to make an appreciation of the situation in the Congo.  We are all glad he has changed his mind with regard to his attitude for the past six months.  He said it was not the Government's function to make any appreciation.  He has now decided it is the Government's duty to make an appreciation.  There are certain circumstances which he says must be fulfilled if the Government intend to despatch replacements or a further contingent to the Congo.  The first is that, in the judgment of the Government, the situation there required the continued presence of a United Nations force and of European contingents in that force.  The only comment I have to make on that is that the conciliation commission which was set up recommended that non-white forces should be used in the Congo. That advice comes from people who are far more familiar than the Taoiseach, I or anybody else in this country with the conditions and with the history of the African peoples.  I think their advice will possibly weigh heavily with the Security Council when they meet in the near future.</P>
      <P>The second point the Taoiseach mentioned was that the objective of a United Nations force in the Congo would still be as it was when the first contingent was dispatched, that of helping to keep peace and order in the Congo, while the Congolese people and leaders are getting themselves organised and able to carry that obligation themselves without United Nations help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the United Nations took the decision to go into the Congo, they <Col N="966" /> did so on the invitation of the democratically-elected Government of the Congo.  They were invited in by the Premier and President of that country. This was the indication given by the Security Council of the powers and the orders which should be carried out by the United Nations contingent.  The Security Council authorised the Secretary-General to take the necessary steps in consultation with the Congolese Government to provide the Government with such military assistance as might be necessary until, through the efforts of the Congolese Government, with the technical assistance of the United Nations, the national security forces might be able in the opinion of the Government fully to meet their task.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The necessary steps&rdquo; constitute the important part of that directive and the necessary steps, as we know, were not taken by the United Nations forces at the time when they first went into the Congo.  Therefore, the conditions and the reasons why we sent our troops no longer obtain in the Congo, and until such time as there is a change of attitude with regard to what the United Nations Forces should do, I think we should mark time in view of the danger again of the force being misused.</P>
    <P>The position has arisen that a number of other countries have indicated they are not satisfied that the original objectives of the United Nations in the Congo are being pursued. We may not agree with all the views of these nations but I think we should give considerable thought to the advice of Mr. Nehru who, on a number of occasions, made it quite clear that the United Nations in the Congo have departed from their original objective.  It may be that India and the other countries involved may decide in the very near future to withdraw their troops.</P>

      <P>It is beyond dispute now that the situation has changed completely since last July as far as the objectives of U.N.O. in the Congo are concerned.  The danger now is that, if there is a complete withdrawal of U.N. Forces, the gap will be filled by people who are not a bit interested in the Congolese.  Clearly what the Belgians would like to see is the U.N. Forces withdrawing completely thereby allowing them to take control, not alone of Katanga but of the rest of the country.  I am sure that fact will be borne in mind by the Government.</P>
      <P>Ireland has played her part and given of her best.  Before there is any question of further contingents, or replacements, the Government should satisfy themselves completely that the original intention of the U.N. Forces is pursued, namely, that democratic government is restored in the Congo. that the Parliament of the Congo is summoned and allowed to take control, that the breakaway province of Katanga is forced to recognise that it is part and parcel of the Congo.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is not a prophet.  I am asking the Taoiseach to remember the circumstances in which our troops were sent into the Congo.  I am asking him to make sure, if it is the intention to send replacements, that the duty of the U.N.  Forces there is to restore democratic government, help the Congolese people build their own civil <Col N="968" /> service and police force, rediscipline and re-equip their defence forces and, in fact, ensure as far as possible that the United Nations carry out the original intention of forcing the Belgians to get out.  If the objectives are as originally stated, there will be no objection to our troops going there.  If we are not satisfied that the objectives are those of the U.N. Security Council we should not send our troops to be used as they have been used up to the present.</P>

      <P>We all realise this Bill is necessary to replace the temporary measure.  I am very glad to know the Government have not yet made up their minds about the sending of this second battalion.  They are, of course, quite right to make all the preparations necessary.</P>
      <P>We have, as everybody knows, a rapidily changing situation in the Congo.  If, for no other than financial reasons&mdash;the Soviet bloc does not intend to spend one penny on these operations&mdash;I think the time will come when the United Nations will not be able to carry on.  Apart from that, this country has done enough in sending the men it has sent to the Congo. Those men have done their work well. The Congolese have been given an opportunity of settling down.  They have had six months in which to do that.  If they are not able now to settle down in some sort of order, the United Nations have failed, and failed completely.</P>
      <P>My suggestion is the reverse of Deputy McQuillan's.  The one and only way in which the situation can now be saved is by bringing the Belgians back and giving them a mandate.  I hold no brief for what was done in the Congo, or in any part of Africa, by the white races.  I am quite satisfied that in a very short time every white man, except those who are technicians, will have to go.  I thought at one time that the African tribes would take control.  Now they have fallen out among themselves and they are no longer <i>persona grata</i> with those who seek to hold authority in the Congo &mdash; Mobutu and Deputy McQuillan's friend Tshombe.</P>

      <P>The Belgian Government have been trying to make amends for the criminal negligence of the past. They were prepared to hand over an ordered and orderly State to the Congolese had they been allowed to do so.  It was their considered opinion that it would take at least ten years&mdash; 20 would probably be nearer the mark &mdash;to hand over a properly organised state after the manner of the British in Nigeria.  Unfortunately busybodies interfered and caused the Army to mutiny.  Everything collapsed &mdash; law and order, business and everything else.  There seems to be no possible hope now of restoration except by calling in the people who understand the situation best; and the Belgians are prepared to hand over in ten years' time, or so, an orderly State, a going concern, a properly organised society to replace the chaos that now exists.</P>
      <P>I hear people talk about democratic elections.  Can anybody tell me how elections are held in the Congo? Are the bow-and-arrow men put on a register?  Is a register kept?  Is there a secret ballot?  We all know that a head man was picked and the poor tribesmen voted for him by putting up their hands.  That is how the Government were elected.  Comparing the Congo with Ireland and the Six Counties is simply fantastic.  The Congo is a conglomeration of tribes which were kept in subjection, by the Belgians for the last 80 years.  When the collapse came, they were all anxious to revert to their original state.  There is no such thing as a homogeneous race there at all.  There are several different tribes.  Unfortunately the Belgians behaved scandalously. Unlike other colonisers they left the Congolese in a very primitive state.</P>
      <P>The fact is that there were no clearly defined units in the Congo.  There were all sorts of tribal units, some held by the French, who seemed to have done a good job, and some held by the Belgians.</P>

      <P>What I have to say in this debate has a definite bearing on this unfortunate country, the Congo. If any of us has any ideas on the matter I think we ought to state them and perhaps some good will come out of them.  Last week I had intended suggesting that African nations alone should be sent into the Congo because white men are not wanted there, except as technicians.  However, some black nations now there are saying that they are going to withdraw.  The only way I see out of the difficulty is that we should suggest to the United Nations that the United Nations should give a mandate to the Belgians for 10 years so that they may be able to transfer power in the ordinary way to the Congolese people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is generally recognised that the restoration of <Col N="971" /> order in the Congo is an essential prerequisite before there can be any prospect of progress.  Undoubtedly the situation there is an extremely complex one and, as we know from experience elsewhere no less than from our own experience, it is extremely difficult to establish new administrations where there is a rapid change over from a situation in which an entirely different administration had responsibility.  Nonintervention in the domestic affairs of the Congo is a very difficult problem and may well be incompatible with the effort to preserve order.  It is not our function to express views on a very complex situation which changes from day to day and, indeed, from hour to hour and on which information may well be out of date by the time the matter is under discussion.</P>
      <P>While the United Nations intervention in the Congo continues, we are obliged to support it and to assist it within the limits of our resources.  That does not mean that we should be prevented from querying the work of the United Nations mission in the Congo. We are entitled to get information from the United Nations on the situation there.  Up to the present, the information furnished to us has been meagre, mainly because the Government have no information other than that which is generally available to Pressmen and others who have visited the scene.</P>
      <P>The present situation in the Congo has brought up the most vital question of the effectiveness of the United Nations itself.  If certain nations withdraw their support without valid reasons, the United Nations intervention will be so hampered that it cannot succeed.  At certain times it is not easy to understand the nature of the United Nations intervention but I have always held the view that small nations have a vital interest in the preservation of peace and in the maintenance of order in situations such as at present exist in the Congo.  We have in the past seen many cases of the fatal tendency to refuse to take action where the conditions are difficult or where conflicts arise between different forces on big issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This happened in the League of <Col N="972" /> Nations in the Thirties when one error led to another and when the failure to take action finally led to the downfall of the old League and ultimately to the Second World War.  We must avoid any such situation so far as the United Nations Organisation is concerned.  It is easy to criticise the work of the United Nations mission but at present it seems to be the only effective instrument for action such as is required in the Congo.  No doubt at times it seems to the outsider that the Assembly of the United Nations is a mere talking shop but the success of the United Nations mission offers the best prospect of achieving the objective of the Assembly if it is made clear that it means business.</P>
    <P>The only people who can gain by its failure are the Communists.  They seek to profit by disturbance and disorder anywhere at any time.  It is our national duty to resist to the limit any effort the Communists may make to disrupt the United Nations mission. We must do everything we can, to the utmost of our ability, to see that order is restored in the Congo and that progress can develop and be made possible.  The very existence of the United Nations as an effective instrument for the preservation of world peace, depends on the efforts being made by the United Nations in the Congo.  We all have an interest in striving to see that this effort is successful and in giving it our support.</P>
    <P>It may be that the task assigned to the United Nations Force in the Congo may be greater than the scope of the authority they were given by the Security Council.  The terms of the order given to them are difficult to implement in practice and, in seeking to implement the directives given by the Security Council, the United Nations force may well have found their difficulties multiplied.  The problems created by that directive may at times have overshadowed the work which one would expect the mission to carry out.  However, that was the decision that was taken and until that decision is altered or a new directive issued they must endeavour to implement the directive contained in it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> Our soldiers in the Congo have done their duty and those who died died bravely in defending and upholding the responsibilities assigned to them, namely, the establishment of order and peace out of chaos.  This is never an easy assignment and least of all in a complex situation such as that which exists in the Congo.  In discharging that duty, we should see that our troops are adequately equipped and trained to perform their task.  We should ensure that the training and equipment are proper and effective, judged in relation to the task allotted and the terrain and territory to be covered.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that Deputy Cosgrave has intervened at this stage and spoken as he has done.  I am very much in agreement with what he has said.  He has brought us back more to the spirit of the speech which the Taoiseach made when introducing this Bill.  It is a pity that the National Progressive Democratic Party should have done all in their power to discredit the United Nations and to cast doubts on the value of the operation which is at present being carried on.  I do not know whether their Party feel embarrassed by the fact that they have virtually quoted, word for word, the speeches of Mr. Khrushchev in the United Nations.</P>

      <P>The comparison becomes more appropriate as time goes on.  However, what this Bill is attempting to do, and is doing very <Col N="974" /> well, in my view, is to establish beyond all doubt that this country takes its membership of the United Nations seriously and that it is prepared to take risks if necessary to uphold the rule of law in the world.</P>
      <P>That was the spirit of the Taoiseach's opening speech and was very largely the spirit of the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition and, just a few moments ago, by Deputy Cosgrave.  That is something which is of tremendous value.  It is particularly appropriate that a small country like ours should undertake such a very great responsibility.  It has been made perfectly obvious during the Congo operation that our troops have been particularly well received by the people of the Congo, and the report of the Chief of Staff, when he returned only yesterday, was that he had received requests in several cases from the local people that where an Irish garrison was to be replaced it would be replaced only by Irish troops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I have carefully read his speech which was as irrelevant, inappropriate and malicious as one could imagine.  We are attempting here to take a very courageous step, one which I hope will be an example to many other countries, particularly those who are now losing faith in the United Nations and who are obviously influenced to some extent by the Soviet Union.  We are taking a very wise step here and one which I hope we shall take without faltering.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the difficulties experienced by our troops in this operation and I would anticipate that similar difficulties would arise on any similar operation.  War is difficult enough but at least an army has an enemy provided for it and knows against whom it is fighting but in any police operation such as is envisaged in this Bill, our troops will come in without any enemy, purely as police, purely as neutrals, not knowing who is friendly and who is not.</P>
      <P>Under those circumstances I particularly welcome the Taoiseach's assurance that men will not be kept abroad on such an operation for longer than six months because the strain of such operations must be almost incredible. The fact remains that our troops have proved extremely valuable in this connection and if they are replaced by a further contingent, this third battalion to leave the country will, I hope, acquit themselves at least as well as those who went before.  They probably will acquit themselves better because, all going well, they will have some chance of learning from the experience of those who preceded them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that this Bill will go through without any further contentious matters being raised.  I feel very much for those who will be affected by it.  I would not wish for a moment to discourage anyone from criticising this Bill in a constructive way but I hope this House will be unanimous so that these troops who will go abroad in future will know they are doing so with a unanimous House and a unanimous country behind them, with the support of us all in an operation which <Col N="976" /> is of value not only to ourselves but to our children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill and I consider it is necessary, if we are to send troops abroad, to cover them by some form of legislation. There are certain things in the Bill which might need some alteration. Before referring to the Bill itself, I say that we should not lose ourselves in confusion in this House.  Our troops are in the Congo because originally they were asked for by the Congolese themselves.  We acted as members of the United Nations.  We responded to the call sent to us here, I think the Taoiseach told us, direct from the United Nations to send troops there for the purpose of endeavouring to establish law and order and to assist in every way possible this new and emergent country which found itself in difficulties.  The sympathies of Ireland and the Irish people must always go out to a young country trying to build itself a government.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have tried to draw a parallel between the situation in Africa and conditions here at home.  I have had the privilege of being in Africa.  It is many years since I was there, but nations, customs and national outlooks do not change much over the centuries or over the years. We have got to face the fact that, in Africa, the tribal system is entirely paramount.  That is one of the greatest difficulties the world has to face to-day. Before they secured their own Government, these tribes appear to have come together and to have united in the fight they were making to establish their own Government.  Since then, it appears that disunity has crept into the ranks and we have the unhappy situation that prevails at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We joined the United Nations fully conscious of the obligations we were accepting, and as an honourable State, we must fulfil those obligations.  It may be difficult at times.  There is a good deal of propaganda going on from both sides, from the East and from the West People may try to argue that the United Nations Forces are not carrying out the mandate imposed on them.  It is very hard to <Col N="977" /> know what is actually happening there, unless you are on the spot.  So long as the United Nations decide by a majority that they are going to maintain a force in the Congo for the purpose for which they were originally sent there, I think it is our duty to live up to our obligations.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in what Deputy Boland said just now.  I should like the Taoiseach, the Minister or some member of the Government to say whether or not it is a fact that on the withdrawal of the present force, whose time expires on 25th January next, it is intended to replace it.  I think Deputies generally were under the impression that it was the intention to replace that force.  It may not be possible at the present stage to say if such is the case, but I think the Government could indicate to the House whether, if conditions from the point of view of the overhead charges on the United Nations are unchanged on 25th January next, it is intended to replace the force or not.</P>
    <P>With regard to the force itself, it is only fair that we should express our opinions here, first, concerning the difficulties they have to face, and also in regard to suggestions we might have to make to the Government of things that might be necessary.  The terrain in Africa is entirely different from conditions at home.  I think I am right in saying that the correct term for the type of warfare you meet there is &ldquo;bush warfare.&rdquo; Africa consists of roads in the modernised areas and tracts in the large, rather backward areas of solid bush.  Bush warfare consists of ambushes in a deep thicket, and, in effect, that is what happened when our personnel lost their lives there recently.  It was suggested by Deputy McQuillan, I think, that our troops going out there should have instruction in the type of warfare they would have to contend with and that they should betrained by those who have personal experience of that type of action.  Perhaps that does not arise so much now in that our troops have been out there and those who return will be able to instruct those who may follow them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> With the present wave of anti-colonialism that exists and with the antipathy that exists among certain tribes to all white races, it is very difficult for U.N. troops to do their job there.  I should like to pay this tribute to the Irish troops.  I think they are doing a magnificent job. Irishmen have fought through the ages with great courage and distinction, on land, at sea, and in the air, for other nations before we achieved our freedom.  It is something to note that today they are fighting in their own uniform even though under the United Nations flag.  They are carrying out a work of reconstruction, but I think the term &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; might be applied to it because there has been loss of life and they have shown great courage and honour like the great Irishmen who went before them.  I should like to say how much I deprecate the remarks that have been made by certain people, non-nationals outside. I refer particularly to what the &ldquo;People's Government of China&rdquo; accused our troops of the other day&mdash; of attacking men with bows and arrows.  That was an infamous libel on a religious people who went out to do a job and to try to preserve and encourage peace in this land.</P>
    <P>This Bill, I think, is intended for permanent legislation and to cover any force that we may be called upon to send abroad according to our responsibilities to the United Nations. I notice in the Bill that the word &ldquo;men&rdquo; is employed in some caces instead of &ldquo;personel.&rdquo;  I do not know if it is intended ever to use female personel or not, but it might well arise, if we are passing legislation at some later date, that we may be sending nurses or ambulance drivers abroad as so many other countries do. I draw the Minister's attention to that fact.  Perhaps he might consider amending the Bill accordingly, so he would not have to return to the House at a later date for further legislation.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which strikes me.  I have had personal experience of this in the case of a descendant of an Irishman who was actually born in India.  I wonder if it would be possible to arrange that anyone born <Col N="979" /> abroad of Irish parentage may in some way be registered here at home?</P>
    <P>The reason I bring this before the House is this: I know of a man born many years ago of Irish parentage in India.  He came under the Indian quota for immigration into the United States and although all of his family had gone to the United States and had settled down there, this man of 75 years of age was unable to join them. The Indian quota was so small that he was unable to get into the United States.  I should like the Government to consider that point to see if they could get around it in some way, so that parallel conditions may not arise for children born outside the State and so that they will not find themselves blocked by immigration laws from entering a country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to associate myself with the well-deserved tribute which Deputy Dillon paid to the Army Command for the efficiency and despatch with which they arranged the organisation and movement of the two battalions to the Congo.  In all the circumstances, it was a remarkable performance. However, the speed with which these two battalions had to be grouped and sent created problems, including problems associated with the equipment of the troops with tropical gear and their inoculation against tropical diseases.  The decision to proceed forthwith with the arrangements for a third battalion was taken last month so that the Army Command would have time to ensure that problems of organisation would be reduced, that the troops could be despatched equipped with their tropical gear and fully recovered from any after effects of inoculation.</P>
      <P>The bringing back of the two battalions from the Congo next month will, of course, be spread over several days.  The present intention is to start moving the 32nd Battalion back to Ireland on January 10th.  When that operation is completed, the planes and personnel involved will go back to the Congo to lift and bring home the 33rd Battalion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> Whatever maybe the future of the United Nations effort in the Congo, and our part in it, the people here can salute the officers and men of the 32nd and 33rd Battalions when they are back on Irish soil on their performance when in United Nations service.  I have heard nothing but widespread praise by everybody, including Press correspondents who have had the opportunity of seeing events there at first hand, of their efficiency and morale.  I had the opportunity to-day of hearing the report of the Chief of Staff and the Quartermaster General who have just returned from a tour of the Congo, in which they visited every single detachment of Irish troops there, which confirmed reports already received from other quarters that our men are going very well.</P>
    <P>The nation has every right to feel proud that soldiers of the modern Irish Army on their first overseas service under arms have demonstrated their professional competence and a high quality of general behaviour.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The 34th Battalion which is being organised may have to face a more complicated situation in the Congo than the first two battalions anticipated, but it is certain that they will do their duty with equal competence. That battalion will be composed of officers and men who have volunteered for the service, knowing everything that has happened and with some understanding of what may eventuate.  There has been no dearth of volunteers, which speaks well for the spirit of our Army and for their understanding of the world importance of the duty for which they are volunteering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Army is, of course, in its entirety, a volunteer army.  In future, those who join it will be volunteering for service outside Ireland with a United Nations force, if the occasion should arise, and they will be aware from past events that the occasion may arise.  The Army authorities do not think that that knowledge will have any other effect than to popularise <Col N="981" /> Army service and to help their present recruiting campaign.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding the Congo is changing almost daily, as Deputies know.  In our judgment, there is no prospect of the problem of the Congo being resolved without a great deal of United Nations help, not merely to keep order but also to maintain in operation the essential community services and to get the machinery of government there organised in some way.</P>
    <P>If the United Nations should be unable for any reason to continue to provide help to the Congo, and to provide help on the present scale as a minimum, the situation there could very well become quite chaotic and if as a result of the failure or inadequacy of the United Nations effort, there should be direct intervention by great powers, the world, as Deputies have indicated they realise, could be brought still closer to the brink of a major world conflict.</P>
    <P>If that should happen, or if there should be any deterioration in the international position because of events in the Congo, we would not wish that there could be any suggestion that it was due to a failure on our part to afford the modest measure of help that we have been asked to contribute.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that I said in my introductory speech that the despatch of the third battalion to the Congo on the withdrawal of the two battalions already there would be subject to certain conditions.  I do not wish to be taken as suggesting that there is any doubt in our mind that these conditions will be met.  It is practically certain that the further battalion will be despatched.  It will be realised by Deputies who are noting the course of events that our withdrawal from the United Nations force in the Congo now might cause misunderstanding which could prejudice the success of the whole United Nations effort there and could also create the mistaken impression that, in our view, the United Nations objective in the Congo has changed in a way of which we did not approve.</P>
    <P>It has been announced that certain countries with contingents in the <Col N="982" /> Congo&mdash;the United Arab Republic, Morocco, Guinea, Ceylon and Yugoslavia&mdash;are withdrawing their contingents, although in the case of Ceylon and Yugoslavia, the contingents were of token size only.  The decisions of these countries to take that course appear to be due to the disinclination of the United Nations to change the directives given to the force in the Congo in a way which would involve intervention in internal Congolese political affairs.  I cannot now attempt to forecast what effect, if any, the decisions of the Government of these countries may have on the United Nations operation in the Congo but it may not be decisive.</P>
    <P>As a general rule, we shall base our policy and attitude in respect to the Congo and all other matters on the presumption that whatever the United Nations, through their proper organs, decide to do is <i>prima facie</i> right.  The extent and the duration of our contribution to any action upon which the United Nations may embark must, however, remain a matter for our decision.  We would not have been in breach of any legal obligation to the United Nations if we had declined to meet their request for military contingents for the proposed Congo force and we can, even where a clear legal obligation would arise, accept commitments only in proportion to our resources.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, both during the present debate and on other occasions, have expressed views on the internal Congo political situation and its possible solution, and Deputies Browne and McQuillan on many occasions, by Parliamentary Question and otherwise, have tried to provoke me into comments on the internal political situation there.  I want to make my position clear in that respect.  I am not going to make any such comment because, apart from our strict adherence to the official United Nations attitude in the Congo, I have to bear in mind that any statement of that character by the Government&mdash;any apparent taking of sides in the internal Congo situation&mdash;could very well increase the hazards facing Irish troops in the Congo.  Our understanding of <Col N="983" /> their function is quite clear.  Our troops are there in accord with the terms of the resolution of the Security Council under which a United Nations force was sent to the Congo&mdash;which assumed the unity, territorial integrity and political independence of the Congo, and affirmed&mdash;this is a quotation from the resolution of the Security Council&mdash;&ldquo;That the United Nations force in the Congo will not be a party to, or in any way intervene in or be used to influence the outcome of any internal conflict, constitutional or otherwise&rdquo;.  That is our clear understanding of the function of the United Nations force and no statement made here in the name of the Government must give any impression that we regard them as having any other role and particularly any duty to discriminate between the rival claimants to political authority in the Congo.</P>
    <P>We all know that the purposes of the United Nations in the Congo are being misrepresented by many people in many countries and with apparently ulterior motives.  There appears to be a desire to bring about a failure of the United Nations effort with the long-term aim of discrediting and weakening the United Nations as a world force.</P>
    <P>Before our contingents were despatched, we understood from expressed statements made on behalf of the United Nations that the operation of the United Nations force in the Congo would be separate and distinct from the actions of any national authority and for the sole purpose of maintaining order and protecting life.  We understand now that the purpose of the U.N. force there remains unchanged, notwithstanding the subsequent collapse of any internal Government authority which existed in the Congo.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the United Nations, through their Congo Advisory Committee or their recently appointed Congo Conciliation Committee &mdash; a delegation from which is now reported to be proceeding to the Congo&mdash;to bring about a political settlement are distinct and separate from the actions of the United Nations Force there <Col N="984" /> and, as we understand it, that Force will not be used to give effect to any political settlement.</P>
    <P>As regards the composition of the United Nations Force, we accepted the policy declaration which was contained in the first Report of the Secretary General, which was based upon three principles.  The first was that the ultimate solution of the Congo problem must be found in the Congo itself, with the assistance of the United Nations.  The second principle was that assistance should be given within the framework of the United Nations, in the first instance by sister African States as an act of African solidarity. The third principle was that this reliance upon regional solidarity should be qualified by an element of universality which would emphasise the United Nations character of the force and which, in the opinion of the United Nations authorities, required that non-African contingents should be included in it.  That view as to the desirability of retaining in the force European contingents, and thus emphasising the universal character of the force, has been reinforced strongly by subsequent events in the Congo.  So long as, in the judgment of the United Nations, the universal character of the force should be made apparent by the presence of European units in it, we would be very slow to question the wisdom of that decision.  Clearly the non-African contingents are regarded as more detached from the internal Congo problem than some of the African States with contingents there.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that there should be an Irish diplomatic representative in the Congo seems to me to take no account whatever of the prevailing circumstances.  In the existing conditions, even the selection of the Congolese authority to whom a representative would present his credentials would be a controversial decision. Such a representative, if sent, would presumably be resident in Leopoldville.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations headquarters are in New York.  I would <Col N="985" /> point out that the Congo is almost as big as the whole of the West of Europe, with primitive communications, and that a single representative of ours there in one centre would be a most unreliable source of information.  Such a representative could have no function whatever of screening the directions issued to the Irish contingent by the United Nations Command. There is only one non-African country with a contingent in the United Nations force and with diplomatic representation in the Congo and that is India.  It is doubtful whether India has found that arrangement very helpful. The great majority of the countries with contingents in the United Nations Force in the Congo have no diplomatic representation there.  Like ourselves, they probably believe they can get more reliable information concerning the Congo situation through the United Nations Congo Advisory Committee and that if they have views to express on the situation it is there they should make them known.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Deputy Corish was serious in suggesting we should send some Dáil Deputies to the Congo to explore the situation.  However tempting that prospect might be, there is nothing in my view more likely at present to lead to misunderstanding of our attitude in the whole Congo situation. When there is a stable and representative Congo Government prepared to extend an invitation to an Irish Parliamentary delegation, the suggestion could be considered.  I do not think it should be considered before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather Deputy Dillon was not quite satisfied with the information I have been giving him during the course of the months since July last regarding the Congo situation.  It was at least considerable in bulk.  Therefore, it must have been the quality of the information that the Deputy was complaining about.  I considered that I should confine myself to conveying to Party Leaders documentary information that came to me, the authenticity of which could not be questioned.  I did not consider it wise to send on to them purely speculative or doubtful items of information that came along. <Col N="986" /> I realise that many of the documents sent to Party Leaders, including the fairly voluminous reports made by the Secretary General to the Security Council, did not contain anything, or not very much, that had not been published in the newspapers.  I felt, however, that it might be convenient to the Parties to have these documents and statements readily available, in the form in which they were supplied, for reference purposes.  I shall consider whether it is possible to improve the quality, if not the quantity, of documentation which I can supply.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about the type of activity engaged in by the United Nations Forces in the Congo, including the Irish contingent.  In the main they are engaged in very routine types of duties&mdash;protecting essential installations, keeping open vital communications, guarding civilians engaged in various activities there, including church missions, where necessary, and, generally, acting as peacemakers.  The reports I have received from our Army Command indicate that their relations with local Congolese are very good indeed.  The shock which the Niemba action caused to members of the contingent was due entirely to its unexpectedness. Previously, the patrols of Irish troops, wearing the United Nations uniform, in that area, had experienced little difficulty in dealing with any groups of the local tribesmen whom they met.  A not unusual experience when coming upon such a road block as they were removing at Niemba was that the local tribesmen having identified them as Irish members of the United Nations Force, helped them to remove the road block. The ambushed patrol had not anticipated anything else when they saw the group of tribesmen at Niemba.  The general feeling amongst the Force was of surprise that such an attack had taken place at all.</P>
    <P>Generally, the indications are that the Irish troops are not merely maintaining good relations with the local Congolese but, as the Chief of Staff said in his interview with the Press, published this morning, in districts which he had visited, and where the prospect of the withdrawal of Irish <Col N="987" /> troops was known to the local Congolese, people had urged that they should be replaced by further Irish contingents&mdash;so happy were the relations which our troops had established with the local residents.</P>
    <P>It is a great tribute to the Irish people and to their understanding of the vital role which the Irish contingent is playing in the Congo that notwithstanding the unfortunate loss of Irish lives in the Niemba ambush and the consequent increased public anxiety for the safety and welfare of the rest of the force, not one voice has urged that, for that reason, the Force should be brought home.  In that respect we have displayed a maturity which has been universally recognised and which cannot but enhance Irish influence in the world's affairs.  We can only hope that the Congo situation will be resolved on a basis which will preserve the unity, territorial integrity and political independence of the Congolese State, with a Government that in time will be able to protect and advance the welfare of their people and through which can be channelled the aid, moral and material, which the world is so very willing to give.  If that should be the outcome of the whole United Nations operation there, we shall be proud to have been associated with it.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach rightly emphasises that public reaction to the hazards our men have met with in the Congo has been admirable and highly desirable.  In some measure, that must be attributed to the atmosphere of this Assembly which can be preserved, as the Taoiseach recognises, only on the basis that those of us who share some responsibility in matters of this kind are kept reasonably well informed of essential developments.  I appreciate  the Taoiseach's difficulty in giving any more information than the bulky material he has furnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate his desire to improve the quality of that material hereafter, if that is possible.  If a short appreciation of the situation in the Congo from our Government's point of view were confidentially made available at <Col N="988" /> reasonable intervals, say, monthly intervals, to responsible leaders of this House it would help them to bear their share of the burden of decisions this House may from time to time be called upon to make in the name of the people in regard to events transpiring in the Congo.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all familiar with the term &ldquo;passing the buck.&rdquo;  The story is told that when ex-President Truman succeeded to the Presidency of the United States of America, he says himself that the first decision he took was to inscribe on a large sheet of cardboard the words &ldquo;The buck stops here,&rdquo; and to place that notice on his own desk.  That is an indiscretion into which I do not think our Minister for Agriculture will ever fall because whenever he finds himself confronted with a problem, he establishes a board and thereafter he stands forth stainless and unashamed and whatever happens afterwards is the responsibility of the board.  If he has promised to pay 84/- a barrel for wheat, he establishes An Bord Gráin and if the price drops down to 72/6d. less 4/6 a barrel, that is not his responsibility.  An Bord Gráin put on the levy and none can point the finger of scorn at the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have a Bill introduced on foot of a report.  He set up the Board to prepare the report and therefore no one can blame him for bringing in the Bill.  The Bill operates, in effect, to transfer to a new body which is called An Bord Bainne, substantially the functions of the Butter Marketing Committee which has been operated through the Department of Agriculture for the past 20 years.  That is not all it transfers.  It has some other functions which are described in the <Col N="989" /> Minister's speech.  At Column 763, Volume 185, he said:</P>
    <P>Under Section 35 of the Bill, the Board is empowered to collect levies on milk supplied to creameries. These levies will enable the Board to meet its expenses, including the dairying industry's proportion of any deficit arising on exports of milk products.</P>
    <P>Then there is a long harmless piece in the speech until we come to where he says, at Column 764:</P>
    <P>It is specifically laid down in Section 31 (4) of the Bill that a grant shall not be used to defray more than two-thirds of any loss incurred by the Board on the export of milk products or any support given by the Board in relation to the export of such products.  This will ensure that the dairy industry will continue to contribute its share of export losses.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it was necessary to set up Bord Bainne to enforce that proviso.  It is already briskly operating. There is a levy of one penny per gallon on milk and of course the Minister increased the price by one penny per gallon, but the farmer discovered that, at the same time, the calf produced by the cow whose milk had gone up by one penny had dropped by £10. If she was a good average cow, she was producing 600 gallons of milk per annum which represents 2,400 pence, so that really he lost fourpence a gallon through the calf, got back one penny through the Minister and lost one penny by way of levy, so that the farmer was fourpence per gallon worse off than before.  Hereafter, all the woe can be attributed to Bord Bainne.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear to-the House that all the functions prescribed for Bord Bainne in this Bill are functions which the Minister for Agriculture ought to have been carrying out energetically himself for the past four years, but the fact is that &ldquo;sweet Fanny Adams&rdquo; has been done since 1957 by the Minister in respect of any of the things he ought to have been doing and that the sum total of his <Col N="990" /> effort is to answer that he is going to set up a board to do what he ought to have been doing for the past three years.  I remember that the Butter Marketing Committee used to consult me every week about the prospects of the butter market in Great Britain and we used take decisions.  I remember taking a decision in 1951 when the question arose whether we should reimpose rationing of butter for a fortnight or bring in butter from abroad.  Do you remember that?</P>

      <P>We brought in Danish butter for a fortnight and Fianna Fáil careered around the country bawling &ldquo;Dillon's yellow butter&rdquo;.  Now it will not be &ldquo;Smith's yellow butter&rdquo;; it will be Bord Bainne's yellow butter and the Minister for Agriculture will be out washing his hands and declaring that he is quite free from all responsibility and: &ldquo;Address your representations to Bord Bainne&rdquo;.  I do not believe in fraud of that kind.  I believe that if a person is Minister for Agriculture, he should do his job and answer to the House for it and not come in shedding crocodile tears and saying: &ldquo;I did not do it; it was Bord Bainne did it&rdquo;.  I do not believe that if you decide to knock 4/6d. off a barrel of wheat, you should come in and say: &ldquo;I did not do it; it was Bord Gráin&rdquo;.  I believe that if you conceive it your duty to do these things, then here in Dail Eireann is the place to render an account of your stewardship. I do not believe the people are one bit fooled by the establishment of boards on to which the Minister for Agriculture can shove all responsibility for every decision of consequence which affects the welfare of the farmers for whom he is supposed to be responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that when the question of providing an additional outlet for milk became a matter of urgency and we found that there was only roller process spray milk manufactured in Ireland, we invited a number of creameries to engage in the spray process dried milk so as to get our foot <Col N="991" /> into that market and when a number of them did undertake it, we started ourselves in the Dairy Disposal Company creamery in Tipperary.  Then, of course, some of the other creameries came clamouring to the Department to get permission to go into the business themselves.  We gave them permission.  We did not set up Bord Bainne to do it.  We did it ourselves because we thought it was the duty of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I remember that when Miloko was being set up to manufacture chococlate crumb, the persons concerned to embark on that enterprise came to the Department.  We chose the site in consultation with the local creameries and insisted that the plant of Miloko would go to the creameries and that they would not be required to come to Miloko.  We insisted on it being put in the place most convenient to the maximum number of creameries from which supplies would be drawn.  We stipulated that the British confectioners who were going to buy the crumb would contribute 49 per cent of the capital, so that if, in the hereafter, the market for crumb showed a tendency to contract, the British manufacturers would not close down our crumb factory and turn to other factories elsewhere, because for every £1 our factory lost, we were determined they would lose £1, too, and signs on it, in spite of difficulties in the chocolate crumb trade, Miloko continues to function and take the farmers' milk.</P>
    <P>Those functions are now being transferred to Bord Bainne.  I often wonder what the Department will be doing in a few years' time, if we set up more boards like Bord Gráin and Bord Bainne.  The Minister will be like the Minister for Transport and Power trotting in and telling us: &ldquo;Don't ask me, ask Bord Grain; don't ask me, ask Bord Bainne; don't ask me, ask Bord Cearc; don't ask me, ask &lsquo;Bord Turkey&rsquo;.&rdquo; I forget what is the Irish for &ldquo;turkeys&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> I deplore that development.  I always maintained that the Department of Agriculture is the most important Department of State.  I always maintained, when I was Minister, that there was no Department in the State better equipped to carry out its functions and that there was no Department of State equipped with a body of men better acquainted with the problems and the characteristics of that section of our community which they were concerned to serve.  If we continue on these lines, the Department will have no function at all.  I do not believe it is desirable for the Minister for Agriculture to jettison his responsibilities in that way.</P>
    <P>I have no objection whatever to encouraging any body of public spirited persons who go and seek fresh markets and open fresh opportunities, but I do not believe their activities should be regarded as a substitute for the over-riding responsibility of the Minister to promote the industry of agriculture himself.  I always felt, and I still feel, that there is no substitute for that personal interest and encouragement which it is in the power of a competent Minister for Agriculture to give.  I believe that the principle underlying this Bill is the principle of passing the buck, and in so far as that is so, I deprecate the suggestion that the institution of this board in any way diminishes the ultimate responsibility of the Minister for the time being, towards the welfare and expanding prosperity of the dairy produce division of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>There are certain other broad principles to which I wish to refer now, as well as some details to which I shall refer later.  There is one fundamental and poisonous illusion underlying the whole procedure envisaged in this Bill.  It is illusory that by some miraculous marketing device, you can alter or eliminate the fundamental problems of the dairying industry of this country.  That is a complete illusion.  The real problem of our dairy produce is that we have never yet produced supplies sufficient to maintain a constant supply in any substantial market.</P>
    <P>The first essential and urgent necessity is that we should build up the dairy produce output of this country to where it will be sufficient to maintain <Col N="993" /> a constant and reliable supply in some market, small or great, which we can secure.  It behoves us, therefore, first of all, to expand the output. I know that preliminary expansion of output may involve the community in a transitory burden of surplus milk until we have found the marketing channels into which it can profitably be passed.  The fundamental product is milk.  The form in which we sell it must await decision until we test the market, and we cannot test the market until we have the milk.  Therefore, our first problem is to expand milk production.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that this is a Dairy Produce Marketing Bill.  I reject with contempt the suggestion that the setting up of Bord Bainne is any final or exhaustive solution of the problem that a Dairy Produce Marketing Bill presents to this Legislature. The real problem is to get the stuff for the market, because there can be no market until you have it. The desperate danger in this business is to put the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>I pointed out three years ago that our great problem in regard to industrial exports was that if you went out and sought a market for industrial exports in any part of the world, it was relatively easy to get it, but if, having got the market, you failed to deliver and if, having failed to deliver, you then wanted to expand your output capacity to the point where you could deliver, and then returned to that disappointed market with the announcement that you now had the goods to deliver, you would find that 90 per cent. of the people from whom you got orders on the first occasion would turn away from you and say: &ldquo;You fell down on it the last time; we will not order from you again.&rdquo;  The only way to break that vicious circle in the industrial sphere was, I said, to contact an existing industrial organisation with a wide market, an organisation which would collaborate with the producers here and through which they could pour their output into the established market channels.</P>
    <P>We are confronted now with the same problem in regard to agricultural output and we may find it much more <Col N="994" /> difficult to get marketing channels for dairy produce through the method of bringing in foreign capital and firms to collaborate with our domestic producers. It would be far more difficult to get markets for dairy products because I do not think that the device we employ for the purpose of securing foreign industrial markets is available for dairy produce.</P>
    <P>We have to face the fact that we have to break into these markets and we cannot break into them, unless we have the goods.  We have to face a period when we have the goods but there may be some lag between the period when we have the goods and the period when we attain to profitable markets wherein to dispose of them.  In that interregnum, the community have to carry the cost.  If they do not, we can never expand these markets.  I am not in the slightest degree pessimistic about our ability to get the markets provided we have the goods.</P>
    <P>How then are we to get them? There is no way we can get the goods except by expanding the output of our existing acreage of land.  We have not got any more land to distribute than the 12,000,000 acres of arable land which is our national heritage, and a very precious heritage it is.  But associated with those 12,000,000 acres of arable land are 350,000 farming families, and perhaps most precious asset of all, 42 inches of annual rainfall.  In wet weather, people are inclined to bemoan an excessive moisture in our climate, but it is one of the most precious assets this country has if only we knew how to use it, and we do know how to use it.  The maddening thing is that the people who know how to use it and could help our farmers on every acre of Irish land, whether a 10-acre farm or a 1,000-acre farm, are being shipped to Rhodesia, Canada and elsewhere because we will not employ them at home.</P>
    <P>I have advocated in this House repeatedly that the only method to make a dairy marketing organisation truly function is to establish a national advisory service.  That is contemptuously rejected by the Minister, although <Col N="995" /> before he goes to the general election, he will adopt that idea as he has adopted so many others put forward by the Fine Gael Party, much to my embarrassment.  Up to this, his attitude has been one of contemptuous rejection, although he has before him as Minister for Agriculture what I had most dramatically confirmed to me in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I established a parish agent service whereby there was to be one advisory agent for three parishes to supplement the inadequate local authority services &mdash;services which were not only inadequate in the number of their personnel but in their methods of administration and in the degree of direct contact that was maintained with the Department of Agriculture and the Research Institute.  We had no Research Institute until I succeeded in laying the foundations of the Research Institute we now have.  In one of the areas in the Minister's constituency and one which is in my own constituency of Monaghan, I had recent evidence of the fact that where we have put a parish agent, the output of milk in that area has increased by between 30 per cent. and 40 per cent. since that parish agent took up duty.</P>
    <P>This interesting fact follows.  In that creamery area, if a similar expansion had taken place, that creamery would be handling more than 1,000,000 gallons extra per annum without any increase in their overhead costs.  That would have meant that they could have either increased the price of milk to all suppliers by between 1¼d. and 1½d. or reduced the cost of butter excreamery by 2½d. to 3d. per lb.  It is a most dramatic instance of what increased output meant.</P>
    <P>It meant in that area that every man who kept four cows was now keeping five and their output was rising, owing to the improved grassland techniques now being employed in that area.  It meant that a man who was getting £100 a year in his milk cheque&mdash;they are all small farmers&mdash;was now getting £130 per year in his milk cheque and that without the expenditure of a single penny extra, except for the super he put on the grass.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> If that could be done, and it can be done, over more than 70 per cent. of the land of Ireland, it would metamorphose the lives of the vast majority of the small farmers.  We cannot give them more land&mdash;we have not got it to give to them&mdash;but there are thousands of farmers today living very miserably on 30 acres of land who could be given relative security by an increase of 30 per cent. in their output. What is vitally important is that if that increased output became available, the cost of producing a great part of that entire output would fall materially, because the costs of the processing plants, whether creameries, chocolate crumb factories or dried milk factories, would correspondingly decline as their capacity came to be used 100 per cent. instead of 70 per cent. at which they are at present operating.</P>
    <P>Nor should we overlook the fact that if an increase of this kind resulted, it would have repercussions on the pig industry for which there is an immense future, if it is carried on on the same lines.  I do not propose, although I could justify it, to follow the dairy produce industry into the pig industry. That can wait a fuller discussion on the Estimate itself but Deputies who understand this business will realise that the pig is an integral part of the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>People may ask: where is this increased output ultimately to be sold? Suppose we all agree that an essential preliminary is to expand the output. Where do we hope to get rid of it? It is going to consist of cattle and milk.  You will not get milk if you do not get calves.  That is one of the lessons we taught the Fianna Fáil Party during the past quarter of a century.  You do not get milk from a cow without a calf.  If calves are slaughtered and thrown over the ditch, that seriously reacts against the interests of the dairy farmer.  It always gives me gratification to see the dawn of light flooding the minds of Fianna Fáil Deputies when they come to understand that simple theorem of elementary agriculture.  It is true to say that the great world deficiency at the present in the emerging nations of <Col N="997" /> the world is in protein foods.  These protein foods are best supplied through the mechanism of fish, meat and milk.</P>
    <P>Contrary to general belief, we are not peculiarly well situated for the production of fish for export.  I do not propose to initiate an argument on the subject of fish in connection with the Dairy Produce Marketing Bill, but many people thought that, because we have a long coastline, we must have plenty of fish to export all over the world.  The Minister for Transport and Power used to believe that.  He had a couple of years of the fishing business before he moved over to transport and railways, with the result the railways are disappearing in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not wait to eliminate the fish.  But he learned, and he is passing that on now to Deputy Moran, who is beginning to learn that fish are not as plentiful as he had thought they were.  We are not advantageously placed for the production of fish for export.  We may be as well off as other countries, but we have not got the apparent advantage that many ignorant members of the Fianna Fáil Party at one time thought we had.  We are, however, peculiarly well placed for the production of milk and meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I venture to say there is no country in the world which has the natural advantages we have for the production of meat and milk.  Fifty years ago there would have been insuperable difficulty in transferring meat and milk from Ireland to equatorial regions in Africaner to the countries of the Far East where chronic deficiencies of protein food exist.  Many people forget that there are large areas in Africa where it is impossible to keep a cow because cattle cannot live in these areas.  These people must either do without milk or bring it in in another guise.  The present situation is that the wealthy white population in these areas bring in milk in the form of spray dried milk and reconvert it into liquid milk as required.  The relatively poor people <Col N="998" /> in these areas do without, and suffer from many shocking deficiency diseases for want of it.</P>
    <P>In regard to meat, in these areas the relatively well-to-do, who heretofore were very largely the representatives of colonial Powers, bring in their meat in preserved states of one kind or another, usually canned, though, in the absence of cattle in these areas, alternative sources of meat are available. For the bulk supply of meat there must be an almost insatiable demand for the foreseeable future. There is no country in the world better equipped to supply it than we are.  That almost unlimited horizon of demand awaits exploitation.  In the meantime we have 55,000,000 people in these two islands, including our own population, to feed while we are branching out into that unlimited area of demand.  An essential preliminary to the maintenance of our position in the markets that we have, never mind the exploitation of those yet to come, is the creation of an adequate supply of the commodities we have to sell.</P>
    <P>We are introducing a Dairy Produce Marketing Bill at this moment.  I wonder do Deputies realise that we have not had anything to sell for some years, that there were two or three years during which we had no butter to export at all&mdash;none&mdash;and that this year we are getting back only to about the output we achieved in 1957?  If we are to make any real progress of consequence, that output would at least want to be doubled, trebled and quadrupled.  It is well within our ability to do so if we exploit the potential of the land we have.</P>
    <P>I notice in this regard that it is proposed under this Bill to transfer to the Milk Board the export of certain commodities which I deliberately exclude from the province of the Butter Marketing Committee, notably cream. Before I come to that, I want to mention one detail.  The Minister has chosen to call this Board An Bord Bainne which, in the English version, is the Milk Board.  Why the Minister chose that particular phrase I do not know.  It is well calculated to give rise to confusion.  There are two Milk Boards in existence, the Dublin Milk Board and the Cork Milk Board, <Col N="999" /> whose specialised function it is to control and supply the demand for liquid milk in the Dublin milk area and the Cork milk area.  Why the Minister could not have called this the &ldquo;Dairy Produce Board&rdquo;, which would at once distinguish its function from that of the existing Milk Boards, I do not know.  I think the Minister would be well advised to turn that over in his mind.  He may find it more difficult to get someone in the Translation Section to translate &ldquo;Dairy Produce&rdquo; than he finds it to get someone who will put Irish on &ldquo;Milk Board&rdquo; but I do not think it should be as difficult as all that.  I think the Minister will create problems by calling this Body the &ldquo;Milk Board&rdquo; in the light of the two existing milk boards and their specialist functions.</P>
    <P>We shall transfer the export of fresh cream now.  There is a distinction between fresh and tinned cream.  I want to tell the House my experience in the Department.  The export of fresh cream before the 1939 war was a fiercely competitive business.  It became so fiercely competitive and cut-throat because the purveyors of fresh cream in England discovered that by prudent manipulation they could set one creamery society here against another.  By that form of competition they managed to whittle down the price they paid for fresh cream derived from Ireland.  With the advent of the war, the sale of fresh cream disappeared because its consumption in Great Britain was prohibited.  After the war the creameries, in their own defence, came together and organised a joint creamery exporting venture.  I think that was done during the administration of my predecessor, the late Deputy Thomas Walsh, the Lord have mercy on him.</P>
    <P>When I came back into office in 1954 I raised the question as to why we were restricting permission to export fresh cream to this cream exporting body.  Ought it not to be available to any creamery that wanted to engage in it?  I was advised of the circumstances that obtained.  I said: &ldquo;I cannot understand it.  It seems to <Col N="1000" /> me that if an enterprising creamery manager wants to get into this fresh cream export business he ought not to be excluded from it.&rdquo; I further said: &ldquo;We ought to notify these cream exporters that we propose to let any creamery, that wishes to, export cream.&rdquo; We did that, and the body exporting cream asked to see me to put their case before me.  I saw them, accompanied by my technical advisers. They explained that the combination they had formed to export cream was solely for the protection of the producer here, to prevent his being exploited by the successful operations of distributors in Great Britain setting one creamery against the other, and gradually whittling the price down. They said: &ldquo;Our position is that any creamery in Ireland can join us, whether they actually physically contribute cream or not and any profits&rdquo;&mdash;this is my recollection of the scheme&mdash;&ldquo;we make on the operations we will distribute to the contributing creameries on the basis of their total milk intake.&rdquo;  On reflection, I came to the conclusion that they were right and that, so long as the cream exporting organisation was open to any creamery that wanted to join it, that was the right way to go about it.  I withdrew the opposition to their activities and I think I was right.  I wonder is the Minister right in breaking up that organisation and substituting An Bord Bainne as the cream exporting body?  I see that he has given special representations to the cream exporting creameries but I wonder if he is right in interfering with the existing machinery which, so far as I know, worked very well and operated on an equitable basis.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister is excluding from the scope of the Milk Board's powers the marketing of milk powder.  I should have said that if there is one commodity which requires exploitation at a national level it is milk powder.  It is a market of limitless potential but one into which it is extremely difficult to get. It has a variety of ramifications because in some cases it is sprayed milk and in some cases it is roller milk and one would have thought that it was something <Col N="1001" /> which would need to have a centralised marketing organisation.</P>
    <P>I can see that the Minister may ask me why I did not centralise it when I was Minister for Agriculture and the answer is that I did not because I could not.  I could not because there was a fight in which 40 could have joined when I started the sprayed milk plant in Tipperary.  At that time I was presented with a certain agreement entered into by Dr. Ryan, when he was Minister for Agriculture, by which two creameries in Ireland were presented with a practical monopoly of the manufacture of dry milk.  That presented me with considerable difficulty because Dr. Ryan had been the Minister for Agriculture and had the right to speak with the full authority of the Government.  It appeared to me that no man had a right to give a practical monopoly of the manufacture of such a product and I said that that was to be stopped.</P>
    <P>The monopoly was expressed in terms of roller dried milk and I said that it did not extend to spray dried milk and I directed the Dairy Disposals Company to manufacture that milk in county Tipperary.  Neither of the monopolists wanted to enter that market at all.  They were content to produce roller dried milk and to sell it to people manufacturing baby food and to others of that type.  As scon as we got the sprayed dried milk working other creameries applied for leave to engage in that work.</P>
    <P>In 1957, notice which I had given to the monopolists was still in the process of running out and I do not know if the situation now is that the two creameries concerned wish to maintain their monopoly.  They claim to have got that monopoly from Dr. Ryan but if that is the Minister's difficulty, I think he ought to solve it firmly and seriously consider charging this Marketing Board with the marketing of dried milk.</P>
    <P>I can understand his leaving the marketing of chocolate crumb to the existing industrialists who do it because, despite all the hullabaloo about the marketing of it in Canada, I always thought that our best market for <Col N="1002" /> this product is Great Britain.  There always was a good market for our chocolate crumb in Britain because we had good contacts with the sweet manufacturers there.  It would be desirable to develop a market for chocolate crumb in Canada and America but the impression I got was that both of those countries were determined that we were not to get a foot into either market and that they were well able to supply themselves.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of the end product, chocolate crumb, is imported cocoa and it is easy to see why countries like Canada and the United States were limited in their output of this product solely by the availability of milk.  It is that which limits the British potential for the production of chocolate crumb.  They have not got the milk from their own resources, although there was a period when milk supplies in Britain began to expand and when there was a danger that milk would become available in Britain for the manufacture of chocolate crumb and that we would be forced out of the market.  It was our contacts in Britain that prevented that from happening and I do not think there is much danger of its happening now. However, unless there is some quite extensive potential expansion of the chocolate crumb trade to continental or American markets, of which I know nothing, I think the Minister is well advised to leave our chocolate crumb trade outside the general duties of the new Milk Board to be established under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he hoped for an expansion in the consumption of cheese in this country.  I always hoped for that.  I think there are two things that fail to be said about it.  One is that I do not think we have got sufficient support from the public health authorities or the medical profession in recommending cheese as a desirable element in the diet of children.  I believe it is a perfectly true and desirable recommendation that the diet of children should contain a substantial proportion of cheese.  I do not think that has been given the publicity it ought to be given.  The Department of Health would be better employed in <Col N="1003" /> urging that upon nursing mothers and others responsible for the raising of the young up to adolescence than in urging upon us the vital necessity of fluorine and molybdenum and other chemicals in our water.  If mothers, before the birth of their children, made themselves consume more calcium in the form of cheese and if children could be taught to consume more cheese, it would probably have a much more significant effect on dental caries and dental defects than any therapeutic process such as treating the general water supply could ever hope to have.</P>
    <P>That is one aspect of the expansion of the demand for cheese which I do not think we should over-estimate because, for a reason I have never been fully able to understand, unlike the British people we do not seem to be a cheese-eating people.  I can understand our not being an ardent fish-eating people because we have to eat fish on days of fast and abstinence and this produces a natural aversion. I do not mind some of my eccentric colleagues who prefer fish to meat; that is merely a foible and not a normal reaction.  I think every Minister for Agriculture will find himself confronted with a strange reluctance on the part of our people to consume cheese.  It would help greatly if our public health authorities would promote the consumption of cheese amongst the young.</P>
    <P>There is a second problem; confession is good for the soul and I may say it is a problem I could never resolve.  When I was Minister for Agriculture the Danes were introducing Danish blue cheese to the world shortly after the war, about 1948.  I remember time and time again saying to the officers of the Department of Agriculture and to creamery managers: &ldquo;How is it that the Danes can flood the world with blue cheese, that it is pressed upon you in New York and London and that we cannot produce any distinctive type of cheese at all?&rdquo; Of course, one alibi at that time was that there was not enough milk wherewith to do it.  However, later when there was enough milk wherewith to do it and when we were <Col N="1004" /> actually exporting milk, I could never get the cheese industry to produce a distinctive Irish cheese.  They contented themselves with producing Cheddar, processed cheese or copying Continental cheeses mainly for the purpose of forcing me to put a duty on these cheeses to prevent their importation.</P>
    <P>That is a matter to which the Minister might profitably turn his mind, the reason why we have never been able to produce a distinctive cheese suitable for export.  I do not know whether he has ever inquired into that question but, if he has, some of the explanations vouchsafed to him might cause him some astonishment and concern.  I can only hope that in recent years the general standard of quality of milk delivered to Irish creameries is such that these supplies could be readily used for conversion into cheese.  It has been sometimes suggested to me that one of the difficulties of expanding that market related to the standard of milk, as it was delivered to the creameries.  I do not believe that is an insuperable difficulty. There ought to be an expanding output of cheese and it ought to be possible for us to secure an expanding market for it abroad.  However, I believe that if we are to do it with any hope of profit it will largely depend on whether we are able to produce a cheese that has as outstanding a character as Danish blue. It is true to say that twenty years ago the name of Danish blue was unknown, yet today it is one of the most commonly consumed cheeses, after Cheddar, in the world.  It has probably outstripped many of the well-known old varieties of English, and even most of the established varieties of French cheese in their appeal.</P>
    <P>It is a highly technical problem but it does not seem to me credible, when I think of the multitude of varieties of cheese manufactured not only in France but in Italy and Switzerland as well as in Germany and Holland, that it is not possible in Ireland to produce at least one cheese of distinctive character on which a marketing board of this kind could rely to get an alternative outlet for milk supplies.  It is only <Col N="1005" /> in that way that it can hope to get an enduring market which will be of consequence to the dairy produce industry.</P>
    <P>We are going to have a levy.  We are also going to have this Board constituted by representatives of the creameries, the Dairy Disposal Board and the manufacturers of cheese, milk powder and chocolate crumb.  I do not understand why these interests are to be represented on the Board if we specifically exclude their products from the discretion of the Board.  I quote from column 761, Volume 185 of the Official Report of the 6th December, 1960, where the Minister says:</P>
    <P>At the outset it is proposed to leave to the individual manufacturers the export of all chocolate crumb to Britain and the Six Counties;</P>
    <P>There is no qualification in regard to milk powder, non-creamery butter and some special lines of cheese.</P>
    <P>The Board would be the sole exporter of creamery butter, fresh cream, canned cream, condensed milk and cheese other than some special lines, and would also handle the export of chocolate crumb to destinations other than Britain and the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>This is what I am puzzled about: why does the Minister exclude milk powder altogether?  I can understand his attempting to segregate exports of these things to the British market on the ground that channels of trade already exist but he seems to exclude milk powder for all parts from the discretion of the Board.  I would be interested to hear from him at some future date his reason for that decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask this question: if there is to be a board charged with marketing which is to have representatives of the creameries on it, representatives of the Dairy Disposal Board, and representatives of the manufacturers of cheese, milk powder and chocolate crumb and this extra member that the Minister announced as a representative of the creameries participating in the production of fresh cream, has he considered whether it would not be desirable to give the Irish Creamery Managers' Association representation on this Board?  I <Col N="1006" /> suppose it is true that these creameries could themselves elect a manager to represent them on the Board if they wanted to do so.  But if we are to bear in mind, as I think we must bear in mind, that marketing is not exclusively a question of selling&mdash;it also has aspects relating to production, handling, packing and processing&mdash;it occurs to me that among the Irish creamery managers are to be found a number of men with very highly specialised knowledge.</P>
    <P>If the creamery societies themselves do not choose to appoint managers&mdash; and I could well imagine that they would not and would prefer to appoint representative members of their committees&mdash;would it not be a desirable thing that responsibility should be thrown upon the creamery managers themselves to choose somebody to represent their common knowledge, wisdom and experience in the deliberations of a marketing board of this kind?  I think that is a matter worthy of consideration and I would be glad to hear from the Minister whether he has considered this and, if so, what are his reasons for deciding against including them.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters of detail which we can discuss more exhaustively on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I do not think this Bill is going to make any serious difference at all. I think the Butter Marketing Committee, under the general supervision. of the Minister for Agriculture, did many of the things this new Board is now charged to do.  I believe the principal reason the Minister has been so spry in introducing legislation to conform with the recommendations of the board he set up to advise on the marketing of agricultural produce is that he sees an incomparable opportunity of passing the buck again. I hope the dairy farmers will not have as painful an experience in regard to the potentialities of a levy as the wheat farmers have had in their dealings with An Bord Gráin.</P>
    <P>I want to say quite definitely that no matter how many boards stand between the Minister for Agriculture and the ultimate welfare of the industry he is supposed to represent in <Col N="1007" /> this House and in the Government, the responsibility ultimately rests on. him; and no amount of public hand washing, no amount of boards, however well remunerated and however large in personnel, can substitute for the duty he has to answer to the people for the fundamental industry of this country and for the wise administration of the £1,000,000,000 of our national wealth that is invested in the land.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say on behalf of the dairy farmers, a good many of whom I have the honour to represent, that this Bill should be welcomed by the House and should have the blessing of all concerned.  We should not start off, as Deputy Dillon has, by ridiculing it.  This Bill envisages the establishment of a committee which will understand the problems of the dairy industry.  It is obvious Deputy Dillon does not understand those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1008" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You do not believe a word of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that all the problems of the dairy farmer could be resolved by the appointment of a parish agent under the Parish Plan is the greatest over-simplification of a problem I have ever listened to.  I can speak with considerable personal knowledge of the dairy industry, and I defy anyone, whether he be an agricultural instructor or otherwise, to tell me better ways of increasing the output of my dairy farm than those I know myself.  Our difficulty in Cork has been to get people to avail of the agricultural services we already have without offering them more.  People may require advice in regard to particular matters but to say that by bringing one of those gentlemen into the yard of a dairy farmer, he could increase his output by 50 or 60 per cent. in the course of 18 months or two years is absolute nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows&mdash;and Deputy Dillon should know it&mdash;that the market for dairy produce has become highly competitive everywhere.  I agree with him that there is now a very wide field for milk products but I disagree with him when he says that dairy farmers have unlimited possibilities under present arrangements.  We have not.  In my opinion, we in the dairy industry are trying to straddle two horses at the same time.  We are trying to provide beef and, at the same time, trying to provide milk.  It is virtually an impossibility to go in for the unlimited production of both at the same time.  That is what has been distracting the dairy farmer up to now, and I suppose it will continue to be so.  Instead of concentrating on producing an unlimited or greatly increased supply of milk, he has been trying to provide both milk and beef at the same time.  That has been the great impediment to increasing milk production, and nothing we can say about agricultural instructors or parish agents can change that position unless the Department and the people concerned are convinced that in the production and sale of milk lies the most money.  When that becomes <Col N="1009" /> apparent nobody will change over more quickly to the full production of milk than the Irish dairy farmer. When he finds in one year an increased demand for calves or store cattle and no means of disposing of surplus milk and difficulty in knowing what that surplus will realise, he is very slow to go into milk production.  Once he is convinced that there is a prospect of selling milk and milk products, he will produce an immense amount of milk.</P>
    <P>If the Board operates in the right direction, as I am sure it will, the dairy farmer will realise that the future of the agricultural industry lies in milk and milk products.  That is as it should be.  That is why I say the Board is welcomed by those who are really interested in dairy farming.  The tragedy is that so few people are really interested in dairy farming.  Lip-service is paid to the dairy farmers but very few people are prepared to admit that the dairy farmers are literally the hewers of wood and drawers of water of the farming industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear! Who made them that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in that position because they do not know where they are going between the policies in regard to beef and milk and because of the difficulty they have experienced in disposing of surplus milk products.  They very often had to dispose of them at very bad prices. That was because no real attempt was made to channel milk to any particular use and because the exportable surplus was marketed in such a haphazard manner that nobody knew what anything was worth or what would become of it.</P>
      <P>That is why I am of the opinion that if this Board operates properly and sensibly, as I am sure it will, it will create hope and confidence in the dairy farmers.  The fact that the Board will exist to see that products are properly marketed will mean a higher return for our products and will definitely have the effect of increasing milk production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is very easy to stand up <Col N="1010" /> here and find fault with what is being done.  That is the easiest thing in the world to do.  In all the criticism I have heard so far, I have not heard one constructive suggestion or any alternative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Board certainly deserves a chance.  The section of the farming industry concerned are the people who are entitled to deal with the marketing of their products.  Does Deputy Dillon or anybody else expect the Minister or his officials to tour England or any other country in order to sell dairy products?  That is not and should not be necessary.  It should not be the function of the officials of the Department.  To assert that the Government in establishing the Board are simply passing the buck is completely wrong and gives a completely wrong impression.</P>
      <P>I see no reason why the Board cannot do an immense amount of work, as other boards in other countries are doing, for milk products.  The cream-exporting part of the business should have got more direct representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has got representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;More direct repreresentation&rdquo;, I said.  It is a traditional trade.  It secured a hold on the British market for a commodity that it is very difficult to sell at times because it is regarded as a luxury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="BattDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that at least the interest is represented but I should like it to have had more direct representation on the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How could the representation be more direct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Once that representation is there, I hope some good will come of it.  The sale of cream on the British market is a highly competitive business and it may not be an easy thing for the Board to increase sales. The export of cream is increasing. That development has been achieved <Col N="1011" /> without any aid from the State or anybody else and I suggest it should get very special consideration.</P>
      <P>We wish the Board well in its very difficult task.  It certainly will have its hands full and deserves the best wishes of the House and the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first intimation the House had of the Government's intention to introduce this Bill was when a motion was tabled in the names of two Independent Farmer Deputies in Private Members' Time. The Taoiseach availed of that opportunity to announce that the Government had decided to do something dramatic in the interests of the agricultural community.  We were informed in the same debate by Deputies supporting the Government, notably Deputy Moloney, that something of very great consequence to the dairying industry was envisaged in a Bill which was shortly to be introduced. Now that we have the Bill at hand and have heard the Minister's statement on it, we fail to see what aroused all these great expectations. Those who had great expectations deserve sympathy, now that we have seen the proposals about which they are called upon to be so enthusiastic.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech, almost in its entirety, was taken up with the mechanics of the setting up of the Board and the responsibilities it was intended to transfer to the Board.  We must look at this in the context of the general policy of the Government to pass the buck, as Deputy Dillon put it, in very plain English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government were elected as a strong Government.  The Party in Government got it across to the people, that what the country required was a strong Government and the people, unfortunately for themselves, elected them as a strong Government. I am sure they expected that a Government having the majority this Government enjoy could face up to tasks that a weaker Government could not attempt.  We find that when anything arises which contains an element of political risk, a board is established and responsibility is boarded out, so as to relieve the Minister concerned <Col N="1012" /> of his obligation to defend in this House the administration of the affairs transferred to an outside body.  There has been monotonous repetition every time a question was asked, of the statement that the matter was not the responsibility of the Minister, that Deputies should address their queries to some other body.  This unknown and intriguing person, this woman whose voice is raised to inform people they have the wrong phone number, has nothing on the Ministers in this Government.  And we have the Minister for Agriculture as the king pin in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this is just a passing reference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a passing reference.  This proposal now is a continuance of that policy &mdash; a continuance on the part of the Minister for Agriculture, on this occasion, of the creation of the second child of his brain in relation to this sort of thing. We all know of the major problem the Minister had to contend with in regard to wheat.  What did the Minister do? He resolved that problem by ridding himself of all responsibility, by setting up An Bord Gráin.  That relieved him of any particular responsibility but it did not work well for the unfortunate people who were sold the pup.  The wheat growers have an entirely different view today.</P>
      <P>Now an effort is being made to bring into being An Bord Bainne which will promote the same end as that for which An Bord Gráin was brought into being in relation to wheat.  Let us hope the same pitiable consequences do not flow from An Bord Bainne.  When we look at the problem we are asked to face in this Bill in regard to the marketing of dairy produce, we must review for the moment the situation in which we found ourselves a decade ago. Far from having any problem of the marketing of dairy produce, we did not have enough dairy produce to supply the requirements of our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not very much more than a decade ago, butter was rationed and the problem then was to bring production up to the point at which rationing could be dispensed with and to continue that advancement so that we would be able <Col N="1013" /> to guarantee supplies of dairy produce to outside markets.  We could not hope to make any progress in securing those markets until we had the first essential &mdash; a guarantee of being able to supply any markets procured.  Towards the end of the increase in production, the first action of the Government was to put an end to calf slaughter so as to preserve the cattle population in the south of Ireland.  If that had not been done in 1948 by the then Government, what necessity would there be to-day for any Board to concern itself with the marketing of dairy produce?  We would not have enough butter for our own people.  Following that, we embarked on the provision of ground limestone, after which we introduced the Farm Building Scheme, the Land Project and secured markets for cattle in dairying areas.</P>
    <P>I should mention here the increased value of the skim milk brought home from creameries in consequence of the increased conversion value of it as feed for pigs and other such animals which we were able to produce to a greater extent and which brought a reward by contributing towards the overall profits of the dairy farmers.  It is regretable that now there is a diminution in those profits because of the decrease in the value of store cattle and the fact that people delivering milk to creameries now suffer a reduction equal to 3d. or 4d. per gallon in the price of milk.  This happened because of the deliberate reduction brought about in the monthly cheques paid by the creamery societies.  It is a fact that the reduction people have suffered in their incomes because of the decrease in the numbers of young cattle is equal to 3d. or 4d. a gallon in the price of milk.</P>
    <P>The Government resorted to a method which they had already applied to wheat &mdash; the imposition of a penny levy on the milk producers. Then, at a later date, a penny increase was given in the price of milk.  Of course, that was not peculiar to the agricultural industry: we know the extra charge borne by every Department for increased salaries for all sections in order to meet the higher cost of living.  But the increase given to the dairy farmers was balanced by the <Col N="1014" /> levy on the creamery milk suppliers in order to create this fund which the Government have had for some years past.</P>
    <P>Now it is intended to charge this Board again with part of the cost of subsidising the production of butter for export.  Before this, this cost was borne entirely by the Exchequer.  We do not find that people who produce other goods for export are called upon to produce any money by way of levy, but here we see the agricultural community again selected for unfair treatment. Seemingly, the blow will be softened because they are invited to apply the blow themselves.  I cannot see the reasoning behind the idea that if you get people to hurt themselves, they will suffer less than if the blow were delivered by an outsider.</P>
    <P>Through the enactment of this Bill, the position will be that the Minister can fall back on Bord Bainne as readily as he did earlier on Bord Gráin in relation to wheat.  On the last occasion, the Government were very much embarrassed by the conditions in the dairying areas and they had to resort to the creation of an outside body.  There was the Milk Costings Commission, the carrot dangled some years ago by the Government.  Of course it did its job.  It diverted the attention of the people from their problems then and directed their attention to the Commission itself.  This carrot was left dangling for a long time and when it was all over, we were as wise as we were at the start.</P>
    <P>That Commission served its political purpose.  Can it be regarded as unfair if we suspect, in the creation of this new body, something similar to what was adopted by a Minister for Agriculture in a Fianna Fáil Government on two other occasions?  We are prepared to wait&mdash;since we can do nothing else &mdash; for the outcome of this body's deliberations.  Time will tell whether it will succeed in securing the markets we had all hoped could be secured so as to guarantee that the producer will be saved from the impact of any reduction in his income in consequence of over production. Deputy Dillon went into more detail. We see great possibilities in securing <Col N="1015" /> markets for milk products in countries in more than one continent.  We have diplomatic representatives in many countries.  In placing responsibility on this board for the marketing of dairy products do we completely relieve our diplomats abroad from any obligation to secure markets for agricultural products?</P>
    <P>Other organisations are in existence to promote the sale of industrial goods.  These bodies are financed out of State funds.  They are not directly contributed to by industrial producers and industrial exporters.  This represents a break-down in the guaranteed price of milk delivered to creameries. There was also a break-down in relation to the price of wheat.</P>
    <P>It would be very difficult to prevent the farmers from fearing, as they once did that, were they to work harder and respond to appeals to produce more, there would be a diminution in their incomes because of a fall in prices.  By exacting a levy on the exportable surplus, we are re-enacting what was done in relation to An Bord Gráin.</P>
    <P>This measure will be interpreted by many producers as another heavy impost.  It would have been well worth while to retain the complete subsidy from the Exchequer towards the cost of exporting any surplus rather than to break the price guarantee which was responsible for bringing about the increased production we all wanted and which happily we have.  It is to be hoped that the reduction in the delivery of milk to creameries, recorded for a couple of years, will show an upward movement until it gets back to the position it enjoyed some four or five years ago. If, next year, we have an exportable surplus of butter I hope it will be achieved by increased production rather than by a reduction in consumption in this country.</P>
    <P>In Departmental returns we find that in 1956 there was a very small increase of some thousand cwts. of butter consumed over 1955.  The withdrawal of food subsidies and the great increase in the price of butter resulted in a reduction by 60,000 cwts. in the <Col N="1016" /> amount of butter consumed in this country in 1957 <i>vis-a-vis</i> 1956.  Again in 1958, we had a reduction from 700,000 cwts. to 684,000 cwts.  Therefore, if there is an exportable surplus next year, one of the factors creating it will be that we have placed Irish creamery butter beyond the capacity of too many Irish families to buy and consume.</P>
    <P>Rather than create a situation in which there would be reduced consumption at home, we should try to develop the home market and also to increase production.  We could then export our surplus.  These are reasons why we feel there is not in this Bill all that the Government would like us to believe.  We hope and trust it will be to the benefit of the agricultural community and that it will not prove as we suspect, a mere passing of responsibility.  We see in this measure a repetition of enactments which were face-savers for the Government in circumstances that they found embarrassing. A continuous shedding of responsibility will not lead this country into the happy position in which we should all like to see it.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough continuously to take from this House the opportunities that should be the right of this Legislative Assembly.  We should retain our right to make frequent inquiries into marketing as well as into many other operations of State management.  If these rights are handed over to a board the Minister will be in a position to say: &ldquo;I have no responsibility in the matter.  It is a matter for An Bord this or An Bord that.&rdquo; That would be the end of the question.  Ultimately, such procedure will lead to frustration among those engaged in this industry.</P>
    <P>It is well that there is enthusiasm among agricultural organisations who are prepared to give of their best to educate and bring modern facilities to the doors of many thousands of our farmers.  These men and women are prepared to shoulder a lot of responsibility. Possibly they are prepared to shoulder more responsibility than they would if they knew all the factors involved. It would be criminal to abuse their enthusiasm by unloading so much <Col N="1017" /> responsibility on them and then saying: &ldquo;We have washed our hands of it.  That is no longer our problem.  That is now the problem of such and such an organisation or such and such a group of representatives of organisations in a Board we have created.&rdquo; That would do much more than dampen the ardour of those undertaking such responsibility. It would have a very detrimental effect on the future of our agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt but that this Bill, which is to set up An Bord Bainne, will be welcomed by everybody who has the interest and future prosperity of this country at heart.  Over the past few years, rapid and radical changes have taken place in political, cultural and economic fields throughout the world.  In the economic field, methods of salesmanship have improved out of all knowledge. The nation which is willing to rest on its oars and simply throw its produce on the export market in the hope that it will sell itself soon finds itself accepting the lowest prices and also finds itself with large surpluses left on its hands.</P>
      <P>A small nation such as ours, which is competing with large and well-developed nations, must make up in efficiency what it may lack in production and wealth.  When we realise that agriculture is the back-bone of our economy, it is only right that we should make every effort to improve the salesmanship of our agricultural produce on the export market.  It was with this aim in view that the late Seán Moylan, when Minister for Agriculture, asked this House to vote £250,000 for market research and it is mainly on the results of this research that this Bill has come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dairying industry and the cattle industry which is allied to it accounts for a very large percentage of our agricultural output.  For that reason, it is only right that it should get priority when we come to consider ways and means of selling our agricultural produce on the export market. Since I came into public life, I have been particularly interested in this matter of marketing our agricultural <Col N="1018" /> produce on the export markets.  To be candid, I wondered why more was not done in regard to this vital matter many years before.  As I mentioned on an Estimate for the Department of Agriculture a couple of years ago, I made a survey of shops and stores in the Liverpool area, mainly with the intention of trying to find out why our butter was then fetching such a low price on the British market.  At that time, I was not aware that the bulk of our butter was being sent to the Liverpool area.  When I read the Advisory Committee's report, I found that their findings were very much the same as mine.  Possibly the reason for that is the fact that the bulk of our butter is being sold in the Liverpool area.</P>
    <P>The securing of an economic price for our creamery butter is, and will continue for some time to be, one of our biggest problems.  When we consider that three-quarters of the milk products exported by us in 1958 consisted of creamery butter, we can realise the great problem which faces us in this matter.  There is a suggestion by the Advisory Committee, which I believe is a good one, that we should be in a position to change from producing one type of milk product to another type when the market is found more favourable for the other type. We will all agree, however, that this is not something which can be done quickly.  It is a matter which will take considerable time and for which a considerable amount of planning and organisation will be needed.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with the Advisory Committee that whatever measures we may take in the interim to help in the disposal of our surplus milk products, the future of the dairying industry depends on a long-term, well-planned policy.  From what I can gather from the Advisory Committee's report and from the various investigations I have made myself, I feel that we will all agree the foundation stone of a reliable export trade must be a regular supply to the export market.  In most stores which I visited in the Liverpool area, I found that the shopkeepers and customers were well satisfied with Irish butter, well satisfied with its quality, <Col N="1019" /> but it was pointed out to me that when a customer bought Irish butter for a number of weeks and had acquired a taste for it, he found he was no longer able to get it because of a short supply here at home.  The result was that, perforce, he had to change over to buying butter from some other country and eventually he acquired a taste for this other butter and rarely returned to buying Irish butter when it came into supply again.</P>
    <P>It is shown in the report that when a plentiful supply of butter was being exported to Britain, the difference between the price of Danish and British butter, on the one hand, and of Irish butter, on the other, was very great.  On the other hand, when the supply of butter from this country was scarce on the export market, the differential in price between Irish and Danish butter closed up very considerably. I am convinced that this was not caused by the normal supply and demand conditions.  I say this because, in the first place, we supply a very small percentage of the total amount of butter consumed in Britain and, in the second place, it is reasonable to assume that when we had large supplies of butter here, both the Danish and British also had large supplies of buttter.</P>
    <P>I feel the reason why the prices closed up when we had only a small supply to export was that there was a small circle of people in Britain who were really anxious to get Irish butter and were willing to pay for it when it was in small supply.  When Irish butter is cut off from the market altogether, the exporters find that to get into the market again, they must start rock bottom.  As I mentioned before, people after a certain time lose the taste for Irish butter and in order to try to get them to acquire this taste again, Irish butter has to be sold at the lowest possible price.</P>
    <P>No industry could stand this type of fluctuation.  We have got to try to streamline our exports of butter and our salesmanship, just the same as we are endeavouring to streamline the sales of our industrial goods on the foreign market.  I feel that the present <Col N="1020" /> policy of sending supplies to a small area in Britain is the sensible one, so long as our supplies are limited.  When an area is selected by An Bord Bainne and when it is satisfied that it will be able to supply the market regularly, then it should embark on an intensive advertising campaign to endeavour to sell as much of our butter as possible.</P>
    <P>While on this matter of advertising, I should like to point out that a lot of nonsense is being talked about advertising. We are advised by this body and that body that we should advertise <i>ad lib</i> but we must realise that when we advertise it is good business practice &mdash;in fact, it is the only business practice &mdash; to be in a position to supply the market.  It is extremely dangerous to create a demand for a product and then be unable to supply that product regularly because it not only damages the product when it comes into plentiful supply again but damages the sale of other products from the same source.</P>
    <P>The question of agents was dealt with in the report.  I am inclined to feel that the fewer agents we have, the better, particularly when our supplies are not large.  An agent is much more interested in selling a commodity when he has a considerable amount of that commodity to sell.  If we increase the number of our agents and each of them has proportionately less to sell, his interest in selling our product will lessen.  Several areas have been mentioned in the report as being areas into which we should endeavour to get our butter.  Glasgow and Cardiff were mentioned.  I feel that Glasgow would be an excellent area to select because a considerable number of our people live there.</P>
    <P>I would agree to a considerable extent with the Advisory Committee that we should not rely too much on sentiment in the matter of selling our goods on the export market.  When we look around and ask ourselves how many people who go into our shops ask specifically whether an article is Irish-produced before buying it, we realise that the number is relatively small.  When we, with an economic necessity to buy Irish, are not as interested <Col N="1021" /> as we ought to be, we should not rely too much on our people abroad, who have not the same economic necessity as we have, doing better than ourselves.  At the same time, I feel it would be easier to promote the sale of Irish-made products in a city where there are a considerable number of Irish people living than in a city where the people are strangers, so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>The question of packaging was fully dealt with in the report.  Personally, I was always inclined to favour the packaging of butter here at home, first, because it gave employment and, secondly, because we would be certain that the butter sold as Irish butter on the export market was Irish.  I appreciate from the report that there are very considerable difficulties in the way of exporting our butter in packaged form.</P>
    <P>There is one suggestion in the report which I feel could lead to considerable controversy.  I refer to the suggestion that we should consider safeguarding our butter exports, at a time of short supply by importing foreign butter.  That is a very wide problem.  I believe the Danes do something like that.  Of course, really to overcome the problem with regard to our exports of butter to the British market, we would have to get to the point where we could supply the market regularly and we must carry a certain amount of the burden in the interim period.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sale of cheese on the export market, I would say the main difficulty is caused by the fact that we consume so little cheese here at home.  In any of our native industries &mdash; I am not referring now to industries set up for export only&mdash;it is regarded as a necessity that we should have reasonable home consumption of the article produced, in order to be able to compete successfully on the foreign export market.  I believe we should try to promote cheese consumption at home to help our cheese manufacturers to export successfully.  A suggestion was made that we should begin with the children. That is a good idea, because <Col N="1022" /> after a certain age, it is difficult to acquire a taste for cheese to the extent that it will be consumed in considerable amounts.</P>
    <P>Apart from the discussions on this Bill, reference was made on a number of occasions to the possibility of getting our milk products into the markets of the newly-free States in Africa.  I have no doubt that the Danes and the Dutch are doing their utmost to get into these markets, but I feel that we have an advantage over them in so far as there is a fund of goodwill for this country in many of these newly-free States because of the very fine work of our missionaries in developing hospitals, schools, and so on.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made in the report to the possibility of selling butter in areas other than those already mentioned in Britain.  I made a suggestion some time ago that it might be possible for us to establish something on the lines of a supermarket in London, a place where Irish goods would be on view and for sale, a place to which people interested in buying Irish goods could be directed.  If we had something on those lines, we might be able to develop and expand our sales in that area.  Again, of course, we come back to the question of whether or not we can supply the market.  As I said before, our main objective should be to create a regular supply to small areas, first, and develop from there.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that there will be a number of people on the board who are experts in the production of milk products, that the chairman of the board will be elected by the members and that there will be as little red tape as possible.  I should like to wish the new board well.  I have no doubt it will do a considerable amount to improve the dairying industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note from the Minister's statement that he welcomes the tendency towards increased milk production.  Milk is the basic product of our agricultural industry and our cattle and pig industry really depend on it.  It is an accepted fact that agriculture is our great industry. Naturally, we in the southern counties <Col N="1023" /> are very interested in anything which appertains to the dairying industry.  If the setting-up of this board means some prosperity for the dairying industry, which is very much in the doldrums, everyone must welcome its establishment.  If the board produces a ready answer as to how this industry is to be put properly on its feet, certainly no one from any side of the House will quibble with it.</P>
      <P>Everyone is aware that there are fluctuations in the dairying industry, seasonal and otherwise.  The year before last was a fair indication of how the weather can affect the production of milk, or the production of butter, into which the bulk of our milk is channelled.  In the past year, we did not have substantial exports of butter and, consequently, the money made available by the House to support such exports was not needed.</P>
      <P>The dairy farmer is always concerned with the fact that the more milk he produces, evidently, the more difficulty he runs into.  The question was raised here this evening as to whether the Irish farmer should go in for dairying cattle, or cattle for beef.  We are well aware over the years of the problem which is created when we have an exportable surplus of butter.  In our attempts to get into foreign markets, we find that the exports of such products as butter and cheese have to be subsidised.  That means that the people must produce to support and enable that product to be put on the market which is, in the main, the British market.  That leaves the farmer &mdash; and certainly the southern farmer &mdash; in the position that he cannot wholly concentrate upon milk.  In addition, perhaps it would not be wise, having regard to the present tendency of cattle prices, to go in for cattle entirely.  Consequently, traditionally for a great many years we have had the dual purpose cow as the foundation of both the dairying industry and the cattle industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions which this Board is now to carry out seem to me, from reading this Bill, to becatered for already in, as has been mentioned by <Col N="1024" /> the Leader of the Opposition, the machinery of the Butter Marketing Board.  Having read how the personnel of this Board are to be selected and noting from the Minister's speech that there is to be a representative of cream exporters, I must confess that at the moment I have not been able to find directly where this representative is among the members set out in the various sections.</P>
    <P>Unless I am mistaken in my reading of the sections, three are to be members of the Board on the basis of the co-operative dairying societies in nine counties.  One member is to be selected by the Dairy Disposal Company; one from the manufacturers of cheese; one from the manufacturers of milk powder; one from the manufacturers of chocolate crumb; one nominated by the Minister who is a representative of the company which is the Dairy Disposal Company; and then an officer of the Minister.  Those, so far as I can make out, are the nine members of this Board.  I do not know how the cream exporters are to have representation unless some direction is given that one member shall be a representative of those who are now known as the Irish Cream Exporters Association.</P>
    <P>Again, while the various co-operative dairy societies in nine counties are to have the choosing of three members, a body which, in the south of Ireland, has concerned itself very much with the interests of the Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, has no direct representative on the Board.  In addition, the technical experts of the industry, so far as the co-operative societies are concerned, the managers, have not secured any representative on this Board.  I think that, when a board such as this, by which it is hoped to improve the dairying industry is constituted, we certainly ought to include on it one of these people who represent the technical side of the production of milk products.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's speech that some of the products of milk come under the control of the Board, but there are certain products exempted and in that respect, the Minister mentioned certain types of cheese.  I should like the Minister to indicate to us what <Col N="1025" /> special varieties of cheese are to be exempted from the marketing functions of this Board and also to indicate to us, if the price of Irish cheese fluctuates on the British market as it does at the moment even with a subsidy, will the Board accept responsibility then for the marketing of cheese without loss to the producers of cheese?</P>
    <P>Another question which suggests itself is: by what means and in what markets does the Board intend to develop the export of cheese?  What assistance will the Board give to the existing manufacturers of cheese who undertake research and development of other varieties of cheese, its packing or its presentation?  I notice that milk powder is to be exempted.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether it is the intention of the Board eventually to take over the purchasing and marketing of milk powder, both whole milk and skim milk?  I understand that an American company who are interested in the purchasing of whole milk powder from Ireland are coming here.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate, if there is any contract with this company, the basis of the contract and what quantity we may expect the company to take.  In regard to the purchase of such products, the manufacturers of milk powder would be very interested to know what price they might expect, what the market tendency might be and whether an export subsidy will be applied to the export of milk powder.  I am sure that standards of cleanliness will be required.  What steps will be taken by the Department to ensure that a bacteriologically clean milk supply will be available to measure up to these standards?</P>
    <P>At the present time, the marketing of milk powder and chocolate crumb is to be left outside the jurisdiction of the Board.  These products are to be exempted.  Since they are being exempted, it occurs to one to ask why these interests should have representation on the Board.  If they are to be removed from its jurisdiction, why should those interests have direct representation on the Board?</P>
    <P>The hopes expressed for the success of this Board are sentiments <Col N="1026" /> which everybody connected with the dairying industry will endorse.  If, indeed, only half these hopes are realised they will play a tremendous part in relieving the anxieties of dairy farmers at the present time.  They have experienced over the years, and are still experiencing, great difficulties in a difficult trade.  Not alone have they to shoulder the burden of an uncertain market but, in regard to the production of milk, they are engaged in the very vital task of eradicating bovine tuberculosis.  Both phases of the industry are fundamentally connected. The dairy farmer who is faced with the problem of clearing his herds, and the vast capital expenditure involved in that, will welcome this Bill provided that the setting up of this Board will give him an adequate return on the milk he produces.</P>
    <P>The dairy farmers will require, however, from the Minister, an assurance that the activities of this Board will produce for them a speedy solution of the problems with which they are confronted.  If the Board succeeds in doing that, then I, as a representative of a dairying area, welcome the measure.  When the Minister comes to reply, I invite him to answer the questions which the dairy industry sees fit to pose at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a representative of one of the main dairying areas in the country I welcome this Bill.  May I say that I have been rather disappointed with the reception given to the Bill by some members on the Opposition Benches?  The allegation was made and repeated that the purpose of the Bill is to enable the Government to shelve their responsibilities in regard to the marketing of dairy produce.  There is nothing to sustain that allegation as far as the Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to go back many years to find out the real reason for the introduction of this measure.  Producers of milk, whilst appreciating the good work done by the existing marketing machinery under Government auspices, have a feeling that an organisation directly under their control <Col N="1027" /> charged with the responsibility of marketing would do a better job.  We all know the mental attitude of people generally, whether they be business people or engaged in agriculture, towards the handling of business matters by a Government Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to say that the marketing organisation under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture has done a very good job.  How good that job has been will be realised only when the new board comes to tackle the same problem and gains some experience. Until we read the very comprehensive report of the Advisory Committee many of us did not realise how complex the problem is. Successive Governments have played around with the idea for some years that a thorough investigation should be made into existing conditions with regard to marketing.  The decision taken by the late Minister for Agriculture, Senator Moylan, to set up a marketing board was a very realistic approach to the problem.  The advisory committee was set up in due course, and set to work.  As a result, a very comprehensive report has been introduced.  Certain recommendations have been made, and the Bill now before the House is framed generally on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>We shall do good work for those whom we represent and for the country as a whole if we confine our remarks now to the measure before us for consideration.  I have listened to some rambling speeches here this evening dealing with the operations of other Government boards and, in my opinion, these have no relevance, good, bad, or indifferent to the measure now before us.</P>
    <P>The first consideration is the responsibility the Government should have in relation to the marketing of agricultural produce.  Should a Government have such a responsibility in relation to agricultural produce any more than they have responsibility for the marketing of industrial products? We know that the dairying industry has not had the same opportunity of <Col N="1028" /> becoming organised as other industrial activities have had.  It was for that reason presumably that the Department of Agriculture, 20 or 25 years ago, took on the job of organising the agricultural market.</P>
    <P>I have been told by those in the creamery industry that the position 35 years ago was chaotic, just before the Dairy Produce Acts came into operation.  In various parts of the country we can still see the remains of creameries which went out of commission.  The creamery organisation did not seem then to be able to survive.  Co-operative creameries did not have either the co-operation or the allegiance that they deserved.  There was a trade war on the whole time between these creameries and those owned by private interests.  By and large, as a result of Government intervention, that state of affairs was corrected.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have been faced with fluctuations in supplies of dairy produce.  I doubt if any other organisation could handle such a complex problem as one which is representative of all the interests concerned and I am glad to note from the Bill that such a very close examination has been made of that aspect of the matter.  The Minister is endeavouring to create now an organisation which should have every opportunity of being a success. The task before the board will not, however, be an easy one.  The report of the advisory committee lists in great detail the various problems that have to be tackled.  I think the board will have a very big job of work before it.</P>
    <P>The construction of the board, in accordance with the terms of the Bill, makes for confidence and optimism that a body will now be set up capable of facing the task and doing a good job.  For the first time the producers. have an opportunity of selecting their representatives and I know they will select persons who will be capable of discharging the duties assigned to them. That is a very important aspect of this Bill.  When one gets an opportunity of selecting someone to do a job for one, one has much more confidence in that person than if the representative were nominated by somebody else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> One thing that impressed me very much is the provision in the Bill for the appointment of senior executive officers of the board by open competition. This arrangement is highly desirable because it ensures that the best men possible will get those assignments. In fact, the Bill goes out of its way to determine that no appointments except those of a minor nature can be made by any other means.  The Minister had been very wise in doing that.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Minister in introducing this Bill is to ensure that a general reorganisation of marketing conditions will take place.  We note from the report of the advisory committee the difficulties that exist under the present arrangement.  The report lays great emphasis on the lack of a continuous supply of milk products and that is the greatest problem the new board will have to face.  The pattern of things in the dairy industry has been such that a substantial supply of our total milk produce comes in in the late spring and summer months.  We are never able to keep up a reasonable volume of supply over the winter period and the early spring.  But for the fact that the Butter Marketing Board has made available a system of cold storage our general supplies to the British market would be absolutely disorganised. However, butter coming from cold storage after some weeks is not as palatable as when first produced, and the new board will, at the outset, have to take some steps towards persuading our farmers to produce even limited minimum quantities of milk during the winter periods.</P>
    <P>In the past few years the average supply of milk to the creameries has been around 300 million gallons per annum.  That is very substantial and its volume constitutes a great problem as far as the export of its products is concerned.  The feeling among dairy interests has been that too much of our milk goes into the production of butter.  We are always pressing on various Governments to take steps to divert a good deal of the milk supply to other purposes.  Very praiseworthy efforts have been made by Governments, semi-Government and outside organisations to that end in recent <Col N="1030" /> years.  The quantity of milk going into chocolate crumb has been substantially increased over the past few years and it shows promise of expanding in future years.  The price paid for milk diverted to that purpose is in fact more favourable than if it were put to any use.</P>
    <P>There are certain drawbacks, however. While compensation is paid for the loss of the skim milk, the farmer is at a disadvantage by the lack of it for the rearing of young stock.</P>
    <P>We know that there is great promise too for future development in cheese. Not alone have the Dairy Disposals Company seen fit to erect a very substantial cheese plant in Limerick but we also have a well-known European interest setting up a similar factory in another part of the country to do likewise.  I think that there is still room for expansion in that regard.  The home consumption of cheese is deplorably low but it is a product that was never pushed on the home market. One speaker here made a good point in that connection when he suggested that young people of school-going age should be persuaded to use cheese products as a substitute for butter so that they would become cheese-minded in their later years.  We might then be able to stimulate considerably the home market for cheese.</P>
    <P>We have also the conversion of milk into milk powder.  I do not think that there is a very substantial market in Britain for that product but I do feel that we should take advantage of the market that exists in African countries where there is a fund of good will for the Irish nation as a whole. We may be able to dispose of quite a lot of milk powder in those countries. It is something which lends itself to quick and inexpensive transport. Butter, in my opinion, will still form a substantial part of the products from our milk and we will have to concentrate our attention, generally speaking, on the markets for butter in Britain and in any other countries where we can find them.</P>
    <P>Whenever discussion takes place on the question of the Irish butter marketing organisation in England, people here and in England complain that Irish butter is never available for sale <Col N="1031" /> there.  I think the reason for that is that the supply does not form a very substantial part of the total consumption. It is quite understandable why the product is not generally available in any of the bigger cities in England when we cannot maintain a continuous supply.  In the marketing of any article, the first essential is continuity of supply, apart from the quality of the article and the usual other requirements.</P>
    <P>The biggest difficulty our new Marketing Board will have&mdash;I expect it will be charged with this responsibility also because it relates to supply &mdash;is in keeping up a regular, systematic supply to any market it may find.  I do not think this very onerous task will, however, prove to be beyond the capabilities eventually of the new Board because the people who are likely to be on that Board will be men of experience and foresight; many of them with business ability. I am sure their combined efforts will enable them to cope with their many problems.</P>
    <P>The question of cream exports, whether tinned or otherwise, has been dealt with in the report.  We are glad to learn that fresh cream exports during 1959 brought in the very substantial sum of around £380,000.  One thing in the report at which I was amazed was that the total amount of cream exported to Britain and the Six Counties constituted about 8 per cent. of the total exports of these countries.  There is a great possibility of development in relation to cream. The satisfactory feature about it is that evidently it does not require any subsidy from the Exchequer.  For that reason alone, we would be well advised to have our new Board concentrate on pure cream as much as possible.  The demand for fresh cream appears to be growing, and the cream produced in this country and sent to England seems to command a ready market there at a very remunerative price.  I understand the sale of cream is mostly confined to a number of the bigger centres in England and there is a very wide field to be explored still in the sale of that <Col N="1032" /> product.  I sincerely hope the new Board will pursue that at the earliest possible moment and get the results that are expected.</P>
    <P>In regard to the constitution of the Board, the Minister is setting out to have the Board appointed along very practical lines.  The co-operative societies who receive about three-quarters of the total milk intake by the creameries are getting representation on the Board in proportion to the volume of their supplies; likewise, with the Dairy Disposal Company. One matter which is not quite clear in the Bill is in relation to the detailed method of election of representatives from the co-operative creameries.  The Minister, in his opening statement, explained that the creameries would appoint three representatives to represent the co-operative creamery societies in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is not generally known that there are co-operative dairy society members, a small number I admit, who are not milk suppliers and similarly, there are milk suppliers supplying milk to the co-operative creameries who are not members.  I do not know what obligation, if any, is imposed on the society to call all their members or suppliers together for the purpose of giving them a direction as to the persons to be supported for election to this Board.  If the system is as democratic as it is in the case of the Dairy Disposal Company, each co-operative society should be obliged by statutory regulation to convene a special general meeting for the purpose of giving the ordinary supplier an opportunity of choosing the person or persons, as the case may be, he desires the society to support for membership of the Board.</P>
    <P>If that pattern is to be followed, the system proposed for selection by the Dairy Disposal Company would not be quite in harmony with what it is proposed the society should do.  I make a suggestion to the Minister for what it is worth, that each of the several groups of creameries under the control of the Dairy Disposal Company be regarded as a unit; each unit according to the number of suppliers would be apportioned a number for <Col N="1033" /> the purpose of forming an electorate. In due course, that electorate would meet and from the people composing the electorate, one person would be appointed to represent the Dairy Disposal Company.  That would bring it into line with the system it is proposed to adopt in the case of the co-operative societies.  In any event, it is satisfactory that every milk supplier to a Dairy Disposal creamery will get an opportunity of having his say in the appointment of the person who is to represent the Dairy Disposal Company. I do not know whether the suggestion I have made to the Minister would work out in practice but I think it is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The ordinary milk suppliers naturally have a very keen interest in the legislation contained in this Bill.  They think it is a practical approach to a very grave problem and that the economic position should be improved in course of time when the Board gets on its feet.  The producers realise that the Board will not have an easy task on its hands.  They will, however, have a reasonable amount of patience in awaiting the results which the Marketing Board activities will bring in the early stages of its work.  I am sure that, with co-operation, a smooth change-over from the existing organisation to the new will take place.  We are dealing with the rehabilitation of the biggest and most promising industry in the country.  Every Deputy should consider this legislation in a proper spirit and this House should give a lead so far as co-operation is concerned.  It is natural that there should be criticism, and I am sure that nobody would welcome positive criticism more than the Minister.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again pay tribute to the various Government organisations which have been dealing with the dairy industry since the establishment of native government.  They have done a good job, and a job which is not appreciated as it should be.  We shall have to wait and see if the alternative we are proposing by this Bill brings about the better results we expect.  I sincerely hope it will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather lengthy Bill.  It contains 64 sections, <Col N="1034" /> various subsections and various subdivisions of some of these subsections. When we realise that dairying and its associate products form an integral part of our agricultural economy, indeed an indispensable part, we are not surprised that a Bill catering for these activities should be a compre-. hensive Bill.  The fact that this Bill is before the House is an indication that the Minister and his Government are anxious about the future of the dairying industry.  It is also a vindication of the often-repeated contention that the dairy cow is the basis of our agricultural development.  If this Bill or a similar Bill succeeds in its objective and provides the markets envisaged, then the dairying industry is assured of a permanent future.</P>
      <P>Side by side with that will go the expansion of our livestock trade, which is such a valuable economic factor. Deputy Donegan, in his remarks here, could be misinterpreted.  He said we cannot go in for beef side by side with dairying.  I am sure what he meant to convey is that the dairying industry is native to certain localities and that, side by side with that, must go the development of beef cattle. We in the south raise many cattle that find their way into the midlands, to Meath and Westmeath.  If they were not there, it would be a very serious matter.  Therefore, the dairying industry is indispensable to the production of beef.</P>
      <P>In these days of intense competition, we must face the fact that our quality must resist a challenge from any other nation in the markets into which we hope to send our products.  Side by side with quality must go packaging under the most hygienic and attractive conditions.  Behind these two requirements, there must be expert salesmanship. That is the kernel of the whole success envisaged in this Bill. It is quite true we are making a late start and that this Bill is many years late.  At the same time, we are a young nation.  Our milk producers were scattered units throughout the country.  In later years, they were organised into creamery areas and they are now in a position to increase production because of the possibility of increasing the fertility of their lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> Therefore, we welcome this Bill, even at this late stage.  We hope it will be a success.  In the past, our people had not the financial resources and opportunities because of their scattered way of life.  They had not available to them the modern travel facilities we have now.  It would have been impossible for them to get together in an organised way in order to push their products into foreign markets.  It is quite true that our products do not find their way even to the market nearest to us, Great Britain.  People on holidays there, those who have gone on business and those who have gone there to work, all contend that they have found it almost impossible to secure Irish dairy products in the various centres in Great Britain.  The market is there, provided we have the quality and the push to see that our goods find their way into these areas. If the Board succeeds in its objective, it will have broken virgin soil.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister has in mind when he gives power to the Board to secure premises and to purchase land.  Does he intend that the Board should extend its activities and purchase premises abroad?  Does he intend that the Board should establish agencies abroad?  Does he intend that distribution centres under the authority of the Board should be established in other countries?  I think that would be wise, if possible, but it may be too costly.  I am sure the Minister will explain to us what is in his mind.  Will he put any plans at all before the Board or will he give them a free hand entirely?  Will he not lay down some general plan which the Board could usefully follow?</P>
    <P>The Board has power to impose levies.  It may happen that the Board will grow into a vast organisation.  It will have to pay officials, if it is to extend its aims and objects.  Perhaps the Board in its extension may impose levies that would be a burden eventually on the producers.  The larger the Board becomes, the more levies it will impose in order to defray its expenses together with whatever <Col N="1036" /> the Government will provide for it out of the Central Exchequer.  I can see the Board becoming a very important body.  It will build up a very large retinue of officials in the course of time.  That will be a tribute to the success of the Board, probably, provided it does not become unwieldy and over-expensive and a burden on the producers.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to speak about the composition of the Board, but I would make this suggestion to the Minister.  I make it in all earnestness for the sake of the future of the dairying industry.  I would include on that Board one representative from the N.F.A. and one from Macra na Feirme.  I know nothing whatever about these associations except what I read about them.  They are voluntary organisations speaking with a national voice and their inclusion would give a national complexion to this Board. More important than all that is the fact that it would bring these representatives of producers into close contact with the realities and the difficulties of securing markets abroad and they, in turn, would be more appreciative of the difficulties and less critical. They would be able to tell their farmer colleagues of their experience as members of the Board.  I appeal in all earnestness to the Minister to consider that point in his own interest and particularly in the interests of the country and of the dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>There is not so much in the Bill as one would think at the start.  There was a good deal of substance in most of what Deputy Donegan said this evening.  He asked if we expected the Department of Agriculture to send officials to other nations in order to sell our goods.  I do not think anybody expects that, but there is nobody more competent to make a survey of the market possibilities in Great Britain than our Department of Agriculture. Our Department of Agriculture is internationally known and has the confidence of the people of this country because of its many experts and its efficiency.  I have no doubt that these men could make a survey of the market possibilities abroad and very considerably help the Board to get off to a good start.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> There is an urgency now.  The later we start, the more difficult the problem and the greater the competition we have to face.  While we were building up over the years and did not realise the value of exports for the survival of the nation, other nations had got into markets that we might have gone after, had we been in a better position to undertake these responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I do not think that in the Bill as presented to us now the Minister has retained sufficient powers to preserve the supremacy of this Parliament.  I believe in democracy.  This Parliament should be supreme in the eyes of the elected Government on all occasions. In connection with certain national activities which are controlled by boards, we sometimes hear Ministers state that the Minister has no function in the matter.  Such replies indicate stultification of the House. This House should be supreme on all occasions and the Minister should retain sufficient powers so that the House would be supreme in connection with the Board's activities.</P>
    <P>First of all, it lessens the functional value of this House, if we delegate all our responsibility to public boards or independent boards.  In that way, autocracy would be built up and that would not be desirable.  We have that in the case of C.I.E. to some extent and in the case of the E.S.B.  I shall not go into that matter now but I would not like to see this Board put in the same category as these bodies who have become rather autocratic in their approach.</P>
    <P>There has not been much criticism of the Bill.  This Parliament would have no function at all if we were all in agreement about every point in a Bill.  It is a good thing that there is this exchange of views.  It would be better still if we could deviate from the practice that has been established here and that when Bills are to be introduced, the Minister, by a motion, would initiate a debate so that he could go back to his experts, having heard the views expressed by members of the House.  In that way it might be possible to produce a Bill which would be more generally acceptable, perhaps that would be more in keeping with <Col N="1038" /> the circumstances and the needs of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the early speeches made on this measure tended, I suppose, in a jocose way, to accuse me as Minister for Agriculture of a desire to transfer my responsibilities to a body such as the Board it is proposed to set up.  All I can say in that regard is that while I do not claim to know the minds of all the Deputies, I venture to hazard the guess that I, more than any other, have the deepest suspicion and the gravest doubt about the utility of boards unless the task being given to them is, in the opinion of those with some considerable judgment, one which can be handled more efficiently by such a body than in any other fashion.</P>
      <P>If I were asked which aspect of agriculture would seem to fit in with a board such as that proposed here, I would certainly say the dairying industry. I and some of the other speakers here have paid tribute to the manner in which the affairs of that industry have been looked after by the Butter Marketing Board, but in recent times, we have all realised that the scope that was possible in their case was very limited.  It was limited in the sense that the price determined by the Government for butter determined the price of milk.  Those who were handling the milk sent by farmers to creameries were influenced, naturally, by the assurance which they had as to what they would receive for the product.  If they converted that milk into butter, the price was known in advance.  If the milk was converted into cheese or any other milk products, there was no such assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the report of the Advisory Committee on this subject and I hope the Deputies who are interested in this matter have read it.  I did not find myself in agreement with all they recommended but I was very impressed by their reasoning and their understanding of many of the problems that confront the dairying industry. Their recommendations were very instructive.  You sometimes find that people talk and write about their failure to find Irish butter on sale in Britain &mdash; in such centres as London. <Col N="1039" /> Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham. They have no appreciation at all of the very small percentage of Irish butter imported by Britain in relation to their total imports.  Any one who reads the recommendations of the Advisory Committee as to the line of action that should be pursued by a body like the one suggested here could not fail to be impressed.</P>
    <P>During this debate, there were very few contentious questions raised.  This advisory body, which was set up to deal with milk production, was composed, among others, of creamery managers and representatives of other commercial bodies, chocolate crumb interests and cheese-making interests. There are many proposals made by the body which I would not hesitate to meet, but there are others which I am prepared to argue about with anybody. A number of questions were directed to me to which I should like to reply briefly.  I was asked, for example, why I did not adopt the recommendation to appoint representatives of the Creamery Managers' Association.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I gave a good deal of thought to that question. Not only that: I met a deputation from the Association which, I agree, is composed of very excellent people.  However, I cannot see, having regard to the case that could be made for representation for several other important interests, why the Creamery Managers' Association should have the right to appoint one man on the Marketing Board.  I knew that if the electorate of the co-operative societies and the electorate of the Dairy Disposal Board chose, they could, and possibly will, elect a creamery manager. There is nothing to prevent them.  In addition, I knew that the chocolate crumb industry was being given representation and that there was always the possibility that the person who would represent that interest might be a creamery manager.</P>
    <P>As I said, much as I regard creamery managers as an excellent body of men, I am not prepared to see this Board composed of nine individuals representative of all those interests, made up entirely of creamery managers. I can assure the House it was <Col N="1040" /> not a question of ignoring the creamery managers; I took this course after consultation with my advisers and using my own judgment and I think I was justified in taking it.</P>
    <P>I was asked also why, since the chocolate crumb industry was excluded from the Board's activities, that industry should be represented on the Board.  It is vital to remember that the Board will have power to support from its resources the producers of chocolate crumb and therefore it is only right that that industry should be represented on the body.  It is also true that the Board will be free to give financial support to the manufacturers of milk powder.  That being the case, it is only fair this industry should also have representation.</P>
    <P>We have in recent times been trying to cope with this problem, knowing it would take us some time to bring the Board into existence.  I would point out that I am not saying this in order to create the impression that a body like that visualised here will give us a milk and honey situation, as far as the dairying industry is concerned.  I do say, however, that I think the Board, properly staffed will be very well able to judge what policy should be pursued in the tackling of the various problems to which I have referred.</P>

    <Title>Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Bill, 1959&mdash;Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Dáil Éireann has been asked to give its final approval to one of the most repulsive pieces of legislation which has come before it in recent years.  This Bill seeks to impose mass medication upon all sections of the Irish people.  Less than one-seventh of the Irish people can possibly acquire any benefit whatsoever from the fluoridation of water supplies.  Less than one-seventh of the Irish people can acquire only a very <Col N="1041" /> temporary relief from dental caries or a temporary postponement of dental caries.  The remaining six-sevenths of the people are being asked to expose themselves to a long intake of a poisonous substance which it has been clinically established builds up in the human system the longer it is taken and as the people who take it grow older.  On that account, Dáil Éireann should pause before it gives its final approval to such an obnoxious Bill.</P>
      <P>Many people have the strongest possible objection to compulsory medication. This Bill contravenes the fundamental rights of the natural law which people enjoy.  It also contravenes our Constitution.  If ever a Bill cries out for reference to the Supreme Court by the President this Bill does.  It may be that the Minister, with his organised body behind him in this House and in another place, may put this Bill into the hands of the President for signature. If it is signed without being referred to the Supreme Court there will be individuals in this country, who, having the strongest objections according to their consciences to the Bill, will be able to establish their rights only by a very expensive and prolonged legal action.</P>
      <P>Since this measure so vitally affects the integrity of human beings and the rights of the people to the integrity of their bodies, there is an obligation on the President and the Council of State to ensure that the Bill will be referred to the Supreme Court to consider whether or not it contravenes the natural rights recognised in the Constitution.  This is not a matter which even the Minister can treat lightly.  One section provides that, in relation to surveys on dental caries and. general medical service, people who object to medical examination need not submit to that examination.  Surely compulsorily to examine a person is an invasion of a much lesser privilege? It is much more serious when, without examination of a person, you compel him to take continuously and without any option an intake of fluorine poison?  That is what you will do, over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will not lose <Col N="1042" /> the opportunity of saying that the Irish Dental Association recently indicated their support for this Bill.  I am no more impressed by that than I would be impressed by a painter who would say a building was a good building because it was well painted or by a plasterer who would say a house was a good house because the plaster he was putting up was well put up or was good plaster.  Our dentists, like dentists all over the world, are not in a position to judge the effect of the intake of poison on the human system.  Very careful examinations by most competent people indicated that very damaging consequences can flow from the intake of fluorine in water.</P>
    <P>The only section which to any extent provides safeguards is that which allows a medical survey to be carried out.  Unfortunately, the words of the Minister on the Report Stage give us serious reason to doubt whether that survey will be objective. He told us his sole reason for inserting the amendment in the Bill was to prove himself right.  If medical surveys are carried out merely to prove an argument they are worse than worthless; they are dangerous.  If we are to have a medical survey of the effects on our people of the fluoridation of our water supplies it must be objective.  I hope that the Minister will assure us that such a survey will be an impartial and objective one and that he will withdraw the statements he made that the purpose of the survey is to prove that he and the public health authorities are right.</P>
    <P>This Bill is highly objectionable in another way.  Our people have had good cause to have confidence in our public health services.  If this Bill becomes law they will have good cause to fear our public health services and our public health servants, because if it is approved it will show a disregard for the fundamental rights of the individual. That is a very dangerous thing and a very dangerous departure and, as I pointed out on previous stages, if we admit for once the right of mass medication, even if it be in regard to a harmless substance &mdash; and there are many who do not regard it as a harmless substance &mdash; there is no end to the mass medication we may <Col N="1043" /> have imposed on us from time to time.  There have been medical crackpots who, from time to time, have suggested schemes of this nature in the past and in some places they have succeeded in persuading people that their particular hobby horses should be ridden by the public.  I greatly fear that if once we open the door to mass medication of the kind contemplated in this Bill we will start a rot which may be extremely difficult to check.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested again and again that the purpose of fluoridated water supplies is to prevent certain chronic diseases and to abolish a substantial amount of the ill-health from which our people suffer.  If that were so it might be argued that on balance this fluoridation of water supplies should be inaugurated because it would remove more ill-health than it would create.  But the scientific examinations conducted elsewhere and the experience of even a short 15 years of fluoridated water supplies elsewhere, give us every reason to fear that we may create more trouble than we have at present.  Experiments carried out in America on more than 600 mice indicate that the life span of mice who drank fluoridated water was reduced by as much as 9 per cent.  One might well imagine that the life span of a mouse is considerably less than the life span of a human being, but fluoridated water supplies have been imposed on people for only 15 years, which is less than one-quarter of the average life span of human beings and we are not yet in a position to know what the effects of fluoridated water may be on a human being who takes fluoridated water for his complete life span.</P>
    <P>To my mind, if it will reduce the life span of human beings on average by as much as one per cent. we are, in this Bill, putting into the hands of our public health officers a murderous weapon which we have no right to give them, even if it has the temporary beneficial effects of which the Minister speaks.  In San Francisco it was discovered, after the water supplies there had been fluoridated, that within two years there was a <Col N="1044" /> 400 per cent. increase in complications and diseases of the thyroid gland. These I respectfully submit are shocking figures.  They should make us pause before we give this Bill any approval whatever.  Again, Dr. Taylor of the University of Texas says that some individuals develop allergic disturbances to fluorine which might not necessarily shorten their life span but would cause a lot of discomfort and disability.  Have we any right to put into the hands of our public departments any weapon or scheme, no matter how well intentioned, which may possibly have these most dangerous effects?  I do not think we have and, therefore, I think we should not give approval to this Bill.</P>
    <P>In many parts of America it has been established that while fluoridated waters may postpone dental caries, it has in a considerable number of cases been the main contributory factor in gum decay and gum trouble and that, while the teeth may remain sound for a longer period than formerly, complications have arisen in connection with the gums of people which were.  not previously experienced.  In a report in the <i>Lancet</i> in 1942 it was pointed out in America that water supplies containing as little as one part per million of fluorine &mdash; the amount provided for in this Bill &mdash; can be associated with certain spinal deformities.  It is an appalling thing that we should give support to a Bill which proposes to compel 50 per cent. of our people to drink fluoridated water supplies which may create spinal deformities.</P>
    <P>It has also been established that fluoridated water increases the mottling of teeth and the Minister brushed that aside by saying it is only of cosmetic significance.  Well, cosmetic significance, particularly to young ladies, can have serious psychological reactions which might be more serious than some of the complaints to which the Minister has referred.  The mottling of teeth can so disfigure the teeth that many of our citizens, particularly the ladies I suppose, may well have to have their teeth extracted and have false teeth put in, so that what the Minister hopes to achieve in one way is going to be defeated in another.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that all the scientific <Col N="1045" /> examinations which have been carried out demonstrate that fluoridation is unsafe and, if it is unsafe, we believe that it is wrong to put into the kitchen of every house a supply of medicine which will be available to any child or adult who wants it.  It is as though we were to allow a doctor to enter a household and, without examining the people in that household, put a bottle of medicine on the table and say to these people.  &ldquo;You can drink as much or as little of that as you like and the result will be that you will not have bad teeth any more.&rdquo; That is what the Minister says and that is the only reason this Bill is being introduced. To my mind, that is a very false ground on which to base this Bill, but it is the beginning and the end of all argument in relation to it.  It was put to the Minister in the course of the debate that he could make available, at small cost, a supply of fluoride tablets which would have the same beneficial effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but what I wanted to stress was that what the Bill seeks to defeat is what the other idea hopes to achieve.  This Bill will not allow a person to decide whether or not he will take fluorine. It compels him to take it, whether or not it will do him any good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in my opening remarks, fluoridated water has no beneficial effect oh any person over 16 years of age, but we are condemning the majority of our people to the intake of a poison which can do them no possible good, and which will almost certainly do them some harm. Perhaps the amount of harm will not be perceptible in the vast mass of the people, but if it does harm to as few as one in 100,000, it will be doing the same amount of harm as is done by that dreadful disease, polio.  One in 100,000 may appear to be of no <Col N="1046" /> consequence, but one in 100,000 is 30 people per annum in this small country of ours.  It seems to me, therefore. that in the face of the serious medical doubts expressed by people who are in a position to judge, this House would be most unwise to put that dangerous weapon in the hands of our public authorities.</P>
    <P>This Bill flies in the face of what the Fluorine Council recommended. That body recommended that a choice should be left to the local authorities. The Minister has stated that his reason for not allowing local authorities a choice in the matter is that councillors like Richie Ryan would be saying the same thing throughout the length and breadth of the country.  He seemed to put that forward as a valid reason for accepting the Bill as it stands. Whether what I say is right or wrong, the fact of the matter is that it needs to be said, in order that people will be on their guard and in order that public health officials will be on their guard.  If our public health authorities are to serve the people, it is very necessary that they should respect the rights of individuals.</P>
    <P>The rights of individuals in any matter are very important and, in the field of medicine, could perhaps be extremely important.  If people object to this mass medication, to my mind, they have a natural right not to have it imposed upon them.  There is nothing in the Bill which allows them to opt out of a fluoridated water supply.  We are, therefore, compelling them to contribute towards the cost of something they do not want; we are compelling them to contribute towards the cost of something which may do them harm; we are compelling them to pay for something which will not be of any use whatsoever to six-sevenths of the people; and we are compelling them to pay for something which could be done more cheaply in another way.</P>
    <P>These are important arguments but they are not, of course, half as important as the fundamental argument of the right of the individual not to have medical treatment imposed upon him against his will.  We have had a discussion with regard to the duties of a <Col N="1047" /> public authority to supply the people with pure water.  Irrelevant arguments and invalid comparisons were introduced between fluoridated water and chlorinated water.  It is a surprise to me that despite the long debate on this matter, that invalid argument is still trotted out.  As has been pointed out from this side of the House, there is a way.  of getting rid of chlorine out of a water supply if a person has an objection to it.  It is simply a matter of boiling the water. There is no such simple way of getting rid of fluorine.  The result is that the masses of our people will not have any opportunity of getting rid of this deadly poison &mdash; and that is what this is.</P>
    <P>There is another fundamental difference which the Minister is trying to camouflage, so I think it is necessary for me to clarify it once again. Chlorine is put into the water supply in order to prevent water from carrying disease.  That is the purpose, and the only purpose, of putting chlorine into water.  Water does not carry dental caries.  Fluorine is not being put into water to prevent the water causing dental caries.  Dental caries is caused by something entirely separate from water.  It is not a communicable disease; it is not a disease carried by water.  Therefore, we are introducing a completely new idea into the treatment of our public water supply.  We are introducing, for the first time, the principle that a public authority has the right to put a medicine, or a poison, or a toxic substance &mdash; call it what you like &mdash; into water, not for the purpose of treating the water, but for the purpose of treating the person who drinks the water.  We are not treating the instrument; we are treating the recipient.</P>
    <P>Again, an invalid comparison has been drawn between the pasteurisation of milk and the fluoridation of water. There is no valid comparison.  Milk is pasteurised to prevent milk carrying disease; water is fluoridated not to prevent water carrying disease but to put a medicine, by compulsion, into human bodies.  One might as well put <Col N="1048" /> cough-drops in a milk bottle as fluoride in water.  That would be a valid comparison. If we were to add medicine to water to prevent gout, chilblains, colic or something else, that would be a valid comparison.  I think we would all object to that.</P>
    <P>What would the members of this House say if their good wives were to insist on their taking a dose of salts with every meal because some members of the household were inclined to be constipated?  Would they not rebel and refuse to take the dose of salts? They could validly say: &ldquo;Maybe Johnny needs the salts but I do not; I am not inclined to be constipated.&rdquo; What then are we trying to do in this Bill to a person who has a mouthful of false teeth?  We are saying: &ldquo;You are going to take fluoridated water even though it will not be of any use to you because Johnny must have it because he has a moutful of natural teeth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We would compel every adult over 16 years who cannot benefit by taking fluoridated water to take it.  We are compelling those who never suffered constipation to take the dose of salts day in, day out.  That is the scientific background that the Minister suggests is the authority for this fantastic measure in mass medication, because mass medication it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister chased after most of the arguments which were developed from this side of the House in the course of the debate.  We know the Minister's artistry.  In approaching such arguments, he seldom deals with the arguments themselves.  He puts up Aunt Sallies of his own choosing and having put up the target, he remains quite near it and it is no trouble to him to knock it down.</P>
    <P>That is not the kind of approach we ought to have to such a very important and highly technical matter. One of the facts disclosed from this side of the House was that the medical advisers of the President of the United States of America view with considerable caution fluoridated water supplies, believing it was dangerous for the President of the United States to take such fluoridated water.  The Minister went hunting, or sent his scouts hunting for some phrase, notion <Col N="1049" /> or idea which might deflate that.  He quoted from Major General Howard Schneider, personal physician to the President, but what he did not quote from was a letter Major General Howard Schneider wrote to Mrs. B.E. Doyle &mdash; she must be of Irish ancestry &mdash;on 21st March, 1955, saying: &ldquo;I keep abreast of the discussions regarding the fluoridation of city water supplies.  Until this discussion is settled, I am employing conservative methods in advising President Eisenhower and Mrs. Eisenhower regarding the water they drink&rdquo;, but President Eisenhower is in the happy position of having not one but many doctors examining the most intimate details of his whole make-up, possibly day in, day out.  There have been available to us all the most intimate diagrams of the good President's intestines. Every time he falls ill, the whole structure of the good President of the United States of America is disclosed to us.</P>

      <P>On the Fifth Stage, only matters contained in the Bill may be debated.  I feel that the Deputy is getting away from the Fifth Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to develop is that a man who has such information available to him in relation to one man believes we should be conservative about the intake of fluoridated water supply.  The Minister is compelling our public authorities, who have not got all this information about each human being within the bailiwick of the authority, to force everybody to take this fluoridated water, without regard to whether or not it may have damaging effects on everybody, nobody or somebody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me very wrong that this House should admit that a public authority has the right to disregard the possible damaging effects which fluoridated water may have upon some people.  We on this side of the House share with the Minister an anxiety to reduce the incidence of dental caries from which so many of our people suffer.  Where we differ from him is the way in which he sets <Col N="1050" /> about it.  We differ from him because we think he is destroying the integrity of our people and because he is seeking to make public authorities do something which it is within the province of the family to do.</P>
    <P>We believe that this Bill seeks to deal with the problem in the wrong way.  We feel that a great deal more could be done to assist people in improving their teeth but we also feel that this Bill is doing it the wrong way because if it postpones dental caries for a couple of years&mdash;it does not prevent dental caries &mdash; it does so at a terrible price &mdash; the price being the invasion of the integrity of human beings, the destruction of the duty and the right of parents, and the subordinating of the dignity and integrity of our people to a very questionable public health policy.  Even if all the beneficial effects and none of the damaging effects which we have heard about in relation to this fluoridated water were to come about, are we entitled to do it and, at the same time, do such serious damage to the rights of the individual?  Even if it is only one individual who objects to this fluoridated water, I believe this House has a duty to protect that individual's natural rights.</P>
    <P>I feel we are invading these rights in an unnecessary way.  If the Minister has his way, it is because, even after several months' debate &mdash; and I say this with the greatest respect for my fellow members of this House &mdash; there is still ignorance and because masses of our people are still ignorant of and indifferent to what the Minister is seeking to achieve in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to think that democracy in this country is balanced on such avery tight rope &mdash; a tight rope of ignorance and indifference. If it be so, I feel that not a little of the blame must lie with the Minister who in the course of this debate has heaped the most appalling calumny on some experts and medical men who have expressed their reasonable fears concerning fluoridation of public water supplies.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that those of us who are opposed to fluoridation are, in effect, ridiculing, <Col N="1051" /> criticising and abusing medical experts. Far from it.  I do not criticise, or doubt, the competence of medical men who have no objection to fluoridation and I respectfully suggest that the Minister should neither doubt nor cast aspersions upon the competence of those who disapprove of fluoridation. It is fair to say that the figures so far as medical opinion is concerned on this very vital problem are 52 per cent. or 53 per cent. in favour and 48 per cent. or 47 per cent. against; and, as a result of my own experience, I have come to the conclusion that many of those who are in favour have not examined the matter fully.</P>
    <P>Since this debate began, I have been approached by, and I myself have approached, many doctors and dentists and I have found that the vast majority are completely ignorant of what fluoridation means and the results it can have.  The notion is abroad that fluoridation will benefit children's teeth and it is, therefore, a good thing.  There, the knowledge and the views of most of those I have consulted, and most of those who have consulted me, stops: because it will do good, we should have it.  When, however, these medical people and dentists read some of the documents made available to me, they were unanimous in the opinion that this compulsory Bill should not pass and that it was wrong to impose on society any system of mass medication which might have damaging effects upon some of the people in that society.</P>
    <P>That is why this Bill should, in my opinion, be opposed.  There is a reasonable alternative; there is a cheap alternative; there are many other ways of improving the dental health of our people.  We could take steps to eliminate the cause of dental caries as against leaving the cause there and trying to prevent its effects, because that is what we are doing in this Bill.  I believe we should pause to consider what may well be the effect of fluoridation of water supplies on the behaviour of our people, particularly our children.  We are spending a little money &mdash; very little money, indeed &mdash; on education in dental hygiene.  A cartoon <Col N="1052" /> appeared in last month's<i>Dublin Opinion</i> and, though it is a humorous journal, humour frequently touches truth.  In the illustration, there are two typical little rough lads going into school; one turns to the other and says: &ldquo;Won't it be great when our water supplies are fluoridated.  We can eat all the sweets we like and we won't have to wash our teeth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that, if we introduce this safety belt which the Minister has in mind, we will discourage children from taking the steps they ought to take in the care of their teeth.  There will probably be a still greater intake of starchy foods.  Parents will not think twice before they feed soft, sugary substances to their children.  The children will not get the same encouragement to wash their teeth because the idea will be abroad that washing teeth is no longer necessary, since fluoridation will take care of them.  Toothpaste will become a thing of the past; the toothbrush will be an antique.  There are many diseases and disabilities which may arise from not washing one's teeth, but, when we provide this excuse for not caring teeth, we may well be creating a trap into which many of our people will fall.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing, but it is a fact, that every community which fluoridated its water supplies has, within a few years, had to increase the number of dentists.  If what the Minister boasts of is certain of achievement under this Bill, how come that there are more jobs for dentists?  How come that in some places the number of dentists has doubled within a matter of ten or 20 years?  I appreciate that teeth will have a longer life if people have an intake of fluorine, but, according to the available information, that longer life is a matter of only two or three extra years.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of fluorine, however, is practically to eliminate the possibility of filling teeth and it is in filling teeth that our dentists build up a considerable part of their practice at the present time.  Fluorine strengthens the outer shell.  In doing so, the teeth become like the famous Maginot Line, the shell which was supposed to protect France for all time <Col N="1053" /> from ever again falling into the hands of the enemy.  The Maginot Line was the fluorine of France but once someone had got around it and once it was pierced, the shell was of no use.  It crumbled away.  That is what happens to our humble teeth when they have been persistently and consistently subjected to an intake of fluorine: they get a hard outer shell, which is as brittle as it is hard and once a breach appears in it, the tooth collapses altogether.</P>
    <P>All these beneficial effects, then, about which the Minister speaks will not necessarily flow from this Bill when it is passed.  It may bring some passing advantage but it will also bring very serious disadvantages, disadvantages which will have serious medical consequences.  It will add to, not lessen, the cost of our public dental services. It will do what none of our medical services do at the moment: it will destroy the right of the individual to the integrity of his own body.</P>
    <P>It may be said again &mdash; I hope not, because it has been said so often and contradicted so often, and because it is invalid &mdash; that we have compulsory vaccination and various inoculations, treatment against smallpox, diphtheria and contagious and infectious diseases generally.  There is a very fundamental difference between such compulsory medical treatment and what is proposed in this Bill.  Medical treatment in the cases I have mentioned is imposed in relation to a communicable disease which can be a danger to fellow citizens.</P>
    <P>It is only because the sufferer is a danger to society that society says &mdash; and I believe society has the right to say &mdash; that the sufferer must receive the necessary medical treatment to remove the illness, because otherwise he is a danger to his fellowmen.  No person with dental caries is a danger to his fellowman and accordingly, you cannot urge as a justification for what the Minister proposes to do any of the established, recognised medical practices. We are introducing into our medical jurisprudence a new idea which offends against the natural law and the rights and duties of parents <Col N="1054" /> and does so unnecessarily.  It does so, not because danger to the individual is a danger to society, but because society believes that persons ought to be freed of this danger whether such persons wish it or not.</P>
    <P>This brings us to another heresy which the Minister propounded &mdash; that the interests of the individual must be secondary to the interests of society. It is agreed that a considerable number of man hours are lost through dental trouble of one kind or another. That is partly true but there are simple methods of avoiding that.  A visit to the dentist in time is the easiest way of avoiding it.  There are many other diseases which would cause less trouble if people took the necessary precautions in time but to introduce this Bill for such a purpose is to contradict ourselves, particularly when we know that the fluoridation of public water supplies has been proved to cause as much trouble as it prevents.  We are not yet in a position to know the damaging effects which may follow the fluoridation of water supplies.</P>
    <P>This Bill would permit the Minister to compel all public authorities who supply piped water to fluoridate their water supplies.  We shall not be in a position to test the effects of fluoridation in certain areas.  It may be argued that we have the experience of other countries but that is not the same thing.  This country may have different elements in its water supplies. Our own bodies may be different from those of people of other countries, different social habits exist here and there are many different considerations to which effect ought to be given before any public water supply is fluoridated.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude throughout the debates on the Bill gives us serious reasons for being concerned.  It would appear from the intolerant manner in which he met fair criticism that he will suffer no criticism and no opposition whatever.  That is why he will not allow local authorities to express any view on the matter.  If that is his attitude, it looks as if he will compel every supplier of piped water to fluoridate the water and it seems <Col N="1055" /> as if he hopes that, by so doing, he will end the controversy.  However, he can rest assured that there are still a number of people who believe that the best protection of liberty is eternal vigilance and that they will not accept lightly what he wishes to impose upon them.</P>
    <P>It would be most undesirable to draw our local authorities into any acrimonious debate regarding this matter and, if the Minister believes that this Bill does not offend against the Constitution and against natural rights, I hope he will use his good offices to ensure that before it is signed by the President it will be referred to the Supreme Court.  If the Bill is upheld by the Supreme Court he can come to me and say: &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;. I am sure that would give him considerable joy.  I would accept such a verdict and would think it preferable to having any lack of confidence in our public health authorities.  That will certainly happen if this Bill as it stands is approved by this House and passed into law.</P>
    <P>We, therefore.  Sir, are not in agreement that this Bill should pass.  We are not in agreement because of the trespass which it commits against the natural rights of our people.  We believe that those natural rights of the individual must be superior to any passing advantage to which the Minister can point.  We believe that its short beneficial effects, even if there was no damage afterwards, do not justify that trespass and we feel that the Bill should be rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just listened to a reticulation of half truths and half falsehoods in which misrepresentation was linked with misrepresentation <i>ad nauseam.</i> The first of these was when Deputy Ryan alleged that when speaking on the Report Stage I said that I was not going to have the surveys that I have provided for made objectively.  I have the script of my speech here and I defy Deputy Ryan to quote the statement that he ascribed to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> On the Second Stage of the Bill Deputy Ryan said this:</P>
    <P>I want to return to Washington, to the first citizen of that great City the first citizen of the sovereign Republic of the United States, President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  He is under medical orders not to drink fluoridated water and he is provided with one gallon of pure water from a spring well every day because his medical advisers &mdash; the best medical advisers in the U.S. &mdash; believe that it would do harm to the first citizen.</P>
    <P>Here is what President Eisenhower himself said at a Press Conference, not in 1955, but in March 7th 1957.  He was asked if he could tell whether he drank bottled water or water from a tap and he replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I don't mind telling you no.  For many years the doctor, because I travelled so much and all around, has always had me on a special water, the name of which I forget, I think it is Mountain Valley water.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President said that the doctor, because the President travels so much, had prescribed that he drink a particular water.  It had nothing to do with the fact that the water supply of Washington is fluoridated.  Deputy Ryan manipulated the truth to suit his baseless case.</P>
    <P>He tried to mislead the House by ascribing the fact that the President of the United States does on occasions drink bottled water to the fact that the water supply in Washington was flouridated, when in fact, the position is that because he may sometimes go to places where the water supply may not be wholesome and his medical adviser on these occasions has recommended him to bring with him a supply of water from a particular spring; presumably because his medical adviser thinks this water is best suited to his condition, he has advised the President to bring a supply with him when he travels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fluoridated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>His interrogator then put the following question: &ldquo;That is bottled water?&rdquo;  And his reply was: &ldquo;Bottled water; I have drunk it for <Col N="1057" /> years.&rdquo;  I hope Deputy Ryan will listen to me and not repeat this falsehood throughout the country because if he does he will be repeating it deliberately with the intention of deceiving the people to whom he is speaking. When the question was put to the President whether he drank tap water or not he said: &ldquo;I do drink tap water here at home&rdquo;&mdash;in Washington&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;but that is just because I figure it is just as good as bottled water.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was then this further question put to the President: &ldquo;Well, some people in the District have quit drinking the District water because they don't approve of fluoridation.  You know, there is a chemical added to the water and the advocates contend that it slows down tooth decay for children.  But the opponents of this idea insist that it may pollute the water, may make it unsafe for drinking.  There is a big controversy going on in New York City at the moment&rdquo;&mdash; a controversy which was carried into the debate on this Bill.  Commenting upon that remark the President answered: &ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;  The interrogator was then proceeding to ask a further question: &ldquo;As to whether they&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; when the President interrupted him &mdash; the President had less patience than I had when I was listening to Deputy Ryan.  He interrupted Mr. McGaffin and said: &ldquo;Well, I'll tell you; in the White House I drink it often, very often.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope I have nailed that falsehood which Deputy Ryan has repeated on several occasions throughout this debate and which I contradicted when first he made the statement that President Eisenhower's medical adviser would not allow him to drink fluoridated water.  I think I have nailed that for good and all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To bolster up his bad case Deputy Ryan referred to a letter written in 1955 by Dr. Howard Snyder.  It stated that because of the controversy he was adopting a conservative attitude towards this question of fluoridation, but that was in 1955.  He wrote a letter later to Dr. Charlotte Brown, Director <Col N="1058" /> of Health, New Canaan, Connecticut, and this letter is dated April 9th, 1958.  I am sure it is available and has been made available to Deputy Richard Ryan.  Here is the text of that letter:</P>
    <P>Dear Dr. Brown,</P>
    <P>I have never seen a case of illness which could be attributed to fluoridation of a community water supply.</P>
    <P>I have no reason not to endorse a health policy that is advocated by the American Medical Association and the United States Public Health Service.</P>
    <P>This evening we heard Deputy Ryan say that no authoritative opinion had been expressed denying that fluoridation would have ill effects upon the health of individuals.  The Consulta tive Council whose report has been made available to Deputy Ryan devoted a considerable part of that report to this question of the possible ill effects of fluoridated water on the general health and on specific conditions. That examination was carried out under the headings of acute poisoning, growth retardation, changes in bones, effects on kidneys, and so on, and the Council came to the conclusion, which they supported by their signatures, that no ill effects on health were to be feared from the drinking of water containing one part per million.  The Expert Committee of the World Health Organisation examined the contention which has been made by Deputy Ryan and others who oppose fluoridation and what they had to say was this:</P>
    <P>All these findings fit together in a consonant whole that constitutes a great guarantee of safety &mdash; a body of evidence without precedence in public health procedures.</P>
    <P>Is that not an expression of authoritative opinion?  Then the British Medical Research Council in 1956 called together a conference of experts to consider this matter and at the conclusion of that conference the following statement was issued:</P>
    <P>The experts agree in general with the conclusions of the United Kingdom Mission which examined <Col N="1059" /> fluoridation in North America in 1953 to the effect that despite considerable interest and research there is no definite evidence that the continuous consumption of fluorides in water at a level of about one part per million is in any way harmful to health.</P>
    <P>Is that not an authoritative opinion? Then the Royal Swedish Medical Board in recommending fluoridation in 1958 said this:</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the Board the inquiry carried out has shown that fluoridation of public water supplies does not involve any demonstrable health hazards even on prolonged consumption of the water.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Export of Rails.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>On Monday, 28th November, I saw in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> that:</P>
      <P>...the Costa Rican freighter, Kyriakoula, arrived from Belfast light to collect a cargo of rails at the John J. Horgan wharf....  The rails were those of the branch line from Headford to Kenmare and from Farranfore to Valentia Harbour, both of which were closed by C.I.E. at the beginning of this year. It is believed to be C.I.E.'s first shipment of rails from the port of Cork. ... altogether she loaded 1,400 tons of rails before sailing for the Italian port of Spezia.  As three lines usually make up a ton in weight, she took aboard altogether 4,000 tons. It is understood that the Board procured an export licence before arranging the shipment.</P>
      <P>When that matter was brought to my attention, I put down a Question for answer today.  As I am not satisfied that the Minister has fully replied to it, I thought it right to raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied, nor are many other interested parties, with the manner in which an export licence was granted to C.I.E. for the export of these rails.  I should like to know what opportunity was given to Irish citizens, or to Irish Steel, of tendering for these rails.  What opportunity was given to farmers and builders to tender for them?  Farmers might require them for the erection of haysheds and other farm buildings, or they might be required for other building purposes. Why were C.I.E. granted this licence for the export of 1,400 tons when an ordinary citizen cannot export scrap, even to the amount of 10 tons?  The export of scrap is entirely prohibited and an Irish citizen cannot export scrap but is obliged to sell to Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if advertisements were inserted in any of the newspapers asking for tenders.  I <Col N="1061" /> should also like to ask him why did C.I.E. not reserve those rails in case it might be necessary subsequently to relay the lines that were closed or for the construction of new lines or the repair of existing lines?  What was the reason for the indecent haste in lifting and disposing of these rails?</P>
    <P>It is doubtful if C.I.E. had ownership of the rails at all, so far as the Kenmare-Headford line is concerned. When that line was first constructed, the ratepayers in the Kenmare-Headford area had to act as guarantors and any losses incurred on that line had to be made good by them.  A rate was struck right up to 1945, until the Transport Act became law.  Thereafter, the ratepayers of South Kerry, as have the ratepayers of the whole of the Republic of Ireland, have had to pay rates and taxes to subsidise C.I.E. and to make up the losses incurred by that company.</P>
    <P>The shareholders, the people who invested money in these railways when first constructed and whose money was eventually lost, should have some claim to these rails.  That applies also to the ratepayers of South Kerry and to the ratepayers and taxpayers of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>None of these matters was included in the Deputy's Question, which deals with a special export licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  Was the money obtained by the export of these rails for the purpose of helping the balance of payments?  Would the Minister tell us what sum was obtained for the rails?  After all, C.I.E. are not like a private individual or even a private company.  They are subsidised by the taxpayers and surely, in these circumstances, we should be told the price obtained, seeing that the people's money is invested in this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole question of closing railways and the haste in removing these rails and exporting them without, perhaps, a right to export them, has certainly caused a great deal of dissatisfaction because in other cases where trains ceased to run, the rails were left there.  In some cases, the <Col N="1062" /> rails are still there, although the railways were closed many years ago.</P>
    <P>Would it not have been possible to give an opportunity to see how the alternative transport system worked before lifting the rails?  Indeed, it would be very useful if people travelling from Valentia Island and Cahirciveen to Dublin, Cork or elsewhere could travel on the railway line, instead of skidding along the roads in cars.</P>

      <P>Is there not indecent haste in rushing these rails to Cork, in not advertising them so that Irish merchants would have an opportunity of bidding for them?  Are there not people in Ireland besides Irish Steel Holdings who would be interested in purchasing these rails? Are there not people who build haysheds for farmers, and farmers and groups of young farmers who would buy some of these rails?  Why was the same procedure not adopted as was adopted in Sligo-Leitrim where the rails were put up for public auction?</P>
      <P>Before C.I.E. can show that they can give an adequate alternative service, they are rushing off on these strange Costa Rican boats, dashing away with these rails to strange ports all over the world, not giving an opportunity to purchase the rails to Irish firms.</P>

      <P>There is a reluctance on the part of the Minister to answer any question about this matter.  I put it to the Minister across the House today that if he would say that the rails had been. sold without being put to public tender, I would be satisfied.  They were sold without being put to public tender but the Minister would not say that.  Why deny it now?  Why this reluctance?</P>

      <P>The Minister must admit that it was an extraordinary <Col N="1064" /> get-up, that we had this ship with an unpronounceable name flying the Costa Rican flag, taking away these rails to Italy for parts unknown, probably going behind the Iron Curtain. The Minister is nettled about this because it is a fact.  The Minister said that everybody knew that the rails had been sold privately.  I did not know.  I wanted to know had they been offered for public tender and if not, why not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If you will allow me, Sir.  A drawback that I suffer from here is that not only am I getting blurred and foggy answers from across the House but I have a blurred brief addressed to me.  One relates to a Dail Question addressed to the Taoiseach by Deputies Thaddeus Lynch and Patrick Palmer.  The other relates to Question No. 37 put down by Deputy Patrick Palmer.  Deputy Patrick Palmer wanted the details of the licence, including the name and address of the purchaser and the quantity of the rails involved and the price.  When a Question such as that is put down by a Deputy, the answer should be more freely given &mdash; we should not have to drag it out of the Minister.  The reluctance of the Minister, acting for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to answer questions regarding rails or railways is extraordinary.  I am sorry the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here because I was going to ask a Supplementary Question today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter that has been raised is one that can be explained very simply.  There was no special or indecent haste in regard to the export of these rails.  There is a general export control that applies to all classes of steel and iron manufacture and covers a wide variety of goods.  The general export control is applied in order that firms cannot get export licences for material which they describe as re-usable which in fact is really scrap.  In this case the material is regarded rightly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as re-usable.  It is composed of rails of over nine feet in length, bridgework and wheels &mdash; material which is manufactured of steel and not cast iron.  It is scrap only in so far as Irish Steel Limited are concerned.  They are the only firm that could make use of the material.  In no other way could it be described as scrap because it is re-usable. Córas lompair Éireann were given a licence to export a large quantity of this re-usable material.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not possible to re-use it in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies must allow the Minister to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going to listen now to what I have to say. The company were given an export licence because they were able to increase the supply of scrap &mdash; and it is scrap as far as Irish Steel Limited are concerned &mdash; by 70 per cent. over a period of eighteen months as compared with the material they were selling to Irish Steel Limited in the previous period before the closing of these lines.  The granting of the <Col N="1066" /> licence was perfectly proper in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>If any merchant who collected scrap could prove to the Minister that he could supply an additional quantity of 70 per cent.  over an eighteen month period of the scrap he collected, the Minister might be prepared to grant such a firm a licence.  But quite obviously no firm would be likely to do so.  If the total supply of scrap to Irish Steel Limited could be increased enormously &mdash; and incidentally a licence given for the export of such material &mdash;the Minister would have to consider the application.  The transaction in question is unique in character.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This material is exported in defined quantities to very special markets &mdash; to people who are specialists.  Some of it may be used for railway lines, some of it may be re-rolled without being converted into scrap and used for reinforced concrete. C.I.E. are entitled to get the best possible price for such material. The Company have been ordered by the Dail to pay their way by 1964. C.I.E. have a very formidable re-equipment programme, in terms of better rolling stock and new diesel engines, and the less interest they have to pay on fresh capital the better for their balance sheet and the better for the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>C.I.E. offered this material to a number of firms.  They did not go to tender and they were perfectly entitled not to, because this is entirely a specialist business.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has received no complaints in regard to these transactions that have been going on.  Everybody has seen the rails being removed.  The demands for this type of material here for purposes <Col N="1067" /> in which it can be used in its present form are negligible and there have been no representations that this material was required for haysheds or other local requirements.  In fact, I understand that C.I.E. have sold a certain amount of this type of material to local persons for haysheds and I understand the use to which it could be put is very limited.  One cannot build a whole hayshed with rails.  They could be used only for part of the corners.  I repeat that I understand the local demand for such material is negligible and that there have been no representations made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that exported materials could have been used at home in a form in which they could be described as being re-used.</P>

      <P>In so far as the ownership of the rails is concerned, I can assure Deputy Palmer that he need not have any doubt that C.I.E. is entitled to sell.  In reference to the price, I would not dream of giving this to the House.  The point is that C.I.B. should try to get the best possible price.  That should apply to the disposition of material by any State firm. Unless there was a public inquiry, involving a public scandal, I would not dream of publicly announcing the price paid to C.I.E.  There is nothing strange in this matter at all.  C.I.E. have to deal in a highly specialist market in so far as the sale of such material is concerned.  No harm has been done here in any respect, I would assure the House, and it is very important that C.I.E. should be able to get the maximum price for a certain quantity of re-usable material.</P>
