      <P>The answer to the Deputies' question is in the negative. In this connection I would recall what I said in the course of my statements in the Dáil on 20th July in the debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1960.  I there pointed out that the Irish contingent in the Congo would be subject to the orders of the United Nations Supreme Commander and not to the orders of the Irish Government and that, while it could be said that we were not sufficiently informed about the situation in the Congo to make a proper appreciation of it, we should not, in my opinion, regard ourselves as <Col N="2" /> being under any obligation to make that appreciation.  I still think that the attitude there defined is correct, despite the very confused and complicated political situation which still prevails in the Congo.  In my view, therefore, it would be a mistake to act in the manner suggested by the Deputies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution of Cyprus provides that the appointment of the President of the High Court shall be for a period of six years.  To enable the President of the Circuit Court to accept appointment as President of the High Court of Cyprus, the Government have agreed to release him from his normal judicial duties. The Government of Cyprus have been informed that, if Mr. Justice ó Briain is to continue in office as President of the High Court of Cyprus after the expiration of one year, his continuance would have to be on the basis of his then relinquishing his position as President of the Circuit Court in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>

      <P>I have already given careful consideration to the suggestion that private doctors who have entered into agreements with local health authorities for the provision of maternity medical services under the Health Acts should have access to maternity beds in district hospitals.  These hospitals are under the control of local authorities, each hospital having its own medical officer with the duty and responsibility of providing services for all patients, including maternity patients, admitted to the hospital, and there would be serious practical and legal difficulties in allowing private doctors the right to attend maternity patients in them.  Consequently, I am unable to approve of such an arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Only the holder of a qualification <Col N="13" /> certificate issued pursuant to section 10 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, as amended, is entitled to make an application for unemployment assistance.  No unemployment assistance is payable in any case in which the weekly rate of means, calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Acts, less 1/- equals or exceeds the scheduled rate of unemployment assistance payable.</P>
      <P>The grounds on which applications for unemployment assistance are disallowed fall into two categories:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  failure to satisfy the statutory conditions laid down in the Unemployment Assistance Acts for the receipt of assistance, and</P>
      <P>(2)  statutory disqualification under the Acts for the receipt of such assistance.</P>
      <P>As regards the first category, the statutory conditions to be satisfied by an applicant are, in effect, that he or she must:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  be unemployed;</P>
      <P>(b)  be capable of work and be available for and genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable work;</P>
      <P>(c)  be not debarred by reason of a change in means since the qualification certificate was issued;</P>
      <P>(d)  satisfy certain tests as to residence or employment in an urban area if the applicant is resident in an urban area;</P>
      <P>(e)  in the case of a widow or spinster without dependants, have not less than 52 employment contributions paid in respect of her during the four contribution years preceding the date of the application for assistance.</P>
      <P>As regards the second category, a person is disqualified for the receipt of unemployment assistance:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  while resident temporarily or permanently outside the State;</P>
      <P>(b)  while an inmate of any institution (including a prison or other place of detention) which is maintained wholly or partly out of public moneys or by a local authority;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> (c)  while in receipt of or entitled to a blind pension, disability benefit, unemployment benefit, a widow's pension or a maternity allowance;</P>
    <P>(d)  if he loses his employment through his misconduct or leaves it of his own accord without good cause (the disqualification in this instance being for a period of not less than one week or more than three months from the date on which he became unemployed);</P>
    <P>(e)  if unemployed as a result of a trade dispute except in special circumstances.</P>
    <P>Every applicant for unemployment assistance who is dissatisfied with the decision on his application has the right of appeal to an appeals officer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the statutory condition that an applicant must be unemployed, I should perhaps point out that persons affected by the two Employment Period Orders made each year under the Unemployment Assistance Acts are deemed not to be unemployed during the period specified in the relevant Order.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also wish to know that it is the practice of my Department to issue to every new applicant for unemployment assistance copies of explanatory leaflets which set out, <i>inter alia</i>, the statutory conditions and disqualifications I have mentioned and also the applicant's right of appeal.</P>

(25%) and to accept responsibility for the future maintenance of the works when completed.</P>
      <P>The county council suggested that restoration of the Dock Gates would be essential to give adequate protection for the boats.

Is it not a fact that the reason he did not give the information last week is that he did not want it known that the Minister for External Affairs and his Department had done nothing whatsoever about this objectionable sign which has been in Piccadilly Circus for several years until a Fine Gael <Col N="19" /> backbencher put down a question to him?</P>

As far as I know all members of the United Nations, including of course this country, support the principle of total disarmament: indeed a resolution endorsing the aim of total disarmament was adopted unanimously by the General Assembly at its 14th Session on 20th November, 1959.  There is, however, a difference of opinion as to how this major objective can be achieved.  Our attitude in the matter was explained in considerable detail by the Minister for External Affairs in his speech in the First (Political) Committee of the General Assembly on 28th October.  I would suggest that the Deputy read that speech, of which the text has been placed in the Library.</P>

      <P>The total quantity of home grown wheat of the 1960 crop received at the mills up to 12th November, 1960 was approximately 360,000 tons which represents about 320,000 tons of dried wheat.  All this wheat has been purchased as millable wheat, but having regard to its quality it appears that it would not produce a satisfactory flour if used to a large extent in the millers' grist.  Arrangements are being made to have further tests carried out in order to ascertain the maximum extent to which the wheat may be used in the girst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount deducted from growers in respect of levy on wheat delivered to the mills so far is approximately <Col N="24" /> £648,000.  As wheat is being purchased at the prices payable for millable wheat the question of refunding the levy does not arise.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;No regulation made by the Minister under this Act shall come into operation unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and approved by a resolution of each such House.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Ryan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in moving this amendment was to ensure the fullest possible discussion in the House on any proposal that any area in the country should have flourine added to its piped water supply.  As it stands, Section 8 provides that the Minister shall make regulations and that they shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made.  It also states that if a resolution annulling a regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.  My objection to that is that it may permit the fluoridation of a public water supply in the area of a local authority which has already gone on record as being opposed to the fluoridation of its public water supply.  If this House is in recess, some months might pass before it would have an opportunity of reviewing a regulation made under the Act by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that despite the efforts of those <Col N="49" /> opposed to the fluoridation of public water supplies to make the public aware of what the Minister is endeavouring to do, there are many people, some of them members of this House, who are not yet aware that the deliberate intention of the Bill is to put fluorine poison into public water supplies and, because people have not yet considered this matter fully, I think no regulation should be made, no regulation should be enforced or operated, unless and until this House and the other House have given the matter their fullest consideration.</P>
    <P>We are aware that some local authorities have already gone on record as being opposed to the fluoridation of their water supplies.  That being so, I believe the House has an obligation to ensure that fluorine is not put into the water supplies of these local authorities until it has had the fullest opportunity of considering the matter, and I feel the House has not yet properly debated this radical proposal. Of its 147 members, I believe only ten members have yet spoken their minds in public on this very important matter and it has amazed me that those speakers who did so from the opposite side of the House, on each occasion on which they rose, showed they had not read the remarks of those opposed to the Bill or, apparently, had not been present when we spoke.  If they were present, they must have been fast asleep because the same irrelevant argument were recited by them whenever they spoke.  They endeavoured to draw a comparison between flouridation and pasteurisation, which are two entirely different matters.  Even the Minister himself has indicated that he has not given due regard to what has been said by those opposed to the Bill and he has deliberately accused them of the basest motives and gross recklessness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is seeking to go over all the merits or <Col N="50" /> demerits of the Bill on this amendment. He may not do that.  The main argument is whether a regulation made by the Minister shall come into operation until it has been laid before each House.  That is the only argument&mdash; whether that should be done or not. The Deputy may not travel over all the provisions of the Bill in order to justify his argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully say that the purpose of the amendment is to achieve that no regulation shall come into operation until it is laid before each House of the Oireachtas and approved by a resolution of each House.  It is because due weight has not been given to the expert medical opinion opposed to fluoridation of water supplies that I say each and every regulation should come before each House.  It is of paramount importance that the Oireachtas should not seek to impose fluoridation of public water supplies on any local authority which has already expressed its opposition to it and, if we accept Section 8 as it stands, that is what will occur.  Fluoridation will be in operation before this or the other House has had an opportunity to upset the Minister's regulations.</P>
      <P>A very good reason why we should not tolerate such a provision is that under the Bill, as drafted by the Minister, a local authority may be obliged by ministerial regulation to expend money on the acquisition of capital equipment for fluoridation.</P>

      <P>This is a matter of the greatest importance to this country. I respectfully say it is not a matter which we can arbitrarily determine at this stage for the whole country.  There may be, in relation to particular local authorities, <Col N="52" /> a different concentration of natural fluorine in the water supply.  We shall not have an opportunity of considering that in relation to any regulation made by the Minister until, perhaps, it is too late unless my amendment is accepted.  Under an amendment to the Bill, which the Minister has already made, a substantial change has been made as compared with the Bill originally introduced.  The effect of that amendment is to cause a survey to be made in advace of fluoridation and that survey would be presented to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's remarks emphasise the very need for the amendment.  There are so many Acts which now contain this provision, as provided by the Minister&mdash;that a regulation shall operate until rescinded by the House&mdash;that members of this House and of the other House are inundated day after day with long lists of official titles which mean nothing to them.  Even a Deputy working <Col N="53" /> the full round of the clock on his Parliamentary duties, apart from other duties, would find it impossible to chase after all the various regulations brought to his notice when he gets the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Again, when the House is in recess, Deputies are not made aware of regulations. They are not aware that these regulations have been made until the Order Paper is presented to them.  On account of the colossal volume of regulations of one kind or another now in the hands of Deputies, I respectfully say that in such a vital matter, affecting the integrity of human beings, no regulation should be put into operation unless and until this House has had an opportunity of discussing the matter and approving it by a specific resolution of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, Sir.  The first of the Acts relating to the control of poisons in this country was <Col N="55" /> the Arsenic Act of 1851.  This Act required sellers of arsenic to keep records of sales and prohibited its sale to persons who were not known to the seller or to a witness at the sale.</P>
      <P>Under the Poisons (Ireland) Act of 1870, which is still the backbone of our legislation on this subject, a much wider form of control was introduced. The Act listed a number of poisons and certain provisions were made in relation to each class of poison.  Containers of all poisons must, in accordance with the Act, be labelled with the word &ldquo;poison&rdquo; and with the name and address of the seller and restrictions on sale similar to those I have described for arsenic were introduced for a number of other poisons. When under the Pharmacy (Ireland) Act of 1875, statutory provision was made for the registration of pharmaceutical chemists, the keeping of open shop for the sale of poisons was controlled, by restricting such sale mainly to these chemists.</P>
      <P>The legislation of 1870 and 1875 was amended in 1908 to permit of trade in poisons for agricultural and veterinary purposes by persons licensed by the local authority.</P>
      <P>This whole code of law is now out of date and is defective in other respects.</P>
      <P>While, for instance, there is a procedure under which new poisons can be added to the Schedule contained in the 1870 Act, there is no provision under which new poisons can be removed from that Schedule, or under which the nomenclature in the Schedule can be brought up-to-date. Chloroform is a case in point.  It is a scheduled poison but, in certain presentations, it is innocuous and the controls under the Poisons Acts are not necessary for such presentations. This, and certain other, presentations of poisons&mdash;for example, in solid soaps&mdash;could be excluded from the scope of the statutory controls on poisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision in the code under which any new form of control could be introduced, such, for example, <Col N="56" /> as restricting the sale of certain poisons to those holding medical prescriptions.</P>
    <P>The existing code does not permit of the variation in degrees of control necessary for some of the newer and more complex substances.</P>
    <P>Somewhat different provisions relating to labelling other than the simple printing of the word &ldquo;poison&rdquo; might be desirable in some cases.  Carbon tetrachloride is a common constituent of substances sold to remove stains from clothes.  The fumes of this substance, when it is used in a confined space, have been known to cause death and it would be desirable that the label should have printed on it a warning against this danger.</P>
    <P>In addition to simple provisions governing sale, it may be desirable in some cases to regulate the manufacture of poisons.</P>
    <P>Finally, the penalties fixed almost a century ago by the Act of 1870 are no longer an adequate deterrent and should be increased.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, it has been decided that the time has come to ask the legislature to repeal the old code in its entirety and to replace it by a new Statute.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House will be the basis of that new code.  It provides that the details of the controls on poisons and their sale and disposal will be spelled out in regulations to be made by the Minister and not in the legislation itself.  For that reason I have described it as the foundation of the new code.  This, as Deputies will be aware, is a common modern practice and while delegated legislation such as this may be criticised and on occasion deprecated by some, I feel that there is a very good case for it in this instance.  New substances, including a wide variety of synthetic products, for use in medical, and veterinary practice and in agriculture, are being evolved year by year.  Many of these are of a nature which requires control over their distribution and use, and it would be impracticable to expect the legislature to devote the necessary time to dealing <i>ad hoc</i> with special Bills every time control of a <Col N="57" /> new product was deemed to be necessary for the public safety.  Indeed, the delays involved in the preparation and the passage of such legislation might well be dangerous.</P>
    <P>A feature of the Bill is the proposal to establish a new council&mdash;Comhairle na Nimheanna&mdash;to advise the Minister, and the Minister for Agriculture, on the exercise of their functions under the Act and generally on questions relating to poisons.  There is no such advisory body at present, but, under the 1870 Act, the Royal College of Physicians have the function of declaring substances to be appropriate for addition to the Poisons Schedule.</P>
    <P>If such a declaration is approved by the Government the poison is added to the Schedule.  The proposal in the Bill to confer a power somewhat similar to this on a new body rather than on the College of Physicians should not be construed as a criticism of the latter body.  I am satisfied that the College have always carried out their limited functions under the 1870 Act with discretion, competence and care. If, however, I may be permitted to express my views by a metaphor&mdash;in no way unkindly intended, I can assure the House&mdash;the operation of a bad machine by even the best mechanics cannot make it work well.</P>
    <P>The development of veterinary medicine and of the pharmaceutical industry since the first legislation was introduced makes it appropriate for us now, when considering where we should look for advice in relation to poisons, to establish a body whose membership will not be restricted to the medical profession alone.</P>
    <P>I will now refer briefly to the major provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the establishment of Comhairle na Nimheanna and Section 3 defines the functions of this Council. These are to advise the Minister or the Minister for Agriculture on appropriate matters in relation to poisons which are referred to them for advice.  They may also be asked to advise on certain regulations under Section 65 of the Health Act, 1947, relating to the advertisement and sale of medical preparations, which may be appropriate for referral to that Council rather <Col N="58" /> than to the National Health Council. As a possible subject matter for such regulations, there is the question of the control of the sale of substances known as tranquillisers.  There is a certain amount of evidence in my Department that there is some danger in these being too freely available and, while I cannot anticipate the advice of the new Council on this matter, I would say that it may be appropriate to make regulations to control their sale.</P>
    <P>The Chairman and the members of the Council will be appointed by the Minister for Health.  Under Section 4, it will consist of two doctors, two pharmaceutical chemists, two veterinary surgeons, one specialist in the use of poisonous substances in agriculture and three other persons.  The Minister, under Section 7, may determine the tenure of office of the Chairman and the members.  He will also appoint the Secretary to the Council.  The Minister may also by order fix a procedure for calling meeting of the Council and specify the quorum, but, apart from this, the Council will regulate its own procedure and business.</P>
    <P>Under Section 9, the Minister may remove a member of the Council from office.  Sections 10 to 13 contain the usual provisions in relation to resignation of members, filling of casual vacancies and the payment of the members' expenses in attending meetings or otherwise doing work on behalf of the Council.</P>
    <P>The core of the Bill is in Section 14.  Under this section will be made new regulations to replace the existing legislation which I have described. The Minister will have power to define by regulation what will be poisons for the purposes of the controls to be specified under the regulations.  The storage, transport, supply and sale of poisons and the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations containing poisons can all be governed by the regulations.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of this Section specifies in more detail a number of the matters which may be covered by the regulations under the Section.  These include the specification of the persons who may deal in different classes <Col N="59" /> of poisons.  While I do not like to appear to anticipate the recommendations of Comhairle na Nimheanna, I think we can expect that, as at present, retail trade in poisons generally will continue to be restricted to pharmaceutical chemists and druggists and that other shops will, as at present, be licensed by health authorities to sell poisons only for specific purposes, such as for use in agriculture.  This sub-section will provide for an appeal to the Minister against a refusal by a health authority to grant a licence to deal in poisons.  There is no such right of appeal under the existing legislation but in more recent similar provisions&mdash;such as the Food Hygiene Regulations of 1950&mdash;it is customary to concede it.  This sub-section also makes it clear that the regulations can govern the labelling of containers of poisons and provides that regulations may be enforced by the officers of the Minister for Health or the Minister for Agriculture, by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland or by health authorities.</P>
    <P>Under Section 15, the Minister for Agriculture will be given a new power to regulate the use of poisons for agriculture and for veterinary purposes. This power will be exercised to ensure that persons using or coming into contact with poisons used as weed killers or insecticides, or otherwise in agriculture or horticulture, will observe proper precautions.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Health, or the Minister for Agriculture, will normally be required to consult Comhairle na Nimheanna before making regulations, it is provided by Section 16 that urgent regulations can be made first and advice in regard to them obtained afterwards.</P>
    <P>Penalties for contraventions of the Regulations are provided for in Section 17.  These penalties, which may range up to a fine of £100 or imprisonment for six months, are considerably more severe than those under the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 18 includes the usual provisions on the laying of regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas and Section 19 the normal provision <Col N="60" /> for meeting the expenses of the Ministers with functions under the Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 20 is to bring up-to-date certain references in the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1934, to international conventions which were originally made under the auspices of the League of Nations and have now been adopted by the United Nations. These changes in the 1934 Act are necessary to enable certain regulations under that Act to be made.</P>
    <P>Under Section 21 all the present law relating to the control of poisons will be repealed.  It will be noted, however, that under Section 22 the Minister can bring part of the Act in before the balance of it.  The intention is that the provision for setting up the new Council will first be brought in ans that the provision for the repeal of the present laws will not have effect until a later date when, appropriate regulations having been made, we are ready to dispense with these laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will welcome the Minister's statement on this Bill.  The principal provision of the Bill, as the Minister has pointed out, is the establishment of this new advisory council.  In relation to this measure we are legislating in a very definite way by regulation and the Minister himself conceded in his opening remarks that the control of poison and poisonous substances, their definition, restriction on their sale, manufacture, supply and so on will now become a matter to a very large extent of Ministerial regulation made on the advice of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person who has frequently objected to legislation by regulation I do believe that dealing with poison and poisonous substances by means of regulation would prove better than depending on old legislation which, as the Minister has pointed out, is not flexible and in modern conditions does not give health authorities or the Minister himself sufficient power or authority to deal with such matters, particularly in the case of a new manufacture or innovations of one sort or another.  In this instance I certainly am not prepared to press any objection <Col N="61" /> to the fact that the Bill will largely be legislation by regulation.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the Bill is Section 14. It deals with the type of regulations which the Minister may make after consultation with the council.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give some more information to the House regarding Section 16 which provides that, in cases of emergency, the Minister may make his regulations without consultation with the Council.  The section goes on to provide that, having made his regulations in this particular situation of emergency which may have developed, the Minister will then consult the Council but there is a full stop there and the Bill does not make it clear what is to happen if the council disagrees with the Minister, if they advise the Minister that he should rescind the regulations which he has made or that he should vary them in some way or another.  I take it it would be the intention of any Minister to have regard to the advice given by the council and it would be as well that the Minister should endeavour to deal in Section 16 with the action to be taken by a Minister for Health in the event of a regulation having been made as a matter or urgency under Section 16 and then, when it goes before the council, the council say to the Minister that they think the regulations should be rescinded or cancelled. The Minister should have regard to their advice in that respect.</P>
    <P>The only other comment I want to make is in relation to the constitution of the council which is being establashed under Section 4.  It is provided that the council will consist of 10 persons, two of whom would be registered medical practitioners, two registered chemists and two others veterinary surgeons nominated by the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not know whether the Minister would consider that this suggestion has any merit but it is one into which he might look. It would seem to me that this council has a very important rôle to play and that the advice which the Minister will receive from it from time to time generally regarding the question of the control of poisonous substances will not be taken lightly by any Minister <Col N="62" /> for Health.  That being so, I suggest to the Minister that it might be as well now that provision should be made in the Bill that whatever medical practitioners, veterinary surgeons or chemists are appointed to the council they will be people of some practical experience in their profession.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands&mdash;I am not suggesting that this would be done&mdash;it will be open to the Minister or to any successor of his to appoint a newly qualified doctor, veterinary surgeon or chemist who has not even a day's practical experience.  I know that that would not be the intention of any Minister for Health who is serious in relation to this matter but it is not unknown in legislation of this type where professional qualifications are required for particular appointments to lay down in the legislation that so many years experience should be regarded as a necessary qualification.  I would ask the Minister to look into that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my approval also of this measure.  The necessity for the measure is obvious and I suppose the statement in the explanatory memorandum is a source of wonder to us that &ldquo;the legislation at present governing the control of the sale of poisons in this country dates back to 1851 and the latest enactment on the subject was the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908.&rdquo;  I suppose all of us must take a certain amount of blame for that.  Whether or not new legislation was necessary over the years we do not know because we do not know what ill effects have arisen due to lack of legislation such as this. Whilst I am also more or less of the same mind as Deputy M.J. O'Higgins and most members of the House with regard to legislation by regulation, the introduction of this method by the Minister, making regulations to do certain things, is one that could be readily approved in view of the type of abuse it is intended to prevent and in view of the safeguards it is desirable to make, safeguards that must be made immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect I should also like to make a comment on something Deputy O'Higgins said with regard to the <Col N="63" /> necessity for the Minister to make regulations without consultation with An Comhairle Nimheanna.  The Minister is never bound to accept the advice of the council.  Certainly it is desirable that he should listen to them &mdash;they are there to give advice&mdash;but I assume and I think it is implied in the Bill, that if the Minister has to make emergency regulations he will consult with the council afterwards but he does not necessarily have to take their views.</P>
    <P>The constitution of the council does not seem to present any difficulties and at first glance should not give rise to any objections.  Most of the people mainly concerned with poisons and drugs and who have wide experience of their handling and sale are included in it both from the health and the veterinary point of view.  The Minister is very wise to include a provision that three other persons may be appointed to the council because it gives him pretty wide scope and will enable him to make the council as representative as possible.  I assume the other three persons will not be people with any particular qualifications.  I do not think it would be desirable to select them because of particular qualifications. The Minister should really select them as three citizens and no more, without specifying any particular qualifications.</P>
    <P>A provision with which I am particularly pleased is one which has been absent from much of our recent legislation dealing with the Departments of Local Government and Health <i>vis-á-vis</i> the local bodies; that is the provision for appeal to the Minister.  That is a very desirable provision because there was a feeling of frustration, a feeling that there is not true democracy in the local bodies, when a local body gives a decision for or against a certain proposal and the aggrieved person has no appeal.  The Minister has wisely provided for an appeal to himself if a person is aggrieved by the withholding or the cancellation of a licence.</P>
    <P>Generally, the people will welcome the Bill.  There has not been an uproar or outcry, but there has certainly been a great deal of concern recently about <Col N="64" /> the sale of tranquillisers mentioned by the Minister.  Scores of various tranquillisers and what people call &ldquo;pep balls&rdquo; are sold.  I am not a medical man.  I do not know what effect they can have on the health of an individual, but they must have some ill effects. There must be some cumulative effects from these tranquillisers or &ldquo;pep&rdquo; pills which are sold pretty freely.</P>
    <P>It is a very good thing that the Minister may make an emergency regulation because unscrupulous people who want to sell these tranquillisers or &ldquo;pep&rdquo; pills will find ways and means of avoiding any regulation previously made.  They can do that within a relatively short time.  Before a council could meet and deliberate on the new tranquilliser or &ldquo;pep&rdquo; pill thousands of them could be sold in the country, but if the Minister and his Department act quickly the sale of that sort of commodity can be stopped very quickly.  The provisions for fines and imprisonment should be sufficient deterrent.</P>
    <P>There is one omission from the Bill which perhaps the Minister will consider. The Bill provides generally against the sale of poisonous and dangerous drugs only in certain circumstances. It refers to them as absolute poisons.  There are other commodities that can be poisonous to children. Is there any regulation, or can the Minister take power in this Bill, to prevent the sale of medicine or pills that an adult would treat with respect but which children from seven to fourteen years of age would not treat with discretion and would not know what was contained in them?  Day after day thousands of children are sent to chemist shops for aspirins and pills.  They are sent with prescriptions that could be fatal to children if a few children got together and decided to have a lark and take these pills.  It has happened.  Thank God, there have been very few occasions.  There is that danger.</P>
    <P>There is a law that prohibits the sale of cigarettes to children under a certain age and a shopkeeper can be prosecuted for selling cigarettes to such children.  Is there any regulation, or can the Minister take power <Col N="65" /> in this Bill, to prevent a child of, say, five years of age buying a bottle of aspirins?  Aspirins are not very palatable to a child.  Most medicines and pills are not palatable to young children. On the other hand, there are cough mixtures which are palatable and which could prove fatal if taken in excess.  I hope I am not making a commercial plug but there is a sweetened form of aspirin.  They are sweetened to make them more acceptable to children.  There is the danger that if a young child is sent for a bottle of pills that have been flavoured with lemon, orange or raspberry he may take a handful, whereas anything in excess of three or four might be dangerous and even fatal.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has not power in this Bill to deal with a situation of that kind, I would ask him to consider the matter between now and the Committee Stage.  It may be included in the Bill, but I cannot find it.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, this is a good Bill which will be approved, not only by the House, but by everybody in the country in view of the danger there is at the present time from the sale of pills, tranquillisers and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, also, would like to welcome the Bill but there are a few matters to which I wish to refer. The Bill controls the sale of poisonous drugs but, unfortunately, no effort is being made to control the importation of poisonous drugs.  The fisheries of this country, particularly in Donegal, are being ruined by the importation of a poison called Cymac or Cyanide. It is being imported from the Six Counties, Scotland and England by gentlemen who come in to poach. They have actually ruined our rivers. At least three of the rivers in Donegal this year have been destroyed as a result of the importation of this poison.  There appears to be no control whatsoever over the importation of this substance by individuals who have purchased it from drug stores or chemist shops across the Border or in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If some control could be exercised over the importation of poisonous drugs it would be for the benefit of the <Col N="66" /> community generally.  About six weeks ago I came across a case where a drug was purchased in Strabane, the sale entered in the poisons register and the drug brought across to this country and used here.  It was a mere fluke, an accident, that the source of the drug was discovered.  If that drug had been purchased in this country and a proper poisons register kept, if an incident such as the one to which I refer occurred it would have been possible, by examination of the poisons register in the various chemist shops, to put a finger on the culprit immediately.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I wish to refer is the members of the council. There appears to be no provision for the period for which they shall hold office.  That is a mistake because, if we refer to Section 9, the Minister may at any time remove a member of the council from office.  I am not suggesting that the present Minister would do so but there could come a time when we would have a Minister who for personal reasons would remove an individual from the council. I am afraid that such a person, if once removed, would never again become eligible for reappointment by the Minister who removed him or by the Minister who succeeded him because Section 10 says:</P>
    <P>A member of the Council whose term of Office expires by effluxion of time shall be eligible for reappointment.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of a member whose term expired by reason of its termination by the Minister.  I am sure it is an oversight.  It is a matter that the Minister could possibly look into and see if he could amend it.  I would much prefer to see the members of the council appointed for a particular period, during which time they could not be removed, and leave the option to the Minister of the day to renew their appointments or appoint others in their places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TadhgManley" hpid="Mr. Manley Mr. Manley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few questions that I should like to ask the Minister.  Everybody will welcome the Bill in so far as it provides a safeguard for our people.  In these days when <Col N="67" /> preparations and drugs of all kinds are on the market it is well that people should know where danger lies.  Lists of dangerous drugs should be available to the public.  I would ask the Minister whether the council will be the authority to decide what substances are dangerous or are near being dangerous or whether they will report to the Minister and he will be the deciding authority as to the drugs that should be characterised as dangerous or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I intended to raise the point adverted to by Deputy O'Donnell.  It does not state for how long the members of this Comhairle are to hold office&mdash;whether for three years, five years, an indefinite period or until such time as they desire to cry off.</P>
      <P>I realise full well that a Bill of this kind is necessary.  I should further like to ask whether this authority will have any power to decide what substances should be used in the preparation of medicines or certain pills. Will these preparations still be made available in the ordinary way?  Will manufacturing chemists or concerns heretofore engaged in the production of these still operate freely?  Will the authority have any say in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which it has received this Bill.  One must realise that when breaking what might be described as new ground in the sense that we are widening the scope of the authority to control the sale of poison there may be aspects of the Bill which the Minister has overlooked.  I do not think, however, that any great difficulty will arise under Section 16.  That is the section under which the Minister may make a regulation to deal with an emergency.  The regulation can be subject to amendment when the advice of the council has been considered by the Minister, but if there is any great apprehension about the action of any future Minister under this section, I could consider whether the public should not be given some sort of warning by the publication of a notice in the newspapers that this regulation was made before the <Col N="68" /> Comhairle had been consulted.  Under the Bill as it stands, the regulation would be tabled, and the House, having due notice that the Council had not been consulted, might wish to debate it.  A motion to annul the regulation could be put down in order to discuss the circumstances in which the regulation was made.  I would not see any objection to that procedure.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the council, we have to act on the assumption that Ministers, to whatever Party they belong, are responsible men. Section 9 gave me a great deal of thought.  I decided that, after all, no Minister is likely to remove a member of the council from office unless such member has shown himself unworthy of holding the office, but the fact that a Minister has removed a person from office does not debar that Minister or his successor from reappointing the member in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister just examine that?  Section 10 would seem to imply that it is only in cases of termination by effluxion of time that he can reappoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted that.  I shall make it quite clear that a person will not be debarred from reappointment simply because a Minister or his predecessor had removed him from office. Though there is nothing in the Bill about fixing a limited period for membership or saying in regard to nomination it can only be for a period not exceeding X years, nevertheless if any other Minister wishes to change the personnel of the Council he should be at liberty to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to appoint them in perpetuity or for life.  As has been said, it is very desirable that people reappointed should be persons of practical experience and I would suggest&mdash;and this is even more important&mdash;that they should be persons of high professional standards.  The position should be left open so that if there were a professor of pharmacology who was continued <Col N="69" /> in this professorship, he might be continued a member of the council. It has been made quite clear in Section 10 that if I do fix a maximum term, they can be reappointed for a further term.  That, I think, would cover the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised in my mind just this question as to whether I should not say that a person reappointed shall have been a practitioner of so many years' experience and shall have certain post-graduate qualifications.  I shall look into it to see if I can do that.  In the first place, the code which this supersedes was felt to be very inflexible and professional qualifications in relation to these matters may change completely within a very short term of years.  The Minister will act on his own responsibility. He is bound to consult the council.  He is bound to procure their advice, but he is not necessarily bound to act upon it.  He must carry his own responsibility and if he is to be responsible to the House, he must be in a position to reject the advice of the council and stand or fall by his own act in so rejecting; otherwise, he would become a mere rubber-stamp for the council and the House would lose all authority and control in relation to this very important matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Manley raised the question whether we had any power under this Bill to prohibit the importation of dangerous drugs.  As the Bill stands, we have not; but whether we should have or not is a matter to which I should like to give some consideration. Even if the Minister were empowered to prohibit by regulation the importation of dangerous drugs, I think if they were imported for the purposes to which Deputy O'Donnell referred it would be very very difficult indeed to enforce the prohibition.  As I say, it is an important point and I shall look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More difficult is the question which Deputy Corish raised.  It relates to drugs which, though harmless when taken in prescribed does by the persons for whom they are intended, may be harmful if they fall into the hands of children or people of little experience.  I am afraid it would be <Col N="70" /> impossible for us to deal very effectively with that, although we have the power under Section 14 to prohibit the selling of drugs by &ldquo;persons or classes of persons other that the persons or classes of persons specified in the regulation or otherwise than subject to the conditions and limitations specified in the regulations.&rdquo; I think that power is sufficiently wide to enable us to make regulations prohibiting the sale of drugs to a particular class of persons.</P>
    <P>I again say that we can make regulations to that effect.  It might be a very difficult provision to administer because, after all, there is a lesson to be learned from the comparative failure of the Act which endeavoured to limit the sale of cigarettes to young people. I do not think anyone can say that provision is strictly enforced in this country, or strictly enforceable.  As I say, we have the power to limit the sale of drugs to normal people to quantities which are comparatively harmless.  We can endeavour to ensure that they will not be sold to young people who have not enough commonsense to use them in a manner which will not be dangerous to other people or even themselves.</P>
    <P>With regard to tranquillisers or the stimulating drugs to which Deputy Corish referred, they, of course, can be dealt with under the regulations and. as I mentioned here before, it is my intention, if the Bill becomes law, at an early date to refer certain drugs which are supposed to have a tranquillising effect to the Comhairle for advice.</P>
    <P>Indeed, one of the things which influenced my officers and myself in the preparation of this Bill was the number of complaints we received from parents and others who have suffered by reason of the fact that persons can become addicted to certain of these preparations.  It was on examination of those complaints that the need for a completely new up-to-date code for the control of poisons and drugs was forced upon us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which, on first reading, appeared to me to be an essential section.  I remember on Second Reading stating that I thought that before c.p.o. orders were made, an inquiry should be held presided over, not by an official of the Minister, but by a district justice or a Circuit Court judge as the case might be.</P>
      <P>The Minister is bringing in a new section after Section 12.  In that section, the Minister provides for entry on to land and says that an officer may enter on land for the purpose of making surveys, etc., and that before doing so, he must give notice.  I am referring now to the new section for the purpose of referring back to Section 10.  Under the new section, notice must be given to the land owner or occupier of the intention of the agent of the local authority to enter on land for the purpose of making a survey.  The owner or occupier has the right, within so many days, to appeal to the district justice to prohibit the entry of the servant or agent of the local authority on the land.  It appears from the new section that there is no right of appeal from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, if permission is granted to enter on land for the purpose of making an inspection, a survey, or for the taking of necessary measurements, unless there is an agreement, the owner or occupier may appeal to the district court where the amount of damages is less than £20 or may appeal to the arbitrator where it is greater.  In other words, the courts are being brought in, when we are dealing with the preliminary entry on to the land for the purpose <Col N="72" /> of inspection, but once it has been decided he may enter on the land and once the compensation has been decided, the courts are wiped out completely. An order may be made on evidence tendered to the inspector who, in turn, recommends to the Minister, and in that way we are wiping the courts out completely.</P>
    <P>I know that was done when we required land for houses for the working classes, but that was a very serious problem.  Land had to be urgently acquired to build those houses and we had to wipe out, if I may so describe it, the red tape.  Now, in relation to the building of offices, halls, or municipal buildings, we are putting the land into exactly the same class as land acquired for the housing of the working classes.</P>
    <P>I know Dublin has a problem of its own.  I am quite satisfied about that. I know Dublin is anxious to procure a site for a municipal building, and I am not quibbling about that, but there are many local authorities outside Dublin. If it is necessary to ensure that Dublin gets a site for a new municipal building, why not let us write that into the Bill?  Why not make an exception of Dublin?  It would be much better if we wrote Dublin into the Bill.  It would not be the first time that was done.  That could be done for Dublin if Dublin wants it, but the position in the rest of the country should be left as it stands at the moment.</P>
    <P>I noticed that during the debate, on one occasion, Deputy Briscoe said that not only was the Bill necessary in order to procure a site for a new building, but also to procure buildings for the purpose of knocking them down and making new roads.  That may be all right in Dublin, but I should like to see it made the exception rather than the rule, and to see a section or an amendment written into the Bill, even at this stage, taking Dublin out of the general run and leaving the acquisition of land for the housing of the working classes under the local authorities as it is today.</P>
    <P>As I say, in view of the fact that we are inserting a new section which brings the courts into the preliminary investigation and the fixing of damages <Col N="73" /> caused by the trespass of the preliminary investigators, why not have the same principle in respect of the acquisition of land for purposes other than the housing of the working classes or the procurement of municipal buildings for the city of Dublin?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy O'Donnell with great attention.  Unless I have missed the point he advocated that these are exceptional measures which are required for Dublin and as such should apply only to Dublin.  I did not hear any real reason why such powers should not apply in general.</P>
      <P>Assuming the Bill became law and that a building was required by the local authority in Dublin or elsewhere that local authority will put forward proposals to the Department of Local Government setting out the reasons why the building should be erected. That will have to be examined in great detail by the Department.  If it is agreed in whole or in part that the original proposal for a building should go forward the local authority concerned will be so informed.  In turn, they may seek to acquire certain lands for the project for which there is already prior approval on the basis that it is necessary to their well-being and general work-a-day business.  If there is objection to the acquisition, an inquiry will be held and as a result the compulsory purchase order may be confirmed for the whole or part of the land about which the inquiry was conducted.  Subsequent to the making of the order, and assuming there is still somebody who feels it should not be absolute and that there is any point of law which such party may wish to raise, he may then have recourse to the Court for a final determination on a point of law in regard to the validity or otherwise of the said order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell opened with the point, confirming his views expressed on an earlier stage, that such inquiry would better be presided over by a member of the Judiciary, a district justice, a judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court or what you will. That suggestion is rather strange, not from the Deputy himself, but coming from his side of the House.  We recall that in the not too distant past, <Col N="74" /> when such persons were envisaged as adjudicators in another matter, they were described here as the instrument of a political party.</P>

It is well worth recalling that the people who would have judges now are the people who once described them as the possible lickspittles of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It did not determine the matter then and I do not think it should determine the matter now.</P>
      <P>I have heard no cogent reason why this part of the Bill should not apply to all local authorities as is the stated intention.  I did hear that since Dublin alone seems to have the problem, we should legislate solely for Dublin and make it an exceptional case.  I am not satisfied that that is so.  I am inclined to leave it to the House that the matter should stand as it is.</P>

      <P>The Minister made reference to the Judiciary.  I hope he will remember that it was Deputies on this side of the House who protected the Judiciary when the Minister and his Party attempted to tear them down.  We are opposed to the section for the reasons ventilated last week.  We can understand the introduction into our law of these powers in relation to housing because of its social importance and because of the problem involved.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Government of the day provided for these powers under our housing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are opposed to this mysterious extension of these powers.  The justification for this section has not been made clear.  I think only one Deputy made a case for it, Deputy Briscoe, and it was a particular one.  It referred merely to the problem as it exists in Dublin.  Everybody concedes that Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Larkin and other persons interested in local government in Dublin City and to some extent in outer Dublin may have a particular problem.  Nobody disputes that.  We have urged and I think it is a reasonable suggestion that it <Col N="75" /> would be far better and wiser to provide special powers for Dublin Corporation or any other local authority with a similar problem.  That course has been adopted with benefit I think in the past.  It is quite wrong, merely because a particular problem faces one or two local authorities, to give these wide powers to every local authority in the country.  I think it is wrong and we are opposed to it.</P>
    <P>We feel that a case has not been made by the Minister to justify this wide extension of power.  It is wrong that Deputies should be asked to vote and act in blinkers without having any clear case put before them as to why these additional powers are necessary.  The Minister said last week and again now that this does not in fact give any additional powers. That is nonsense and the Minister knows it.  This section, if passed, gives to every local authority a convenient and ready means of acquiring any land for any purpose it thinks expedient.  That is too wide a power to give to local authorities and for that reason we are opposed to this section.  Nothing has been said which convinces us that there is any reason why this section should be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the members of the Dublin local authority have been anxious to see this Bill go through.  I said on an earlier stage I wondered if the power was sweeping enough.  The plans of a local authority can be held up by an individual such as an absentee landlord or landlord who is practically inaccessible. The problem that exists in Dublin may arise in some other local authority. The proposal of the local authority must go to the Department of Local Government for sanction and therefore I do not see why there is any fear in the mind of any Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A legal mind may be able to foresee it in a more analytical manner than I could attempt to examine it, but the necessity is here.  It is a burning question and, though it may be a vital one at the moment for Dublin, as one who has travelled through the country and visited the offices of other municipal authorities, I am <Col N="76" /> satisfied the same position may arise in their case at any moment.  I do not see any reason why Deputies should not agree to the Bill forthwith. Local authorities may feel they can go ahead with the building of dance halls, but, first of all, they have to get the Minister's sanction to do so and every member of the local authority knows that sanction is not an easy thing to get at any time from the Department of Local Government.  In saying that, I am not casting any aspersion on the present holder of the post of Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that without this section the Bill could be withdrawn from the House because, in fact, it would be of no real value whatsoever.  Deputy O'Donnell has referred to the problem in Dublin.  It is true that the problem has existed in Dublin for many years and because of that fact, development in the capital city has, in many instances, been of a somewhat lopsided character. It was relatively easy to obtain possession of sites for housing under the Housing of the Working Classes Act.  On many occasions, it has been possible to go ahead with the socially necessary work of housing, but the provision of housing is not the only work of a local authority.  The problem of providing reasonably efficient arteries for traffic is becoming increasingly great in the city and, indeed, in other towns throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In this connection, one of the problems in Dublin has been the acquisition of ground and, if it is not already a problem in other cities throughout the country, it may well become a problem tomorrow.  To deal with the closing of a section of a road, the widening of a street, the widening or closing of a right-of-way under present legislation has given us the experience in Dublin that, in many cases, to take effective action results in delays of six, 12 and 18 months.  In some cases, the delay may extend to two years and the public at large suffer because of the provisions in existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold no brief for city or county <Col N="77" /> managers, but, by and large, elected councils throughout the country are composed of responsible people and I do not see any real danger of their building dance halls as has been suggested. It may well be a good decision for local authorities to take, that is, to provide municipal halls in places where they are badly needed so that citizens can have a place for meetings of various associations, but dance halls are entirely different from that.  I believe this section is essential, certainly in so far as Dublin is concerned, if we are to see progress made during the next few years in completing the work of clearing many derelict sites.  The problem of acquiring land is not solely connected with the provision of houses.  It is also associated with streets, lanes and rights-of-way in order to provide proper carriage ways.  In conclusion, I should like to repeat that this section, giving power to local authorities to acquire land under compulsory purchase orders for such purposes, is a good one, particularly for Dublin, though I believe it will also be to the benefit of local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again draw attention to Deputy O'Higgins' interpretation of this proposal and to reiterate to the House that Section 10, to which objection is taken, merely substitutes compulsory purchase order procedure for the provisional order procedure that applied to these cases in the past?  The intention of this section is that a local authority&mdash;apart from the provisions of Section 10&mdash; must have power of compulsory acquisition of land for a particular purpose, before it can invoke the procedure provided in this section.  I want to make that quite clear, that it confers no new uses for which land may be acquired and it comes back again to what I have said time and time again, that it is merely a question of the procedure to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the sake of those who make the argument that compulsory purchase order procedure is something abhorrent, something that should not be used in the context which we propose <Col N="78" /> it in this Bill, let me say that at present, under other enactments of this House, a sanitary authority, a fire brigade authority, a housing authority, a public assistance authority, a mental hospital authority and a health authority may use compulsory purchase order powers for office purposes. which is what we are talking about at the moment in so far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>May I point out further that not only may all these bodies use compulsory purchase order powers for acquiring land for office purposes but the last four&mdash;the health authority, the mental hospital authority, the public assistance authority and the housing authority&mdash;may use compulsory purchase order procedure in their acquiring of lands that may be needed for office buildings in the course of their work.  I fail to see how one can object to the extension of the C.P.O. procedure to cover office buildings and multiple buildings for all local authorities. We must remember that the Provisional Order procedure did not meet all cases in the past.  The safeguards in existence in regard to the C.P.O. procedure are adequate and have been found so in all instances in the past under the other authorities I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins struck the nail on the head when he said this was an efficient and ready method, though I think he was complaining it was too efficient.  Is there anything wrong with it being an efficient and ready way of doing a job that requires to be done? Is it not much better that it should be so and that we should have proper safeguards, rather than having local authorities bogged down as Dublin Corporation and Cork County Council were bogged down in the past because they had not an efficient and ready procedure to go ahead with much needed building for their use in their functional areas?</P>
    <P>Although Dublin is regarded as the real reason for this Bill, it was the experience of Cork County Council that originally gave rise to the Bill, followed up quickly, and with much greater emphasis, by the difficulties of Dublin Corporation.  Deputies might <Col N="79" /> be interested to know that Cork County Council actually asked for a C.P.O. which could not be given to them, and they had to do as best they could and look for acquisition by agreement.  I know that in my own county there have been rumblings for a number of years.  For instance, Letterkenny Urban Council felt that much good could be done and much greater efficiency brought about if they were allowed erect a building in the town to house all their various staffs and, indeed, to be used for other purposes of benefit to the town and the community as a whole.  It is not merely a question of meeting a problem in Dublin city alone.  It is a problem that has arisen on a number of occasions in the past and which will arise in the future.  The safeguards are there.  They have been tried in the past and found suitable, and I cannot see why there should be this furore in the House against giving this power to all local authorities, who are, in my experience, responsible bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the power of compulsory acquisition was given under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, away back before 1930, we must remember that the local authorities consisted entirely of property owners and ratepayers.  The franchise for local authorities had not been extended to the adult population but was confined to local ratepayers and property owners.  These gentlemen were then given the opportunity of acquiring their own land, the land belonging to a class of which they were members.  The Legislature was satisfied that they would not exercise these compulsory powers except where absolutely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that most local authorities to-day are composed of reasonable men, but some of them are not property owners and ratepayers. They may not have the same respect for compulsory acquisition as ratepayers would.  In the case of compulsory acquisition previously the owner of the property was tried by his peers, but here it is quite possible that we may have&mdash;we should always <Col N="80" /> legislate with our eye on the exception &mdash;a local authority wishing to acquire for such purposes as, say, the building of a dance hall and we may find a Minister prepared to sanction such a compulsory purchase order.</P>
    <P>It is most peculiar that not one Deputy, with the exception of the representatives of the city of Dublin, has spoken in favour of the section. Apart from those from rural Ireland who have spoken against the section, not a representative from Cork city, Galway city, Limerick city and no person from rural Ireland&mdash;not even the representatives from the town which the Minister himself mentioned, Letterkenny&mdash;has said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>He is also the Minister in charge of the Bill, whose duty it is to try to pilot it through the House.  I can appreciate his position as a Minister.  I have heard no Deputy from rural Ireland say he is anxious for compulsory acquisition.  There would be no difficulty whatsoever about this section were we to limit it to the city of Dublin, or as somebody suggested, greater Dublin.  We would all accept it then.  We know they have a problem in Dublin and there is difficulty in solving it.  However, I can visualise some of the uneconomic holdings in my county and the local authority deciding to step in and acquire possibly the only valuable site on a holding for the purpose of erecting a courthouse or a fire station. That site could be acquired by negotiation, which is much better than acquisition by compulsion.  But there is a problem in Dublin and I know they can never acquire there by agreement. By that I mean acquire <Col N="81" /> property which they want to provide the amenity which they say they require. Let us confine this section to Dublin.  If we do so, no one will object to it.  I would ask the House to consider seriously my suggestion in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we really expected to take seriously Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion that we might refer back to the time when only those who had the material goods in this country were entitled to vote?  I do not think it was really his intention that we should logically draw that conclusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope not, and I do not really think the Deputy meant it in that sense.  Nevertheless, the suggestion was used as an argument and advanced, elaborated and extended still further in the sense that only the ratepayers could represent the local authority as elected representatives. When something was absolutely vitally necessary, it was only because they were ratepayers, because they were concerned, that there was agreement given or reached on the acquisition of any land for any purpose. It has been said that the comparison with today is that there are on the smaller local authorities some people who are neither property-owners nor ratepayers.  I do not dispute that, but what is to be drawn from that?  Are we to say that because they are neither ratepayers nor property owners as such, although they were elected by popular choice of the people whom they represent, their voice should not be heard, that they are not in a position to judge issues as they are not ratepayers and do not own much of the world's goods and that they have no conception of what is for the general public good?  In fact, it is very often the case&mdash;and I think it is true generally&mdash;that those who have not a great deal of the world's goods are, by virtue of that fact, in a much better position to appreciate what is for the public good than those who have everything <Col N="82" /> provided for them because of their wealth.</P>
      <P>It would be a sad thing that we should regard non-ratepayers and non-property owners who are members of a council as not being the type fit to control and run a local authority and not able to tell right from wrong, as it were, people who would not recognise what is for the good of the community, people not capable of weighing up the rights of the individual against the rights of the community.</P>
      <P>I think we should stay very far away from that aspect of things and now that we have got away from it, we should not use it here as an experimental argument, as it were, to divorce the powers in this Bill and give them only to Dublin, whereas they can be, and have been, sought in other parts of the country.  Indeed, in the first instance, this was raised not by an actual proposal in the Dublin Corporation but by a proposal from Cork County Council.</P>
      <P>It has also been commented on that no speakers other than those from Dublin have spoken in favour of this Bill.  It is noteworthy that in the case of any Bill that meets with approval there is less likelihood of those who approve speaking than those who disapprove. It is not to be taken&mdash;nor does it follow&mdash;that if you have a barrage of criticism on any measure here, when only criticism has been heard, and when it is greater in volume and lengthier than the approval, that there is nobody else in the House in favour of that Bill or that we can say if three spoke against it and if nobody spoke for it, that the House rejected it by a majority of three to one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would be an entirely erroneous conclusion to arrive at on any measure and I certainly feel it would be most erroneous in this case and on this section.  Again, let me say that the powers of compulsory acquisition have existed for a considerable time and have been exercisable by four authorities I have already named.  No grave hardship has been brought to the notice of the House, to my knowledge, that would take away from the benefit of <Col N="83" /> that procedure.  It is the procedure we are concerned with and not the power.  The power already exists and if it did not, Section 10 does not give a power that is not already held by the local body concerned in relation to acquiring land.  Therefore, the mode of acquisition has been tried and has not been found wanting.</P>
    <P>Compulsory acquisition procedure has existed and has been used or is usable by at least four other types of authorities in the country and yet a cry now goes up that because we want to change and give the same procedure to our local authorities, elected bodies of our people throughout the country, we are doing something wrong.</P>
    <P>Complaint is actually made of the connection between the building of a dance-hall and the acquisition of a small-holder's farm or part of his farm.  I need not say that the question of building dance-halls, as such, does not arise on this Bill.  No power is being conveyed to any local authority to build a dance-hall, as such, in any part of its functional area.  Furthermore, <Col N="84" /> how does it happen that compulsory purchase order procedure which has operated quite extensively throughout the country, including the rural parts, in regard to housing has never resulted in the large number that one might expect from what Deputy O'Donnell said of small holders being evicted from their holdings or having their holdings reduced to such a small size that they could no longer exist on them?</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any such development in regard to housing which naturally operates on a much bigger scale.  Housing development has taken place more often and to a greater extent and more land was acquired in connection with it than could ever be anticipated as being necessary for the purposes we are discussing to-night. The idea of linking the building of a dance-hall and the eviction&mdash;almost&mdash; of a smallholder by a local authority is so farcical that I do not think it requires any further comment from me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 13 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>13.&mdash;(1)  An officer or agent of a local authority who is duly authorised in that behalf by the authority may, subject to the provisions of this section, enter on any land at all reasonable times between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. for the purpose of ascertaining whether the land is or is not suitable for acquisition by the authority.</P>
      <P>(2)  A person entering on land under this section may do thereon all things reasonably necessary for the purpose for which the entry is made and, in particular, may survey, make plans, take levels, make excavations, and examine the depth and nature of the subsoil.</P>
      <P>(3)  Before a person enters under this section on any land, the local authority on whose authority the entry is proposed to be made shall either obtain the consent (in the case of occupied land) of the occupier or (in the case of unoccupied land) the owner or shall give to the owner or occupier (as the case may be) not less than fourteen days' notice in writing of the intention to make the entry.</P>
      <P>(4)  A person to whom a notice of intention to enter on land has been given under this section by a local authority may, not later than fourteen days after the giving of such notice, apply, on notice to such local authority, to the justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district in which the land is situate for an order prohibiting the entry, and, upon the hearing of the application, the justice may, if he so thinks proper, either wholly prohibit the entry or specify conditions to be observed by the person making the entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  Where a justice of the District Court prohibits under this section a proposed entry on land, it shall not be lawful for any person to enter under this section on the land, and where a justice of the District Court specifies under this <Col N="87" /> section conditions to be observed by persons entering on land, every person who enters under this section on the land shall observe the conditions so specified.</P>
    <P>(6)  A person who suffers damage by anything done under this section on any land and, within one month after such thing is done, makes to the local authority on whose authority the land was entered under this section a claim for compensation in respect of the damage shall be entitled to be paid by the authority reasonable compensation for the damage and, in default of being paid such compensation when the amount thereof has been agreed upon or has been determined under this section, to recover it from the authority in any court of competent jurisdiction as a simple contract debt.</P>
    <P>(7)  In default of agreement, the amount of any compensation payable by a local authority under this section shall, if the amount claimed in respect thereof does not exceed twenty pounds, be determined by the District Court or, in any other case, be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 (as amended by subsequent enactments) as if the compensation were the price of land compulsorily acquired.</P>
    <P>(8)  Every person who, by act or omission, obstructs an officer or agent of a local authority in the lawful exercise of the powers conferred by this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding five pounds together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding one pound for every day on which the offence is continued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very lengthy amendment and one which in my opinion commends itself, or should commend itself, to the House.  I am very glad indeed to see that the Minister has taken the steps which he has <Col N="88" /> taken in this amendment to ensure that officials or agents of local authorities will act with propriety when they enter lands to inspect them for compulsory acquisition.  I think that is a very good thing.  There are eight subsections in the amendment.  The first subsection sets out that an officer or agent of a local authority may enter the lands.  The local authorities could not make up their minds to apply for a Compulsory Purchase Order until they had inspected the lands and it is an essential amendment.  The second subsection enables them not only to enter the land but to make a survey which is essential and which is helpful at a later time when it comes to an inquiry, if one is necessary.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) provides that notice in writing should be given 14 days before they enter the land and that it should be given to the occupier or owner.  Subsection (4) is the most important because it gives a dissatisfied owner or occupier of land the right to appeal to the district court before there is entry on to the land.  The district justice in his wisdom may make an order prohibiting the agent or servant of the local authority from entering on the land if he is satisfied it would be in the interests of public justice.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I must go a little bit further there.  We are leaving the sole discretion to the district justice.  Local authorities, at the preliminary stages, if they are dissatisfied with the district justice's decision should have the right to appeal to the circuit judge.  Remember that a district justice is a gentleman of summary jurisdiction and he may decide summarily that he will not permit the agent or servant of a local authority to enter lands.  If he does make such an order that ends the matter and there will be no compulsory purchase order, no further investigation and no inquiry and the land will never be acquired compulsorily. So far as my reading of that subsection goes, we are giving him that power.  If the local authorities are dissatisfied we should permit them to appeal to the circuit judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (6) deals with the question of compensation, not compensation <Col N="89" /> for the compulsory acquisition of the land but compensation for any damage which will be done during a preliminary survey.  Unfortunately, under subsection (7) we deal the district justice a blow.  We say: &ldquo;Although you may be the deciding authority as to whether we enter the lands or otherwise, when it comes to assessing damages we will give you jurisdiction only up to £20.  If the damages exceed £20 the matter must go to arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act.&rdquo;  We should go further than £20 and give the district justice at least the jurisdiction which he has on the civil side of the court, namely £50, and if we give him jurisdiction up to £50 we should give the local authority or the aggrieved person the right to appeal to the circuit court.</P>
    <P>In every court of jurisdiction in this country there is a right of appeal to a superior court.  We cannot initiate proceedings in the Supreme Court but other than the Supreme Court we have the right of appeal in every court in the State and this is the first place that I know of where we are taking away that right, not only from the aggrieved person but from the local authority. The Minister should look into that matter again and, if he is satisfied that there should be a right of appeal, let him insert a further amendment between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Frankly I am rather confused about this amendment and the various subsections in it.  The Bill is for the purpose of enabling local authorities to do certain things.  It appears to me&mdash;I may not be reading it correctly&mdash;that the amendment is providing machinery whereby the purposes of the Bill and the powers of the local authority may be completely vitiated because in the sub-section there are conditions laid down which cover the entry of the local authorities into lands for the purpose of obtaining evidence for submission to a tribunal or body set up by the Minister for Local Government to deal with an application for a compulsory purchase order.  One of the matters about which I am not quite clear is whether the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; in this amendment <Col N="90" /> refers only to land and not to buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Buildings also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if it is proposed to introduce machinery, as apparently it is proposed under this Bill, to make it possible for the local authority to utilise compulsory purchase order procedure at their convenience, it appears rather strange that in subsection (1) it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>...at all reasonable times between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.</P>
      <P>Take the case of local authorities who are seeking to inspect a building which is inhabited by people who may be out at work all day and are available only after 6 p.m.  To limit the right of entry of the local authority in those circumstances would mean that no inspection could be made of the building or part of a building occupied by those people.  If no inspection can be made, how can a local authority accumulate evidence for submission to an inspector in a case where a compulsory purchase order is sought?</P>
      <P>The restriction to the hours 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. does not impose very serious difficulties but if the right which is given to a district justice in subsection (4), if he thinks proper, to prohibit entry on land, can be exercised by a district justice entirely at his own discretion, in effect, the efforts of a local authority to utilise the machinery of compulsory purchase order may be completely negatived.  This subsection gives a district justice authority to prohibit entry for the purpose of survey, for the purpose of preparing a case to be submitted where a compulsory purchase order is sought.</P>
      <P>I may be entirely wrong and I should be glad to be so advised, but it appears to me that in their present form these amendments could have the effect of negativing the general value of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions governing the housing of the working classes, a representative may attend at reasonable times.  I do not think that there should be any question that &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; should be interpreted to mean the convenience of the owner or <Col N="91" /> occupier, but the limitation to specific hours could give an owner of a small property or portion of a property that was affected or liable to be affected by the activities of the local authority the right to say: &ldquo;You cannot come in before 9 a.m.  You cannot come in after 6 p.m.  I am not available at any other time.  Therefore, you cannot come in.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Secondly, the owner or occupier of property might apply to the district Court seeking a prohibition order and, as I read it, if the district justice gives such an order, then, as Deputy O'Donnell mentioned earlier, the efforts of the authority concerned are brought to a complete stop.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister again to examine this amendment and to say whether 14 days' notice in writing is essential.  Is it essential that valuers or architects appointed by a local authority will give 14 days' notice before they call to look at a piece of property or survey land?</P>
    <P>These are the matters on which I should like further clarification by the Minister.  I refer in particular to the power given to the district justice to prevent a local authority from surveying and thereby prevent the local authority from making a case to the inspector.  It is common sense that an inspector appointed by the Minister for Local Government would not entertain an application for a compulsory purchase order submitted to him by a local authority who merely stated in general terms the purpose for which they wanted the order and failed to submit detailed and technical evidence in support of their application. Obviously, the inspector would have to say to them: &ldquo;Gentlemen, do you not think that you should give me some information on the application you are making before me on this occasion?&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister to deal with that aspect of his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the section in the order in which it appears, regardless of the order in which the various matters were raised by Deputies. Incidentally, I should say that <Col N="92" /> amendment No. 6 as we now read it, which is given here, is in fact taken from the 1947 Health Act without change.</P>
      <P>On subsection (1) of the amending section, Deputy Larkin raised the question of the hours 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. I feel that the hours 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. if one is to choose hours setting some general guide, are reasonable hours during which one might expect to be not too unwelcome in one's visitations to any person's house or premises for the purposes outlined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that in the case of working people who may be absent during the hours 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., you cannot enter before 9 a.m. or after 6 p.m.  If the hours between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. are not found to be suitable by the occupier, it would be for the occupier, in reason, to agree to an hour before 9 a.m. or after 6 p.m. I take it that after due notice and consideration, there could be an enforceable examination or entry within the hours 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. if no facility was granted outside the hours.  That is the manner in which I think we must regard this and in which we do regard it.  It does not inhibit the local authority or its officers in the operation of the Bill as a whole or the intentions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The other subsection that was objected to was subsection (4).  The points raised in that connection are quite well taken in that it would appear, if one merely reads the sub-section, that it says that a district justice in the district court would be the absolute determining factor as to whether you could enter land or property or not and, whether it was the local authority or the owner who felt aggrieved, that that was the end of it. But, this subsection must be taken in accordance with general legal usage to mean that any matter that is determined by the district court is subject to appeal to the higher courts.</P>

      <P>With regard to the other matter mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell&mdash;the question of the amount stipulated as that appropriate to be dealt with by the district court or the district justice&mdash;I would say that as far as I see it at the moment, it is a matter that I would agree to consider between now and the Report Stage, and possibly raise it up to what might be regarded as a more reasonable limit than the £20.  The sum of £50 or something near that might be more in keeping with present day valuations; otherwise, the amendment is as in the 1947 Health Act.  It does not have the defects under subsection (1) and subsection (4) about which fears were expressed but I am quite satisfied as far as subsection (7) is concerned. Between now and the Report Stage, I shall give consideration to an amendment of the figure of £20, to bring it up to a more reasonable figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Bill in effect utilises the provisions of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, why is it necessary in regard to the inspection of land or property to depart from the provisions of the Act for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I might answer the Deputy's question this way.  Dublin Corporation got representations, which were brought to our attention when the Bill first appeared, and which seemed to suggest that we should apply Section 42 of the Housing Act, 1931, which would, as Deputy Larkin said, be entirely in keeping in so far as the spirit is concerned, but when we came to look at the implications of Section 42, we found that that section is not suitable for two reasons.  In the first place, it applies specifically to housing, which rather limits it.  Secondly&mdash;and this is even more important&mdash;it was worded as <Col N="94" /> applying only to cases where a compulsory purchase order had been given; in other words, after the grant rather than before it.  While we could not accede to the request of Dublin Corporation for those two stated reasons, we applied this section which, taken all in all, is a pretty fair method of approach, having regard to the private as well as the public interests.</P>
      <P>While the question of the 14 days' notice might be said to be in some cases scarcely necessary, on the other hand, I do not think that 14 days' due notice in writing is an undue burden when one considers that we are dealing with something which may arise only once in a century.  I am fairly satisfied that the amendment which we are now transcribing from the 1947 Health Act with possibly an amendment of subsection (7), is a reasonable effort to meet both sides of the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not quite correct.  It seems to be quite clear that these hours are laid down so that there will not be any undue disturbance of people at unreasonable hours.  It is right that such sensible hours should be actually dictated there.  If within those hours it is unreasonable in the special circumstances of the person or occupant concerned, then obviously it is he who will have to accommodate the local authority by specifying an hour after or before.  You will meet him by agreeing to an hour outside the stated hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In quite a percentage of cases, it is more convenient for the occupier to have the inspection made after the hours mentioned.  In that event, it is a question of the convenience of the occupier and not of the local authority.  In that event, does subsection (1) permit arrangements being made convenient for the occupier? It appears to me that the section does not, as it is written, make it possible for the local authority to convenience the occupier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not in any way circumscribe any effort in that direction. It merely safeguards people and occupiers from being disturbed at unreasonable hours which would be taken in normal circumstances to be hours other than the hours between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  If an occupier, because of his absence from home, finds he cannot possibly give access to the local authority officers within the specified hours of 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., it is quite obvious that it is he who needs to be facilitated! It will be for him to propose an alternative hour outside the stated hours and unless he suggests the middle of the night, I am sure it will always be possible to find some officer willing to come along and do the inspection in order to facilitate the private individual on whose property he is entering.  The section has been taken from the 1947 Act, which is 13 years old.  There has been no objection on any grounds such as those which have been raised in this discussion.</P>

I asked the Minister what the capacity of each station was, what the total capacity was and what has been the greatest draw on the total capacity at the highest point of peak load.  I got a reply which was that it had kept to 100 per cent. for some time.  That is not an answer to the question I asked. The question related to the total generating capacity and, over the last three years, the total draw at peak load periods.  One station might be working to 100 per cent. capacity and others might be lying idle.  Perhaps the Minister could direct himself to the point at issue.  Have we surplus generating capacity at the moment and if so, what is the necessity to add to it?  The Minister may have a reply in the morning for me?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had given the Deputy sufficient information to assure him that the amount of spare capacity is sufficient only to deal with the different power demands that arise from time to time.  It is almost impossible to make comparisons with other countries because of the different conditions here.  The spare capacity of the E.S.B. is regarded as the minimum required to deal with the following series of situations as they arise.  We have the almost fantastic situation of an extremely wet year followed by a dry winter in which the hydro-stations are not able to provide the amount of power for the peak winter purposes. <Col N="100" /> At the same time, in certain years there will be insufficient turf production but in the latter part of the year there may again be a dry season which will reduce the winter water power.</P>
      <P>With all these varying types of situations and with the peak requirement at certain times of the year roughly from sundown to 11 o'clock, the amount of spare capacity required is, I am advised by the Board, only adequate.  Naturally they make allowances for what might be described as emergency conditions.  They have to take account between the difference in the position here and in Great Britain where the vast majority of the power is provided by solid fuel or oil and in which hydro-development does not enter into it.  It would be much too long an exercise for me, even if I had the figures, to measure the very cheap cost of hydro-generated power as compared with any other type of power, against the interest on capital for the spare capacity required when the hydro-power is inadequate.</P>
      <P>The programme of the E.S.B. for the next eight years was put up to us by the E.S.B.  It was accepted almost without any amendment whatever.  It is their prediction of what is required in the next eight years, based on certain assumptions in regard to the increase of power required by the community&mdash;based on the assumption that the increase will be seven per cent. per annum.  No pressure is being brought to bear on the E.S.B. to put in more installed capacity for turf or for oil, either with the object of forcing a higher degree of employment on the bogs or in order to suggest that we are moving faster than we really are in the economic life of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals were put forward to us by the Board and were accepted by the Government.  The only important consideration is that the Government have for a considerable number of years stressed the necessity for making use of the whole of our available turf resources on bogs which are economically useful.  The production of turf varies from year to year.  The community may be paying a certain cost <Col N="101" /> arising from the effects of weather upon turf production.  Now that Bord na Móna have gone into the production of milled peat which is a very low cost fuel and now that they have been able to experience production over a number of years the arrangement is made that Bord na Móna will reserve about 25 per cent. surplus of peat from one year to the other so as to avoid the kind of excess capacity that might otherwise be necessary if there were not that reserve of peat.</P>
    <P>As more and more of the available turf bogs get into production, there will be a higher percentage of power derived from oil.  Quite evidently, as the consumption of current increases to reach the point where every bog is being exploited and where the total percentage of power derived from local and oil increases, the excess capacity may be slightly diminished because of the fact that in examining the use of water, oil and peat there is a sufficient amount of oil to prevent an unnecessary amount of spare capacity being required because of the possibility of bad weather on the bogs from one year to another.</P>

    <Title>Transport Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the provisions of Section 23 of the Transport Act, 1958, in relation to the Royal Canal only so that C.I.E. will be empowered to close that canal to navigation on two months' notice; as the law stands at present C.I.E. could not close the canal to navigation unless it had not been used for public navigation for three years or more.</P>
      <P>The Royal Canal, about 96 miles in length, extends from the Port of Dublin to the Shannon at Tarmonbarry. It passes through the Counties of Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath and Longford and served the towns of Dublin, Mullingar and Longford. Longford was served by a branch (about five and a half miles long) from the main line of the canal a few miles from its junction with the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Royal Canal was constructed under the provision of a Charter of <Col N="103" /> Incorporation of the Royal Canal Company under the Great Seal of Ireland in 1789.  Ownership of the canal passed to Great Southern Railways Company from the Midland Great Western Railway Company under the Railways Act 1924; and subsequently, ownership passed to C.I.E. under the Transport Act, 1944. Neither C.I.E. nor their predecessor ever operated a commercial transport service on the Royal Canal.  Commercial navigation on the canal has in fact ceased since 1951.  The Broadstone branch of the canal was closed in 1927 and subsequently filled in. Recently the Longford branch and the section from Spencer Dock, Dublin, to Liffey Junction were closed to navigation. There is no longer access to the canal from the Port of Dublin. During the past 4 years there has been no public navigation on the Royal Canal except in a technical sense, that is to say, by locally owned row-boats or canoes.</P>
    <P>In that period the canal had been used on 14 occasions only and the total revenue derived by C.I.E. from tolls in that period amounted only to £10 5s. 1d.</P>
    <P>I would have been quite satisfied to allow the position of the Royal Canal to continue as at present until the five year term for the reorganisation of C.I.E. was completed in July, 1963. The question has arisen, however, of the replacement of various road bridges over the canal and it has been found that the cost of replacing these bridges will be increased substantially if they have to be designed to provide for navigation.  For example, in the case of the &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; Bridge at Mullingar which is due for immediate reconstruction, the cost of the new bridge will be increased by about £8,000 if it is necessary to provide for navigation.  A similar position will arise in respect of other bridges on this canal which must be reconstructed in the near future.  If such bridges were to be reconstructed to allow for navigation shortly before the closing of the canal to navigation the Minister for Local Government feels, and rightly <Col N="104" /> so, that the Departments and the Local Authorities concerned would be open to criticism for wasteful exepnditure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands is at present giving consideration to the possibility of developing the canals generally for coarse fishing and eel fisheries.  The closing of the Royal Canal to navigation will not prejudice any plans in this respect; in fact it should clear the way for further consideration of such plans.</P>
    <P>Lest there should be any misunderstanding on the point I would mention that the closure of the Royal Canal to navigation would not affect the other obligations of C.I.E. in relation to it.  C.I.E. would continue to be responsible for such matters as drainage and prevention of flooding and if subsequently they should wish to abandon the canal these responsibilities will be transferred, if necessary, to some other body or bodies.  Needless to say, permission to abandon the canal would not be given without due regard to interests in respect of which C.I.E. retains responsibilities nor would such permission be given unless it were clear beforehand that abandonment would not prejudice proposals for development of the canal for other purposes.</P>
    <P>As to the future of the Royal Canal, the present intentions are that the portion of the canal between Liffey Junction and Mullingar will be retained indefinitely for water supply purposes; the portion of the canal west of Mullingar will also be retained for the time being, but ultimately it may have to be abandoned unless it is found possible to develop it for some other purposes.  The portion of the canal between the Liffey and Liffey Junction and the Longford branch have already been closed to navigation.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that this Bill deals solely with the Royal Canal.  The position in relation to navigation on the Grand Canal was explained by my predecessor in the course of the debate in this House on the Transport Act, 1958.  The provisions of that Bill as introduced would have enabled C.I.E. to close a canal to navigation on one month's notice.  It was, however, strongly felt by various interests that <Col N="105" /> the Grand Canal still had a potential for future development, and to meet those views the Bill was amended to provide that C.I.E. would close a canal to navigation only where it had not been used for public navigation for three years or more.  The intention of that amendment was that those interests which supported the retention of the canal would thereby have an opportunity of demonstrating that the canals would be used to an extent sufficient to justify their retention for navigation; and in relation to the Grand Canal that situation will remain unchanged at least until the end of the 5-year period allowed to C.I.E. under the Transport Act, 1958, for reorganisation of the transport services.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances and bearing in mind the urgent necessity to provide for reconstruction of certain bridges over the Royal Canal, I consider that the legal requirement to keep the canal open to navigation should now be repealed and, therefore, I recommend that the House give a Second Reading to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the main there are three points arising for consideration in connection with this legislation. One is navigation; the second is fishing rights; and the third is water supply purposes and it strikes me as somewhat ominous for the future, in connection with water supplies, that the Minister says that portion of the canal between Liffey Junction and Mullingar &ldquo;will be retained indefinitely for water supply purposes&rdquo;.  The rest of that is very much in the air, with the Minister saying that portion will also be retained &ldquo;for the time being but ultimately it may have to be abandoned&rdquo;.  I think that is a warning that it will be abandoned but it is not thought politic to say that at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also deals with certain amenities and properties connected with coarse fishing and eel fisheries, but we are left in the dark about them.  He states: &ldquo;The Minister for Lands is at present giving consideration to the possibility of developing <Col N="106" /> the canals generally for coarse fishing and eel fisheries.  The closing of the Royal Canal to navigation will not prejudice any plans in this respect ...&rdquo; We shall have to wait and see what will happen in that connection.</P>
    <P>With regard to the third question, that of navigation, there does not appear to have been very much made of it in recent years, but it is ominous that the Minister, in the early part of his speech, says the Broadstone branch, which was closed, was subsequently filled in.  I am not sure that is not intended to be a warning that the same will happen, following the stopping of navigation on the rest of the canal.  A case has been made that the public neglected to use the canal for navigation purposes, and a case has been made that it should be used, but, at a later point in his speech, the Minister says that the cost of replacing bridges over the canal will be more expensive if navigation rights are to be preserved, and he talks about bridges as if they were really going to be built. I do not know if there has been any public announcement of this proposal but I hope there will be some made between now and Committee Stage so that the public mind can become aware of what is proposed and so that we can determine reaction in the areas through which the canal runs.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, there is not much hope, in my reading of this, either from the fishing side or the water supply side.  Of course, water supply is of tremendous importance to farmers living along the canal and it is to be hoped that their interests will not be interfered with&mdash;that the canal will not be dewatered and filled in.  Certainly if that is to happen, there will be a matter of compensation to be considered and a substitute water supply found for them.</P>
    <P>This piece of legislation, small as it is, has to be brought into the whole general matter of C.I.E., and C.I.E. are not exactly having a good Press at the present moment.  They appear to have fixed firmly in front of their minds the necessity of having a good balance sheet showing as quickly as possible. In that connection, may I say they appear to be forgetting what was <Col N="107" /> stated in this House to be their duty? Their duty is to provide service, and whether their services are completely economic in certain areas, is a different matter.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of a speech made by the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, in connection with transport legislation in 1956, when he said it was completely wrong to think of these pieces of transport legislation as something designed to save C.I.E.  His speech was to the effect that C.I.E. could provide a service, a nation-wide service, whether by land or some other form of transport, for both passengers and goods, with fares that provided equal justice between everybody, and rates set equally for separate classes of merchandise where the merchandise had been properly classified.</P>
    <P>All that has gone by the board.  The 1958 Act gave C.I.E. power to make individual bargains and there is now no question of an obligation on them to give equal treatment to those who use their transport services.  The Minister will be aware of the agitation and indignation that exists in many parts of the country where lines have been closed that were essential for the communities concerned while, at the same time, money is being squandered in a most extravagant manner on traffic through the air.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the only thing I need say in reply to Deputy McGilligan is that C.I.E. cannot get out of their responsibilities under this Bill, except to close the canal for navigation.  The future of the canal will be safeguarded, if necessary, to cover water supply requirements and possible fishing developments.  For example, if the canal were finally abandoned and filled in, and it had been providing a water supply, then another supply would have to be provided and C.I.E. accept responsibility for that.  That is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the House need have any great anxiety in regard to fishing development because I have the Inland Fisheries Trust's angling campaign very much at heart.  One of the satisfactory features of the situation is that <Col N="108" /> very considerable stretches of the Royal Canal will be kept open and the canal will be kept filled with water, thus enabling the Inland Fisheries Trust to pursue its policy of stocking canals with coarse fish, if that seems desirable to them.  It does not interfere with the coarse fishing campaign and at the same time, the future of the canal will be safeguarded, in so far as water supply requirements and fishing developments are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been saying that when the Deputies who were so favourably disposed towards adoption of the 1946 motion found themselves in office in <Col N="109" /> 1948, they were either not in earnest in 1946 or, when they saw the difficulties and complexities to which Deputy O'Malley referred, they decided that action on the lines of the motion was not possible.  That belief was justified by the answer which the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Mac Eoin, gave to a Labour Deputy, Deputy James Tully, who asked him in 1950 whether it was the Government's intention &ldquo;to introduce proposals for legislation in the near future with a view to giving leaseholders the opportunity of buying out their ground rents at reasonable terms, such as ten to fifteen years' purchase&rdquo;. The Minister for Justice said: &ldquo;The answer is in the negative.&rdquo;  That was an uncompromising &ldquo;no&rdquo; on the part of the Minister.  I have to presume that after a period of two years in office, they had ample time to have examined the position as they found it, and they took the same action as successive Governments had taken over all the years.</P>
      <P>I presume that the reason why no action to give effect to the motion was taken was because of the difficulties and complexities to which Deputy O'Malley referred in the course of his speech.  Someone may ask: &ldquo;What are these difficulties and complexities?&rdquo;  The answer is that they are numerous&mdash;too numerous to start mentioning in detail.  The most difficult, I would say, would be that of endeavouring to compensate the many interests that are often involved between the head lessor and the occupying leaseholder.  Most Deputies interested in this subject know that there can be a number of these intermediate interests.  There is the freeholder himself in the first instance, and there may be a developer, who perhaps takes a lease from the freeholder. Then there is the builder and then the tenant.  All of these interests will have a claim and they will all, naturally, be looking for their share of the compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there would be the cost of legal proceedings.  There would be the searches, the assessments of the purchase value of the ground rents, complicated conveyances and so on. In addition, it would necessitate the <Col N="110" /> setting up of administrative machinery of a most specialised kind to deal with such applications as might be made.</P>
    <P>In the course of the 1946 debate on this question, Deputy J.S. O'Connor, a practising solicitor in this city, a man who had specialised in that particular branch of the law, made what I deem now to be one of the most realistic speeches on the 1946 motion.  He said in the course of that speech, just as Deputy O'Malley said last Wednesday, that he was in full sympathy with the motion but that he could not see how effect could be given to it as suggested by the various speakers who participated in that debate.  During his speech which, as I say, was a reasoned speech and one which expressed sympathy with the object of the motion, he said:</P>
    <P>We have no idea of the total amount of rent involved.  We have no idea of the financial assistance which would be needed from the State and we have no idea of the size and cost of the Department that would be needed to carry out a proposal of this kind.  It seems to me that for that administrative side alone we would need a Department as large as the Land Commission and the Board of Works put together.  I do not want to frighten anybody by suggesting that we could possibly have another Land Commission but I do not know how the proposal would be carried out otherwise, without a Department to work on the same lines as the Land Commission, and I cannot form any idea whatever of the cost of the administration of that Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey, another man experienced in this subject, intervened to say: &ldquo;Or how long it would take.&rdquo; Deputy Morrissey was a Minister at a later stage.  He at least realised as well as Deputy O'Connor the problems involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan, in the course of his speech, said that if we abolish future ground rents land owners will not get the £150 to £200 extra they now get by selling the freehold.  I think he is over-optimistic in making that statement because land is scarce and good <Col N="111" /> building land is scarcer still.  To get a site, house-hunters must pay the market price and when there is competition for a good site the price will naturally be as high as the highest bidder is prepared to pay.  I am pretty certain that no one will suggest that the price of land should be controlled.</P>
    <P>The 1931 Act gave leaseholders, for the first time, a statutory right to have a lease renewed.  Moreover it prescribed the terms which were to be included in the renewal lease in default of agreement.  It guaranteed a new lease for a term of at least 99 years and, in the important matter of rent, it provided that the ground landlord could not charge more than one-quarter of the letting value.  It is no exaggeration to say that all the major anomalies and abuses which were characteristic of the leasehold system were swept away by the 1931 Act.  It was not until 1954 that leaseholders in Britain were given rights of renewal and the terms of renewal are not as favourable as those that are enjoyed in this country despite the statement that Deputy T.F. O'Higgins made here the other evening when he said that ground rents could be purchased in Britain.  They cannot be purchased in Britain any more than they can be purchased here.  That can only be done by voluntary agreement between the owner of the ground rent and the tenant.  That operates in Great Britain and the same position operates here. If two people agree to do business with each other there should be no difficulty whatever in reaching agreement and having a contract entered into.  In the Six Counties, the leaseholders are still in the position of having no rights whatever when their leases expire.  We have advanced a considerable distance in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>The three major recommendations in the Conroy Commission Report were all designed to improve the position of leaseholders and were given effect to in the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958&mdash;that is the Act I referred to in the course of my opening remarks last Wednesday. Firstly, the right to obtain a renewal lease on favourable terms <Col N="112" /> prescribed by the 1931 Act was extended to certain leaseholders who, for technical reasons, had been excluded from the scope of that Act. Secondly, compensation was provided for any leaseholder who was refused a reversionary lease.  Thirdly, the maximum rent which a ground landlord might charge under a renewal lease was reduced from one-quarter of the letting value to one-sixth.  That was another valuable advance.</P>
    <P>The 1958 Act could be described as an all-Party Act because it arose from the consideration which the previous Government gave to this question and I must presume that that was as far as they were prepared to advance at that time.  The Bill was introduced and given a second reading but it lapsed because of the dissolution of the Dáil.  That was the measure which I had the privilege of introducing and which is now known as the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958.  We can all take some credit for that Act.</P>
    <P>The first requirement which any compulsory purchase scheme must satisfy is that it should be on the basis of paying the full market price to the landlord for his interest and any scheme providing for the payment of anything less than that would contain an element of confiscation, would be unjust, and would be of very doubtful constitutional validity.  Many leaseholders, as we all know, are people of moderate means whose houses are generally already mortgaged.  They would not be able to provide the purchase money either from their own resources or by borrowing.  I think it would not be too much to say that most leaseholders are in that position. As for the remainder, it seems to me it would be difficult to persuade the majority of them to spend from their own resources, or to borrow, the purchase money of a ground rent in preference to alternative methods of investing or spending particularly when it is more than doubtful that their purchase of the rent would make any difference to the selling price of the house should a sale become necessary.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I met a friend that <Col N="113" /> I knew in the old days who was something of a fanatic in regard to ground rents.  I knew that he was always nagging the ground landlord to give him the right to purchase.  He eventually secured that right and made the purchase.  He had a family of two girls and one boy and his intention was to purchase the freehold so that in due course he could pass the house on to his son.  When I met him a short time ago I asked him how he had fared in this respect.  He seemed to be a disappointed man, whose dreams had not been realised.</P>
    <P>The two girls had married in due course.  They naturally wanted modern houses which they got eventually. When the son got married he, too, was not satisfied with this older type of house, a fine house in the Rathgar area with three storeys and a basement, and got a modern house also. The house is now left on the man's hands and he told me: &ldquo;In due course, it will be sold and I am certain I will not get a penny more even though I have the freehold of it.&rdquo;  In other words, the fact that it is freehold will not be taken into consideration when a sale is being made.  That is another aspect of this discussion.</P>
    <P>Apart from the considerations which have been discussed, there are also several serious disadvantages connected with any scheme of compulsory purchase.  A major difficulty arises in connection with the restrictive covenants contained in ground leases with the object of maintaining the amenities of the estate or neighbourhood. It would be unjust to his neighbours if a leaseholder could free himself from these covenants by acquiring the freehold and then proceed to carry on a trade or business which might seriously depreciate the amenities and the value of property in the vicinity.</P>
    <P>That has actually happened and most Deputies have had the experience of somebody turning a residential house into a shop and starting some type of business which was most objectionable to the people of the neighbourhood, such as a cheap café with one of these juke boxes blaring away into the small hours of the morning or, as in another case, somebody opening <Col N="114" /> a chip potato shop with its objectionable fumes.  I appreciate these covenants are irksome to individual tenants.  However, we must grant that they are freely entered into between the tenants and the ground landlord for the benefit of the neighbourhood as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that the introduction of a compulsory purchase scheme would result in the abolition of the building lease system which, whatever its defects, has in the past facilitated the provision of houses at a lower capital outlay to the purchaser. I believe that without the leasehold system the cost of the postwar building drive and the enormous drain it imposed on State capital funds would have been greatly increased and there would have been serious risk of a breakdown.</P>
    <P>Referring back to the restrictive covenants I should like to refer to the letter which Deputy Larkin quoted in his opening speech.  It was a letter addressed to Deputy Corish by a young man in some part of the country who was making a complaint in regard to some property he had inherited from his father who in turn, had inherited it from his uncle.  It would appear that the young man wanted to make a letting of some portion of the premises.  He made application to the landlord and the landlord, for some reason best known to himself, refused permission.  Unfortunately the young man, like the angry young men of today, decided to take the law into his own hands, and proceeded to make the subletting. That was a breach of a covenant freely entered into.  The peculiar thing about it is that there has been no mention of any such disagreement having existed between the young man's granduncle and the then ground landlord or between the young man's father and the ground landlord.  In fact, it appears that four such sublettings were made in the past.  It was not until this young man himself entered into the business that the first disagreement occurred.</P>
    <P>If this young man had acted wisely he would have consulted a solicitor after he had been refused permission <Col N="115" /> and before doing anything else.  The solicitor would no doubt have advised him that he should apply for relief under the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, which provides that where there is a covenant of this kind in a lease the landlord's consent may not be unreasonably withheld.  I do not know &mdash;perhaps Deputy Ryan, who is a lawyer, could tell us&mdash;whether that breach of the covenant will prevent that young man's taking the case to court and getting a decision on the reasonableness or otherwise of the landlord's refusal.  It may be that he will have to correct the breach which he committed.  I should imagine so.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It has been suggested in the course of the debate that ground rents should not be created in the future.  That is a suggestion which, I may tell the House, the Government considered arising out of the tabling of this motion.  Some time ago, I was instructed by the Government to have that matter examined.  I am having it examined departmentally&mdash;with what results I cannot say yet&mdash;with a view to seeing if it is possible, for the future at any rate, to eliminate ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, it is necessary to look at this question with a view to seeing whether the advantages to the community generally, as distinct from particular leaseholders, of a compulsory scheme would not, perhaps, be outweighed by the attendant disadvantages, such as the upsetting effect it would have on building development and investments in ground rents and the legal costs of transfer.  The number of leaseholders who would, in fact, avail themselves of such a scheme is, as I say, likely to be small and the legal costs involved might often be substantial.  Moreover, many leaseholders are themselves landlords and in these cases occupying tenants would receive no benefit from a purchase scheme.  In these circumstances the promotion of the necessary legislation, which itself would be bound to be <Col N="116" /> complex and controversial, should not, in my opinion, be undertaken without a thorough examination by a committee of experts who would have every facility afforded to them of looking into all aspects of the possibility of legislating for the purchase of ground rents on the lines suggested by the motion.</P>
    <P>I cannot say when such a committee could be set up because of the overplus of work that is at present occupying the energies of all branches of my Department.  In particular, owing to the heavy programme of important legislation now requiring priority it may not be possible to deal with this matter for some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a most reasonable man and he has made a very forceful case against this motion.  He mentioned the complexities and the difficulties that would face the body set up to help people to acquire the freehold of the properties of which they are in possession and the difficulty of compensating the lessor and the lessee.  I do not think there would be any great difficulty because in the majority of leases, even where they are covenants, an arrangement could be made that the freehold could be purchased by a tenant.  At the same time if the covenants were important to the rest of the properties, or other people, that matter could be dealt with at the take-over, as the saying is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important thing that I can see in this is that there would not be any great difficulty in assessing the value of these ground rents.  I know a great many people who would be very glad to sell their ground rents for 10 or 12 years' purchase.  The only difficulty would be that the people living in the houses would not be able to put up the money.  That I think is the object of this motion, that the Government should bring in legislation and moneys would be made available to the people who could come to an arrangement with their landlords.  The bankers are not so hot on this themselves but if an arrangement were made there could be a purchase scheme similar to the land purchase scheme.  There were <Col N="117" /> many difficulties and complexities in relation to taking over all the land in Ireland.  We had to get the Land Commission to do it and although people decry the Commission it did a good job.  It would not be necessary to have enormous machinery like the Land Commission because this is more or less an open and shut business.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fair for Deputy O'Malley to come along to pin the stand which the Government are making on the shoulders of Deputy Sean MacEoin because away back in 1951 or 1952 in answer to a question he said that he did not intend bringing in legislation.  He probably had something else on his plate at the time but the fact that a former Minister made that statement does not mean that the House is going to stand rigidly by it, or that it would give the Minister a foundation to stand over what Deputy MacEoin said.</P>

      <P>I am not ashamed at all.  Last week I heard speakers attack ground landlords and talk about what happened in Dublin and of how people acquired great portions of the city of Dublin.  They said that they have been drawing ground rents for the past 200 or 300 years.  Well, that was due to Dublin Corporation and the Dublin people.  They gave them these big patches of ground because they were friends of theirs and they gave them for peppercorns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where local authorities are ground landlords they are reasonable and generous landlords.  The local authority to which I belong, the Waterford Corporation, own 90 per cent. of the ground rents in Waterford.  They did not dish them out for peppercorns and they did not rack rent them.  They own an enormous amount of land around the city and, when people want to erect small dwellings, they are supplied with a site on a 75 years' lease, with no fine and at £2 a year, and there are eight or nine houses to the acre.  Please God, whenever there is legislation on this problem, that aspect will be taken into consideration. <Col N="119" /> It would not be fair to pin down very generous landlords who were local authorities.</P>
    <P>This motion is reasonable because it refers to purchase on equitable terms.  The movers of the motion are not endeavouring to confiscate people's land or ground rents.  What the motion asks is that legislation should be introduced to give people living in houses and paying a ground rent the opportunity of purchasing that ground rent.  They could be purchased in the same manner as the land was purchased by the Land Commission, as I mentioned before.  An arrangement could be made for so many years' purchase.  The money would be paid down immediately to the landlord; the tenant would pay so much a year for so many years and then he would be in the clear.  That I think is the object of the motion; it is reasonable and I shall support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to intrude on Deputy Larkin's time, but perhaps he might give me three or four minutes.  The Minister has given us a very reasoned analysis of the pros and cons of the whole question of ground rents.  His conclusions do not fully convince me, but nevertheless he has given us a factual appraisal of this question of ground rents.  It is quite clear from his remarks and from what we have heard in the House that this question is so forbidding that Governments have shied from it completely.  Some day, some Government will have to tackle this problem.  It is a longstanding problem which probably began in the days when land was privately owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to remember that in all the Land Acts from 1895 to 1903, under the British regime, and again in 1923, under our own Government, definite reductions were given whereas the ground rents remained as they <Col N="120" /> were over the years, particularly the old ground rents.  Undoubtedly, those people who have been drawing ground rents over the years have been amply repaid for wherever they lost in the little land they gave for housing.</P>
    <P>This matter calls for redress of some kind.  I sympathise with the Minister and the Government who would have to face up to this problem.  Many of the persons who are benefiting from ground rents in this country are resident abroad.  The people who pay the ground rents have to pay the income tax for them.  Admittedly, they deduct it from the ground rent. Nevertheless, the person paying the ground rent has to pay the income tax on the ground rent for the person resident in England.  I suppose the income tax authorities are perfectly entitled to have the tax collected in that way but the position is anomalous.</P>
    <P>I do not know anything about local authorities but I believe some local authorities are drawing ground rents in respect of houses being built at the present time.  May I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, since 1934, housing has made rapid progress and that this question of ground rents has been repeated, especially in the towns and cities.  In some towns where the landlord owns all the property, the ground rent is iniquitous; it is abnormally high. People who have been drawing ground rents over the years have certainly got their pound of flesh.</P>
    <P>The motion is a modest one.  Redress of some kind is called for.  If the Minister gave an assurance that the Government would tackle this problem, it would be comforting to the sponsors of the motion and to the others here who have no interest whatever in ground rents.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that ground rents have been made a stock-in-trade in recent years and that committees of various kinds have purchased ground rents in order to have recurring annual revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been surprised by the attitude taken by the Minister in expressing the views of the Government on this matter.  The Minister gave a fairly long dissertation on the difficulties involved, after accusing a previous Minister for Justice of some lack of courage or lack of sincerity because he failed to bring in a motion on the same lines to the House.</P>
      <P>What this motion asks of the House is very simple: it is to state whether in this year 1960 it is a good and proper thing that the citizens should be put in a position to buy the small plots of ground on which their houses stand.</P>
      <P>Over the years, there have been exhortations from Ministers of the present Government and of previous Governments on the value to the community of private ownership of homes. It has been pointed out frequently that the only responsible citizens are those who own their homes or who are in the process of purchasing their homes. Yet, the same Government, the same Ministers and the same Party who advocate private ownership of homes as a most desirable position say here that they do not think ownership of the home should extend to the ground on which the home stands.</P>
      <P>For many years since this State was formed and prior to that, the argument has been put before the people that the ground on which their homes stand is part of Ireland and should be owned by the Irish people, that individual citizens should have their right in their homestead and in their plot of ground.  I am afraid this Minister for Justice, like his predecessors since this State was formed, is not prepared to face up to the problem.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that ground rents are in many cases not owned by the people who originally owned the ground on which the houses were built.  Everybody knows that when a builder builds 20, 30 or 50 houses, almost within a matter of years, the ground rents on those houses are sold to somebody else and the bulk of the ground rents, possibly, are controlled by a relatively small number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth last week painted a heartrending picture of the poor <Col N="122" /> builder who provided houses for people and had to pay a fine for the ground, which he had to pass on. What happens?  Somebody owns 20, 50, 100 or 200 acres.  He sells or leases that ground to a developer.  The developer runs in roadways in certain cases and builders, large or small, come in and build houses.  They may build an estate; they may build a few houses here and there.  Millions of pounds of public money have been made available for the purpose of assisting people to buy their houses. Considerable benefit of that expenditure is going to people who own the land or whose forebears owned the land or who buy the land.  In 99 per cent. of cases, they do not spend one cent in developing the land.  Because a city or town develop areas and build up their communities, people whose only right in the matter is ownership of land can say: &ldquo;We own this land. Not only can we insist on getting ground rent in perpetuity but we can enforce covenants and regulations on the people who occupy the houses built on that land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to protection of people against exploitation, against the withdrawal of amenities as a result of neighbours turning their residences into fish and chip shops, cheap cafés and so on.  The fact is that in many cases the people responsible for that type of development are the ground landlords.  How many cases do we know where ground landlords and even people who built houses, because of some difficulty in disposing of residential property at a particular time, turned the property into fish and chip shops and cafés, without any regard at all for even the people to whom they sold the houses?  The Minister is aware of such cases in his own constituency.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend for one moment that anybody whose name appears on the motion pretends to think that this problem is easily solved but I do not think you will solve any problem by seeing difficulties and complexities and quoting what somebody said in 1946 and what somebody else said in 1956.</P>

      <P>How much money was made available to make it possible for people to buy the ground upon which their houses stand?  All this motion asks is that this House place on record its belief that it is proper that legislation be introduced to make it possible for Irish citizens to purchase ground rents.  If the Minister and his colleagues do not believe that is a good thing to do; if they do not believe that Irish citizens, who have homes and who are buying their homes, should also have the right to purchase the ground on which the houses stand, let them vote against this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister says he accepts the principle of this motion and is prepared to do something tangible so far as setting up machinery to examine and report to this House on the steps necessary to implement this, we would be quite prepared to accept it, but the Minister has not said that.  He has made certain difficulties and has not given any indication, so far as I can see, that there is any clear intention of dealing with this matter.  Consequently, I feel that the only thing for the House to do is to go on record <Col N="124" /> as to whether it is or is not a desirable thing to have legislation introduced for the purpose of permitting people to purchase their ground rents.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many people want to purchase ground rents.  The Minister may be right but I do know that if it is good and proper for people to be assisted to purchase their homes, the right which goes with it to purchase the ground on which their homes are built should not be denied them. At the present moment, the power lies only in the hands of ground landlords and nobody else.  No tenant, no house purchaser and no house owner can say: &ldquo;I want to purchase the ground rent.  Let us enter into a deal&rdquo;, because the owner, who may be an Irish citizen or in very many cases, an alien, can say: &ldquo;You have no right to buy the ground rent.  I do not propose to enter into any agreement to sell you this ground rent.  I shall observe the law in so far as the conditions of renting the ground are concerned but I do not propose to sell you one inch of it.  I am going to exercise my right and you have no right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears to me that so long as that position continues, we still have a right in this country of overriding the right of the landlords as against the ordinary citizens of the country.  I think it is time that this House set about the task, even though it may take a long time, even though there may be complexities, of doing something about it.  I would, therefore, ask that the House adopt this motion, which, even the Minister cannot say, has not been set down in reasonable terms.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Dairy and Cattle Industries: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That in view of the serious position of the dairy and cattle industries, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the whole question of prices and marketing should be reviewed.</P>
      <P>I do not want to give the impression that either Deputy Finucane or myself knows more about the marketing of agricultural produce than the Minister, his officials or many important men engaged in the industry.  I have no hesitation in conveying to the Minister and to the House our disappointment with the progress in market development and research.  Our system of marketing agricultural produce is obsolete.  It is the same today as it was 50 years ago.</P>
      <P>We are still exporting the bulk of our cattle on the hoof.  Irish farmers suffer and have suffered the whims and fancies of the English farmer.  At the slightest notification of foot and mouth disease in Britain, the Irish farmer suffers because the markets are held up.  That happened 50 years ago and it is still happening.  The least upset in the British market has an unfavourable reaction on our farmers.  It is high time some practical steps were taken by our Government to ensure that more of our cattle are processed for export.  That refers particularly to the British market, which is considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> This question must be reviewed.  We should have abattoirs to enable us to slaughter more cattle.  That would give tremendous employment.  In slaughtering more of our cattle, we would have raw materials for the development of several industries.  The same applies to the slaughter of our sheep.  The development of a leather factory using cattle hides and of a major industry based on wool would provide more employment.  We hear great talk about our lack of raw materials and we search the world for industrialists willing to come here and set up industries.  We look to the four corners of the world for raw materials with which new industries can be set up, but we seem to ignore altogether the very plain fact that we have the greatest of raw material on our own farms.  If we could draw public attention to this raw material and have the necessary finances, backed by the Government, we could produce numerous commodities from the slaughter of our livestock at home, and allied with that, should be the transport of carcase meat to export markets.</P>
    <P>We need more and better refrigerator ships to transport our meat to the various ports in England.  There are 10,000,000 people in the city of London and they alone could consume more than we could send them.  There are also big populations in Liverpool, Birmingham and Glasgow but we need the necessary ships to transport our finished products to all those markets. We need a proper marketing organisation and suitable depots at those ports for the distribution of our finished products and, when we get them, we should ensure that only the best is sent to them.  The customers there are anxious to secure our Irish products because they know they can get them fresh and clean.  Cattle and sheep killed in Dublin or Cork today could be sold fresh in any English market tomorrow, but we have not availed ourselves of the tremendous geographical advantage which we enjoy, and it is high time the Government did something practical and realised the importance of our own raw materials worked to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, I welcomed the announcement made by the Minister <Col N="131" /> for Agriculture that he was allocating a sum of £250,000 for market research for agricultural produce, but I am sorry to say that the progress made since then has been shockingly slow and disappointing.  There is an old saying that big bodies move slowly, but this business is moving too slowly for my taste and that of the people who are suffering from lack of guidance in this respect.  The farmer himself is not to blame for this deficiency. He is a producer and is not in a position to explore and develop markets in foreign countries.  That is a matter altogether outside his capacity.  It is a matter that should be tackled by a combined effort on the part of all the interested parties such as those engaged in the processing and canning of meat, with the support of the Government behind them.  It will cost money, but, in my opinion, it would be money very well spent because it would provide a considerable amount of employment on the land.  I sincerely hope that some practical step will be taken in the immediate future and that lack of money will not be responsible for delaying action any longer.</P>
    <P>We read in the newspapers of the vast amount of money being spent on other projects such as the development of jet aircraft services and the Verolme Dockyard at Haulbowline. It is good to see development of that nature but I often wonder if the money is being spent to the best advantage of the Irish people.  I feel that if more money were channelled into market development, with particular emphasis on our next door neighbour, England, it would be of far greater benefit to the Irish people as a whole than money spent in any other way.</P>
    <P>Having dealt so much with cattle and sheep exports and the industries which could develop from the slaughter of livestock at home, I shall now turn to the dairying industry because that industry is the parent of the cattle industry and is the foundation of the country's whole economy.  The production of milk is a very important industry, giving a tremendous amount of employment.  Recently, the Minister <Col N="132" /> said that a slight increase in that production was causing a headache but I hope to see production increased still more.  Even though it may cause a headache, I believe that headache can be cured, and cured very effectively if our milk production is channelled into the right lines for the export market.</P>
    <P>Studying statistics today, I was amazed to note that we are importing £64,000 worth of dairy products, cheese, etc., and I should like to get an explanation of why we are importing cheese and other dairy products in 1960 into a land which is exporting its own dairy products to other countries.  I cannot see the sense in that.  It may be an infinitesimal amount in the eyes of the Minister, but to me, £64,000 appears to be a big sum to leave this country for dairy products from the first of January to the end of August, at a time when we are supposed to have a surplus of milk.</P>
    <P>When I came first into Dáil Éireann, some four years ago, I stressed the importance of developing our cheese industry.  A gallon of milk makes a pound of cheese but it takes two and a half gallons of milk to make a pound of butter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>No!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceWycherley" hpid="Mr. Wycherley Mr. Wycherley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wycherley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the development of our cheese industry, the development of our chocolate crumb industry, and the production of fresh cream for the export market would be of great benefit to the dairy farmers.  Dried milk is very important also and, if manufactured in large quantities, would find a ready market in many foreign countries, particularly the African countries where milk is so scarce.  Even out in the Congo, where our Irishmen are serving, dried milk would be a splendid substitute for new milk, which is unobtainable there. Out of evil comes good, and perhaps we can explore markets in these foreign countries to compensate us&mdash;if anything could compensate us&mdash;for the great losses we have sustained in those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> Every effort should be made to convert more of our milk into products for which there is a market, products such as chocolate crumb, dried milk and cheese instead of converting too much of it into butter, which is the most uneconomic way to dispose of milk.  It will always be essential, of course, to have sufficient milk produced here for converting into butter for the home market, but I doubt the wisdom of converting more than is necessary, if there is a ready market for the other products I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We have had reports from the Marketing Committee which has been set up.  Some of these reports date back to 26th March, 1959, so that a long time has elapsed without anything being done.  They have made certain recommendations, some of which I approve and some of which I do not approve.  In any case, it is better to do something than to do nothing.  I sincerely hope that some practical steps will be taken in the immediate future to avail of the markets in the cities and towns of England by establishing depots there for Irish beef, mutton, wool, milk, chocolate crumb and all the various commodities we produce.</P>
    <P>We are lagging hopelessly behind in the advertising of our produce.  I can see what other countries are doing by way of advertising, particularly in London, Liverpool and Glasgow.  The Italians are advertising their wares.  At every street corner you will see placards advertising their shoes and other wares of every description.  The Spaniards and the Danes are advertising, but when I was in England the only thing I saw advertised was Irish linen&mdash;and I was prepared to bet one hundred to one that that linen was probably manufactured in Japan.  We have not done our duty in that respect. We should carry on an advertising campaign, particularly in England where the demand for our fresh Irish food would be colossal, if only we made the necessary effort to put our wares on the market in a proper and fit condition.  We should advertise more on the street corners, on the screen and on television and let the people know we have Irish products for sale on the English market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> Of course, there must be continuity of supply and there is no use advertising unless we have that continuity. But I could guarantee the Minister, on behalf of the farmers of Ireland, that that continuity of supply is assured if they get from the Minister a guaranteed price to enable them to realise even a very moderate income from their labour.  In recent years, we have had the experience all too often that when production increased, down went the price.  We had that unfortunate experience with milk some couple of years ago when the price was dropped by a 1d. or a 1¾d. per gallon.  When the levy was imposed, the farmers immediately dropped production, until we were on the verge of being unable to supply the home requirements of butter.  However, with favourable weather conditions this year and a better price for milk as a result of the removal of the levy, the production of butter and milk is on the increase.</P>
    <P>I sincerly hope the Minister will make a statement at the conclusion of this debate that no matter how much milk or how many pigs are produced, the Government are prepared to stand firm and ensure that there will be no reduction in prices but rather an increase, because the more produced, the better chance there will be of capturing and holding export markets which require the guarantee of continuity of supply.  If the farmers were assured of a reasonable price for their products, they could double or quadruple their present output, but our experience in the past has not been happy in that regard.  The Government made blunders in reducing prices and the country suffered as a result of it.</P>
    <P>We have a motion from the Labour Party now looking for more holidays. That will not help the farmers to reduce their costs but rather will it increase the cost of production of every commodity.  The cow must be attended not alone four or five days a week but seven days a week and the pigs must be fed seven days a week. The Minister should be prepared to take into account the increased costs of production brought about as a result of the demand for increased <Col N="135" /> holidays, increased rates and increased rents and all the rest, and to ensure that at least the people living or trying to eke out an existence in rural Ireland will have their financial backing in carrying on the good work of producing hard-earned wealth from the farms of this country.  I look with confidence to the Minister to make a strong pronouncement, when replying to this debate, requesting increased output from the farmers and giving us an assurance for the future that, no matter what the increased output is, there will be an assured market at reasonable and remunerative prices.</P>
    <P>In the past couple of years the Irish farmers have not enjoyed the prosperity we would all wish them to enjoy. Their income has dropped considerably&mdash;it ranges from a drop of £17 million down to £12 million. Exports of cattle have considerably increased this year but that is because these exports were held up last year and there was a carryover.  I hope to see the day when fewer fat cattle will go out of this country on the hoof, when they will go out as tinned or processed meat instead.  There is an assured market if it is developed along the right lines.</P>
    <P>We should have a trade representative attached to every Irish Embassy and he should understand the requirements of Irish agriculture.  I have no doubt that sales of Irish agricultural produce could be made in most countries if the market were explored. Greater efforts should be made in this direction and we should have a Government representative keeping a keen eye on market developments, attached to every Irish Embassy.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the future may hold for us in regard to the Inner Six and the Outer Seven.  As things are shaping, it would be premature to discuss the prospects to-night.  Perhaps something good will come out of it; perhaps commonsense will prevail and that the Six and the Seven will unite in an European common market, but whether or not that happens, we must depend largely, in the first instance, on the English market.  We should make every effort from now on <Col N="136" /> to place our goods on the market to the best advantage and to gain and retain goodwill there for the Irish people.  We have many friends over there who would be only delighted to get fresh food from the farms of Ireland; they have not been able to get it in the past under an Irish label.  I sincerely hope that practical steps will now be taken to ensure that situation will not continue much longer, that instead Irish produce will be sold under an Irish label and that we as the Irish people will be proud of our produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second the motion.  At the present time I think everybody realises the importance of agriculture.  We cannot lay too much stress on this industry, as it is from agriculture we must get the necessary revenue to prevent our whole financial structure from collapsing.</P>
      <P>Every man, woman and child, whether living in city, town or country, depends for a standard of living on the Irish farmer's ability to export profitably.  Anyone who knows anything about the livestock trade at present knows that cattle prices were never as bad as they are now.  It is impossible to sell young cattle; as a matter of fact it is hard to sell any kind of cattle.  If the small farmer is to be saved there should be a long term policy and prices must be fixed for the produce he is selling.</P>
      <P>The marketing of all our agricultural produce should be completely reorganised. I know that is easier said than done but there should be some way of overcoming the difficulty.  This is purely an agricultural country and if agriculture is flourishing all sections of the community are prospering.  More money is in circulation; the shopkeepers, merchants and other sections benefit directly or indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to stress the importance of the dairying industry. Our cattle exports depend solely on the dairying industry and the number of cows maintained by dairy farmers. It is absolutely essential that the dairy farmer should be given every possible encouragement so as to ensure that line of production will be maintained and now, more so than ever, the clearing out of T.B. herds and the <Col N="137" /> extra cost of replacements surely justifies an increase in the price of milk.  If the dairy farmer goes out of production we shall have fewer cattle for export.  That would have a serious effect on our national income.</P>
    <P>I am sure there is something wrong with the system of grading pigs and the Government should have the whole system reviewed as pig prices are not very attractive at the moment.</P>
    <P>The farmer has to meet increased costs both in regard to his home and his way of living.  He has to meet increased rates and increased expenses in regard to his own family.  The day is gone when the farmer's son was prepared to stay at home and work for nothing.  In my opinion this was the main reason for the flight from the land.  It is a national loss that boys and girls should have to emigrate and give their services to another country.  Farmers in other countries are protected and I see no reason why the farmers here could not get similar protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is very appropriate at present.  Although it has been a fairly long time on the Order Paper, strangely enough it is just as appropriate as when it was put down, perhaps even more so.  I often wonder if the Government are alive to the situation in rural areas.  Were it not that I know the rules of the House would not allow it I should like to bring in something equally as important as the subject dealt with in this motion and that is the wholesale unemployment in rural areas.  However, I shall deal with the motion as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I shall not seek to do that because even if I succeeded I believe it would be a complete waste of time talking to the present Government to try to bring home to them what the position is.  Farming at present is in a very dangerous condition due to the complete failure of the Government to provide either a market or a fixed minimum price for Irish produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> There is now wholesale desolation, particularly in the case of small farms that were thrifty and thriving units a very short time ago.  I said here recently that the £12 valuation was a thing of the past because the income of such a holding under the management of this Government is insufficient to support a family.  As I told the House on that occasion, a holding of £12 valuation or even £20 valuation is only a hovel for a bachelor or a pensioner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very strange situation.  The farmers were asked to increase their production which they have done without any help from the Government.  What has been the result?  Not alone has there been a disastrous drop in prices but the very market which seemed to be <Col N="139" /> always there to absorb any agricultural surplus has vanished.  I often wonder whether it is the fixed policy of this Government to squeeze the smaller elements of the agricultural community out of their holdings and force them to emigrate.  That is what is happening, anyhow.</P>
      <P>To support my arguments, I shall quote certain figures.  In 1959, there were 166,000 less cattle exported than in 1958 and the drop in the value was £8,438,000.  I want to ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who has a very good knowledge of rural problems: what industries in this country could bear, in one year, such a deadly wallop as a loss of £8,438,000?  We could confine this motion to that aspect alone of the agricultural industry. I have not the figures for 1960 but I suppose the loss would be in the region of £10,000,000.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Agriculture will be here in time to reply to this motion.  I should like him to tell us what steps the Government are taking to find a market for the increased agricultural produce the farmers have produced at the request of the Government, or what steps they intend to take to recompense the farmers for the care they have taken and the capital they have put into this increased production.  The Government cannot be wholly blind to what is happening in the rural areas.  There are much more prominent and authoritative voices than mine deploring the abandonment of the backward areas.  I rise to add my voice, little weight as it will carry with the Government, to those other voices that are deploring this gradual crushing of the small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to be the settled policy of the Government, as far as these people are concerned whose fathers and grandfathers put up such a desperate struggle to own their land and their farms, to squeeze them out of their holdings and to suggest that the sooner they go to Birmingham, Coventry, Leeds and London, the better for all concerned and the sooner we have a <Col N="140" /> nation of big ranchers who will be able to carry on without any help&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I confine my speech to asking the Government to provide a market and a price, my speech could be made in two sentences.  I want to support my arguments with statistics from Government publications.  A serious situation is arising in regard to the balance of payments, particularly with Britain.  There is a very serious excess which ran to £78,200,000 in 1959-60 and which ran to £81,000,000 between December, 1958, and December, 1959.  We have the means of taking a big slice off that import excess or imbalance of trade with Britain.  The produce is here but we cannot send it across.  There are certain sections of our people who are over-buying and creating this excess of imports.  On the other hand, the farmers have been asked to increase production but cattle, sheep, pigs and other livestock and articles of food are left on their hands.  There is no market for these goods, nor is the slightest attempt being made to get a market for them.  I cannot see any future for the holdings up to £15 valuation or £20 valuation, if the policy of the Government is that the best and most economic form of agriculture can be conducted by a country of big farmers.</P>

      <P>Dairying and cattle are the two principal props of our economy.  Some areas go in for dairying and others for cattle.  I am trying to bring home to the Government that the drop in the number of cattle exported, to the tune of almost £8½ million last year, has been a very serious blow to the farmers but particularly to the small farmers.  Everybody knows the man with the 200 acres is better able to meet a wallop than the man with the 20 or 30 acres.  I am more concerned with the effect on the small farmers of the Government's failure to find a market for cattle.  I am trying to point out what is happening as a result of their failure to find a market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a scandal and a disgrace that this situation should exist under a native Government. It was bad enough to have that situation under a foreign Government. Some people on that side of the House would no doubt advocate taking out guns to remedy the situation. Whatever Minister replies, I should like him to explain what the Government propose to do about the serious drop in the exports of live cattle which I have mentioned, 166,000 less in 1959 than in 1958, and I suppose there will be the same number less again this year.  Even though there are supposed to be between 320,000 and 330,000 farmers, big and small, in the country, a blow of £8,000,000 per year along with the increased cost of living is more than they can survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not deal any further with the motion beyond saying that even though it has been some time on the Order Paper, it is still as appropriate as ever.  The Taoiseach told us tonight that the Government are bringing in a Bill to concede the terms of this motion which we are debating. If so, they are taking a step in the right direction, even though it is rather late and we have lost whole families in the meantime.  When the Bill appears, we shall, of course, have <Col N="142" /> more to say on it.  In the meantime, the wholesale emigration brought about by their failure to produce the market for the agricultural produce they begged farmers to produce when they first came into office three years ago is a desperate indictment of the Government.</P>

      <P>This motion, I believe, is a fairly good one but I do not accept the figures given by Deputy Wycherley or the statements he made.  If Deputy Wycherley will go to the trouble of visiting the Library and picking up a little book known as <i>Trade Statistics</i>, he will find in regard to all the noise he is making about selling cattle on the hoof that there are cattle which have to be sent out on the hoof. Surely he will admit that there are ordinary store cattle and breeding cattle, of which there are pretty considerable numbers, with which we are doing a pretty good trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw his attention to <i>Trade Statistics</i> for December, 1959.  He will find there that the total export of dead beef was of a value of £10,452,000.  That is a pretty hefty sum for dead beef.  Canned beef made £2,273,000, so that there was a sum of over £12½ million for both types of dead beef.  The mutton and lamb trade made £1½ million and there was £175,000 worth of pork. There was £1,255,000 worth of poultry; £5,400,000 worth of bacon and £389,000 worth of ham.  A total of well over £21,000,000 was made from dead animals from this country from across the water in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We turn to the position in the dairy industry and we find that dairy produce exports brought in £1,899,406. Chocolate crumb&mdash;despite the absolute silence of my dearly beloved friend, Deputy Blowick when he was a member of the inter-Party Government and when the British imposed a levy of £16 a ton on our chocolate crumb &mdash;made £5,030,000 last year and that was made from a pretty considerable quantity of milk from our dairy cattle. I can assure Deputy Wycherley that <Col N="143" /> with the work which the Minister for Industry and Commerce and our negotiating committee in Britain are doing for the abolition of that levy, that figure will probably be increased next year by, please God, another couple of million pounds.  Undoubtedly there is a good opening and a good market there for getting rid of large quantities of our surplus milk.</P>

It did not trouble him at all and he had no interest in it.  He had no interest in the beet growers of his neighbouring county Galway.  I am not going to speak about the interest shown in the beet growers of county Mayo because there are none there.  The Government did put up a factory at their doorstep for the purpose of giving them a decent market for their produce, but Deputy Blowick did not make the slightest attempt to protect that market.  We had Deputy Dillon's statement here three months ago that during the period that that levy was in operation, killing the export of our surplus milk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The motion reads</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in view of the serious position of the dairy and cattle industries Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the whole question of prices and marketing should be reviewed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick had to be ruled out of order nine or ten times.  I have no intention of being ruled out of order. I am dealing with a market of £5,030,699.  Last year, we sold in England some 2,000,000 gallons of milk. I think I am quite in order in dealing with the reason why there were not 10,000,000 or 7,000,000 or 8,000,000 gallons of milk sold in that market last year.  The reason was the levy placed on us through the negligence of the inter-Party Government in 1956.  Deputy Blowick was then a member of that Government and I suggest that despite the disorderly remarks a while ago, I am absolutely in order in dealing with that position on this motion.</P>
      <P>I should like to assure Deputy Wycherley and Deputy Finucane that the Government have taken up that condition of affairs, as they can find from the assurances given to me here by the Minister for Industry and Commerce during the past six months. That market is being actively pursued and we shall have a largely increased market for our surplus milk next year through chocolate crumb as soon as that iniquitous levy is removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is briefly the position of affairs. No Government can be held responsible <Col N="145" /> for the price we get for our produce in another country.  A Government can be held responsible for the price we get in our own country. They cannot be held responsible for the price we get in another country, provided they are not guilty of the negligence of which the inter-Party Government were guilty in respect of our export market for chocolate crumb and sugar.</P>
    <P>In Britain, bovine T.B. has been wiped out.  The condition of affairs here has very largely interfered with and crippled our market in cattle across the water.  It will continue to affect it until such time as we are in as clear a position in regard to bovine T.B. as Great Britain is.  That is a fair point of view.</P>
    <P>I admit immediately that in regard to the export of live cattle, the market has been bad and I am afraid it will continue to be bad for some time. I cannot see any great hope of improvement. Unfortunately, this debate is confined to the dairy and cattle industry.  In the dairy industry, considerable strides have been made and enormous sums of money have to be found by the Government for the eradication of bovine T.B.  Whether it is spent in the best possible manner or not is another matter that could be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenditure of some millions of pounds in that direction by the Government is hastening the day when we shall again be in a position to have a clear entry of our cattle into Britain without that bar against them. We must await that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable advances are being <Col N="146" /> made in every line of agriculture and in better marketing of our goods.  I do not wish to go into that here, but Deputy Wycherley and Deputy O'Sullivan were in Mallow close on a month ago and saw another big factory going up there which will help the farmers very considerably. Undoubtedly a very considerable export trade will be developed.  The extensive type of farming that it will call for will give a great opportunity to the smallholder.  The same thing has happened in Deputy Wycherley's constituency.  I do not know whether he has much interest in it or not.  It has happened there during the past 12 months and advances have been made on practically the same lines.  I do not see any reason for the alarm that has been shown here.  Perhaps our marketing conditions can be improved.</P>
    <P>There is one thing militating against us that the Government should take in hand.  I refer to freight and transport costs.  There have been general complaints about these.  Transport costs, especially cross-channel freight rates, will militate very seriously against our sales in the British market. I suggest that the Government should have an investigation into charges from Continental countries to Britain as compared with cross-channel charges.  They will get an eye-opener and will find some means of dealing with the British shipping companies engaged in the cross-channel trade and that spend only about five shillings in this country.  I had occasion to take up with these people the question of leaving some of their money here, even for the repair of ships.  I got the deaf ear.  If the Government examine the question of freight rates, they will find that the rate from Denmark to Britain is about 50 per cent. of the rate from Cork to Liverpool.  They will find that and having found that, they can take steps to deal with the matter in a far better way.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this motion is not broad enough to give us an opportunity of dealing with the wider range of agricultural policy and agricultural conditions, but I now live in the hope that Deputy Blowick will put down <Col N="147" /> a motion that will cover a wider range and thus give us an opportunity of dealing with the matter in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the motion was moved this evening, the Taoiseach informed the House that the Government proposed, within the next week, to bring in a Bill to deal with milk marketing and that, consequently, it might be well if the Deputies moving the motion saw fit to defer it in consequence. He must not have given enough attention to the fact that this motion also deals with conditions in the cattle industry and that in the allied categories included in the motion anything that may be proposed to be done next week would not cover what is, in fact, mentioned in the terms of the motion.</P>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I can say we support this motion.  In fact we must say that it is phrased in a very mild fashion.  It merely asks the Government that in view of the serious position of the dairy and cattle industries Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the whole question of prices and marketing should be reviewed.</P>
      <P>There is nothing extremely demanding in the terms of the motion.  It is one that the Government would do well to accept because there is no exaggeration in it.  There is no exaggeration in that motion when it describes the position of the dairying and cattle industries as serious.  Anybody familiar with conditions in the rural parts today are quite aware of the serious position in which very many people dependent on those industries for their living are at this moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years have passed since the Government announced they were about to do something in regard to the marketing of our agricultural produce. It is well to recall that at the time the Government assumed office they declared they were somewhat embarrassed by the surpluses in agricultural produce left behind by the previous Government, so that all this Government had to do to ensure that the level of production would continue or, in fact, that the rate of production would <Col N="148" /> be increased, was to find the markets. They guaranteed the farmers that there would be no loss in their income; that they need not worry and that if they worked harder and produced more prices would not drastically fall. Instead of that occurring, and despite the fact that this £250,000 was presented to the people with a flourish of trumpets as something which it was the intention of the Government to spend without delay in the discovery and the development of these new markets, we find from the information we could receive by tabling Parliamentary questions that only a very negligible amount of that money was spent, even though it was intimated at that time that it was merely an instalment of what was to be spent towards this very laudable purpose.</P>
    <P>There is no indication there that the Government were serious in their flamboyant statements at the time relating to the benefits that would acrue from the voting of these moneys. If the Government had to come to the House with a supplementary estimate to get more money, because they found this was not sufficient, they would get the utmost cooperation from all parts of the House.  Far from that occurring, we find the demand was not enough to absorb the moneys voted such a long time ago.  Consequently, we may well allege that if marketing conditions are not as good today as they should be, there has been considerable negligence.  We allege, and allege forcibly because we believe what we say, that much time was wasted and great opportunities lost because we can recall that the attention of this House was diverted for a year and a half to a subject demanding the attention of the country&mdash;the Government's aim and object of changing the electoral system.</P>
    <P>While we were engaged in that pursuit, our competitors on the British market were engaged in pinching from us some of the markets we enjoyed in that country for many, many years. We find that when an Irish deputation went eventually to Britain they did not secure what was intimated by them before they left this country as being a probable result of their efforts in <Col N="149" /> London on that occasion.  They came back very much deflated and very much different from the people who had with such confidence proclaimed that they were about to secure for the basic producers of this country something of great value.  Therefore, we say that opportunities&mdash;golden opportunities&mdash;were lost during those wasted years.</P>
    <P>We would not be in this position now if the Government had applied themselves at that time to what was their very first duty&mdash;to honour the guarantee to those who had accepted the call of the Government to work hard and produce more.  But having done so, their profits were very much reduced because of the loss in price due to the incapacity of those directing Government policy to secure for them the markets which would absorb the outflow from that increased production.</P>
    <P>In recent years there have been formidable changes in the taste of food consumers in Britain&mdash;changes to which it would be well we were alive and quick enough to avail of. We realise that in very many towns in Britain today the butcher's shop, as we know it in this country, is a thing of the past.  There is now a great chance for us to avail of the opportunities presented there to supply those markets with a type of packaged meat which they now want to buy in their shops.  There is an opportunity for development in the matter of producing our prime beef such as did not exist in the past but it is necessary that we should, without delay, apply ourselves to a proper examination of what could be done in that respect.</P>
    <P>I was interested in and extremely amused by the strictures Deputy Corry administered to Deputy Wycherley because Deputy Wycherley had ignored the importance of our store cattle exports to Britain.  It is always said that there is nothing to beat the new convert.  When one hears this emanating from the benches opposite, when one looks back on their history in glorying at the death of the British market, saying it was gone and gone for ever and that it took a hundred years to build but would take only <Col N="150" /> ten days to destroy, one can only say: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, the day has come when there is unanimity in the House in relation to the importance of that market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry also spoke on the question of the importance of our having sufficient and suitable transport to carry our goods to Britain.  He fails to recall that a Minister&mdash;he is still a Minister&mdash;at one time said that it would be well for this country if all their ships were at the bottom of the sea.  At any rate, we have progressed from that.  He advanced an idea with which we cannot disagree, that anything that can be done should be done to ensure that shipping facilities equal to those available to our competitors and competitive rates will be available to our exporters, both industrial and agricultural.  Those are points on which there appears to be no disagreement.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Corry said, that the Government cannot fix the prices obtainable for goods which we export to foreign markets, but there are other aspects of the management of agriculture on which the Government could take effective action, but on which, quite often, through neglect and inattention, matters arise which have a very detrimental effect on our costs of production.  It should be the duty of the Government to protect industry against those rising costs, all of which, I am afraid, have a very detrimental effect, and squeeze us out of competition, because that competition is so keen on many of the foreign markets.</P>
    <P>Due to the general policy of the Government, we find that the agricultural community over the past four years have suffered considerable increases in their costs of production. Like other members of the community, the farmers are very seriously affected, and they have had to face vast difficulties, by reason of the drastic increases in the cost of living.  They find, too, that they have to pay more for the necessaries of life and, at the same time, they have had to find money for increased wages and salaries in order to make it possible for other sections of the community to meet the impact <Col N="151" /> of the increased cost of living.  We find, from Government statistics, that, far from receiving an increased income, they have had to meet the hardships imposed by the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>In fact, the people mentioned in this motion have suffered a considerable reduction in their incomes and, at the same time, were also faced with what is probably the greatest problem since the economic war with which Irish farmers have had to contend, the elimination of bovine tuberculosis.  It is only now, and from now on, that we shall realise that three years were unfortunately wasted before that scheme was started.  It is now being forcibly brought home to our people the colossal problem that imposes on the country.  Its impact should be understood by those who are not engaged in farming and particularly by those who are not engaged in the dairying industry because of the action necessary if we are to eliminate that disease, having regard to the loss of income and the expenditure involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the fact that the agricultural community had been called upon to bear the additional expenditure involved in the elimination of bovine tuberculosis and had also to bear the increased costs imposed by other events in recent years.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure that anything that could possibly add to the cost of production in that industry be mitigated to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry dealt with the problem of freight and transport and the necessity for ensuring that we could transport our agricultural goods to other countries at the lowest possible rates.  Of course, incidental to that is the cost of transporting our agricultural goods from the point of production to the ports from which they are despatched.  The Minister should be alive to the fact that if the intention of one of his colleagues is carried to fruition, at the fairs in Bandon, the cattle markets in Clonakilty, Skibbereen, <Col N="152" /> and Bantry, there will be an additional charge of £1 per head on the price of the beasts presented for sale&mdash;if his colleague continues with his intention of wiping out the rail system in that area.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corry when he said that the question of transport and freight charges has an important bearing on the incomes of our Irish farmers. The increased costs of production on the agricultural community in south and west Cork make it very difficult for them to produce beasts at prices at which we would wish to see them produced in order that they could make more profit when presented for sale on the markets of various countries.</P>
    <P>It is also well to record that, in the past four years, there has been a great increase in the rates demand upon the agricultural community.  That is another charge which has to be met by increased profits by farmers who are suffering a serious lowering of their standard of living and, so far as Cork county is concerned, that situation will be aggravated by 10 per cent. in the next year or two.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the people in those areas should be protected from such additional imposts.  They have a most serious effect at the moment on conditions in cattle and dairying areas, in view of the fact that store cattle today are producing such little profit for the people who rear them.  That has a big bearing on the dairying industry, because it means the farmers will require more for their milk if they get less for their stores and young cattle.  It is true that people who bought stores and held them for a considerable time found, unfortunately, that they had to dispose of them in many cases for less than they paid for them.  This instability in the cattle industry is a very disturbing factor, and one to which the Government, in the development of the markets in which we hope they are engaged, should give due attention.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the difficulties encountered in relation to the sale of milk products and have asserted that butter seemed to be the most uneconomic outlet for milk delivered <Col N="153" /> to creameries.  It is true that for a time there was a much better market for milk that was made into Irish creamery butter, but, unfortunately, due to the very steep increase in the price of butter it was made impossible for many of our people to consume it in the quantities in which they consumed it in the past.  We are now forced to find other markets for milk which formerly we were able to dispose of to our people in the form of good creamery butter.</P>
    <P>The development of the manufacture of cheese should commend itself to the Minister.  With the increased standard of living, and so on, in the neighbouring island, it might be expected that there would be a diminution in the market for cheese.  Far from that occurring, there is a growing market in Britain for cheese.  It would be well to ensure that everything possible is done to encourage the establishment of more factories in this country to produce cheese for export.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that, as a people, we do not use more cheese.  Only on rare occasions is cheese presented as an item on the hotel menu.  It would be well if its consumption were encouraged and if the Minister for Agriculture were more active in promoting an increased market in this country not alone for fresh milk but for other products such as cheese manufactured from milk delivered at creameries. That also would help the marketing of this commodity.</P>
    <P>Continuity of supply does not present the problem it did over a decade ago.  Because of the steps taken to encourage the growth of earlier and later grass, the increased supplies of milk are attributable more to the extension of the grass season than to any other factor.  Pending the solution of marketing problems, it would be well if the Minister discouraged the extension of creameries to other parts of the country until such time as a solution is found to the problem affecting the creamery industry in the Munster area.</P>
    <P>The availability of credit to the agricultural community is not now a problem.  It appears possible to secure <Col N="154" /> credit but there is an obligation on the Government to ensure that the people who obtain such credit are put in a position to pay the interest and capital involved.  The situation would be far worse than formerly if the freeing of credit resulted in embarrassment for people who felt they could utilise credit to their benefit and that of the community.</P>
    <P>A point worth noting is that of all the industries under the various agricultural heads in this country the activity which gives the most employment today is dairying and animal husbandry.  The day is gone when it was felt this industry called for the least amount of labour.  Today it is far ahead of wheat-growing or any other agricultural pursuit in the numbers engaged all the year round.  It is never seasonal.  It demands the employment of very considerable numbers of men and women to look after animals which must be cared for on Christmas Day in the same way as in mid-Summer.  Consequently, any reversal in the conditions of people engaged in that industry would merely accentuate the present drift from the land.  It is necessary that that be taken into account in determining that the utmost priority be given to securing markets for the sale of the produce mentioned in this motion.</P>
    <P>A new development in the past few years has made it more difficult for farmers' sons who work on their parent's farm to acquire land.  It is something the Government and future Governments must watch carefully. They must preserve for the families of farmers whatever land comes on the market.</P>

      <P>I have made the point.  It is desirable, in that situation, that nothing should happen to cause a reduction in the income of these people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry made some remarks with which we are in agreement and other remarks about which we cannot be enthusiastic.  He tells us that certain omissions of the previous Government had not been rectified after being actively pursued by the present Government for a period of four years. I do not know what he means by actively pursuing something, if there is nothing to be seen for the active pursuit after four years.  We must infer that, whatever the omission, it cannot be easy to rectify.  We shall wait, I hope not too long, to see the outcome of the active pursuit.</P>
      <P>The House could well accept this motion which asks the Government to recognise the serious position in the dairy and cattle industries.  It also requires them to give full and immediate attention to the serious plight of the people concerned and to take action to ensure something is done in the near future to save them and lift them out of the danger in which they find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am largely in agreement with Deputy Corry's suggestion as to how this motion should be received.  It has been tabled for many months and comes forward at an opportune time. Today, the Taoiseach announced that legislation will be introduced shortly to deal with the question of marketing.  The Opposition speakers have more or less charged the Government with not fulfilling their <Col N="156" /> duty in that connection and allege that the Government have taken no effective action up to now, but I am quite sure it cannot be suggested that the tabling of this motion has in any way influenced the Government in arriving at the decision they have made in regard to the legislative proposals that are to come before the House shortly.</P>
      <P>It must be obvious to everybody that the Fianna Fáil Party, before taking office, had considered that marketing reorganisation was essential. The Party were in power only a month or two before the introduction of the 1957 Budget but in that Budget, the Minister for Finance announced he was allocating £250,000 for the purpose of improving the marketing of agricultural produce, covering all species of agricultural produce marketed under Government auspices. The Government at that time acted without any great public demand being made for such a step and that step was followed up very effectively some six or seven months later when the late Senator Moylan, then Minister for Agriculture, appointed an advisory committee, with very comprehensive terms of reference, to deal with this problem in December, 1957.</P>
      <P>I believe it has been accepted in all quarters of the agricultural industry, particularly in the dairying end, that it could do with a major overhaul.  In other agricultural countries, such an overhaul has been attempted, with some success in most of them, and the fact that it has not been attempted up to now in this country is, in my opinion, something for which no Government could be held responsible. The people engaged in the agricultural industry are very independent and do not like being dictated to by whatever Government are in power, as regards the manner in which they shall do their job.  The same thing applies to industry in general.  It is not easy to get people to take kindly to Government initiative instructing them how to carry on their business and I can well appreciate why any Government should be somewhat reluctant to go into such a wide field without the necessity of doing so being absolutely apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> At all events, the Government did take that action.  The committee which was established proceeded to tackle its work with all possible haste, and the White Paper which the Minister issued in December, 1959, entitled <i>The Export Marketing of Irish Agricultural Produce</i> demonstrated that the committee did make a most exhaustive inquiry and produced a pretty comprehensive report in the shortest possible time.  Since then, the Minister has been engaged in preparing his legislative proposals founded on the committee's report to establish the necessary marketing organisations.</P>
    <P>However, the fact that organisations or boards of this character are to be established is not in itself the complete solution of the problem.  Government aid to enable agricultural produce to be marketed at economic prices is a good stimulant, but, to have a healthy agricultural trend, it is desirable, as far as is possible, that Government aids, particularly those provided through taxation, should be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals will be coming before the House shortly and for that reason I am sure most Deputies are not anxious to go into too detailed a discussion on the motion now before the House.  The motion sets out that in view of the serious position of the dairying and cattle industry, Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the whole question of prices and marketing should be reviewed.  Now, at the time the motion was tabled some people may have held the view that a serious position existed in the dairy and cattle industry, and Opposition speakers, with great difficulty, have tried to make the case that at present the price of cattle is so depressed that in some instances store cattle are being sold at less than what they cost their owners a year or a year and a half ago.</P>
    <P>I am not a farmer but I keep store cattle for eight or nine months of the year and that has not been my experience, or the experience of a number of other people with whom I am acquainted and who are engaged in that business.  In regard to cattle the present difficulty appears to be that <Col N="158" /> of fodder and, while prices could be more satisfactory, it is not true to say that people who own store cattle have to sell them at a loss, as stated by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Opposition speakers also dealt with the levy imposed on butter a couple of years ago, but I think the Minister gave a very good reason why the levy had to be imposed at that time, and he also gave an undertaking that if the export difficulties which gave rise to its introduction were solved, then the levy would be withdrawn.  Happily, the difficulties ended and I am glad to say that the Minister fulfilled his promise without undue delay and, as far as I know, at present, butter is not subject to that levy and is unlikely to be subjected to it in the foreseeable future.  I do not want to go into too much detail in this regard just now as the Minister's new legislative proposals dealing with this very important matter will be coming before the House very shortly.</P>

      <P>I hope these proposals will have the serious consideration of the House, and that what the Minister is attempting to do will not be misrepresented.  The reorganisation expected is absolutely necessary, and it is important that it should be implemented in the shortest possible time. The Minister should not delay, therefore, and should select a board representative of all those competent to deal with marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions have come from all sides in regard to the steps we should <Col N="159" /> take to stimulate our exports abroad. Such suggestions have been made for many years and have been examined, I am sure, by Ministers both of this and previous Governments.  To my mind, however, the most important factor is that we have no effective selling agencies abroad.  I have discussed this with persons conversant with these markets and I have been told, time and again, that there is not much point in having active representatives abroad, if we are not in a position to keep up continuity of supply.  That has been a defect and we shall have to remedy it if we are to compete with similar organisations in other countries. I hope that matter will be dealt with by whatever body is appointed to explore markets for our agricultural produce.  There is little more I can say at this stage, but I am glad to have had this opportunity of making those few points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker said he had not very much more to say.  In my opinion, he had nothing at all to say.  He told us about certain boards and commissions.  Speaking as a tenant farmer, I say: &ldquo;To hell with those boards and commissions.&rdquo;  Too much has been spent in that way; and if the Government think our problems can be solved by handing them over to such boards and commissions, I am afraid they are too late.</P>
      <P>Presumably Deputy Corry was speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil&mdash; at least at by-elections he says he is&mdash; and listening to him I was reminded of an old rhyme I used to hear when going to school:</P>
      <P>The devil when sick</P>
      <P>The devil a saint would be.</P>
      <P>The devil when well</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Corry was on this side of the House, everything in agriculture was wrong, no matter how right it was; but when Deputy Corry is on that side of the House, everything is right, no matter how wrong it is. Deputy Corry's heart bled for the small farmer and the tenant farmer, but I remember when he described him here as the &ldquo;hen rooster&rdquo; who did not <Col N="160" /> deserve any consideration.  I remember the late Deputy Beegan standing up on behalf of Fianna Fáil and dissociating himself completely from the statements of Deputy Corry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned chiefly with that portion of the motion which refers to the cattle trade.  The Minister heard the last speaker, a Kerryman, say he did not think the cattle trade was in such a bad position. I am sure the Minister is not so much up in the air&mdash;he never was indeed&mdash; and that he realises the position as far as the tenant farmers of Cavan are concerned, as well as those of Galway, Kerry, Donegal, Cork, Mayo and portion of Roscommon.  I am sure he realises that they find it impossible to sell the few cattle they have at the moment.</P>
      <P>I know the position of the tenant farmer who has a cow or two.  Milk production is not in his line.  He bought a calf or two extra last year. He paid up to £24 or £25 and in some cases £28.  He reared that calf, hoping that at this time of the year he would have him for sale.  The position today is that he cannot sell that beast at all, and the calf that cost him from £24 to £26 this time last year is not worth that money today.  Nevertheless, that tenant farmer has to meet higher rates and the higher cost of living, and the position is that these people are leaving at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are always told that something is coming tomorrow or the day after. As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, something is always coming but nothing ever arrives.  We are told that something will be done to help the milk producer, and I suppose he requires assistance very badly, but his plight is no worse than that of the tenant farmer who produces a few cattle and sheep.  What an extraordinary change when we hear Deputy Corry talking about markets in England!  We also heard from Deputy Moloney about our cattle trade, about what is to be done&mdash;something to come.  Do we not remember the time <Col N="161" /> when we were told that it was a good job for us that that market was gone? That was preached once by Fianna Fáil.  That market is nearly gone now. Some days ago, the Taoiseach in reply to a question here said that things were not bad at all.  I am referring to this because I believe that the tenant farmers who produce a few cattle, who produce milk for the creameries, are the foundation of the State and the position in which they are today is reflected in every other industry in the country.  They are the people that make the new money in this country and once they go down, as has happened now, it is reflected in the position of every other section of the community.</P>
    <P>As I have explained, their position was never worse.  If the Minister went around the country, he would soon know that the position is not as Deputy Moloney or Deputy Corry represented it.  I believe that the Minister, as a good farmer, knows the position.  I would ask him to throw his mind back to the time when he was on this side of the House and Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture. Deputy Dillon needs no bouquets from me, nor will he get them, but he took this matter in hands, went across to England as Minister and brought back the 1948 Agreement which every tenant farmer in Ireland thinks was the best thing ever done by a Minister for Agriculture for this country.</P>
    <P>There was a time when that Agreement was about to be renewed during the term of office of the present Government but, for a year and a half, when the Government should have been concerned with that Agreement they were trying to change the system of election so that they would always be in power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would ask the Minister to consider this motion seriously, knowing that the two Deputies who have tabled it are sincere in putting it down.  It has been quite a long time on the Order Paper but it is even more necessary now than when it was first put down.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>My first reason for speaking is to pay a tribute to the farmers and particularly to the small farmers, especially the small dairy farmers with whom I am personally more concerned in my own area.  It is a remarkable tribute to their tenacity that they have managed to survive the vicissitudes of various Governments over the past 40 years.  I do not want to labour the political side of this motion, to which several references have been made tonight, but it is an historic fact that over the past 30 <Col N="163" /> years, the wheel has turned complete circle and instead of celebrating the fact that the British market is no longer necessary or desirable, we had the Taoiseach himself going to England a few months ago to persuade the British Government that in the interests of the economies of both countries, a practical step would be to integrate these economies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarkable fact is that when we should have organised and stabilised our agricultural industry, we lost our opportunity to do so. In the thirties, the opportunity was there and we did not take it.  During the war years the opportunity was there for fancy prices because Britain was enmeshed in a world war and paid any prices we asked.  We built up the huge external assets that we are still feeding on today.  Now that the war is over and circumstances have completely changed, we are facing a very difficult position as regards our agricultural exports not only to England but also to European and other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very badly equipped to tackle the problems facing us with the development of the trade groups in Europe.  It is well known that the British market is not now nearly as remunerative as it was for years back, and, indeed, in the next 2 to 10 years our farmers will have to face very difficult and competitive conditions for the produce they have been sending to England over the years.  With the ten per cent. tariff going off bacon imports into Britain, our farmers and our bacon factories will have to meet severe and highly-organised competition from the long-established and efficient Danish bacon industry.  There does not seem to be at present any compensating market anywhere else in the world.  That emphasises the fact that the years that have been wasted are now coming home to roost and as a result we are in the really weak position in which we find ourselves today. That is largely due to the fact that we did not take advantage in past years of <Col N="164" /> advantageous markets in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>References have been made to marketing. I can recall that a few months after I came into this House, the Minister for Agriculture spoke about £250,000 that was to be made available as a matter of urgency for the study of marketing conditions.  I think I am correct in saying that up to date only a few thousand of that £250,000 has been spent for the purpose for which it was intended.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Congo Situation: Appointment of Representative.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In July the Dáil adopted a motion to send troops to the Congo as part of the United Nations forces, and we supported that motion. However, in the course of the debate we suggested that it was of the greatest importance, due to the extremely complicated situation in the Congo, that a liaison officer, political officer, or some person other than military personnel should be sent out there in order to ensure that we would know whether our troops were being used to the best possible advantage and for the most desirable purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach at that time refused to accept that suggestion put forward by Deputy Corish and supported by myself and Deputy McQuillan.  We sent troops out, in the extremely confused situation, at the request of the Congolese Government which was led by Mr. Lumumba and we accepted that responsibility.  We considered the matter at that time under the threat of a civil war, it could be said, and certainly under the threat of secession by Mr. Tshombe in the province of Katanga.  It was an extremely important consideration because it meant that the greatest and the richest part of the Congo was controlled by Belgian financial interests under the premiership of Mr. Tshombe.  The position of Katanga is that while it contains only about 12% of the total population of the Congo it produces 60% of the total wealth.  Consequently <Col N="165" /> it was most important that our troops should not be permitted to be used in any way to jeopardise this wealth for the whole of the Congolese people.</P>
    <P>At that time Mr. Tshombe insisted that he wanted to secede from the Congo, to establish a partitioned State, to divide the Congo as our own country was divided 40 years ago, and to take away this industrial potential from the whole of the Congo. To any of us who have even longrange contact with this problem of Partition in our own country, the partitioning of any country is equally repugnant.  We felt that it would be a disastrous thing for the Congo were Mr. Tshombe to proceed with his suggestion for the partitioning of the Congo.  It was suggested that the troops being sent there would be engaged merely on police work.  The Taoiseach did not define what the police work was.  I think he said he was not quite sure, which was reasonable enough in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>This was a very unusual and unique situation, but he appears to me to have grossly under-estimated the appalling difficulties which have been faced by our troops since they left here.  There is the fact that this is a largely French-speaking area and that very few of our troops spoke French. There was also the many great conflicting interests, and the fact that many of the people are illiterate and uneducated, knowing nothing about the United Nations.  The fact that our troops are white people and looked like the Belgians also created many problems.</P>
    <P>There was also the inevitability which we mentioned in the debate that the colonial interests, the Belgians particularly, would come together in the Security Council of the United Nations with other great ex-colonial countries such as Britain and to a certain extent, as a dollar-imperialist country, the United States, and attempt to change the political situation in the Congo and restore if possible the position of the Belgian financial interests there.  When we speak about the financial interests of the Congo we <Col N="166" /> are mainly concerned with Katanga. That is the situation which we foreshadowed and it seems to me that every one of those rather depressing forecasts are in process of being fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has taken the line that we have certain obligations to the United Nations to send out troops to act as a police force.  We believed that the function of this force was to restore the total property of the Congo to the Congolese people, to take it from the Belgians and give it back to its rightful owners.  The Taoiseach's attitude is that, our function being purely police action directed and dictated by the United Nations, we must abrogate our rights, divest ourselves of our sovereignty over these troops, hand them over to the United Nations Commander in the Congo and leave them to their best devices and to any consequences that might befall them.</P>
    <P>We greatly deprecate this attitude on the part of the Taoiseach.  There are essentially serious and complicated political difficulties involved in the solution of this problem, and the soldiers out there, however talented and courageous they may be, are completely incapable of keeping in touch with the intricacies of Congolese politics.  Therefore it is vital that the Taoiseach should send out a representative to help them in deciding for whom we are fighting and whose property we are defending, and in what way we are protecting the interests of the Congolese people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says he will not take any part in the day-to-day or week-to-week political decisions in the Congo on behalf of our troops.  He has stated, however, that we have a right to protest against decisions we do not like and to withdraw our troops if they are put to any tasks of which we disapprove.  I think he made that concession in the course of the debate.  He was asked by somebody: &ldquo;May we withdraw our troops if we wish?&rdquo; and he said: &ldquo;Of course we may, at any time.&rdquo;  I hope I am not misquoting him but I assume that is what he said.</P>
    <P>There are, in any event, precedents <Col N="167" /> for protests being made.  On the question of the threat to shoot Mr. Lumumba, the Premier, the new Arab Republic protested as did also the Ceylon Government and Mr. Nkrumah of Ghana.  We have the right to protest and the Taoiseach has no right to divest himself of that authority when it comes to guarding our very difficult position in the Congo. The Taoiseach has the right to protest at decisions of which he does not approve and I suggest there has been a decision taken in the Congo against which we should have protested.</P>
    <P>I asked the Taoiseach by Parliamentary Question whether he had heard of the threat to shoot the Premier of the Congo, Mr. Lumumba. I do not know anything about matters in the Congo beyond what I read in the newspapers.  I am not expertly advised but I do know the Premier of the Congo invited the United Nations to go into the Congo.  As a result of a directive given by Mr. Hammarskjoeld of the United Nations, this man who had invited the United Nations forces into the Congo was threatened with shooting if he did not leave the national radio station.</P>
    <P>I do not know anything about the merits of Mr. Lumumba.  All I know is that he was elected by the black people of the Congo to represent them. As far as I can see, he is another Nyeri, Nboyo, Nkrumah, Nehru or Dr. Banda.  As far as we can gather, that is how he will turn out, if he survives.  Consequently, it was very wrong to allow this man to be threatened with shooting.  It would have been quite appalling if that order had been given to an Irish soldier and if Mr. Lumumba had lost his head&mdash; he did not do so&mdash;and had been shot by one of our soldiers.  It seems to me to have been a most unwise decision to take on the part of whoever took it. On that occasion, we should have protested against that decision and made it quite clear that our soldiers would not be prepared, and could not be and should not be asked, to shoot the elected Premier&mdash;elected and ratified in his election at a subsequent meeting of their Parliament and ratified as Premier.  That is one point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> Secondly, and I suppose I should have put this point as the more important one, when Mr. Tshombe said he was going to secede and when there was an elected Government and when Mr. Lumumba was Premier, it was up to the United Nations to send armed forces into the Katanga Province and tell Mr. Tshombe that he could not secede, that there was an elected Government and an elected Premier and that he had no right to secede from the Congo.  He should have been told that we would not stand over this decision of an individual to partition the country.  This was an occasion on which we of all peoples in the world should have urged that the United Nations should have sent troops to Katanga in order to see that this man was not allowed to carry out his threat to secede and put himself in the position in which he now is, where he has a force organised which can move in or attack or defy any central Government which may be elected in the Congo.  That was another great failure on the part of the United Nations forces against which we should have protested.  We should not have been party to this further political decision taken by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The United Nations has stood by and watched the Belgian Government supplying unlimited qantities of military stores to the Katanga forces, to the Tshombe Government.  It was an outrageous thing to allow in the first place in a society in which there is incipient civil war.  It was outrageous in that respect, but equally it seems to me particularly vindictive in light of the fact that we refused the elected Premier who was vested with the responsibility of keeping law and order &mdash;and the Taoiseach knows all about that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy allow me?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that if we had a political representative in the Congo, we would be informed of these facts.  I want to draw attention to the fact that the Taoiseach said he did not know that the Premier of the Congo had been threatened with shooting. I say that if we had a political representative there, he would have known.  If he listened to the B.B.C. or Radio Éireann, or read the <i>Irish Press</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i> or the <i>Irish Times</i>, he would also have known that Mr. Lumumba was threatened with shooting by a young English soldier and the fact that he did not seems greatly to increase the necessity for having some political adviser in the Congo who would tell him of these acts which are being carried out in our name in the Congo.</P>
      <P>We now have the situation in the Congo in which the Premier is deposed&mdash;Mr. Lumumba is apparently no longer Premier&mdash;where we have Mr. Tshombe, who defied the United Nations in the first place, with the consent and approval of the military forces and power of Belgium, in an unassailable position of strength; and we have Mr. Kasavubu, who is titular head of the Congo, now sitting in the United Nations; and we have Mr. Mobuto who is military dictator and who in fact is in complete control of the Congo.  Democracy has been suspended and we have been party to every one of these acts.  The position, putting it in terms of 1922, is that we are backing Craigavon; we are defending Carson.  We are ensuring that the partitioning of the Congo will go through.  We are insisting on the federalisation of the Congo, all because of the Taoiseach's failure to establish any contact with our forces and to make any protest in this step by step dismemberment of the Congo as a result of the decisions of Kasavubu, Mobuto and Tshombe, and of course the most important of all, the Belgian-American interests in the United Nations&mdash;as forecast by us in the earlier debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> Last night, there was a discussion at which the Afro-Asian Conciliation Commission&mdash;a perfectly reasonable and perfectly logical body&mdash;who would know the position in these countries better than we could, offered to send a 15-member commission to try to make peace between the conflicting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that our troops are now in the Congo. They are carrying out a policy in the Congo, the United Nations Congo policy, against which we voted last night.  Our delegation in the United Nations, dictated to by the Government, by the Taoiseach, is carrying out one policy and our soldiers in the Congo are risking their lives to carry out a policy with which the Government is no longer in agreement.  That is my point.  This is all due to the fact that the Taoiseach is no longer in contact.  He takes the view that we have no right to tell our troops in the Congo that we no longer agree with the activities of the United Nations in the Congo because he says we are not allowed to talk to our troops once we send them to the Congo.  Of all the absurd suggestions that could be made by a Premier of any sovereign State surely that is the most outrageous. The Taoiseach told me today, in reply to a question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We get our information concerning events and developments in the Congo through the United Nations Advisory Committee and any views we have&mdash;and we have occasionally views to express&mdash;regarding the course of events there and the manner in which the United Nations should try to direct the course of events, are expressed through that Committee.</P>
      <P>It is preposterous to think that we could in any way effectively influence events in the Congo by a personal representative in one part of it and it is, I think, completely contrary to the whole conception of an international force to preserve peace there that we should attempt it.  The Secretary General of the United Nations has already had occasion to draw the attention of all the Governments who have units in the United Nations force there that complications and difficulties have been created by reason of the fact that in some instances units of the United Nations force in the Congo have consulted with representatives on the spot before executing instructions and orders given by the United Nations Command.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I believe, completely untrue to say that the United Nations has departed one iota from the original decision which led to the sending of that force into the Congo.  There is no ground for the suggestion, no tittle <Col N="173" /> of evidence to support the contention, that the United Nations is supporting or facilitating the secession of the Katanga province or any other part of the Congo State.  The decision of the Security Council which led to the formation of the force was aimed at assisting the central Government of the Congo in the restoration and maintenance of law and order throughout the territory of the Republic of the Congo.  As Deputies who read the newspapers are well aware, the United Nations has not accepted Mr. Tshombe's claim to secede and has, indeed, sent troops into the Katanga province.</P>

      <P>The sole purpose of the United Nations force in the Congo is to preserve peace there until the people of the Congo, who were pushed without adequate preparation into independence, who found themselves carrying the responsibilities of independence without being organised for it, are able themselves to take over the task of running their country and preserving order within it.  That is the motive, the proclaimed motive, of every one of the 18 Governments that sent contingents to that force.  It is certainly ours.</P>
      <P>This operation was embarked upon, as everybody knows, with no intention whatever of interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo.  It is inevitable, I suppose, in a situation where internal government has collapsed, that decisions will be forced upon the United Nations representatives on the spot which will be questioned or challenged, and the wisdom of which may be in fact doubtful, but the aim of the whole operation is to create in the Congo a stable political system controlled by the Congolese people which will be able to relieve the United Nations of the responsibility it has undertaken there.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne obviously misunderstands or desires to misrepresent what happened at the United Nations in the past two days. It is true that we voted to postpone a decision on the seating of any Congolese representative in the United Nations until a conciliation commission which the United Nations proposed to send to the Congo had reported and until action on its report had shown the possibility of the creation of a representative and accepted Congolese authority.  When that motion to postpone action was defeated, as it was, in the United <Col N="175" /> Nations Assembly, we abstained from voting upon the subsequent motion to seat President Kasavubu.  It was not that we do not recognise President Kasavubu as the head of State.  It meant that we were adhering to our decision that it was unwise to take that decision until this commission had reported, if in fact the commission now goes to the Congo at all.</P>
      <P>There was nothing illogical in our step.  Indeed it is remarkable that Sweden and Canada, the only two non-African or Asian countries that have contingents in the Congo, took the same line as we did and that of all the 18 countries with contingents in the Congo only one voted positively for that motion.  There can be, therefore, no suggestion that we are acting in this matter in any way different from the line adopted by practically all the other countries who are committed in this operation to the same extent as we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have only this further to say if I will be allowed time to say it: Our motive in acceding to the United Nations request is above all possible <Col N="176" /> suspicion as to ulterior aims.  It was inspired by the fundamental precepts of our Christian Faith as well as by our obligations to the United Nations. We felt obliged to subscribe to the ideal of human relations which is expressed in the parable of the Good Samaritan.  We decided that we could not, having regard to our Faith and our policy, pass by looking the other way when we were called upon to help. That was the ideal that inspired us in accepting the request from the United Nations and I hope that the result of our action and the action of all the other Governments that responded in a similar way to that request will be to make possible the establishment of a stable State in the Congo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The names of the firms or individuals who established the ninety-nine factories referred to and a reply to parts (a) and (b) of the Deputy's question are given in a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the official report.</P>
