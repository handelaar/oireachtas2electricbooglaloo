      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what is the method adopted by the Commissioners of Public Works in placing contracts; and whether tenders are invited through public Press advertisement for all contracts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Save where such a course is not feasible, e.g. the supply of proprietary spare parts for machinery, contracts are placed by the Commissioners of Public Works as a result of competition. The practice is to accept the lowest suitable tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> Tenders are invited through public Press advertisements for building works estimated to cost £1,500 and over in the Dublin and Cork city areas and £500 and over in the remainder of the country.  For works estimated to cost less than those amounts tenders are invited directly from as many known suitable contractors as possible.</P>
    <P>Tenders for supplies are invited through public Press advertisements except where the estimated cost of the supplies is less than £1,000 or where the number of suitable supplies is known to be limited.  In such cases competitive tenders are invited directly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In those cases where the Parliamentary Secretary says that there are no Press advertisements but that tenders are invited from known contractors, would he not consider it more desirable that the tenders should be invited through the public Press or at least the local Press?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of big jobs, tenders are invited through the public Press, but in regard to the smaller jobs, there is a practice of issuing a notice, or sometimes sending out the specifications, to a big number of contractors, which was found to be the most expeditious way to deal with the job.</P>

      <P>The minerals which have been discovered from time to time in Co. Galway, and the localities in which they were discovered are recorded on the geological maps and summarised in a card index with some 200 entries related to this county alone which may be inspected at the Office of the Geological Survey in Hume Street, Dublin.</P>
      <P>Information is also available in the Geological Survey Office publication &ldquo;Memoir and Map of Localities of Minerals of Economic Importance and metalliferous Mines in Ireland&rdquo; by G.A.J. Cole, which may be obtained from the Government Publications Sales Office.  Some of the steps taken with a view to working the mineral deposits in Co. Galway are summarised in this publication mentioned.</P>
      <P>In 1954 a detailed examination of the Murvey Molybdenite deposit was undertaken by the Geological Survey. Prospecting licences and State mining Leases have been granted from time to time under the Minerals Development Act, 1940, in respect of various mineral deposits.  At present there are four State mining leases of marble deposits and two prospecting licences in respect of molybdenite deposits in operation in the county.</P>

In the case of Wexford Corporation the last return was furnished in September, 1959, in respect of the year ended 31st March, 1959.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government what is the basis on which allocations are made from the Road Fund to the Waterford County Council; why was this allocation consistently reduced for the past six years; and what has been the basis on which allocations which are called tourist road grants were made to some counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants are allocated from the Road Fund to Waterford County Council on the same basis as that applying to the country generally which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A main road upkeep grant of 40 per cent. of approved expenditure on the upkeep of main roads;</P>
      <P>(2)  a main road improvement grant which is allocated to each county council in proportion to its mileage of main roads;</P>
      <P>(3)  a county road improvement grant which is allocated to each county council in proportion to its mileage of county roads. </P>
      <P>Six years ago, that is in 1955/56, the total of these grants was about £120,000.  In each of the succeeding 4 years the total was about £122,000 and in the current year it is £130,800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other grants of a special nature allocated from the Road Fund to Waterford County Council in the past six years were&mdash;(1) a grant of £5,000 per annum for the improvement of tourist roads in the Gaeltacht and congested areas; (2) an extra grant of £12,500 in 1955/56 for the improvement of main and county roads.  This was Waterford's share of a sum of £500,000 divided between county councils in proportion to their road mileages; <Col N="1691" /> (3) grants totalling £17,500 in 1955/56 for the reconstruction of Bonmahon and Annestown bridges; (4) a further grant of £8,000 in 1956/57 for Bonmahon bridge; and (5) a grant of £13,500 in 1958/59 for Kiladangan Bridge.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that the total allocation from the Road Fund has been consistently reduced for the past six years; it has in fact varied up and down, due principally to the effect of special grants such as the grants for bridges.</P>
    <P>As regards the tourist road grants they are allocated in pursuance of a scheme drawn up in 1953/54 for the improvement of roads in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  Eleven counties in all benefit from the scheme which has been maintained in its original form since it was inaugurated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section relating to the laying of the regulations before the House.  I mentioned a matter on the Committee Stage to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention again.  There is a proviso that these regulations relating to safety will not apply where the manufacturer states that the oil burners to be produced are not for sale on the domestic market.  I suggested to the Minister that that was a rather dubious use of regulatory powers, that if he was going to make regulations to prohibit the manufacture of dangerous oil burners, he should not permit people here to manufacture dangerous oil burners for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister replied that he could envisage a situation in which another State, having different safety regulations from ours, commissioned the manufacture of a burner to their specification.  The Minister seemed to think it would be a hardship to say to a manufacturer in this country: &ldquo;You shall not be allowed to manufacture <Col N="1703" /> an oil burner which in our judgement in Ireland is unsafe&rdquo; when he is requested to do so by a foreign State.  I put it to the Minister that that is a shortsighted view because if some tragedy should ensue in a foreign State and it transpires that the burner responsible for that tragedy was manufactured in Ireland, nobody in that foreign State is going to be told that our Government condemned that type of burner and would not allow it to be used in Ireland; or if they are told that, the people in that foreign State would be led to believe that we, having rejected that as an unsafe type of burner, unloaded it on a foreign country.</P>
    <P>I reminded the Minister that there was a case in the very recent past in Morocco where a country disposed of certain industrial products with a clear warning that they were to be used only for certain purposes.  Nevertheless, they were used for quite a different purpose with disastrous results for a large number of Moroccans and a great deal of unfavourable propaganda was spread in Morocco at the expense of the country which allowed an unsafe product to be sold abroad.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand there is to be a new company established here for the manufacture of oil burners.  I understand that their product will conform in the fullest sense to all the safety regulations that our Bureau of Standards may establish.  The reputation of their product on the foreign market, I suggest, might be very seriously injured if at the same time as they were trying to make their way in the foreign market with a perfectly safe burner, somebody else was manufacturing and exporting an unsafe oil burner.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that a regulation declaring a certain type of burner to be unsafe for human use ought not to contain any proviso permitting an Irish manufacturer to manufacture such a burner merely on the ground that he is going to sell it abroad.  I believe our standard should apply to any product bearing the trade mark &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo; and I believe <Col N="1704" /> it will do our export trade serious injury if we allow any exporter here to manufacture and export an oil burner which does not correspond with the minimum requirements of safety laid down by regulation on foot of recommendations made by our Bureau of Standards.</P>

      <P>I undertook on the Second Stage to look into this question raised by Deputy Dillon.  I have examined it again and I have come down in favour of the retention of the paragraph as it stands, that is, paragraph (b) of Section 3, subsection (3), which makes it a good defence in the event of a prosecution being brought for the sale of an oil burner not conforming with the standards laid down, to say that the oil burner was not intended for use in this State.  We propose to make regulations here to define the standards we shall require. These standards will have regard to our own particular conditions, climatic conditions perhaps&mdash;even wind velocity might be taken into account.  Conditions vary from country to country. Therefore the standards that should be laid down would perhaps also vary from country to country.  The standards we lay down may be very high and such standards may not be required in other countries.</P>
      <P>I should like to put to Deputies the case of a manufacturer in this country procuring an order from a merchant in another country for oil-burners.  If the manufacturer here sends the merchant the specifications which he is obliged to measure up to in respect of oil-burners for sale in Ireland and if the importing merchant says: &ldquo;I do not want oil-burners up to these specifications; the standards in my country do not require such high specifications; please give me burners in accordance with my own country's specifications,&rdquo; the Irish manufacturer would say: &ldquo;I am afraid I cannot; I am precluded from doing so by the law of my country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest it is unnecessary that we should limit manufacturers here and restrict them from fulfilling orders to a specification that would satisfy his foreign customers whose specifications <Col N="1705" /> are not the same as those which apply in Ireland.  That is, perhaps, only one instance but, in general, I say that most countries will have specifications. If I might instance the reason for the introduction of this Bill it is that standards have been set in Britain.  The British people are looking after themselves and it is up to us to do likewise.  That is what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>In reply to another point made by the Deputy about the setting up of a new industry in this country for making oil burners&mdash;I think he is referring to the same industry as Deputy Coogan had in mind when he spoke during the Second Reading, I am almost certain&mdash;in fact, I can say I am certain&mdash;that the type of oil-burners which this new firm will make in or near Galway is not the ordinary mobile type that one can carry from room to room, but oil-burners of a type which can be used in central heating of premises and therefore they will not be subject to the regulations made under this Bill.  I had full regard to the point made by the Deputy when I was considering the matter but, on balance, I felt it was better to leave the Bill as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not an opportunity of hearing the Minister's speech last week, but in glancing through it&mdash;or at least what I saw of it in the papers&mdash;it seems that he gave the House a statistical abstract of agriculture.  I do not suppose anyone can be very surprised at that, because probably the farmers of Ireland at present find themselves more financially embarrassed than they have been for a considerable period.</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to some aspects of his policy which have produced the present situation. First, I want to address myself to the grain situation which is of considerable interest in my country and in adjacent counties, in other words, in the tillage counties.  The Fianna Fáil Government have been repeatedly warned that if they did not put an economic floor to feeding stuffs&mdash;and by feeding stuffs I mean feeding barley &mdash;they would not achieve the results necessary to maintain an economic balance nor would they achieve a satisfactory ratio between the three principal crops sown here, wheat, oats and barley.  However it may be glossed over by the Minister or by members of his Party, very few of whom appear to have spoken here, the indisputable fact remains that we have come back to the position in which we were some years ago&mdash;we have not sufficient feeding barley to meet our own requirements. That is entirely due to the fact that the Government would not fix an economic floor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were in office those of us who were supporting the Government in the Fine Gael back benches fought our battle within the Party and achieved a floor of 40/- a barrel for feeding barley.  We were told by members of Fianna Fáil that was insufficient and I, personally, was not particularly satisfied with that price but it was the best we could get.  At least it was fixed and the barley was produced, or the greater portion of what was necessary for home feeding was produced.  The present Government, in spite of the advice they got from this side of the House and in spite of the pressure from Deputies of their own Party, two of whom are <Col N="1707" /> in the House at present, refused to take advice from people in a position to know, people speaking on behalf of counties producing that type of feeding stuff.  The Government allowed themselves to be put in a position of fixing an uneconomic price which has resulted in the present situation.</P>
    <P>We move to wheat.  This is a subject on which any Deputy could talk for hours.  He could produce a history over recent years of innumerable statements by Government Party members in regard to this crop.  I do not think there is any need to stress that further; it has often been discussed here and I think the answer was adequately given to the Government in the recent by-election.  As a result of the Government's foolishness over the price of barley they find themselves with too much wheat.  Farmers have grown more wheat this year, I think, than in recent years and the question now is how much the levy that the Government will impose on the farmers for growing wheat will be.</P>
    <P>I wonder how much money has been spent by the Government in advertising and on publications concerning wheat.  In every country newspaper, in every paper, journal and magazine the farmers were told to &ldquo;grow more wheat&rdquo;.  Thousands of pounds were spent in that campaign and the farmers responded as they always respond to a call in this country.  The result is that they will be penalised again.  Further, the Minister has said the present arrangement is a temporary one and that next year he is going to impose a quota on the farmers.</P>
    <P>What about all the money being spent on advertisements asking farmers to grow more wheat?  Is it not sad that a Government who advocated a wheat growing policy are this year imposing a levy on farmers who grow wheat? The Minister has not yet stated the amount of the levy.  Next year he will impose a quota in order to prevent them growing wheat which over the years they were advised by the Fianna Fáil Government to grow.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in regard to grain?  Have the Minister and his <Col N="1708" /> advisers considered, from a world point of view, what the prospects are for grain growers in this country? Employment on the land has fallen by 4,000 or 5,000 over the past few years. Each year there are fewer people employed on the land.  Tillage was calculated to keep people employed on the land.  Extra production of livestock would keep people employed on the land.  Where are all the promises in regard to mixed farming, grain farming, made by the Fianna Fáil Party?  The results are sad.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, has indicated that the agricultural income has fallen by £17 million.  Are the majority of the Irish people, those employed on the land, which is fundamental to our economy, to be content because a few industries are set up from outside? Economists may write articles in the paper indicating that the situation is a bit better here, that the balance of payments position is better.  Fundamentally, the country depends on the people who come from the land, who have stood by Ireland all the time and who are the basis of our economy.  They are to be driven out by a Party with a huge majority in Dáil Éireann, a Party free to adumbrate any policy but who have no policy.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us when he is replying what his grain policy is for the future?  The Minister comes from a county which is not very actively concerned with grain.  That also applies in the case of Deputy Dillon but Deputy Dillon always had in mind the needs of the tillage farmers.  If the farmers of Ireland could get Deputy Dillon back as Minister for Agriculture, they would be satisfied because they know that, in that case, there would be some sort of policy in operation.</P>
    <P>What will the future bring?  What will be the situation in Europe as a whole?  Have the Minister's advisers considered that matter?  What is the position in regard to the wealthiest purchasing community outside the United Kingdom, the Common Market, the Six?  They have all the grain they want.  There is no market <Col N="1709" /> there.  There is no market anywhere else.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;Let us turn grain into livestock.&rdquo; Let us consider the position in regard to livestock. What are the prospects for livestock? In spite of all the glossing over in this House by those who would defend a futile livestock policy, this is the story: Over the past two years, there has been a gradual decline in exports of livestock from this country; there has been a gradual decline in prices.  From time to time, there was a fillip and everybody felt that things would be all right, only to sink back into despondency when the bottom went out of the market again.</P>
    <P>Have the Government any policy for the future?  If the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme is fully implemented and if there is no residual tuberculosis in the country, is there any guarantee the Government can give to the people that there is a market for store cattle?  I doubt it.  Anyone who goes to a mart or fair knows the attitude of the people there.  There is nothing but despondency.  People wonder if they can cut their losses or even get what they gave for cattle some years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department may issue statistics and may say that the price of cattle in such a month is better than it was a month before and better than it was a few months ago, that the fall is due to climatic conditions, that it is due to drought in England, failure of crops in England, a decline in the grain crop, a bad return of hay so that the British farmers are unable to feed the stock.  The fact is that conditions are changing with regard to the sale of livestock and this Government have done nothing to meet the situation.  They have no policy and no stable outlook in regard to the sale of livestock.</P>
    <P>Our capacity to sell to the United Kingdom, where the major portion of our exports goes, is entirely dependent on whether the British buy beef from the Argentine or not.  The price of cattle recently went up by a small amount.  Everybody was hopeful that there would be an improvement.  A few days later, it was announced in the <Col N="1710" /> newspapers that there had been an enormous shipment of beef from the Argentine into the United Kingdom. Prices went down again.  There was another shipment of beef from the Argentine a week or so ago and the price went down again.  There is no stability in the market today, no attempt on the part of this Government to get an agreement.  At the time when they should have looked for an agreement, they were whittling away their time in an effort to change the system of election.  Every country in the world is looking for agricultural agreements.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Government did nothing but they did one thing.  They did it in desperation.  Recently they voted the money for a subsidy for fat stock.  That is something.  It is an indication that the Government and the Department of Agriculture have accepted the fact that they have lost the store cattle trade, on which this country depended and which gave vast employment and kept people on the land.  Above all, it kept the small farmer in existence.  The loss of the store cattle trade is the greatest tragedy in Ireland today.  The majority of the votes that go to the Government Party come from the small farmers.  Yet, the small farmers are the very people whom they have driven off the land and out of the country.  The small farmers are unable to exist without the store cattle trade.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has cattle, who has a strong farm, who has some sort of financial backing, who is able to stand the racket, can hold on to his cattle, fatten them and sell them.  That is the only reliable market left today.  What will happen to the small farmer?  The bigger farmer by exporting his stores, can create space on his farm for restocking. The live calf market can be kept going.  The dairy farmer has a source of income from that and is able to produce milk.</P>
    <P>No doubt, when the Minister is replying, he will produce statistics by the dozen.  Departments are always ready with statistics.  One can prove anything on paper but I want to face the hard facts.  I live on the land and work on the land.  The hard fact is <Col N="1711" /> that at the moment the farmer is unable to sell his produce or, if he can sell it, is selling at a reduced price. The old cry that has been going on all the time is: &ldquo;Produce more efficiently and sell more cheaply&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not for this side of the House to advise the Government.  The Government have a huge majority.  They have official advisers at their elbow. They were supposed to have a policy when they came into office.  The majority of their supporters were small farmers who are being destroyed.  It seems to me that in the changing circumstances on the land at the moment, this Government or any succeeding Government must look for an alternative policy and for alternative markets.  Agricultural production is increasing all over Europe, in North America and in some areas of South America.  There are hundreds of people in the world who have not enough to eat, who are living on the verge of starvation.</P>
    <P>F.A.O., the world-wide organisation for the distribution of food and for the increased production and marketing of food, is conducting a freedom-fromwant campaign and is building up propaganda throughout the world.  The idea behind that campaign is that every country able to produce and already producing food should produce more food and should endeavour to market that food where possible in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>There is an almost illimitable demand for food in Africa.  Though Africa happens to be one of the underdeveloped parts of the world, it still has the purchasing power.  Certainly some of these emergent countries have the purchasing power to absorb a great deal of the world's agricultural produce. This country is fortunately placed in that there is no stigma of colonialism such as attaches to other European countries.  The position in Africa is that they are not anti-white but anti-colonial.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister and his advisers that anything Ireland has to <Col N="1712" /> offer those countries will be gladly accepted.  The marketing of produce in several of the emergent African countries is a simple problem because the majority of their exports and imports are conducted through one firm, a world-wide firm.  When these African countries were colonies they imported and exported through this agency and they are doing it still as there is no other medium through which they can export and import. They are anxious, as many of their leaders have stated, to make separate agreements with other States.</P>
    <P>Is there any State in the world more fortunately placed than Ireland to deal with these countries?  What has the Government done?  Has the Government done anything about solving the surplus milk problem which has become an embarrassment not only to this country but to other strong agricultural producing countries?  I suggest to the Government that they have the means of making such trade agreements. They can appoint someone, a Commissioner for Food or whatever they like to call him, to try to secure markets for us.</P>
    <P>Our chief difficulty is that if we produce more we are not able to sell it.  We regard the United Kingdom as our chief market.  The O.E.E.C. is closing down on the 22nd of this month to become a wider organisation embracing North America and Europe as a whole.  In its reports which have been issued year after year it has stated that the fault with the Irish economy is that we have put all our eggs in one basket.  The Government have relied on policies that existed prior to their entry into power.  There is not the same demand for our produce in the United Kingdom as there was before and they are in a position to pick and choose.  The answer to that is the E.F.T.O.  We are looking in the window while six or seven other nations are inside making agreements which will have an effect on our produce here.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Minister for Agriculture who is responsible for the welfare of Irish farmers should make some definite move to establish a marketing system whereby people can dispose <Col N="1713" /> of their produce.  It might well be answered that if we do get the markets we have not the produce to sell to those who wish to buy from us. There is a certain measure of truth in that.  There has been much instability in Irish marketing throughout the years since this Government came into power.  The cattle trade started to go, as unfortunately it always seemed to go, when they became the Government. If we were to get a comparatively big order from any country it is unlikely that we could fill it.</P>
    <P>Because of the instability that exists it has been impossible for us to go into full production.  Anyone who suggests that we are anywhere near full production is just talking nonsense. People complain; people leave the country and turn their backs on the administration and on political life here.  They are disillusioned in every way because, after 40 years of Irish Government, we are not in full production for the reasons I have been giving the House.  Any time we get production going something happens and our market is gone again.</P>
    <P>With regard to the eradication of bovine T.B., one would imagine from the Minister's statement, if I read it correctly in the time I had available, that bovine T.B. was almost eradicated, that the scheme was a success, that the millions of pounds spent already have been well spent and that we are secure in the thought that the country will be free from bovine T.B. in a very short period.  I wonder if the Minister knows that in my county, which is not very far advanced in the bovine T.B. eradication scheme, those who have disposed of reactors and tried to replace them have found the situation anything but satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In the last few days I have been told by several people in my county who have sold their entire herds, upset their husbandry and their existing method of living, that having bought tested replacements from the clearance areas to which the Minister has been referring, many of these cattle have gone down.  One man had 28 heifers of which 24 went down.  Like a loyal citizen following the policy of the <Col N="1714" /> Government he disposed of the 24 and bought 24 more attested cattle, what he believed to be first-class milking cattle.  Every one of them went down.  Even though the Government bought them from him again, he was at a loss of about £15 a head. Someone may say that is only one case but it has happened not only once but repeatedly and it is happening to people who are taking cattle out of the so-called clearance area west of the Shannon.  I am not alone in that experience.  I know many other Deputies can give similar cases.  Everyone wishes well to the bovine T.B. eradication scheme.  We must make it a success if we are to maintain what little is left of our store trade.</P>
    <P>I have said before to the Minister and I say again that to run a scheme for bovine T.B. eradication you must have technical experts in charge.  They must be free from the worry of continual file-keeping.  The Minister has had difficulty in getting technical experts, but I understand that position has been rectified.  I suggest to the Minister that these experts should be scattered throughout the country, not necessarily to carry out the tests themselves but to superintend the scheme. A small secretariat with central control would be sufficient to run the scheme on a proper basis.</P>
    <P>My information is that it is somewhat like the complicated machinery of the Land Commission.  With machinery like that of the Land Commission, you will never get anywhere. One group will be supervised by another group which, in turn, will be supervised and so on.  The system makes for the gathering of files but not for efficiency in a practical scheme such as this.  The Minister should allow it to be an entirely professionally-controlled organisation with, naturally, the secretariat of the Department of Agriculture and the Minister in supervision. It is not necessary for 20 or 30 officials to write letters to overworked veterinary surgeons to spur them on to greater energy and to send them regulations regarding what they should or should not do when they already know their business full well.</P>
    <P>Nothing will satisfy me that there <Col N="1715" /> is not some directive to go slow on the land project.  We are told that more work is being done on the land.  That may or may not be.  I should think it is more likely that it may not be. However, we shall accept the Minister's statement.  There are more applications as people become alive to the benefits of reclamation, manuring and improving of land.  These applications should be dealt with expeditiously.  No matter how influential Deputies may be, no matter how interested they may be in the people on whose behalf they make representations, the stock reply seems to be that the application has been noted and will be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible to have a few more inspectors?  We have other inspectors without whom we could do.  Quite a number of officials in other Departments might possibly be done without also.  Land reclamation means increasing production and the arresting of emigration.  Surely the Minister could ask the responsible authority to sanction the employment of a few more inspectors so that land will be inspected and the very necessary work carried out?  I cannot accept that the land project is running freely and efficiently and that cases are being dealt with in any sort of rapid sequence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke of the necessity for having Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture once more.  Surely that would be demotion for him in the eyes of his Party?  I gather he is looked upon as a future Taoiseach.  Unless he combines the portfolio of the Department of Agriculture with that of the Department of the Taoiseach I cannot see how he can possibly resume in the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went to the trouble of reading the various contributions to this debate. It was a form of penance; I do not know what Purgatory is like but it could not be worse than going through some of the contributions.  It emerges from them that this most important Department is not in a healthy condition. <Col N="1716" /> Agriculture is our main industry. Nevertheless, it is treated as a political football in this House.</P>
    <P>It emerges from the debate that the small farmer is in desperate straits. One reason put forward is that conditions are not good in the store cattle trade.  I fear there is no future for the country and particularly for the small farmer if our economic salvation is tied to the store cattle trade.  For years, the west has been depending almost entirely on the store cattle trade.  We now see the fruits of that policy. Various reasons are given for the changes that have taken place in recent years in that trade and for the lack of stability in store cattle prices.</P>
    <P>British farmers are increasing their cattle output.  The more they increase their output the less dependent they will be on store cattle from the west of Ireland.  That is one reason why the very attractive prices that were offered for a few years at cattle fairs in the west are no longer available.  Even if those good prices were restored and were to continue indefinitely I still hold that industry is not the cure for the economic ills of the small farmer in the west.</P>
    <P>Is it seriously suggested that the man with 15 to 20 acres can rear a family on that holding if it is devoted to what can only be described as ranching in a small way?  The same type of farm operates west of the Shannon as operates in Leinster.  The same type of husbandry is in operation on the 15-acre unit in the west as on the 500-acre unit in the midlands.  In recent years, husbandry in the midlands was devoted purely to the rearing and fattening of cattle, mostly fattening. The cattle generally were supplied from the south and west.  More recently, when it was discovered that it would not be a crime to plough the midlands, the landholders there turned from the cattle business to a great extent and took up wheat ranching.  Those large units were in a position to hold on, irrespective of market conditions.</P>
    <P>The small farmer in the west of Ireland was left with store cattle as his means of livelihood but his future was in jeopardy from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  How <Col N="1717" /> has it come home to the Deputies of this House and others outside?  In my opinion the facts are beginning to disclose themselves now through a change in the pattern of emigration.  In the past as we sent the store cattle from the west to Britain we sent also a fair volume of human beings.  Our principal exports from the west were young men and women and store cattle.</P>
    <P>The young men and women, when they went, sent back the emigrants' remittances.  They in turn helped those on the small-holdings to eke out an existence and keep the local shopkeepers in existence as well.  The position now, as has been already pointed out in this debate, is that the son and daughter in Britain have decided to stay there and they are taking over their parents with them. The father who left to work in Britain, and who came home regularly to look after the small-holding, has decided that it is not worth while doing so.  He has packed up and with his wife and family has gone to enjoy the benefits of the welfare State.  The people from the west who should be living with some sense of security as far as their land is concerned are now lost to this country.</P>
    <P>To a great extent this turn of events has taken place because of the wrong type of agricultural policy followed for the past 40 or 50 years.  In the various contributions here, whether they were from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Clann na Talmhan, the case was put forward that something must be done to help the small farmers.  Deputy Blowick even went so far as to advocate that the time was overdue when a minimum price must be made available for their produce, cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry.  A Deputy in the Fine Gael Party, a colleague of mine from Roscommon, went so far as to suggest that it was high time the bacon industry and the dead meat trade were taken over by the Government.</P>
    <P>They are only two Deputies.  I shall not name any more.  This thread runs through all the speeches if anybody cares to see it.  The Government must do this, that and every other thing.  I think it is time those Deputies should <Col N="1718" /> realise that every time they make that plea they are condemning the free-for-all type of enterprise which has been in operation for the past 40 years so far as agriculture is concerned.  I could not agree more with all those Deputies who say that it is the duty of the State to step in and provide the stability and make the necessary organisational arrangements to secure marketing for the produce and save the farmers and consumers from the exploitation which goes on at the present moment.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies in what I describe as the Right Wing of this House are actually advocating a form of nationalisation for agriculture.  I hope they realise that and are prepared to stand over what they said.  A Deputy suggested that it was time the bacon industry and the dead meat trade should be taken over by the Government.  Let us examine one of the propositions.  I know that Deputies may be bored with this again because some of it is repetition but I shall make a few comments on it.  I believe this Government have made absolutely no move whatever in the past three years to save this very important industry.  Not to speak of increasing the output or improving the conditions, they are actually making no attempt to save it although it is in a most serious position.</P>
    <P>In November 1957 I asked a question here.  I shall not go back any further because I put down similar questions for four years before that. In 1957 I asked the Minister for Agriculture if he was prepared to take any steps to bring stability into the industry, if necessary by the establishment of a semi-State company on the lines of the Irish Sugar Company in order to ensure that farmers would get a fair return and so that proper marketing arrangements might be made outside this country for the sale of their produce.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply to me said &mdash;and I shall not give the reply in detail; I shall condense it&mdash;he was not prepared to accept any such suggestion. He felt that stability had come into the industry since the introduction of the grading system and particularly since the introduction of Grade A.  The guarantee there was that it was going to bring stability.  He said it was <Col N="1719" /> debatable whether any other arrangements would or could secure better results.  On that occasion Deputy Dillon chimed in and agreed wholeheartedly with the Minister that this was the be-all and end-all and that the introduction of the Grade A guarantee had brought a measure of stability and would continue to do so.</P>
    <P>We know how it failed to do so. The following year, on the 26th November, 1958, I asked the present Minister for Agriculture what progress had been made with regard to the report of the Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce and if the Government would even publish the report of that Advisory Committee on bacon.  His reply was that no decision had been taken by the Government as to whether or not that report would be published. Belatedly, in the course of the Minister's introductory speech, he told us that the Government are going to reorganise this industry.  I wonder are they?  I wonder will they take the necessary ruthless steps that must be taken to put this on a sound basis and give confidence to the farmers that their interests are to be protected?</P>
    <P>Here is the position as I find it at the moment.  A small farmer in south Roscommon has two pigs for the market.  He goes into the nearest town with his two pigs.  He finds a buyer at the factory and he sells the pigs.  He does not know whether those pigs are Grade A, Grade B or Grade C.  He does not know what price he will get for them.  He must keep his fingers crossed until he hears from the factory and receives his cheque before he knows what grade the two pigs were.  One thing which he does know, and one thing about which he can be sure is that when those two pigs have received &ldquo;the treatment&rdquo; at the factory&mdash;when they have got a shower, a shave and a shampoo&mdash;they will come out as Grade A on the breakfast table, irrespective of the grade the farmer was paid for when the pigs were bought by the factory.  The housewife will also pay Grade A prices for those pigs when she is making her purchases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> Where is the guarantee or the security for the farmer?  Where is the protection for the housewife in that performance?  What interest will be affected if the Government take the necessary steps to put this industry on a proper basis?  Is it not a fact that the bacon factories will have to be dealt with and dealt with severely? Are this Government in a position to deal with the bacon factories?  I do not want to delay the House but if I pointed out that quite a large number of the bacon factories are closely associated with the Government can we then expect the Government to take the necessary disciplinary action against these bacon factories?  If I wanted to have a controversial debate here I would mention the factories and their associations with the Government but I think they are well known to the House already.  The proof of the Government's sincerity in dealing with this industry will be the steps they are prepared to take to deal with the middle-man between the bacon producers and the consumers, in this case the bacon curers.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that members of the Fine Gael Party agree with me that it is time for the Government to take some steps.  I am also glad that members of Fine Gael agree with me that the Government have a duty in regard to the dead meat industry.  The difficulty at the moment is that this very important industry has been left in the hands of private concerns.  Naturally the main object of a private concern is to make profits and private concerns are not interested in the general welfare of the community or of the nation. They are interested in making profits and in the course of making their profits they may be damaging the welfare of the community.  Therefore it is only fair and just that the interests of the farmers, the consumers and our export rights, should be preserved from exploitation.  The Government are the people who are in a position to give that protection.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already that the view seems to exist that the store cattle trade is the be-all and end-all as far as this country is concerned.  I find that there is a very great measure of agreement <Col N="1721" /> at the moment on that matter between the two major Parties in this House. I do not want to be taken as suggesting that the store cattle trade is not important.  It is important, but if we give it the position of importance which it seems to hold in the eyes of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, we shall never have anything here except underpopulated ranches&mdash;that is, if we depend mainly on this trade.  Of course, unscrupulous people can go down the country and suggest to the small farmer that people in this House and elsewhere are trying to damage his income and his livelihood by suggesting that the store cattle trade is not as good as the small farmer thinks it is and that people are trying to suggest that a levy should be put on store cattle for the purpose of setting up a dead meat industry.</P>
    <P>I shall put it very simply.  The way I look at it is this.  I take west Roscommon which is an area in which farmers' valuations vary from £3 to £17.  In a year some of those farmers sell three or four beasts in Ballaghaderreen. In my opinion that would be the maximum number they would sell in twelve months.  The position at the moment is that very often a small farmer in that locality sells one or two beasts at the local fair and I have not the slightest doubt that that same farmer has one son or two sons working in England and it is probable that his own sons are employed in some industry which depends on the by-products of that beast bought in Ballaghaderreen.  I believe every effort must be made to expand the dead meat trade so that the farmers' sons in such localities will be employed in this country.  I do not care in what part of the country they are employed as long as it is in Ireland.  It would be much better to have the beasts processed here than to send them on the hoof to Britain.  It would be a much better proposition to sell the dead meat to Britain and process the by-products ourselves so that we can give employment.</P>
    <P>It is not a simple proposition; it will not be done overnight and certainly it will not get the support from the public that it should get if we leave <Col N="1722" /> it in the hand of private enterprise which is exploiting the public at the moment.  If the public are to have confidence in the dead meat trade, the trade will have to be handled by a State or semi-State body.  I need not point out the confidence which the people have in a body such as the Irish Sugar Company.  From the farmer to the consumer that Company has the confidence of the public.  It is efficiently run and is reasonably fair and the question of exploitation never arises. The public and the farmers realise that, and surely the same should apply to a very important aspect of our agriculture, namely the cattle industry.</P>
    <P>I am afraid this industry is in the wrong hands.  Over the best last few years I have noticed the anxiety displayed by the commercial banks to throw money at organisations in this country to set up cattle marts like mushrooms It is significant that in many instances a great measure of the control over these marts is exercised from outside the country.  It is significant that a number of farming groups in Britain, through their banking connections, have very close associations with the Irish cattle marts.</P>
    <P>Whatever benefits accrue to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis through the erection of these marts, the fact remains that a straglehold is being placed on the farmer.  The idea is that he is to be kept there purely as a supplier to the British markets, to be manipulated by British interests in whatever way suits them.  Let us realise that so far as the marketing of cattle or anything else is concerned, we have no such thing as a marketing arrangement with Britain.  Even with regard to the cattle produced in Ireland, it is British agents who buy them; it is British agents who export them; and in many instances it is British ships that carry them, so all we do is provide the raw material.  One of our biggest needs, therefore, is a proper marketing arrangement and the State must provide that arrangement.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the fact that the same type of farming takes place on the 15 acre unit as on the 500 acre unit.  Both carry out extensive farming rather than intensive <Col N="1723" /> farming.  That is very plain to be seen if we examine the returns for tillage.  In relation to the amount of land under the plough from time to time and the amount of land devoted to crops, we have a lower ratio, so far as I can gather, than any other country, although our land, our climate and everything else are suitable.</P>
    <P>I notice that one year we have a record acreage and production so far as wheat is concerned; the following year there is a reduction in the acreage and the acreage of barley goes up, and vice versa.  When we look at the overall increase, we find there is no overall improvement, and that one is up and the other is down, depending on which the farmer, or whoever grows the crops, thinks will be the more remunerative in a particular year.  I believe we must have discipline and organisation in regard to the growing of crops, and especially in regard to the growing of wheat.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde rightly criticised the idea of thousands of pounds being spent on posters and advertisements all over the place urging the agricultural community to grow more wheat. The position for the past few years has been that when a certain amount of wheat has been grown over a certain figure, a levy has to be imposed. How does any farmer in his senses know what is the most judicious amount to grow in any year?   Would it not be a better and more reasonable proposition to bring in the contract system?   Why can the contract system not work here as it does in the growing of beet?  Have we not had over the years practical concrete evidence of the scandalous exploitation that went on in relation to the growing of wheat?  Have we not had evidence given by various members of this House of company directors, telephone farmers, and even foreigners, taking large tracts of land here in conacre for the growing of wheat and making tremendous profits?  Have we not had evidence over the years that those people who took a large acreage of conacre are the people who brought in the big machinery, the large combine <Col N="1724" /> harvesters, which displaced the human element and, at the same time, contributed to upsetting the equilibrium in our balance of payments?</P>
    <P>Surely, therefore, we should decide at this stage to cut out any question of large scale conacre and the exploitation of the community as such.  We should concentrate on the medium or small farmer so far as the growing of wheat is concerned, and let him know what his price will be for a certain production and for a certain figure.  That would mean that a certain amount of hard work would have to be done by the Department and it would mean that more control would have to be exercised over the millers.  I understand we have a grain board, Bord Gráin, functioning at the moment. Surely if that board are to do any good work at all, that is the type of work they should be doing.</P>
    <P>Barley is a very important grain and it is ideal for growing in certain counties in Ireland.  An expansion in the growing of malting barley is held up because the processing of that barley into whiskey is in the hands of a few distillers who do not care tuppence about the country as a whole.  Their records over the past 150 years show that they were anti-Irish.  Those people had their chance, time after time, to tap the foreign market for the end product of malting barley, and time after time they let that chance slip through their hands because, as I have said repeatedly, they were not concerned with a foreign market.</P>
    <P>Surely there is room in that field for the State to move in.  Surely it would be much better for us to have intensive farming and to go in for industries based on agriculture rather than to be left dependent to a great extent for our industrial expansion on raw materials which have to be imported.  We have no control or no say whatever over the price of those raw materials.  Yet the concentration of effort goes into that arm while right under our feet we have the necessary wealth, if only we exploit and develop it.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Government have they given serious consideration to developing the various types of agricultural produce which have been <Col N="1725" /> neglected up to the present.  For instance, I am reminded of something which has been mentioned by other Deputies, namely, the growing of fruit and vegetables.  I do not think it can be denied that for the small farmer, particularly in the west of Ireland, the ideal type of husbandry is horticulture.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is a distinct prejudice, and the Minister knows it, in the minds of small farmers against the growing of vegetables and fruit. The rural community know very little about the scientific aspects of the cultivation of fruit and vegetables.  Very few farmers grow vegetables.  A change in production methods then will entail first-class educational facilities at the outset; first-class horticultural officers will have to be made available, perhaps one to every parish, for the purpose of advising, guiding and helping the small farmers in the growing of fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>This is something, again, that will not be done by private enterprise.  I want to pay tribute here to the Sugar Company for its pioneering activities in the growing of fruit and vegetables. At the same time, I have some criticism to offer, in that I cannot understand why it should be necessary to set up the pilot plant in connection with the processing of fruit and vegetables in Carlow.  I understand that in Carlow the farmers are wedded to the growing of beet.  We all know that in the west of Ireland the growing of beet has not been the success it was initially hoped it would be.</P>
    <P>I believe that the concentration of effort with regard to the cultivation of fruit and vegetables should be sited in the west of Ireland.  It is in the west of Ireland we need such cultivation to give some hope there for the future.  It is from the west of Ireland that the biggest population drain takes place.  It is there we will have to stabilise the population.  We shall not do that by depending on store cattle. We shall have gradually to win the people from that type of husbandry to a more paying one, a more important one, and one that will give much more employment.</P>
    <P>The market is there in Britain.  Let the Minister not tell me that the <Col N="1726" /> market is not available.  The figures for processed food and vegetables in Britain reaches the £1,000 million mark.  Over 25 to 30 per cent. of that market is met by imports from other countries.  We have not tapped even an infinitesimal fraction of one per cent. of that market.  Why?  Because we have left the cultivation of fruit and vegetables in the hands of a few private concerns which are interested in producing peas, or jam, or something else, for the home market and which have shown no interest whatever in getting into an export market.</P>
    <P>As has been said elsewhere by a well-known statesman: the winds of change are beginning to blow.  It is encouraging in this debate to hear Deputies from the Fine Gael benches advocating that the Minister and the Government should step in now and control the bacon industry and the dead meat industry.  It is encouraging to find the Leader of the Clann na Talmhan Party advocating that the small farmer should be given security and a guaranteed market for his produce. It is encouraging to hear the same leader advert to the fact that the welfare State is the attraction for the migrant and that we, consequently, must provide some alternative at home.  When that view becomes prevalent in these Parties, then it is certain that same view obtains in Fianna Fáil.  The only trouble is that, up to the moment, Fianna Fáil have remained almost silent in this debate.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that when the necessary changes are being made in the near future&mdash;I gather certain changes will be made with regard to the setting up of State or semi-State bodies to deal with improving agricultural output&mdash; there will be agreement in this House on these changes.  Let us hope that it will be possible to forget the idea which has been so prevalent up to this, namely, that when Fiann Fáil are out of office, they can delude the small farmer into believing that they are his best friends; when they are back in office, others suffer from the delusion that the only way to save the small farmer is by putting back into Government the people then in Opposition, namely, the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> There is no difference between them as far as the small farmer is concerned. For the past 30 years, both Parties have pursued the same policy, with, perhaps, minor adjustments in relation to the price of wheat, or oats, or a guarantee in relation to something else.  Fundamentally, there has been no difference between the Parties. Neither has made a genuine attempt to get the export market properly organised or controlled.  Both must carry the blame for that.</P>
    <P>Let us hope, before it is too late, that we shall get agreement in this House that marketing arrangements must be handled by the State, through the medium of State or semi-State bodies.  Let us hope these bodies will have on them representatives of the farming community&mdash;the producers. We cannot hope to achieve here in a short time what it took Denmark and other European countries 70 to 100 years to accomplish.  The co-operative movement in Denmark grew up over a century.  It is now the driving force in agriculture.  Such a co-operative movement cannot, in my opinion, be put into operation here for various reasons, reasons which I do not propose to examine here now, but the next best thing can be done.  We should be able to bridge the gap between us and these more progressive countries by the establishment of State or semi-State bodies working in conjunction with the farmers' cooperatives.</P>
    <P>One example we have of that is the Beet Growers' Association.  That body acts as the farmer's protector, adviser and friend.  They consult with the State body, the Sugar Company. and, between the two, the interests of the State and the interests of the producers and consumers are looked after. That is the ideal to be followed in all the other fields.  Let us hope there will be no further delay in getting down to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to this debate, one thing is very evident.  I did not have the advantage of hearing the earlier debate, but I did listen to Deputy Esmonde to-day.  Like myself, he comes from a tillage county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> Apparently the only hope he holds out for wheat farmers is to get Deputy Dillon back into office.  I am rather surprised to hear him say that because I wonder does he know his leader's views on wheat?  As far as we know, wheat is something we convert into bread and, if Deputy Esmonde would like to know Deputy Dillon's views on bread produced from Irish wheat, I shall give them to him:</P>
    <P>... for the first time since the emergency, we had the enthralling, stimulating and surprising experience of eating bread made out of Irish wheat.  Before you ate it, you had to hold it out in your hands, squeeze the water out of it, then tease it out and make up your mind whether it was a handful of boot polish or a handful of bread.  If it was boot polish, you put it on your boots or shoes and if it was bread, you tried to masticate it if you were fit.</P>
    <P>That is from column 2050, Volume 106, of the Official Report for the 18th June, 1947.  He is the man who, for six years when in office, did his damnedest to kill the growing of wheat, and he got stifled in wheat just as he himself was going to smother the English in eggs.</P>
    <P>I remember going to him in 1955 as a representative of the Wheat Growers' Association and he told me he had a headache for a month bothering about what he would do with the surplus wheat on hands.  He got over that problem by leaving the surplus wheat after him when he cleared out of office and letting a certain incoming Minister deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When those two have finished, I shall continue.  To be quite <Col N="1729" /> frank about it, I do not see any hope for Deputy Crotty's constituency, Deputy Esmonde's constituency, my own constituency, or the constituency of any tillage area in the country by reverting to Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Then, too, we heard a growl from Deputy Esmonde about feeding barley and the price paid for it, but we must remember that during the three-year period while the late Tom Walsh, God rest his soul, was Minister for Agriculture, the price of wheat was 82/6d. a barrel and the price of barley was 48/- a barrel.  That was for feeding barley and in 1953, there were 881,867 pigs in the country.  In 1955, during Deputy Dillon's term of office, that number had fallen to 798,845.  I shall give the reasons for that later, but, despite the fact that feeding barley cost 48/- a barrel, there were 881,000 pigs fattened in 1953, and no one was complaining, not even those who were feeding the pigs with it.</P>
      <P>To understand the position in which prices are now 40/- and 38/- a barrel, one must investigate its background. On 17th February, 1960, as reported at column 404, Volume 179 of the Official Report, Deputy Dillon asked the Minister for Agriculture:</P>
      <P>whether any steps can be taken by way of freight subsidy or otherwise to reduce the cost of homegrown barley to the farmers of North Monaghan, whose costs of production are seriously increased by the obligation to use barley derived from sources as far away from them as County Cork.</P>
      <P>Apparently, even though that is Deputy Dillon's constituency, they were not in a position to walk them off the land.  I do not know what happened them.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the arrangements made for the marketing of home-grown barley of the 1959 crop I am satisfied that the millers and compounders catering for the feeders in North Monaghan made every effort to secure their <Col N="1730" /> requirements of feeding barley from the nearest and cheapest source.  As evidence of this there is the fact that the prices of pig foods in North Monaghan are in line with the prices for similar feeding stuffs throughout the country.  In the circumstances it is not proposed to introduce special facilities for that area as suggested.</P>
    <P>That shows where the shoe pinches and I am making no bones about it.  The tillage farmers in the south who grow feeding barley are faced with that position of affairs.  That is what brought the price of barley down from 48/- to 40/- a barrel and I say that is what is holding it at its present figure of 38/- a barrel.  I make no bones about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would advise Deputy Palmer to try to mind his pen and pencil and not interest himself at all in farming.  I am describing the position as I find it.  I say that we tillage farmers cannot afford two reductions, one after the other, and it is as well to be plain and straight about it.  That is one of the reasons why the bottom was knocked out of the price of barley and the other was Deputy Dillon coming into office in 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I see Deputy Dillon weeping crocodile tears about the small farmers, I feel compelled to quote the statement he made in this House&mdash;the Lord between us and all harm! Deputy Dillon was dealing with the problems <Col N="1731" /> of the beet farmer.  This is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There remains beet&mdash;the blessings of beet! Some day, and in the not too far distant time, our people will have to ask themselves whether it is in the best interests of the community as a whole to continue the production of sugar from beet in this country at an annual cost to the community of £3,000,000 sterling.  That is what it costs in normal times to keep the beet industry going in this country. If, instead of growing beet and converting it into sugar, we import refined sugar into this country there will be £3,000,000 sterling more for the national exchequer...</P>
    <P>That is the statement made by Deputy James Dillon in this House on the 18th June, 1947.  That is the statement of the man the Deputies opposite want to put in charge of our agriculture.</P>
    <P>I was wondering what were Deputy Dillon's reactions to the manoeuvre carried out by the British Government during his term of office when a special levy was paid on sugar imported into Britain to provide a build-up for the British Commonwealth price.  Deputy Dillon told us himself when he spoke here on the 12th July last:</P>
    <P>Now, that is a pretty comprehensive Article and yet with that Article in existence, I understand that goods containing Irish sugar are being subjected to a very formidable levy, the proceeds of which are devoted to the subsidisation of goods of similar quality containing sugar derived from crown Colonies of the British Crown.  I am told, I think, by some of the Minister's colleagues, that when Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce, this matter arose and that he did not consider it desirable to press the interpretation of Article V which would give us the right to claim exemption from that levy.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position is in regard to that.  I have no recollection of hearing the matter discussed when I was a member of the inter-Party Government, although it could <Col N="1732" /> have happened and has passed out of my memory but I do not remember it and I have not discussed the matter with Deputy Norton.</P>

It is no wonder that the gentleman who told us the proper thing to do was to close the beet factories and bring in foreign sugar should adopt that line.  At the same time his colleague, Deputy Norton, was opening the door to let in £2,000,000's worth of foreign sugar.  No wonder Deputy Dillon took no interest in it when he was Minister for Agriculture. He had a hatred of beet.  He wanted to see beet go up the spout.</P>

      <P>From what I know of our Minister for Agriculture he is more interested in beet than Deputy Dillon.  I raised this matter here last February but few people were inclined to pay much attention to it.  However, it came up again on the 2nd June when we had this matter out very fully.  I was supported then by Deputy Cosgrave.  In seeking markets for our agricultural products we are up against the blunder made by Deputy Norton in 1956 and the ignorance displayed by his fellow Minister, Deputy Dillon, which has brought about a position in which we are robbed of a market worth £2 million to the farmers.</P>
      <P>We imported last year&mdash;I like to be exact in my figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was only trying to relieve Deputy Norton and if Deputy O'Sullivan does not want it that way, well and good.  Would it not be better for Deputy Norton if he had taken General Costello with him when making that agreement?  Then perhaps we would not have the muddle, trouble and annoyance that every one of us in the beet-growing area had last year through the cutting down in the acreage of beet.  Why did Deputy Norton &mdash;even though Deputy Dillon did not like it, apparently&mdash;not take General Costello with him in making that agreement?  I do not want to throw too much water but the Opposition must be like ducks; they seem to like it.</P>
      <P>Anyhow, that brought about the present condition of affairs and we are now asking our Minister for Agriculture to take up that situation and work on.  In 1948, we negotiated a Trade Agreement, according to Deputy Dillon.  Article 5 of the Agreement reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of the United <Col N="1735" /> Kingdom undertake that where goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland, are dutiable at preferential rates of duty, they will not vary the existing preferential treatment of these goods in such a way as to put any class of goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of Ireland at a disadvantage in relation to goods of that class from other sources enjoying preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>That is a quotation given by Deputy Dillon on the 12th July, 1960.</P>
    <P>What happened in connection with this market of £2,000,000 for Irish farmers for beet?  Evidently, Deputy Norton, when he went across, did not read that; his attention was not called to it by his advisers, apparently. Therefore he did not raise any difficulty. He thought there was not a breach of any agreement.  What happened was this: you have a preferential duty on sugar and sugar goods going into Britain which is the same as the Commonwealth rate of duty.  In 1956 the British got a brain wave. They put a special levy of 16/- per cwt. on all Irish sugar going into Britain and on all Commonwealth sugar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to go back a fairly considerable period, to Wednesday, 23rd March, 1955 and then I shall give the other reason.  I quote from the Official Report of 23rd March, 1955, Column 514:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton): I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £250,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1955, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the increased costs of the flour and wheatenmeal subsidy, £372,000, ...  It was originally calculated that the reduction in flour and bread prices as from the 1st May, 1954, would add approximately £900,000 to the bill for subsidy for the financial year 1954/55. <Col N="1738" /> In actual fact the reduction will cost £927,000 against which, however, can be offset items amounting to about £555,000...</P>
    <P>The chief offset items... are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  increased receipts by flour millers from sales of wheaten offals over and above the amount originally estimated:</P>
    <P>Increases in the price of offals, from £20 to £23 per ton in September, 1954, to £24 10s.  in December, 1954, and to £26 a ton in January, 1955, account for increased receipts by millers of approximately £170,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not arise on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  The Deputy has pointed out that this was moved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Therefore it could not be discussed relevantly on this Estimate for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that I am giving the reason why we farmers got a cut of £4 a ton in our feeding barley.  The reason was that the then Minister for Agriculture, in cooperation with the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, wanted to collect from the pig feeders of this country a penal tax.  They imposed that penal tax in this manner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir.  I have read the statement made by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce when he increased the price of the pig ration that had to be used by those who were under the wing of the Minister for Agriculture.  When I followed that matter up, Sir, I found that early in 1957 the statement made here by the present Taoiseach was that there was collected in that manner £1,096,000 from the pig feeders.  Then we have the crocodile tears here and we are <Col N="1739" /> told about the doors that were locked and the small farmers who went away. Every time that one of them went out with a bucket of ration to feed his pigs he had to contribute an indirect tax to the Government of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Norton.  That was the position and that is another reason why Deputy Dillon reduced the price of feeding barley from 48/- to 40/- a barrel.</P>

      <P>That was the condition of affairs that brought the number of <Col N="1740" /> pigs down from 881,000 to 700,000 in 1955.  That is the sympathy Deputy Dillon and Deputy Norton had for those 10 to 15-acre farmers about whom they are weeping crocodile tears now.  I think the Minister has been wrong in fixing the price of feeding barley at 38/- a barrel.  I agree with Deputy Esmonde that the Minister has driven the farmers back to wheat by that action.  It is very hard to understand some of the things that are done.  For example, in January to December, 1959, we imported 873,000 tons of offals at a cost of £843,000 and exported 191,000 tons of offals for £167,639.  Whether it was to keep the shipping companies going this kind of lunacy was indulged in, I do not know, but can anyone imagine a ship coming in one day with £843,000 worth of corn offals and on the following day, going out with £167,000 worth?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the reason for exporting animal feeding stuffs to-day and importing foreign feeding stuffs tomorrow at the same price?  Furthermore, 35,000 cwts. of malt for £74,000 were exported and my information&mdash; and I challenge denial of it&mdash;is that the exporters of that malt who bought our barley at 38/- a barrel, converted it into malt and exported it, were rewarded with licences for the importation of maize meal and they sold those licences to a Cork merchant at £3 a ton.  There were 1,347,000 cwts. of maize imported in the past 12 months costing £1,293,000, and I notice in Deputy Moher's speech here the other night that that was being sold at around 34/- a cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For whom are we working?  Is it for the farmer or the importer?  There is a big difference between 21/- and 34/- a cwt.  Who got the money?  If <Col N="1741" /> a maize licence is worth £3 a ton, as it was worth to the boys who exported the malt, would it not be worth £3 to the farmer who had to pay for the maize?  I claim that money is the property of Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>We spent some 20 odd years in carrying out experiments in the Cork County Committee of Agriculture on the feeding and fattening of pigs with barley as against maize.  When I saw this craze for maize coming back, I looked up those reports.  That is one of the misfortunes of being such a long time in public life.  You can always put your finger on these things, just as I put my finger on Deputy Dillon's statement in 1947.  According to the results of these experiments carried out over a period of 20 years, Irish barley, cwt. for cwt., is equal to maize meal for fattening pigs.  If it is equal to maize meal for fattening pigs and if the pig feeder has to pay £34 a ton for the maize meal, as Deputy Moher stated last Thursday, I see no reason why 48/- a barrel should not be paid for the barley.  It would mean only a little less profit for the man throwing it into the bag and a bit of sawdust with it and sending it back to them.  I can see no justification for the importation of over £1,000,000 worth of foreign meal whilst the Irish farmer is prepared to produce feeding barley for the needs of the nation.</P>
    <P>The more one looks into this Book, the more puzzling it becomes.  Just imagine bringing in over £800,000 worth of corn offals and at the same time, exporting 831,000 cwts. of wheat for £866,000.  Is there any man living, except a lunatic, who will tell me that the skin of wheat in the shape of wheat offals is better for our cattle than the whole wheat we are exporting?  That was done.  Why, I do not know.  We paid exactly the same sum for the corn offals we brought in as we were paid for the wheat we sent out.  I am reasonable in most things but I cannot understand that kind of policy.</P>
    <P>I shall give Deputy W. Murphy another quotation in regard to his leader's policy to take home with him. This quotation comes from the Official Report of 18th June, 1947, column <Col N="1742" /> 2048.  Deputy Dillon is reported as follows:</P>
    <P>We are subsidising butter production to the tune of £2,000,000 per annum.  How long will that go on? Do we expect butter to get dearer in the markets of the world?  Do we expect a time in the early future when the price of milk will become so adjusted&mdash;</P>
    <P>He did not say he would reduce it; he said it would be &ldquo;adjusted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that it will be possible to suspend this subsidy or do we intend to continue producing milk for conversion into butter in creameries at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £2,000,000 per annum?  I want it to go on record most emphatically that I think such a policy is sheer insanity and is purely pursued for the purpose of maintaining the prestige of incompetents in the offices of the Minister for Agriculture...</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Dillon's statement on the conversion of milk into butter. He had two spells in office.  He evidently continued to maintain incompetents in the Department of Agriculture because we still have the creameries and the butter.  The three main items of Deputy Dillon's stated policy are: (1) closing the factories and bringing in foreign sugar; (2) abolishing wheat-growing; and (3) fixing the price of feeding barley at such a level that the farmers will give up growing it and importing maize meal instead.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the difference of treatment in relation to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis as between one county and another.  Veterinary officers tell us it is a very contagious disease.  I have booklets showing the number of ways in which it can be spread amongst the herd.  Consider a small farmer in my county with ten cows.  The veterinary surgeon examines them.  Suppose three of them go down. Then, when he examines the dry stock, there are two yearling bullocks that go down also.  The Minister has been fair and generous as far as compensation for an animal that has to be removed is concerned.  What is the use of removing the three cows and <Col N="1743" /> leaving the two yearling bullocks to spread the disease?  Once they are earmarked, there is no more about it. No man will buy them except perhaps Deputy Dillon.  However, they are left there.  The Department will take no steps to have them removed.  There is no compensation whatever for them, whilst in the next county, just across the ditch, a man is paid the value of his bullocks when they are taken away.</P>
    <P>If there is to be any hope for our cattle trade, bovine tuberculosis must be eradicated.  How will we get rid of it?  Will we get rid of it by making a big circle of counties on a map and saying that within that area we shall pay no compensation for the store cattle or bullock and saying in respect of the other counties that we shall compensate the farmers for every animal that goes down, bullock or heifer?  That is the difference between the policy pursued in certain counties and the policy pursued in county Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that by hearing it long enough it will sink in.  The facts are there.  If we are to get rid of bovine tuberculosis in this country, it will not be got rid of by a Government policy which allows to remain on the land animals suffering from bovine T.B.  Personally, I am clear.  I think that my neighbours are not.  First of all, I showed them the road by example. When I come to my neighbour, he points to two or three little heifers or bullocks branded as having gone down by the vet.  They cannot be sold.  They have to remain there until they become two or three year olds and are turned into beef if the owner is to get anything at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sensible approach to this matter would be, when you are clearing a herd, to clear all of them.  It would not cost much more money and it would speed up the eradication of bovine T.B. in Cork county by at least two or three years.  It would be a lot faster than the scheme introduced for <Col N="1744" /> Bansha by Deputy Dillon.  I believe it is the one parish in this country where there are more reactors to-day than when this scheme started six years ago.  That is a very bad example.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister also to speed up the examination of herds.  A neighbour of mine came to me about a fortnight ago.  He told me that it was nearly three months since he notified the veterinary officers in connection with 120 cows.  They are since eating the furze off the ditches.  He cannot sell those cattle until such time as the Minister's veterinary officers come down to vet the cattle.  Something should be done to speed up the matter.  That is all I have to say.  I have put the case as clearly as I could.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamMurphy" hpid="Mr. W. Murphy Mr. W. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Estimate for Agriculture is one which should not be spoken to idly.  Listening to Deputy Corry for the past hour or more, I certainly cannot help thinking that he seems to make a joke of the whole thing.  During that hour or more it was a pity he did not put up some constructive ideas which might be helpful to the Minister to carry out what is no doubt an arduous task for him.  Instead of that, the Deputy seemed to be rambling over the past. Deputy Dillon seemed to be the one bee in his bonnet.  His own Minister did not escape.  According to Deputy Corry, the task of the Minister for Agriculture, no matter what Party he belongs to, is certainly not an enviable one.  According to the Deputy also, Ministers for Agriculture do things they should not do and do not do the things they ought to do.  That is about as far as he went so far as constructive debate was concerned.  I shall leave Deputy Corry at that.</P>
      <P>When I commenced my speech, I said this was an Estimate which should not be idly spoken to.  I say that because I firmly and honestly believe that it is an Estimate to promote an industry which has on more than one occasion proved to be the saviour of this country.  I also say it is an Estimate of the utmost importance. It is an Estimate which should be considered in a cool, calm and commonsense way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> This is the year 1960 and if Ministers for Agriculture of the past and even the present Minister, according to Deputy Corry, have made mistakes, surely it is about time now they learned from those mistakes if they got the help of the House?  Needless to say, without Deputy Corry I think something constructive could be done.</P>
    <P>Agriculture as it stands is the one industry which can in its own way be very easily handled.  It is an industry for which special factories have not to be built, nor have we to bring in foreigners to tell us how we can run it.  Every little farmyard in this country, let it be big or small, is undoubtedly a cog in the big wheel in that industry&mdash;even the labourer's cottage where the housewife may have only two little pigs or a flock of hens. She is an asset to that industry.</P>
    <P>We make every effort to see that the goods from industry are properly marketed.  Here we have our own little factories producing everything they were asked to produce.  They have gone into the ground to take the best out of it to produce and overproduce for that agricultural industry. The more they produce the less they get.  There should be markets for that exportable produce.  Above all, that exportable produce should be marketed in such a way that it will be capable of competing with similar products from the different countries.  To my mind, that is of the greatest importance.</P>
    <P>It was only the other evening that two English visitors called to my home. A friend of mine told them to call to see me if they were passing through Ennis and that I would direct them on the road to Galway where they would see something to interest them.  It was their first time in this country, due to Bord Fáilte.  The good lady told me she was influenced to visit this country by the constant advertisements which met her eye about coming to Ireland. She made up her mind and came over, accompanied by her husband.  They were delighted with the country, with the way they were treated and with the people.  However, she asked me one question which stayed in my mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1746" /> One of the things she liked was our butter and she asked me how it was that she could not get anything like it in England.  I said that we sent our butter to England but unfortunately we sent it in bulk and not in pound packages like that which comes from Denmark and New Zealand.  That is where the difference lay.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming anybody for that but it is something which might usefully be considered by the Minister or the marketing board which is to be set up.  At the present moment, everybody will agree with me, the cattle trade is at a very low ebb.  I am not going to say who is responsible for that and I do not know what is the cause, but I know that the state of this industry is hitting our rural towns and villages very hard at the moment. There may be one or two reasons for that but I believe the principal reason is the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  That scheme has been criticised and at times criticised severely. If we study the matter, we find that it is a problem which England has been tackling over the past thirty years.  As yet, their scheme has not succeeded fully and is it not too much to expect that in ten or twelve years we could do what England has not been able to do in 30 years?</P>
    <P>This is a scheme which appeared as a strange one to the farmers when it was introduced.  As a matter of fact, I remember when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture and this scheme was in vogue, I heard many farmers saying that it was a madcap scheme and I well remember that when he was in office, it was boycotted to a certain extent.  The result is that it was only during the past five years that the scheme got under way at all.  That is why I say we cannot expect to do in a few years what England has failed to do in 30 years.</P>
    <P>The farmers had their doubts about the scheme and they are still doubtful about it, and it is extraordinary how those doubts have been substantiated due to the many changes which have taken place in the tests.  Today, you have a herd tested and you may find two doubtfuls and one or two reactors. The reactors are taken away.  Then, <Col N="1747" /> you have the next test and you find that the doubtfuls are all right and that some of those which were previously tested are now doubtfuls.  That is something which the Department must look after.  It is something about which the farmers have to be educated. Personally, I believe that it does not matter what instructions come from the Department and it does not matter what the Minister may do; if he and the Department do not get the cooperation of the farmers, the scheme will never come to fruition.  I say that because I honestly believe it to be true.  For that reason, I believe it should be brought home to the farmers that things cannot be done in a year or two.  They must get time and it is up to the Department of Agriculture to instruct the farmers.</P>
    <P>At present we have many organisations looking after this industry.  We have the National Farmers Association, Macra na Feirme and others.  I believe that if they want to do any good, they should combine.  They should come together as one body, carrying with them their own ideas and pooling their knowledge to instruct the farmer in what he should do.  Until such time as that is done, I believe the agricultural industry will be in jeopardy.  Certainly at the moment its position is very bad.  Today the farmer, especially the small farmer, cannot afford to give his cattle away for nothing.  The big farmer has his chance all the time, but I believe that if you offered the cattle for nothing, they would not be taken.  Something should be done about that and it must be done quickly.  Otherwise, the whole structure will fall down.</P>
    <P>I am making these remarks without prejudice against anybody.  As I said at the beginning, this is the one Estimate which should not be taken idly but which should be spoken to in all sincerity.  It should not be spoken to as Deputy Corry spoke to it, with his Dáil Debates of previous sessions. That does not count now.  We must forget the past.  We are living in the year 1960 and we must stand up to 1960.  We must forget the past if we <Col N="1748" /> want to do anything for our people and now is the time to work for a brighter future for our people than they have at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in this debate will be for only a few minutes. I rise mainly to give my contribution on what I believe is the most vexed problem in agriculture at the moment. If I followed the line of my colleague, Deputy Corry, and had a long line of books before me, some of them going back as far as 1947, and quoted from speeches made here last week, I do not think I would be doing anything very effective for the farmers of East Cork who sent me here.  I prefer to follow another line and I hope my contribution will be constructive, or if not constructive, at least will provide food for thought for the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>I want to refer also to what I have already described as the most vexed question in agriculture in Ireland today&mdash;the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. Deputy Murphy has just referred to it also.  I want to be quite frank although I know that what I am about to say may be treated with ridicule, and perhaps scorn, by members on all sides of the House.  I shall say it because I believe it to be true. I do not know who first conceived the idea of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in other countries but I believe whoever conceived it was thinking with the wrong side of his head.  That is a strange statement to make here but I am convinced that it should never have been thought of. If it should never have been thought of in other countries, it must necessarily follow from my argument that it should not be thought of here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if we are to pursue the solution of this big problem logically&mdash;and a big problem it is&mdash;we must think of other ways and means of circumventing it.  If instead of spending all those huge sums of money which we have been spending and propose to spend on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, we took another view, I believe we would accomplish a better day's work.  My personal view is that instead of attempting to deal <Col N="1749" /> with the problem in the way proposed we should subsidise the export of fat cattle.</P>
    <P>How, I may be asked, does that get around the problem of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis?  We shall get around it in this way.  We all know quite well that when cattle are fat and near slaughter&mdash;&ldquo;near the knife,&rdquo; as the butchers say&mdash;the problem of bovine tuberculosis does not arise.  I honestly believe if we tackle the problem this way and spend this money, or part of it, on subsidising the export or the slaughter of fat cattle at home, we would be doing a far better day's work than by poking around this problem&mdash;and &ldquo;poking&rdquo; is the only way I can describe it.  Personally I cannot see the end of it.  We shall still be spending millions and millions and we still shall not have solved the problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of subsidising fat cattle for export or slaughter at home, the first thing that will suggest itself to any thinking man is that that would do away with the export of store cattle.  That is true.  I still believe in the policy of the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, that we should walk them off the land.  Is this not a most admirable way of walking them off the land? Someone may perhaps say that the small farmer may be victimised and that he will not have a market for his store cattle.  My suggestion is that a subsidy should be paid not only on our cattle for export and fit for slaughter at home but also on the cattle at home.  Then the small farmer or the man who rears store cattle and, as a rule, makes his living out of the rearing and selling of those store cattle will still be safeguarded against the man who is getting the subsidy and is prepared to pay him a reasonable price for them, and is also prepared to fatten them here himself.</P>
    <P>If any encouragement was given the job could be done.  There is no doubt that we have in this country land and grass well fit to fatten cattle in the summer and with a little encouragement, and the application of the scientific knowledge of agriculture we now possess, they could easily be fattened also in the winter months.  That would <Col N="1750" /> have the advantage that much of the grain which we grow could be used at home.  It would also have the advantage of keeping some of the people who unfortunately have to leave the country at home working, tending and fattening those cattle.  I believe that if we had another look at this big vexed problem, perhaps the suggestion I am now making, contemptible or ridiculous as it may seem, would, after the second or third look, appear to have something in it.</P>
    <P>I rise in all sincerity to put that point of view.  I know it is highly likely that one section will have little regard for my suggestion.  I refer, of course, to the veterinary surgeons, but I think there are very reasonable men in that profession also.  In fact, quite a few of them are personal and sincere friends of mine.  I think that if their view were canvassed in a sincere way, they would agree that no matter how we tackle this problem&mdash;and we have seen all the snags over the past 12 monthsit is highly unlikely that bovine tuberculosis will be successfully eradicated in the manner in which it is being tackled now.  I appeal to the Minister to have a look at my suggestion. It may be belated, but better late than never.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitated to rise in order to give members of the Government Party an opportunity of contributing to the debate.  In any debate it is frustrating when a situation arises when three or four Deputies on one side have to rise, one after the other, because those sitting behind the Government do not appear to be in a position to say anything in support of the Government's policy.  The debate started badly because, after the Minister sat down, obviously an order was issued to Deputies sitting behind the Minister to keep out of the debate.  It took a courageous Corkman like Deputy Moher to break the barrier and make a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Moher, one began to understand why that prohibition was placed on Deputies sitting in the Government benches because some of his remarks were highly critical of the Minister's handling of the Department.  The limit was reached <Col N="1751" /> when his colleague, who likes to regard himself as a senior member, spoke a little while ago.  In the midst of the drivel we had to listen to for upwards of an hour, there was one clear statement which must attract the attention of the entire House.  Deputy Corry said he does not know what the Government's policy is in relation to agriculture.  If Deputy Corry makes a statement such as that, how can the people of the country be expected to know it?</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Loughman is in the House.  I thought he would avail of this opportunity to intervene following on his statement last week that the farmers were well off, that he would rise to prove how well off they are, and bring home to us the events which brought about this extraordinary prosperity which he claims they now enjoy. He was careful to put on record when Deputy Flanagan was speaking, that he did not say they were very well off, but that they were well off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that Deputy Flanagan was exaggerating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, he said they were well off.  If they are well off, having suffered a reduction of £17.4 millions in their incomes, I wonder how Deputy Loughman would describe their conditions at the time this Government assumed office? That figure of £17.4 millions does not take into account any changes in the costs of production since this Government assumed office and that is a facet of the whole situation with which I intend to deal.</P>
      <P>I contend that the most undesirable development in agriculture over the past two years was the increasing cost of production.  If I may, I should like to recapitulate the developments of the past decade.  In 1947, we had a situation where, far from being able to provide substantial exports to contribute to the country's wellbeing, we were not in a position to give the people resident in this country enough food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Butter was rationed.  Exports had reached an all-time low level.  We had to break through the long-established conservative attitude of the farmers, <Col N="1752" /> because over the years, they had grown so dispirited with the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government that they could not see the latent possibilities in the agricultural industry.  It was only after the change of Government in 1948, and the enactment of the 1948 Trade Agreement, that the latent possibilities in the agricultural industry were brought home to the farmers. It was no easy task for the inter-Party Government of the time to inspire the farmers and bring them to a realisation of the capabilities of their holdings.  It was only after they had enjoyed the substantial increase secured for their livestock that they began to invest in the improvement of their holdings and their homesteads. It was only after the farm improvements scheme had been introduced and developed, after rural electrification had been extended on the widest scale, after soil testing had got under way, and after an expansion in advisory services, that it became possible to record a growing volume of exports with the concomitant higher standard of living those exports made possible.</P>
    <P>What was the position on the advent of this Government?  This Government were presented with a situation which they said they found embarrassing; they had inherited a number of agricultural surpluses.  But they did not have the headaches of the Government who came into office in 1948.  Nevertheless, they told us they were embarrassed by the surpluses they had to look after.  What a change! All this Government had to do over the past two years was to find markets for the goods our people were producing.  They added to their difficulties in that respect by increasing the difficulties of the primary producer in adding to his costs of production.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the methods they so mistakenly adopted in bringing about that situation.  First of all, they removed the food subsidies.  Speaking here on Social Welfare, the Minister for Social Welfare implied that great benefits accrue to the farmers whenever the cost of living goes up.  Let us examine the position from another point of view.  When food was subsidised <Col N="1753" /> in this country&mdash;let me emphasise, in this country&mdash;not alone was it subsidised to the consumer but it was also subsidised to the producer because it assisted the primary producer in our main industry in combating some of the difficulties with which he was faced.  The farmers had reached the zenith.  In the south, there was a challenge.  It was the challenge of margarine to Irish creamery butter.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government maintained the food subsidies.  They had also to find more money to subsidise other foodstuffs as they became available. They eliminated controls and restrictions.  They did away with rationing.  There is no doubt that the Minister for Finance of the day, and his Government, were faced with tremendous difficulties.  Nevertheless, they felt that by finding the money for the subsidisation of food, they were assisting the agricultural industry.  It is accepted by all that the highest consumer of Irish agricultural produce is the Irish consumer.  The Irish consumer is prepared to pay a higher price as compared with consumers in other countries, even despite their higher standard of living; but there is a limit to which the Irish consumer can go, and that is something this Government forget.</P>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government returned to office in 1954, having criticised the preceding Government for partially reducing the food subsidies, the first step they took was to contribute towards a reduction in the price of butter, thereby assisting the consumer from the point of view of the cost of living, and the health of the people by making it possible for growing children to be provided with a sufficiency of good food, such as butter.  That Government protected the dairying industry against the growing challenge of margarine.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, on the advent of the present Government, a different policy was adopted.  The Government proceeded to do what they had said they would not do: they proceeded to abolish the subsidies on food.  It was indicated to the people that this abolition was really effecting a saving.  The plain fact is that people now have to meet expenditure far in excess of the <Col N="1754" /> level of expenditure they had to meet when this Government assumed office. At the same time they have to find the increased cost of maintaining the household.</P>
    <P>The Government, as a public employer, and private employers throughout the State, by one means or another &mdash;either by additional taxation, a higher levy of rates, an increased cost for the goods and services which the private sector provides&mdash;have had to find the money necessary to pay increased salaries and increased wages to organised labour.  All that was a consequence of the Government's action in abolishing the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know what was done to ease the situation for those engaged in the primary industry. According to the Central Statistics Office, there has been a reduction of £17.4 millions in the incomes of the agricultural community.  Urban dwellers generally are inclined to consider themselves as the only people affected by an increase in the cost of living; they appear to think that everybody engaged in agriculture is in a position to provide all the food he requires.  That, of course, is far removed from fact.</P>
    <P>The cost of living hits the people in the rural areas just as hard as it hits the people in the urban areas.  It hits the people in the lower income group far more heavily than it hits those with higher incomes.  People had increases in salaries consequent on the increase in the cost of living.  I claim that some of them&mdash;I have said this before &mdash;were not much affected at all by the increase in the cost of living.  They enjoy meat three times a day.  An increase in the price of bread and butter does not affect them very much.  The people really affected are those who look on bread and butter as part of their diet at every meal.</P>
    <P>Despite the contention that the farmers are all well off, can we say, reviewing the position of the agricultural community at the moment, whether anything at all has been done to ease the burden on them of the higher cost of living?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the increase in the cost of milk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1755" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to it. The Deputy would appear to have taken his cue from his senior, his senior for whom he so often acts as acolyte. The Tánaiste would imply this is a wonderful increase.  There is no doubt that many people who have to pay the tenpence per lb. increase in the price of butter are under the impression that it is conferring a great benefit on the dairy farmers, and there are as many dairy farmers in Deputy O'Malley's constituency as there are in mine.</P>
      <P>Recently we heard a very frank statement by the Taoiseach in this House, a statement which was completely at variance with that of Deputy Loughman last week.  It was to the effect that, while other sections of the community had secured higher incomes, the position of the agricultural industry was causing him some concern. Arising from this admission, there was a feeling in the country that the Government were about to do something dynamic to improve the position of people engaged in agriculture, but what has happened?  We find a lower consumption of butter than the country has ever experienced. We find it being smuggled back over the Border-surely an extraordinary situation to develop?  We find that because of the increase in the price of flour by 3/7 a stone a situation has arisen, as admitted by those engaged in the milling industry, in which there is a sharp fall in the consumption of bread and consequently, a fall in the consumption of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances we were led to believe that the Government were about to produce something that would considerably ease the lot of those people and it was announced that all consumers, be they farmers, industrial workers, or people living on private incomes, would be called upon to pay threepence a lb. more for butter, again widening the gap between the price of butter and that of margarine and, unfortunately, making it imperative for too many homes to displace Irish creamery butter from their tables and substitute margarine.  This has arisen out of the Government's direct action; yet we are told that the increase of <Col N="1756" /> 1? pence to the dairy farmer is a substantial one.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy O'Malley might inquire from the co-operative creameries in County Limerick, as I have done from creameries with which I am familiar, what proportion of this 1? pence has reached the milk suppliers because we do know that, in company with so many other industries, costs have risen in creameries.  Staffs have had to get increased wages, and quite a substantial part of the increase of which I speak has been absorbed by the creamery industry itself to help meet the increased cost of running creameries.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley will recall that, since this Government resumed office, a new technique has been adopted to relieve the Minister for Finance of the embarrassment of having to find moneys to meet the sale of excess agricultural products&mdash;the technique of placing a levy on the industry which has done what this and successive Governments asked it to do, namely, to produce more.  We have found that, having produced more, a levy was placed on milk, but in consequence of the Government's failure to maintain increased production this levy was not imposed for a time.  Production fell considerably last year and no doubt the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme contributed to that. There were many other factors as well but, even though the levy of one penny a gallon was removed, this was far less than was promised the dairy farmers in the course of the general election when they were led to believe that they would get an increase of as much as threepence in the price of milk.</P>
    <P>Far from getting an increase they found that a levy of one penny a gallon was imposed, reducing the price which obtained at the time this Government came into office.  This levy was to be devoted to the subsidisation of surplus butter whereas the Government previously in office found that money from the national Exchequer.  Now the industry that worked too hard, produced too much and did its job too well, is to be discouraged <Col N="1757" /> from working too hard in future.</P>
    <P>During the course of the local elections campaign, I tabled a Question asking the Minister for Agriculture what the Government's intentions were in relation to the levy, whether it was to be imposed this year, and how much it would be, and the Minister adroitly answered, not saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley says that is not the reason but, even though it was during the middle of the local elections campaign, the Minister did not say he was not going to reimpose the levy.  So we can take it that, as well as having the 5/9, more or less, which the Minister states he is to impose on the wheat growers, we could have a reimposition of the penny a gallon, more or less, on dairy farmers, before this year is out.  If that is the case then I want to know from the Minister, from Deputy O'Malley and from the Tánaiste&mdash;who considers the delegates attending the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis are country bumpkins&mdash; what is the dramatic something done since the last Budget to improve the lot of the agricultural community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument that I have advanced so far has not taken into account any increases in production costs since this Government came into office.  There is a duty imposed upon the Minister for Agriculture in any Government to ensure that nothing is done by the Government which would make it more difficult for farmers to produce agricultural goods.  In that respect I wonder what part had the Minister&mdash; mind you, he is a former Minister for Local Government and must have been quite familiar with what was occurring&mdash;in the Government decision some few months ago to levy <Col N="1758" /> £100,000 taxation on vehicles transporting milk to creameries and bringing agricultural goods to markets? That was another difficulty created for farmers and another reduction in their incomes by deliberate action of the Government.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture has any voice at all, or is allowed to open his mouth, it is surprising that he did not succeed in bringing it to the notice of his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and his other colleagues, that this was putting another burden on the backs of the primary producers in this country.  It may seem a small thing but it is the accumulation of such taxation down through the years that has brought us to the position of finding it so difficult even to hold our own in foreign markets where others are successfully competing with us, and when others have succeeded in pinching some of the markets we heretofore enjoyed.</P>
    <P>Instead of assisting the farmers to produce more economically we find greater obstacles are being created and put in their way.  That is a most disturbing factor and it has been particularly noticeable over the past year.  It is also true that following on the abolition of the food subsidies, despite the difficulties that may arise for agriculturists and any circumstances that may warrant any increase to them in the price of goods they produce, the fact that there is no buffer between the producer and the consumer means that you will have an energetic consumer voice which will be clamant in ensuring that no further burdens are added to that sector considering that the cost of living has already risen so alarmingly.</P>
    <P>Still another repercussion of the Government's policy has been to eliminate the buffer which existed, giving that bit of give and take which made it possible for the Government to come to the assistance of the farming community without adding to the trouble of the consumer.  Again, that was removed.  It means now that no matter what difficulty may arise for the farmer, if anything is done to increase his income there will be an immediate outcry from consumers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> In company with Deputy Moher and, for once, Deputy Corry, I must ask the Minister what sense was there in importing maize and exporting feeding barley?  Although both of those Deputies were critical of the Government's action they did not advert to the fact that the mistake was made long before this year.  The mistake was made when this Government encouraged the siting of storage at the ports.  What had they in mind then?  Apparently, they had not fully realised the potentiality of feeding barley and the policy advocated by Deputy Dillon of walking it off the land.  They were still living in the era in which you had to import the grain necessary to feed livestock.  It was unfortunate that the investment of so much capital in storage sites at ports was encouraged.  That would appear to be one of the reasons for this movement in and out.  I doubt if it was to facilitate the shipping companies, as Deputy Corry claimed.  Certainly, there were interests anxious to see that their money was not poured down the drain since they had been encouraged to site their storage in such locations.</P>
    <P>I want to join with other Deputies in referring to the delay in the payment of farm improvement grants.  We are led to believe that money is freely available in many Departments of State to give encouragement to this, that and the other thing.  But far from there being a loosening, there seems to be a tightening up in the payment of grants to farmers carrying out such laudable work as the improvement of their land and their farmyards.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have spoken of the really great task facing us in the elimination of bovine tuberculosis. There has been considerable concern, particularly in the south of Ireland, at the lack of progress in the elimination of this disease.  Despite Deputy Barry's feeling&mdash;he may be a voice alone and there was a lot of sense in what he said regarding this whole business of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis &mdash;once Britain, our best customer, decided to get rid of it, we had no option but to do likewise.  The regrettable thing is that no progress was made in the period 1951 to 1954 <Col N="1760" /> towards commencing the scheme. There was gross neglect then and to make up that leeway is one of the most difficult tasks facing the country.</P>
    <P>There should be more supervision of the veterinary staff.  I do not say that in any sense derogatory of the veterinary profession.  In fact, I have heard members of the profession state that the fact they are thrown so much on their own, that there are not sufficient officers to carry out a proper check of the work done, is placing too great a burden on them and they are obliged to have a super-rigidity of conscience. The regional offices also seem to be understaffed.  The office in Mallow is most efficient and is in the charge of a really excellent officer.  But it would be humanly impossible for that man to cover the immense area for which he is responsible.  That is an aspect of the scheme which should be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I also heard recently that in the registration of shorthorn herds in the South no question was asked relative to the condition of these cattle <i>vis-a-vis</i> the bovine T.B. eradication scheme, and registration was granted without a question being asked.  It was certainly regarded by the herd owners as extraordinary, in view of the losses they had suffered and the efforts they were making to eliminate the disease, to find that there was no proper cooperation within the Department itself.</P>
    <P>One other thing which is of concern in the south of Ireland is the indiscriminate erection of cattle marts.  It is private enterprise, but just as President Cosgrave had to intervene in the early days of the State to save the creamery industry, the time is approaching when somebody will have to intervene in this matter of the erection of cattle marts and ensure that people will not lose a lot of money.  We know the capital involved and the expense incurred in the operation of marts.  If they are to be erected indiscriminately, a situation will be created where one will be drawing so much off the other, that their continued existence will be uneconomic.  I know of instances where this has occurred <Col N="1761" /> already.  This is a matter well worth the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <P>In relation to the advisory services, I claim we have not yet sufficient staff to meet the demand for them.  Some Deputies who spoke on the Government side, Deputy Moher in particular, sought to put across the view that there was duplication of services when Deputy Dillon launched his proposal for parish agents.  We know of many Departments of State in which there is duplication of services.  Were it not for the action of the Government and the Minister of the day, the committees of agriculture would never have wakened up to the duty of providing these staffs.  However, these committees were faced with the important limitation that the rates would have to bear the cost of these officers.</P>
    <P>To summarise, I wish to express dissatisfaction at the conditions prevailing in agriculture today.  Those engaged in that industry have to work long hours.  They have none of the advantages of the limitation of hours of people engaged in industry.  Yet they seek no more than those engaged in other walks of life.  All they seek is a comparable standard of living on a comparable income.  They have been as much affected as anyone else by increases in the cost of living; yet we find from the Government's own returns that they have not secured any compensatory increase in income.  In fact, the situation has now developed where they have many millions less income than they had 12 months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this Estimates has, as usual, ranged over many topics and, as I think I said on the last occasion when the Estimates was before the House, it is not my intention to take up all the points raised or the suggestions offered or reply to all the criticisms levelled.  There is, however,  one subject to which a number of Deputies referred, a subject which one hears discussed wherever one goes and discussed, I am afraid I must say, by people who do not appear to have given any very serious thought to how it arises or has arisen.  However regrettable this tendency in movement of population may be there is nothing to be gained by just blandy describing some part of the countryside known to us and relating what is taking place there, without at the same time endeavouring to arrive at some conclusion as to the cause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am referring to the depopulation of certain parts of the country and indeed the movement of people not only from small-holdings in congested and semi-congested areas but from small-holdings everywhere.  Some time ago, I made it may business to look at and compare tendencies in the six north-eastern counties with our own experience and, to my astonishment, notwithstanding British policy and support for agriculture, I found that the movement away from small-holdings on poorer land in these parts <Col N="1764" /> was even greater than it is with us. I do not claim to have examined the positions in other lands but I am told that the tendency everywhere is the same.</P>
    <P>We may all regret this&mdash;as we do&mdash; but it is one thing to regret it and quite a different thing to find some means of solving the problem and checking the tendency.  If there is one thing that makes me tired, it is when I go to certain functions and find people discussing this subject at great length and usually they are people who themselves have abandoned the land and the occupation of those who live there.  I am not saying that everybody born and reared in the countryside automatically gets an opportunity of providing himself with a living on the land but many of those who are critical&mdash;rather aimlessly critical&mdash; are people who themselves have left the land and in many cases have ensured that their relatives are provided for in more pleasant surroundings.</P>
    <P>I think we must look at this regrettable fact that is staring us in the face it is a tremendously difficult thing&mdash; to put it mildly&mdash;to provide a living for a man and his wife, if he has a wife, and his family, if he has a family, on the small areas of land that we in our younger days knew would support families.  We know also that the standard of living is much higher now and that people who live in rural areas know that a higher standards is to be obtained elsewhere: we know that the natural human tendency is to go where the high standard will be provided.  As far as I can see, it is not an easy matter to ensure that the inclination will be otherwise.</P>
    <P>I think the State has made a reasonable effort all down the years and that it will be admitted that quite an amount of progress has been made in housing, in the provision of grants of one kind or another, not only for housing human beings but for housing animals; in the reduction of rates, meeting the major portion of the rates on all valuations under £20, and all the other attractions that have been provided by the taxpayers long years ago in order to stem the tendency that <Col N="1765" /> I suppose, even in those times, it was possible to foresee might develop.  I do not think that sort of discussion, whether inside or outside the House, is in any way helpful if we are genuine in our desire to curb this tendency.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to points made in the course of the debate, I shall deal with some other general matters.  There was a discussion on barley and barely prices.  I want to confess quite openly that a matter that some people, even Deputies, would seem to make light of, is to me a most difficult problem. If you were to cater for the wishes of Deputy Corry and other Deputies on every side of the House who think of barley as a cash crop, the price would be much higher than it is, but when one considers barley as being both a cash crop and a crop that is converted into food which to some extent has to be sold abroad in a competitive way, an entirely different situation arises.  I certainly have no desire that feedingstuffs should be imported unnecessarily. I long for the day when we could devise means by which we could give reasonable support to our land owners who grow barley as a cash crop and which would at the same time relieve us of the necessity to have the controls that result from giving a guaranteed minimum price for barley. Immediately that minimum price is given, even when it is regarded by those who want to grow barley solely as a cash crop as a low price, provision must be made for the purchase of the crop after the harvest at the price which has been announced.  Once you do that, you have to provide the organisation; you have to select the means by which you will do it.</P>
    <P>I have seen this task being undertaken by a semi-State body and I have seen the result which, no matter how you tried, you could not explain to the man who feeds barley or other feedingstuffs to animals.  You could not explain the reason why when Grain Importers purchased barley at, say, £20 per ton after the harvest, by the following spring, April, May, June, they were selling the same barley to the components for £27 and £28 a ton. I often tried to explain how that came about.  I tried to do so in this House <Col N="1766" /> on a few occasions.  Maybe it was that the Deputies concerned did not want to understand, but I did try to explain and could not.</P>
    <P>Of course, when you named the organisation to do the job of work, that organisation had to rely on the buyers of grain and those who had storage accommodation all over the country. They authorised these people to purchase the grain at a price fixed, to dry, and store it, to turn it, bag it and all the rest of it.  Every move these handlers of the barley made, every £ they invested, all the interest they paid on the capital necessary to enable them to make the purchases and to provide themselves with the organisation to dry and store the barley was added up and by the springtime of the following year, the price, which was £20 after the harvest, worked out at £27 to £28, or perhaps a little more.</P>
    <P>These are some of the difficulties that have to be contended with in implementing the wise policy of encouraging our people to provide as much coarse grain as we require.  The difficulty must be guarded against that in the process you do not make the feedingstuffs so expensive as to make it impossible for people to do business on anything approaching a competitive basis.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that there was nothing that would please me better than to find a means by which we could give the necessary support and encouragement to our own people to grow barley, while at the same time giving the maximum amount of freedom to merchants and others engaged in the provision of feedingstuffs, so that as a result of noninterference by the Government and Department feedingstuffs would be produced and sold at the lowest possible price.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would secure acceptance by those who have the narrow view as to the purpose which should be served by the growing of barley but anyone in the office of Minister for Agriculture must have regard to the two interests.  It is not because I happen to represent a constituency <Col N="1767" /> where the amount of imported feedingstuffs used is as great as in any other part of the country; having regard to size and population, it is not because that is their interest and largely their way of life that I would be influenced as regards the desirability of a national policy, consistent with the outline I have given, to grow all the feedingstuffs that we could grow.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to wheat but the problem is not quite the same. I see no point whatever in our producing more wheat than we determine from time to time we shall use in the production of our daily bread.  So long as we decide to make flour with 75 per cent.  Irish wheat, we should aim at growing the amount of wheat that will enable us to keep that flour mixture. The difficulty is that when the acreage in a normal year to give that requirement is exceeded there is no means of disposing of the surplus except to sell it for feeding to animals.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy spoke on the much-discussed levy on wheat and said that it was my intention to introduce another system next year.  I made no such announcement.  I have been anxious for a long time to see if there was any other means by which we could have our wheat requirements grown so that unlike last year we would not have too little and, unlike this year, we would not have too much. Last year having regard to the national requirements we were under-supplied, although it was a splend year for wheat, and this year the indications are that we shall probably have too much.</P>
    <P>There is no simple way of devising some sort of contract scheme by which the acreage likely to give the required amount of wheat would be grown. Such a scheme might be open to all sorts of abuses, but it is certainly not a useless occupation to strive to devise some scheme that would meet that sort of situation.  No real national purpose can be served by growing wheat in excess of the quantity the Government determine from time to time as the national requirements.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the bacon industry.  I was astonished to hear <Col N="1768" /> some Fine Gael Deputy recommend very enthusiastically the nationalisation of the bacon business.  We are about to introduce a marketing organisation to dispose to greater advantage of whatever surplus bacon is produced and I imagine it does not make their task easier when the business is privately owned and operated.  At the same time nationalisation of this or any other business would be the last resort with me.  It is a matter that has not been discussed by me with any of my colleagues and what I am expressing now is an individual opinion.  There are times when nationalisation is essential but it would be difficult to convince me that any business run by a central, semi-State board would be more successful than safe family concerns.</P>
    <P>As I think I have indicated in the House in reply to Parliamentary Questions, we are about to introduce a marketing system for the bacon industry. If we get the right kind of board it will probably do good.  There would be many difficulties and while up to a point I have great faith in private enterprises and private interests, I think that bacon is the one case where the marketing committee was clearly entitled to recommend the establishment of such an organisation.  If the marketing committee had not been there at all, the chances are that we would have taken action along these lines before now but since the marketing committee was there, it would be unfair for us to take steps prior to our hearing their views on the subject.</P>
    <P>The question of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, to which I referred at length in the course of my speech, was raised by quite a number of Deputies.  I was not here when Deputy Barry made his contribution and perhaps other Deputies, in my absence, gave expression to similar views.  Seeing that there is and has been all along, with the exception of a single mind here and there, complete agreement as to the wisdom of endeavouring to complete this task as quickly as possible, I do not think it serves any useful purpose for a Deputy to throw cold water on these efforts. It is difficult enough to get our people to become as keen and as keyed-up as <Col N="1769" /> would be desirable without saying anything that might encourage them to remain or to become lackadaisical.  I want to assure Deputies who addressed themselves to this question and who were critical, as they are entitled to be, of the plans we have made and are following, that in spite of the other important questions which are the concern of my Department, there is no question the consideration of which would claim the same amount of time in relation to ideas and criticism from whatever source they came.  I have had in the Department for quite a long time an organisation for dealing with the problem which is as good as you would get even in the best-organised commercial concern.  It is almost perfect. If we receive the co-operation to which we are entitled, I know of no reason why we should not complete this task surprisingly quickly, having regard to the difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to be gained by saying we did not start in time.  I know we did not.  If we did not, it was because many of our people were slow and hesitant even up to the last day.  Nothing could more clearly demonstrate that fact than the rush of applications for accreditation that reached my Department when finally the hand fell and there could be no exports to Great Britain and the Six Counties except of 14-day tested and accredited cattle.  Quite a lot of herd owners then rushed about wildly to have their herds accredited.  They thought the Department of Agriculture, which was short of veterinary staff, should be on tap to carry out the inspections for accreditation.  One would be surprised at the negligence of some people and how critical they can be when they suddenly come to life and realise the opportunities if somebody is not standing by to come to them immediately they crack their fingers.</P>
    <P>The western area scheme has been criticised.  The southern scheme of six counties, five Munster and one Leinster, has been considered of doubtful wisdom.  Having had discussions with outsiders, with Deputies, with public men, with farming organisations, with my officials, I am satisfied we have a <Col N="1770" /> splendid organisation now and that with unstinted co-operation, we shall achieve very satisfactory results.  There is a type of co-operation which is not the wholehearted type from which one gets results and it is not sufficient here. It is not obstruction.  It is a sort of dead and alive co-operation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the details of the matter.  I have notes here which would enable me to deal with some of the points and to give explanations on some of the questions asked, but I do not think it necessary.  One Deputy referred to the urgency of the matter and said that if it is a question of money, the Government should float a loan.  I have not been hampered in any way, within reason, as a far as money is concerned.  Even with all the generosity of the Government and the Minister for Finance, we cannot resolve this difficulty by money alone.  It is helpful and indeed vital.  Generous treatment of those whose animals are being purchased in one way or another is necessary.  However, this difficulty cannot satisfactorily be resolved without unstuited co-operation and the enthusiasm I have tried to depict.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked what I meant by claiming that I have compulsory powers in the clearance area.  I have powers of all kinds in relation to the exposure of animals at fairs and the type of cattle that will be permitted into the clearance area.  I have power to oblige a man to have his cattle tested and to dispose of reactor animals.  We have not had many prosecutions although we have had some in relation to illegal movement of cattle.  A number of prosecutions are pending, possibly in relation to other matters.  We did not find it necessary to use these compulsory powers and we were not anxious to use them. When we come to the end of the road in any area or county, there may be a residue of stubborn people who will not line up and do their duty and against whom these powers may ultimately have to be used.  They are there and if they were not used, it was because in the great majority of cases there was no need to use them except in regard to illegal movement and so on.</P>

      <P>The Minister speaks in an amorphous way of a lack of that kind of co-operation without which results cannot be had.

      <P>We have set out in our advertisements and in other ways all the different things that a herd owner can do to protect himself, to protect his interests and enable us to get along with the work.  I am hopeful that they will see the wisdom of doing that now.</P>
      <P>Some mention was made of the movement of staff, that is, the taking of staff from land reclamation and other work sometimes for the purpose of the purchase and removal of reactor cattle.  That has taken place all right because we could not find any other way of doing so.  The men called upon were men with some knowledge and experience.  It is not always possible to rush off and recruit men when you want them.  We have made some inroads on the outdoor officers employed on those schemes.  I was very relucant to do so because if you interfere with a man in his normal work, the chances are that that interference has a demoralising influence on his work.  When he goes back to that work, he possibly will not settle down in the same way to it.  He will probably assume that he may be taken away from it again.  The percentage of the total number of these people called upon is very small. We are hoping we will reach the stage when it will not be necessary to make these inroads on these staffs.  I think it is bad myself.  I have explained, and I think my officials understand, my attitude on the matter.  I feel that it contributes to a form of demoralisation in their normal work and it would be better in every way if it could be avoided.</P>

    <P>I was asked some questions about the seed potato trade by, I think, Deputy MacEoin.  He asked me to explain how it was that the growers in Athlone were not able to secure the <Col N="1772" /> same prices as prevailed apparently in Donegal.  As far as I understand, the varieties grown in Athlone are varieties grown not for export but for the home market.  Most of the Donegal business is for export.  They are an entirely different variety.  It is true that some years the Donegal people have the advantage because of the circumstances outside.  It is also true, in my opinion, that some years the advantage would rest with people like the Athlone producers who grow for the home market.  I do not think there is any means by which you can mend that matter.</P>
    <P>The question of the marketing of ware potatoes was raised by Deputy Sweetman.  It nearly always happens, as happened on many occasions previously, that when we had a good crop of potatoes, the people across the water had a good crop of potatoes, more than they required.  Not only that but in other lands, the same story could be told.  The difficulties which arise in securing markets in those circumstances are great.  However, the Potato Marketing Company did not do so badly, having regard to all the circumstances. They sold the potatoes in Spanish territories, Portugal, Algeria, the West Indies and Sweden.  The quantity could have been far greater if the opening were there for them, but it just was not there.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy MacEoin who asked about the Agricultural Institute. He asked me to give an account of their activities.  I have no responsibility for the activities of that body.  I take it that they will publish a report at the end of the year and that that report will be available to every Deputy and the public at large.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the suggestion that they were short of money ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked a Parliamentary Question on that matter the other day.  All I can say is that they have obtained from us a grant of £400,000 in the current year.  In addition, they have income from capital funds amounting to over £1,000,000. The combined result works out at their having £250,000 more than was <Col N="1773" /> made available during the year 1958-1959.  That is not too bad, I think.</P>
      <P>The question of lime subsidy was raised by Deputy Sweetman.  He drew attention to the fact that the provision in the Estimate was so much less than last year.  The provision in the Estimate this year is less but the excess over requirements last year was £188,000 and he present provision is based on the usage of 1,200,000 tons. For some reason that I cannot really understand, there has been some slight tendency towards a fall off in the use of lime.  It is not a very noticeable one but there has been a tendency in that direction.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies would attribute that falling off to the reduction in the subsidy. I do not know what is responsible for it but let me say that I heard a number of people engaged in the industry say that if the farmers expect to get lime delivered and distributed on the land for less than £1 a ton, unless you give it to them for nothing, it is very hard to see what more they could expect.  If it is not worth £1 a ton distributed on the farmers' land, I should feel that you might as well throw up your hands and say they just do not want it.  One of these producers of lime thought that it was in fact too cheap.  It was at a period when there was a steep fall because the weather was very bad and he felt the impact of that fall.  He was of the opinion that farmers and landowners had lost confidence in it because it was so cheap.  However, as I say, the provision this year's designed to cover a distribution of 1,200,000 tons and if it should prove necessary to seek a larger amount, if the distribution of lime should exceed that quantity, I have no doubt the money will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman asked me why there should be an increase in the amount of subsidy for superphosphate. The main reason is that the home capacity for superphosphate has increased considerably and a very big increase in the sales of home superphosphates is anticipated for the coming year.  It is expected that we shall <Col N="1774" /> be virtually self-sufficient in superphosphates in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the questions of progeny testing and I shall read the note which I have here:</P>
    <P>Bovine progeny testing started in 1955 with five recorders employed by the A.I. and two cow testing Instructors from this Department.  Information from this source and from cow testing associations was all the data up to 1959.  This was very limited and was of very little use towards testing bulls.  In 1959 with the aid of a grant from the Department testing was started on a larger scale.  In the spring of that year 23 recorders were put in the field, and as a result of their work under many handicaps, ten shorthorns bulls and three Friesian bulls were fully tested for milk, seven shorthorn bulls were satisfactorily tested and 20 shorthorn and 12 Friesian bulls were partially tested.</P>
    <P>This year, 1960, there are 25 recorders working.  Negotiations are in progress between the A.I. bodies cow testing associations, and the Department to reorganise milk recording in such a way that as many bulls as possible will be tested each year.  It is hoped through this scheme to be in a position fully to test every dairy bull standing at an A.I. centre.</P>
    <P>In addition to above a start was made at a number of the A.I. centres with farms attached, to evaluate the progeny of dairy bulls for beefing quantities.</P>
    <P>In the spring of 1958, dropped calves the progeny of 14 bulls&mdash;nine shorthorn and five Friesians&mdash;were taken on to the farms.  They are being retained till they are fat, when they will be slaughtered, and an evaluation made on the carecse.  The cattle are being weighed monthly and their rate of progress recorded.</P>
    <P>In 1960 dropped calves the progeny of 10 bulls (6 Shorthorn and 4 Friesian) were taken on the A.I. farms for testing.</P>
    <P>No testing was done in the Sligo A.I. area till 1959 (except through <Col N="1775" /> cow testing associations) when one recorder was appointed.  He took up duty in July in the Donegal area, and results of his work will not be available till the end of this year (1960).</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Jones why the grants towards agricultural schools seemed to be low.  The decrease in grants in schools is due to the fact that in previous years Estimates included large sums for specific capital projects &mdash;buildings which have now been completed.</P>
    <P>There is another note here on pig progeny testing about which Deputy Dillon asked for informations and which reads:</P>
    <P>In the selection of premium boars the results of progeny testing and litter recording are considered.  At the moment no boar is eligible for a premium if the breeder of such a pig has not been litter recording, and if the dam has not been litter recorded.  Preference is given to the sons of progeny tested boars where they are available.  However, if a progeny tested boar has done badly on test his sons will not be considered for premium purposes.</P>
    <P>Progeny testing gives informations on the performance of sows for characteristics influencing carcase quality.  In the selections of breeding stock every effort is made to select future stock from sows that have done well on progeny tests.  In this way it is possible to tie up the selections of boars using progeny test results on both male and female lines.</P>
    <P>The results of progeny testing to date have shown very few outstanding boars.  So far only three really good boars have been tested.  The greatest weakness in our pigs is carcase length.</P>
    <P>In order to speed up the use of progeny test results, and combine litter recording with progeny testing, a pig accreditation scheme will be introduced on the first of next August.  The scheme will give a complete tie up of all results obtained through both schemes and it will help to identify the outstanding <Col N="1776" /> pig herds of the country.  When this has been achieved it is proposed to multiply the desirable strains rapidly and eliminate the undesirable strains.  This scheme will be the basis for the selections of premium boars in the future.</P>
    <P>A lot of play has been made of the fall in agricultural income in, 1958-59.  I think we had quite a discussion on this last year.  Anything I may say now on this I do not intend as a defence either of the Department of Agriculture or of myself.  I am just dealing with the argument <i>qua</i> argument, because, whether in this House or outside it, I should regard it as childishness to think that anybody can be fooled by that kind of talk or by the idea that a Minister for Agriculture is obliged to defend such a argument, which seeks to describe the conditions that prevailed in 1958 or 1959 and, listening to the Deputies opposite, would compare everything with 1957, and would not dream of going back to 1956.  I do not think all those wise men who, as I say think they are fooling someone with such antics, know their own people.</P>
    <P>Anyone with common sense, and every farmer in the wide earthly world, knows that in a summer like last summer you could not expect to get the same volume of milk from your cows as you could get in a more normal year from the point of view of grass.  Every farmer in the world would be able to understand why it was that last year was an excellent grain-producing year.  Similarly, every farmers would be able to tell you why, and in what way, 1959 was different from 1958.  He would be able to tell you that 1957 was a balanced year for everything, and he would be able to tell you that 1956 was really worse than any other year.</P>

      <P>The public will just think in terms that they are Deputies of the Fine Gael Party who are trying politically to commercialise factors over which they, the Deputies of the Fine Gael Party, the Minister for Agricultural or the Government, have no control in the wide earthly world. I think it was last year I heard Fine Gael Deputies talking about the cattle trade.  They talked about turkey prices last year also and they were entitled to in the sense that turkey prices were very bad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that if they went back to the figures in 1956 for both cattle and turkey prices, they would see a tremendously different picture.  I have here the cattle prices for 1956, 1957, 1958, and 1959, and at no time since 1956 were cattle prices so low.  It would be complete stupidity on, my part to attempt to say that my predecessor.  Deputy Dillon, was responsible for that, because he could not do a single solitary thing about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is putting words in my mouth now.  If I said any such thing, I should like to have my attention drawn to it, and to where I said it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Giles talked about a common policy.  I was not here for all his speech but one point made by him was the desirability of a common agricultural policy.  There is one thing on which we can agree, that is that, in so far as we have goods for sale on the outside markets of the world, and in so far as we can enter those markets to sell those goods, we have to sell them on a competitive basis through whatever organisation which may be designed to give the necessary supports and encouragements.</P>
      <P>In September, 1956, there was nothing the then Minister for Agriculture could have done to prevent the prices of store cattle from falling to 96/6d. per cwt.  When the following Christmas the bottom fell completely and absolutely out of the market for turkeys, he could do nothing about it either. Deputy Dillon or any other member of the Opposition can no longer get away with the idea that they could induce anyone outside the shores of this country to give them better terms for whatever produce we have to sell than those Governments decided it is in their interests to give us.</P>
      <P>There are many such facts which we have to face, and whatever we may do, or whatever we may say, we should not resort to the sort of extravagantly depressive speeches which have been made&mdash;for examples, concerning the cattle trade.  If I made a claim here and if that claim were not in accord with the experience of people in this business outside, or not in accord with what they know to be the facts, they would laugh at me.  I shall not be laughed at and, therefore, I shall not claim that everything has been rosy so far as the cattle trade is concerned, but it is not as bad as some Deputies have described it.  I do not know much about it but I know a little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Donnellan, for example, talking about the cattle trade. Talk about extravagance in the use of <Col N="1779" /> language&mdash;it was just appalling! For the life of me, I do not know what purpose, personal or otherwise, any Deputy could hope to serve by such a contribution.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputies refer to the increase in the cattle population. As I have often said, of course, that is a very important contribution.  It is, in fact, what we have been striving for for years.  I have often expressed disapointment because our cow population seemed to be statics there might be a change of a few thousand as between one year and another but, on the whole, it seemed to be static between 1,200,000 and 1,250,000.  There is evidence now that our cattle population has increased, and increased substantially.  We all know that the cattle trade is full of hazards.  It has at all times had its ups and downs. When introducing the Estimate, I stated what the situation was as far as the store cattle trade was concerned, but I rounded the statement off by saying that, as far as I knew, and as far as those who were competent to judge were concerned, the position seemed to be safe and encouraging.</P>

I am far from deploring the fact that there is an increase in the cattle population, and particularly an increase in the number of cows and in-calf heifers.</P>

Apparently, as is usual in the case of that Party, they have completely misinterpreted the public mind. One thing that amazes me about the Fine Gael Party is the rapidity with which they forget why and how they went out of office in February, 1957. I suppose it is only natural they should try to forget.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked me this evening if there was any tendency to delay the payment of grants, or to withhold grants in my Department? I did not want to interrupt him then, but, had I felt myself free to interrupt at that point, I should have said: &ldquo;Thanks be to God, that day has gone, and gone for ever.  It is no longer necessary to sit on the bills.&rdquo; If the Fine Gael Party really want to know why it was they so mysteriously went out of office in 1957, having been three years in Government, having never been defeated, having a majority in this House, I have here before me three documents which clearly establish the reason they went out and the decision which followed their going out on the part of the electorate.</P>

We have supported the price of milk.  We have supported the price of bacon.  We have supported the price of wheat and the price of cattle, live and dead weight for export, and indeed for home consumption too.  We have relieved the rates on farm buildings erected by farmers now, and about to be erected in the years ahead.  We have introduced a subsidy on phosphates, potash and lime, and I have no doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimate, 1960-61. - Vote 47&mdash;Industry and Commerce.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,200,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 22nd March, 1960, the House agreed to a Supplementary Estimate&mdash; Vote 50, Industry and Commerce&mdash;of £300,000 to enable payment to be made to Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., Haulbowline, Co.  Cork, in respect of shares to <Col N="1791" /> the extent of £300,000 to be taken up by the Minister for Finance.  The money was made available to meet initial instalments to suppliers of new plant and in respect of other items connected with the expansion of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., which I outlined to the House at the time.  In brief, the Company's expansion plans envisage the installation of a new oil-fired furnace to bring ingot output to 80,000 tons p.a., the installation of a new 750 mm. blooming mill, a new 650 mm. large section mill a new wire-rod mill, the rearrangement and mechanisation of the existing merchant mill and the completion of the sheet mill.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the Government have decided that the project should be wholly financed by share capital to be subscribed by the Minister for Finance.  Arrangements are in train for the enactment of a Bill to give effect to this decision. As it has not been possible, however, for necessary legislation to be introduced in time to be passed before the Summer Recess, and as the £300,000 voted last March has all been expended, the provision of capital by means of a vote payment is necessary. To cover the additional expenditure of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd., until the end of December, 1960, a Supplementary Estimate is accordingly submitted to enable payments to be made to the Company in respect of shares to the extent of £1,200,000 to be taken up by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal which the Minister has put forward in order to facilitate Irish Steel Holdings with sufficient money to carry on the develment programme which he has outlined is one that will be supported generally. This project has for a long time been under consideration by the company and is part of the long term programme which was decided on by Irish Steel holdings some time ago. There is only one point that I should like to mention at this stage, that is, whether consideration, in an undertaking of this sort, would not be given to floating a public issue rather than <Col N="1792" /> having all the shares subscribed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Where a State company is concerned, once it is sufficiently established and its progress maintained on a regular basis, confidence should be adequate to undertake a public issue, if not for the entire shareholding, at any rate for a considerable part of it, and while this proposal in itself is desirable, it seems to me that in an undertaking such as this which is of considerable significance and the only undertaking of its type in the country, the fact that it already had State support guarantees the future prospects of the undertaking. For that reason, therefore, consideration might be given to floating, if not the whole undertaking as a public issue, certainly a proportion of the shares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister one question?  I know that the Bill is down for Second Reading.  I take it that it is proposed to take the Bill immediately after the Recess.  The Minister mentioned the 31st December next as the date appointed from the money point of view but I assume that the enactment of the Bill is aimed at long before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The drafting of the Bill is so near completion that one might say it is almost completely drafted at the present time.  As the Deputy is aware, there are quite a number of other Bills which have been put down for Second Reading on 26th October.  The idea behind seeking sufficient coverage for the expenditure of the company up to the end of December was to ensure that by reason of the volume of legislation that the House will face in the Autumn there will be no necessity to come to the House again with another Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be circulated, I hope, very early during the Recess and will be taken at the earliest opportunity that I get of bringing it before the House but I cannot say at this stage how soon that may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Cosgrave's question as to whether or not the money which is now sought to expand the Irish Steel industry in Haulbowline <Col N="1793" /> might not have been raised by floating a public issue, all I can say is that full regard was had to all methods and means of financing the expansionist proposals and it was found that the better way of doing it would be to finance it in the manner proposed in the Bill, that is, the issue of shares which will be taken up by the Minister for Finance except for a small allocation to the directors who will be appointed.  In time it might be possible to seek public subscription but at the moment it is considered that the better way of carrying out the proposals is the manner now proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £132,610 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, the Minister for Finance is being very sparing of words.  I thought we might hear from him a little indication of the manner in which he administered his Department during the past year.  In particular, I should like to hear from him in the light of the speech we have had a few minutes ago from the Minister for Agriculture, when the Minister for Agriculture alleged that in 1956-57 the then Minister for Finance paid out less money in farm building grants than was paid out last year.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance would explain to the House, as of course it is the Minister for Finance who is supposed to be the man best at figures in the Government, how £623,625 is more than £705,248 or, perhaps, to be more strictly relevant, he would take his colleague the Minister for Agriculture aside and teach him a lesson in arithmetic, in subtraction, <Col N="1794" /> because, in fact, of course, £705,248 is the amount that was paid out in that year about which the Minister was telling untruths a few minutes ago and, as I said by way of interjection then, at no stage in the past three years has the present Minister for Finance paid out as much money in grants.</P>
      <P>However, that is by way of an aside because I know full well that no matter how much the present Minister for Finance might try to teach mathematics to his colleague the Minister for Agriculture he would hardly succeed and he certainly would not succeed in getting him to tell the truth on that aspect.</P>
      <P>The present Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance shows an increase over last year of £26,735.  It is the job of the Minister for Finance, particularly, to show an example and to set a pattern to his colleagues in the Government.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance would give the House some explanation as to why he has not set that example as Minister for Finance and why he has not held his own Estimate within bounds.</P>
      <P>Are we to deal with each Vote individually, a Cheann Comhairle?  I am entirely in your hands.  There are certainly points that arise purely on the other votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>To take them all together is a better proposal and then they can be put individually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems rather inappropriate to deal with some of the Votes at the same time as the Finance Vote because they are so very, very different and, with all respect to you, Sir, I would suggest that it might be perhaps happier to take them one by one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case all I want the Minister for Finance to do when he is making in reply the speech that he did not make in opening is to tell the House why he failed in his duty to show an example to his colleagues by keeping his Estimate down, why he allowed it to rise £26,000 over last year.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I cannot let the occasion go without making a vehement protest against the manner in which the Minister for Finance during the past year has utilised both his power as a shareholder and his power as nominator in relation to certain State boards and companies.  I particularly refer to the National Stud, in my constituency. He has so mismanaged his powers in relation to that Stud that he virtually has on it now only one, or two people at most, who know anything about horses.  I know nothing whatever about one gentleman who is on it except that he has no knowledge of bloodstock.  Another gentleman is a turf vendor who has no knowledge of bloodstock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this relevant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister has the sole power of appointing the directors and has appointed these directors within the past year.  It was a matter purely of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a statutory function of the Minister to make those appointments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of his administration as Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a statutory function he has to carry out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But he has not to throw off people who have been there and put on new people.  The manner in which he has exercised administratively that function reflects no credit on himself and certainly no credit on the Government.  The leading bloodstock breeder in the country, the man who bred not merely a Derby winner but a Grand National winner, <Col N="1796" /> was thrown off by the Minister for Finance and the Minister did not even pay him the courtesy of writing the normal letter of thanks any Minister always writes to a director when he feels himself unable to reappoint him. The method by which that was done leaves everything to be desired and can only be described as pure graft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present and had not the benefit of listening to the Minister for Agriculture when he was giving figures in relation to farm grants but I am sure he was as accurate as he is accustomed to be in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!-which is not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it he gave the correct figures and I am not accepting the Deputy's criticism of those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>He was as accurate as he usually is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote is higher this year; in fact nearly every Vote that came before the Dáil was higher because, as Deputies are aware, there was a fairly substantial increase in pay to civil servants.  That is the biggest item, but there are, in addition, a few smaller Votes that appeared separately in other years but are taken into the Finance Estimate this year. For instance, one that appeared up to this was the Estimate under which the banks are remunerated for the management of Government stocks.  That no longer appears under a separate heading.  It was only a small amount involving a few hundred pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A few hundred pounds?  It is £70,420.  The Minister should be better at arithmetic than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Again that is wrong. It is an increase of £4,120.  That is bigger than a few hundred pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not very much different. I am not trying to exaggerate the position or say it made a big difference. The big difference was the increase in remuneration.  It is that which caused most of the increase in this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> In regard to the last point raised by the Deputy, I do not know to whom he referred as going off or to whom he referred as going on but I think he referred to a person appointed to the National Stud as having no knowledge of bloodstock.  As a matter of fact, he has.  He has had racehorses for many years&mdash;maybe not in a very big way, I admit, but at least he knows something about it.  There are always reasons why changes must be made in the board and every government has made changes in its turn.  We can I always criticise each other for making these changes but we can always defend our own position, too, in regard to any changes that may have been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might have had the courtesy to write and thank the man he put off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that that should have happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Page 1 of the Book of Estimates, we are given the true figures for the upkeep of this Establishment.  The figures given in that page are rather startling for the <Col N="1798" /> public in view of the situation at the present time.  To put it very briefly, this year to enable our Republican President to keep up the pomp and ceremony associated with the Empire and royalty days, will cost the taxpayers £54,198.  It may be possible for countries with vast resources, great and increasing populations to keep up high standards with regard to their leading figures but a small Republic like ours, a Republic that contains only portion of the nation, should not try to ape countries that are far better off.  There would be much greater respect for us abroad if we appeared in our true colours in regard to our means.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinary mentality which is displayed in Ireland that we as a nation must try to keep up with the Joneses, while our population is dwindling and 8 per cent.  of our people are unemployed.  If that sum of £54,000 were expended in the following way, it would be of tremendous benefit.  If that sum were allocated to the breadwinners of 100 families, we could afford to pay £10 a week to 100 families.  That is something that should be seriously considered. We have small towns in the west of Ireland where people are trying to eke out an existence and the very sum it costs to keep an individual in style would enable 600 people in such a town in the west of Ireland to keep their heads above water.  This spending is completely out of keeping with our circumstances.  It shows delusions of grandeur and all I can say is that those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office Vote which the Minister for Finance has to introduce but for which the Taoiseach is responsible contains a substantial increase.

I wonder if the Taoiseach, since his speech on the Budget, has taken the trouble to understand the meaning of statistics.  On the occasion in question, he announced he did not understand the meaning of the statistics issuing from his own Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister briefly to the substance of his replies to some questions I put during the year in regard to the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Particularly I have in mind his activity as auditor of semi-State bodies and companies.  This is a hardy annual.  Article 33 of the Constitution provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the control of the Oireachtas.  There are upwards of a dozen, perhaps more than a dozen, semi-State bodies, some of them companies registered under the Companies Acts, the annual accounts of which the Comptroller and Auditor General audits.</P>
      <P>The funds of State-controlled bodies by definition are not administered by or under the control of the Oireachtas. I suggest it is an undue extension of the activities of the Comptroller and Auditor General which constitutes an unwarranted intrusion on the autonomy of such bodies as Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus, Irish Steel Holdings and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bodies to which I have referred appoint the Comptroller and Auditor General under the Companies Acts. There is no compulsion on them to do so.  In a recent reply, the Minister made the case that a certain principle was at stake in this matter.  I do not think so but if there is such a principle, <Col N="1802" /> it is not consistently being applied. The E.S.B. and C.I.E. are among our leading semi-State companies but their accounts are audited by professional firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. P. Byrne Mr. P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I proceed, Sir? Very properly, we follow the British precedent in many matters affecting our financial administration.  I think the Act under which the Comptroller and Auditor General's Department is set up is, in fact, the old Exchequer and Audit Departments Acts, 1866. It is a British Act.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured to find out what is the practice in Britain in regard to these semi-State bodies.  They have many of them there.  I have not been able to find out about all of them but I can state for a fact that the accounts of the National Coal Board&mdash; one of the largest bodies of its kind in England are audited by a firm of professional accountants. The accounts of our analogous body here, Bord na Móna, are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Again, British European Airways and B.O.A.C. are audited by a leading firm of professional accountants, whereas our Aer Lingus and kindred companies are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I do not think it can be argued that there is any principle at stake in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other strong arguments as to why the Comptroller and Auditor General should not be permitted to intrude into these companies. I suggest that the national interest requires here the development of a flourishing and dynamic accountancy profession.  Our development in financial and commercial matters has, perhaps, been somewhat retarded but there are now signs of progress.  If many of our largest enterprises in the country are to be audited by a Civil Service department, the independent <Col N="1803" /> accountant is deprived of an avenue of employment which should be open to the members of that profession. These semi-State companies are here to stay.  We shall probably have more of them in the future.  I suggest that if we have, it would be most undesirable to follow the precedents laid down in the case of the companies to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The question of the Government's confidence in the accountancy profession arises in relation to this matter, the Minister's confidence in the professional integrity and professional competence of the members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants to which I have the honour to belong. If the Minister has no confidence in the profession, I would urge him to say so frankly and give us an opportunity of putting our house in order. If, on the other hand, he has confidence&mdash;and I believe he has&mdash;I would urge him to consider my pleading sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Comptroller and Auditor General is properly equipped to carry out the audits of commercial companies.  I want to emphasise that I do not wish at all to cast aspersions on his department&mdash; quite the contrary.  The staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General's department are highly skilled and highly specialised in a certain function &mdash;the audit of the Civil Service Supply and Central Fund finances.  In the course of questions which I asked during the year, I elicited the information that there are 44 members of the staff who are engaged in audit work, of whom only three are members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The audit of commercial companies is in itself a specialised field.  In particular, I feel that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not equipped to provide that ancillary advisory service which every good professional auditor provides in the course of his professional duties.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House at this stage.  I want to point to the fact that a year ago, when Deputy Dillon raised this point, the Minister was most sympathetic in his reply.  He said that he had an open mind on the <Col N="1804" /> matter.  I quote from the Minister's remarks at column 1513, Volume 176 of the Dáil Reports where he said:</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy I have an open mind and I would certainly consider sympathetically any application made to me for a change by any of those companies.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister at this stage if he still has an open mind on the matter and, if so, will he go a step further and indicate, say, to Aer Lingus, Irish Shipping, Irish Steel Holdings that he would not be adverse to their appointing a professional auditor when the reappointment of their present auditors comes up at their next annual general meeting.  If the Minister feels that he would be unable to do that, I suggest that he should carefully consider the question of appointing joint auditors&mdash;the Auditor General jointly with a professional firm.  The practice of appointing joint auditors to large companies is commonplace in Britain and in America simply because of the scale of the work.  It is a compromise which I would commend to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy Byrne in the case he made. I made it at some length last year.  I had long and intimate association with the department of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the years when I was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  It is unnecessary to affirm my entire confidence in the capacity, skill and care habitually shown by that department and by the various Comptrollers and Auditors General who have occupied that position during the years when I had intimate dealings with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Byrne that the Comptroller and Auditor General's department is not properly equipped to deal with commercial accounts.  I of course, know that from time to time the Comptroller and Auditor General took the precaution of inviting in consultant commercial accountants for the purpose of having the procedures of the division of his department which is responsible for this work reviewed so as to ensure that they are keeping up with the most modern practice.  I <Col N="1805" /> have little doubt that, as a result of such consultation, the department of the Comptroller and Auditor General have satisfied themselves that their procedures are as up to date and modern as those employed by any commercial firm but there is a lacuna which the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General can never fill.</P>
    <P>One of the most important functions a firm of commercial auditors can discharge for its client is to look at the picture presented by the balance sheet or the profit and loss account of a commercial enterprise at the end of the year and, without revealing the confidential information which the commercial firm has acquired, to say to its client: &ldquo;The result in your department&rdquo;&mdash;dealing with drapery, grocery, hardware or whatever it is&mdash;&ldquo;is manifestly, in our experience, inferior to what such a result ought to be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That gives the client a warning that there is some lack of efficiency or lack of diligence in the particular department which the auditor has reviewed on his behalf.  No auditor, however conscientious or dutiful he may be can discharge that essential function for a client if he is auditing only the accounts of one firm of that character in the course of his ordinary duties. Apart from the reasons set out by Deputy Byrne, when dealing with firms like Irish Shipping, which is unique in this country, we should have the advantage of a joint audit, that is to say have our own Irish firm in consultation with a firm of Norwegian or American or other country's auditors who would be familiar with our procedure but which would also have experience in dealing with other shipping firms so that that experience might be made available to the board of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>The same is true of Acr Lingus or any company here, particularly of a semi-State character which is unique in our economic set-up.  For without that basis of broad comparison between the performance of our company with that of companies in a similar line of business elsewhere, you are denied one very essential element <Col N="1806" /> which auditors should provide for their clients when they are called in for consultation. That is one point I want to make.  I agree, therefore, with almost everything that Deputy Byrne said although I am not competent to speak on certain professional aspects of the question to which Deputy Byrne referred as a member of the profession.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another point.  A strange reflection was cast upon the general performance of the Comptroller and Auditor General by the Minister for Agriculture when he was concluding.  He assured the House that in the years between 1955 and 1957, with particular reference to 1956/57, the payments in respect of grants under the Farm Building Scheme by the Department of Agriculture were held up because the Exchequer had no money.  He said that that day has long passed and how happy we are now. Deputy Davern is beaming there from his back seat thinking of speeches he made in days gone by in Timahoe on this subject.  But the facts are quite different.  If the Minister is correct, the Comptroller and Auditor General is incompetent and if the Comptroller and Auditor General is correct it would appear that the Minister is saying something which is untrue.</P>

He reports that in each of the years 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1957 more grants were paid and more money given to grantees in any of the those three years than in any of the three years since Fianna Fáil took office in 1957.  Both stories cannot be true.  Either the Comptroller and Auditor General does not know his business or the Minister for Agriculture is telling the House an untruth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounts of 12 bodies are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General under statute. When these bodies were set up the statute laid down that the Comptroller and Auditor General should do the job and these vary from An Bord Fáilte to the Central Bank and the National University, so that one can see the variation.  There are two where the Minister concerned, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, appointed the Comptroller and Auditor General; these are Bord Gaeltarra Éireann and Bord na Móna.  There are eight more, including Irish Shipping, where the bodies themselves asked to have the Comptroller and Auditor General do the accounts, so there is a very big variation not only in the method in which the Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed but in the experience that the Comptroller and Auditor General must have got from his work with these various bodies.  It is hardly realistic to suggest that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not equipped, or has not got the knowledge, to deal with these bodies.  I am sure there are few auditors in commercial practice who have such a wide and varied experience as the Comptroller <Col N="1808" /> and Auditor General has in dealing with these companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if any further consideration has been given to the proposal to make an aerial survey of this country. There are many aspects of that project to which I might refer.  It could serve a very useful purpose from the point of view of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Local Government.  I should like to refer particularly to its antiquarian value.  I have mentioned this on previous occasions but I should like to refer to it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country is reputed amongst archaeologists to be the greatest storehouse of archaeology in Europe.  For a variety of reasons, only a tithe of the archaeological sites have been discovered by peripatetic surveys.  An aerial survey has been made of one great archaeological site at Croghan in Roscommon.  An opportunity has been <Col N="1814" /> afforded, therefore, of comparing the picture presented by the aerial survey with that available from the peripatetic survey which, if the Minister wishes to refer to it is in the Department of Agriculture in the Land Project section.  He will see that the peripatetic survey revealed only seven archaeological sites at Croghan, and the aerial survey from a very cursory examination by archaeologists discerns somewhere between 30 and 40 of such sites.</P>
    <P>I believe the same situation would be reproduced in very many areas of the country if such surveys were undertaken, and the great danger is that unless such surveys are undertaken soon, a great many of those archaeological sites will be irretrievably lost.  Now, utilitarians may say: &ldquo;Surely you do not propose that all archaeological sites should be preserved forever?&rdquo; Of course I do not, but I do not think they should be destroyed without a proper archaeological investigation.  Once they have been investigated and reported, the vast majority will then pass into history. It is tragic to see a great wealth of archaeological material being annually dissipated because we do not know of its existence.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of this matter from the point of view of the Department of Defence, and, I believe, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture, which would strongly recommend the undertaking of an aerial survey.  However, suffice it to say that in addition to the other considerations which I now advance, an aerial survey has been undertaken of almost every other civilised country in the world and indeed a great many uncivilised countries.</P>
    <P>Such a survey is long overdue here. Our territory is eminently susceptible to it because it is confined and because our boundaries are clearly defined.  I invite the Minister to consider the not very substantial expenditure that would be involved in such an undertaking, and whether it is done by independent contractors or by the Irish Army, in consultation with the Ordance Survey, is probably a matter of indifference. It would not cost a lot of money and <Col N="1815" /> once done, it would be available forever and would provide a vast field on which archaeologists could work for some generations.  As I said, with the passage of every year the value of such a survey decreases as the things we seek to preserve are inadvertently destroyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say to the Minister that I think the case made last year by Deputy Dillon, and again briefly this year, deserves very careful consideration.  There is a very important survey going on at the moment.  It should be speeded up. The best type of survey in modern times is the aerial survey.</P>
      <P>We have had a number of suggestions put forward here recently with regard to the necessity for purchasing helicopters for various uses.  Here is a first-class use to which a helicopter could be put.  The cost of the helicopter need not necessarily be borne on this Vote because, if helicopters were in the possession of the State, they could be used for various purposes, such as training, ship-spotting, trawler-spotting within the three mile limit, life saving, and ambulance services. There is a tremendous variety of work on which they could be engaged.  At the moment the survey is being carried out in a very labourious fashion.  Heavy, precious equipment has to be carted up and down hills.  In every other country that I know of these surveys are now generally made by air.  I understand the helicopter would be ideal for this purpose.  I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to the suggestion.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £13,400 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1961, for a Grant to An Chomhairle Ealaíon (No. 9 of 1951).</P>
      <P>The report and accounts of An Chomhairle for the year ended 31st March last have been presented separately to the Oireachtas.  I am sure they have been studied by Deputies who are interested in the work of the Comhairle and that there is no need for me now to comment on them in detail.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware that the Right Reverend Monsignor Pádraig de Brún who was appointed on 1st November last to fill the then vacant post of Director of the Comhairle died last month.  His death was a very real loss to the nation and to Irish scholarship and, in a very particular way, to An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  Go ndeana Dia trochaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>Monsignor de Brún had, I know, some very definite ideas regarding the development of the activities of An Chomhairle and I had arranged to meet him, with the other members, to discuss these, prior to his fatal illness. Because of his death, that meeting did not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Reverend Donal O'Sullivan, S.J., who was formerly a member of An Chomhairle, has since been appointed Director.  In Father O'Sullivan we have, I think, another Director of outstanding qualifications and I am sure that An Chomhairle, under his guidance, will play an increasingly important rôle in stimulating <Col N="1817" /> interest in, and promoting knowledge and appreciation of, the Arts and in all the other purposes of An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>
    <P>The vacancy amongst the ordinary members, which was created by the appointment of Father O'Sullivan as Director, has been filled by the appointment of Dr. C.S. Andrews. Otherwise, the membership has remained unchanged.  I think I should tell the House that I told Father O'Sullivan, when discussing with him the matter of his nomination as Director, that the only possible objection to his selection was that the appointment of two clerics in succession might be regarded as setting a pattern.  I did not think that was a very serious objection and the outstanding qualifications of both Monsignor de Brún and Father O'Sullivan give all the explanation that is required.  When the next Director comes to be appointed, whoever has then the responsibility will be free to select the best qualified person available and need not consider himself bound, or committed in any way, by what has been done.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not propose to deal with the work of An Chomhairle during the year.  It is fairly fully recorded in the annual report but, in view of a discussion which we had on this Estimate last year, I think I should mention that recently the measures in operation to improve the quality of Irish industrial designs were examined by the Economic Development Branch of the Department of Finance.  That examination showed that, while An Chomhairle Ealaíon was not able to do very much in that field, another Government organisation.  An Córas Tráchtála, was very actively engaged in encouraging development.  The view of the Economic Development Branch, with which I agree, is that it would be desirable formally to release.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon from obligation to extend its activities in respect of industrial design and to make it clear that An Córas Tráchtála is the main Government agency dealing with it. The scholarship in industrial design, which An Chomhairle Ealaíon has offered, was awarded this year.  The <Col N="1818" /> arrangements for the continuation of that scholarship is one of the matters now receiving attention.</P>
    <P>Although it may not be entirely relevant to this Estimate, I think Deputies may be interested in knowing the position in regard to the Lane pictures. Before the pictures could be put on display in the Municipal Art Gallery, certain alterations were required there. These alterations, which include the installation of security arrangements, fire and burglary alarm systems, will I am informed, be completed in October and it is probable, therefore, that the first lot of the Lane pictures will be on display there about November next.</P>
    <P>One final matter I shall mention. Consideration has been given for some time past to the general question of the suitability of all our existing arrangements for the promotion of cultural activities and to the possibility of improving these arrangements.  No decisions have yet been taken and I do not now wish to indicate what the decisions may be, but it is possible that some changes in the character and scope of the activities of An Chomhairle Ealaíon may be involved. I asked that certain reports should be prepared and these have now, I understand, been completed even though I have not seen them, but I hope during the Recess to be able to devote some time to that subject which, I think, is in need of attention.  Indeed, that need has been recognised for many years past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We all wish to be associated with the Taoiseach's expresssion of regret at the death of the distinguished Chairman of the Arts Council, the late Monsignor Browne, and to record our sense of loss at the passing of the Monsignor not only in his official capacity here, but as a man with whom some of us agreed and some of us disagreed, whose brilliance and whose character all ordinary men will have admired. We shall also, I imagine, wish to be associated with the Taoiseach in his expression of satisfaction in having Fr. O'Sullivan available to succeed the late Monsignor Browne, and to congratulate ourselves that someone <Col N="1819" /> of his distinction and peculiar suitability for this post was so readily available.</P>
      <P>I gladly associate myself with the reservations which the Taoiseach added to these sentiments, without in any way detracting from the distinction of Fr. O'Sullivan or the late Monsignor Browne.  We shall regard their succession in the fact that they are both priests of the Holy Roman Catholic Church, to which most of us belong, as a coincidence rather than as a design.</P>
      <P>I express some surprise at the casual manner in which the Taoiseach announces the transfer of the matter of industrial design from the Arts Council to Córas Tráchtála.  I understood our object in inviting the Arts Council to concern itself in the matter of industrial design was, in some measure, to protect ourselves from an excessive utilitarianism in our approach to industrial design.  Now, only a fool would desire to divorce industrial design from trade and industry, they manifestly having an interest in it, and if industrial design does not appeal to trade or industry it is not good industrial design.  But that is a long way short of withdrawing this matter from the ambit of the Arts Council's functions and handing it over entirely to Córas Tráchtála, because that seems to imply that Córas Tráchtála is charged with the responsibility of sponsoring industrial design which should command the maximum sales, and this seems to me to be the very reverse of our intention.</P>
      <P>We can employ anybody in Europe or the United States of America to seek the lowest common denominator of public taste and, if we are to judge that by the criteria of the popular Press in Great Britain and the United States, the industrial design that would appeal to the greatest number would be something far divorced from what was present to our minds when we invited the Arts Council to interest themselves in it.  Do we want to substitute the Córas Tráchtála approach for the Arts Council approach?  I think we are in danger of making a serious mistake here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1820" /> If we are concerned to sell the maximum number of Irish souvenirs, I think if we manufacture a sufficient volume of shiny blackthorns, with right-angle pieces at their tops, and china leprechauns with red hats through which a white clay pipe is preferably stuck, they may prove to be extremely popular, excellent sellers in the popular market.  But I understood the whole purpose of inviting the Arts Council to concern itself in this business of industrial design was to dissuade the producers of Irish souvenirs from manufacturing shiny blackthorn sticks with right-angle tops, and china leprechauns with white pipes in their hats, with worsted stockings and buckled boots, with perhaps for good luck miniature blackthorns thrust under their oxters.</P>
    <P>I am astonished the Taoiseach did not feel obliged to give us a more exhaustive explanation of the decision to make this transfer.  I pick out one item, the item of souvenirs, because in regard to that one can make a very obvious case but the same applies all through the whole range of industrial design.  I think we can safely leave to commercial firms, who are concerned to promote mass production and ready sale, to ascertain popular tastes in the largest mass markets, but I understood the function of the Arts Council in regard to industrial design was to act in some measure as a brake to any natural commercial tendency to seek the lowest common denominator, and to constantly keep up a judicious pressure on industry to realise that the lowest common denominator might be the denominator most readily available but that it is not necessarily the best from the long-term point of view and that, if you made it the hallmark of Irish industrial production, taking the broad view, it would ultimately react against the best interests of the commercial future of the country.</P>
    <P>Having spent all my life in business, however, I do not want to take up the position that art for art's sake is the only criterion by which legitimate business can be carried on.  That, manifestly, is not true.  Due and sensible regard must be had to <Col N="1821" /> commercial considerations.  There is no use manufacturing beautiful things if no one will buy them&mdash;if your purpose is to trade.</P>
    <P>We have all seen the regretted passing out of existence of beautiful things because public taste was not educated up to them and, without seeking unduly to multiply examples, I do offer the House the fact that there passed out of existence in my time the whole glorious panorama of William Morris's designs which adorned textiles, wallpapers and ceramics, because public taste was not educated up to the levels of an adequate appreciation of them. I see them creeping back now when most of the original blocks have disappeared. While the ceramic industries which used his designs have been suffered to die, people have been coming back to an appreciation of how exquisite they were.  I can also see that had there been an Arts Council functioning then it might have interested itself to persuade industry not to let that beauty die and, taking the long-term view, the firm which preserved and retained those exquisite designs would find they would ultimately profit, and that the reputation of Irish industry would benefit by their preservation. I think a British industry would have greatly benefited if these great designs had not been suffered to die in those branches of trade.  Their resources permitted them to restore them and bring them back again, not in their entirety but at least in part.</P>
    <P>I think we are in grave danger of travelling a retrograde road in removing from the Arts Council consideration of the matter of industrial design. I agree with the Taoiseach that if you multiply committees, you get nowhere at all.  Therefore I am reluctant to say it would have been better to leave industrial design to the joint supervision of Córas Tráchtála and the Arts Council.  I think that would be a better scheme than to eliminate the Arts Council from this matter altogether.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that this is a matter which might be reconsidered and a scheme devised under which in regard to industrial design there should be more coordination rather than transfer, and that from the point of view both of the Arts <Col N="1822" /> Council and Córas Tráchtála, it might be useful if in respect of this particular interest, they were required to engage in daily collaboration and coordination of their activities.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the Lane pictures are shortly to be made available to the public here.  I do not think anyone will complain at any delay involved by making available the necessary precautions against fire hazards and the other hazards which attach to such precious things, more especially as in a certain sense both we and the British are now trustees, one for the other, of all these treasures.</P>
    <P>Possibly some other occasion may arise when the activities of the Arts Council can be more expeditiously discussed.  It is a comfortable thing for the responsible Minister to come in here and say: &ldquo;This body has published a report which I presume everybody has read.&rdquo; I have not read it because I have not had time.  A great many reports such as this land up in the Library.  I do not get round to reading them because I have not time to go and ask for them.  If they are not sent to me, I do not see them.  I do not know whether or not the Arts Council Report is sent to Deputies.  I do not think it is.  Is it?  Well, I am sorry to have to confess to the House that if it was sent to me, I have not got round to reading it yet.  I sympathise with the Minister who rambles in and says: &ldquo;You have all read the report.  There is no need for me to say anything about it.&rdquo; It is a growing practice which I would wish mildly to deprecate.  I think the Minister has a wider responsibility than to say: &ldquo;I assume you have all read the report.&rdquo;</P>

What I am deprecating is that responsible Ministers ramble in here and say: &ldquo;Some of you boys have read this.  Therefore, I need not say anything more about it.&rdquo; They have forgotten that there are two aspects to their duties in this.  One is to glory in the achievements of the Arts Council and the other is to satisfy the humblest T.D. that the money he is asked to vote will be well spent.</P>

      <P>I should hate to describe this as much ado about nothing. I think we can all appreciate the sentiments that have been expressed by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, and indeed by the Taoiseach, in respect of the many forms of art and culture in this country.  But may I put this simple question?  What can be done with £20,000?  It is a bit of a joke to be talking about an Arts Council that has at its disposal only £20,000.  To an individual, that is a lot of money, but consider all the things the Arts Council is expected to do.  I do not think there is much need for anybody to bring in a report because what can be accomplished with that amount of money is very small indeed.  It is true that other organisations which receive grants from the Arts Council do a tremendous amount of work, but that is not necessarily done with the money they get from the Arts Council but with money raised by themselves from other sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I want to advocate that more than £20,000 be given to the Arts Council.  I assume that the salaries and expenses of the Director and his staff must be deducted from that £20,000, leaving the Council with something like £15,000 with which to work.  Tremendous credit is due to the cultural societies throughout the country.  I know the work of some of them myself.  The Wexford Festival has been assisted to a considerable extent by the Arts Council, and so <Col N="1824" /> have others such as the Waterford Light Opera Festival, the Cork Musical Festival and Feile Luimnighe.  Other organisations have received help but on a smaller scale.</P>
    <P>I believe this country could readily afford to double, treble or increase five or six times the £20,000 mentioned in this Estimate.  Apart from the societies I have mentioned, there are many orchestras, bands and cultural organisations&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  All these organisations would be eligible for help of some sort or another from the Arts Council.  The Taoiseach should seriously consider, if not this year, then next year, surveying the whole position of art and culture here and increasing the amount.  When one deducts the salaries and expenses of the Director and his staff from the £20,000, very little is left to be distributed in the cause of art and culture.</P>

      <P>I want to support what Deputy Dillon said with regard to the transfer of responsibility for industrial design from the Arts Council to Córas Tráchtála.  I would like the Taoiseach to know that in practically every city in Europe they have an arts museum and an industrial museum as well.  I do not know how they are financed but I presume they are financed in some way by the counterpart of our Arts Council.  I know that many tourists travelling in Europe, particularly those associated with industry and commerce, visit these industrial museums to get ideas for manufacturing things themselves. The museums are also a source of advertisement for industrial production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that the idea in setting up Córas Tráchtála was to increase our exports in every way possible.  At the same time, I cannot help feeling that the average person visiting this country, particularly those coming from the continent of Europe, will seek the counterpart of what he finds in his own European cities.  Only the other day I was out with somebody <Col N="1825" /> in two different cities in Europe who made a point of visiting the industrial museums to get an idea of what was being manufactured in those countries; to get the pattern of what was being manufactured there with the idea of purchasing or extending his own range of manufacture.  He also wanted to see the latest developments in the country concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach's idea is to remove the Arts Council from the field of industrial design and if he has an idea at the back of his mind that by putting it in the hands of Córas Tráchtála, he is going to do a better service to the export trade and put across to the public outside the country what can be manufactured here&mdash;advertise it, in other words&mdash;I do not think he is going in the right direction.  I think what Deputy Dillon said is right.  That has been the custom and the system in most countries; in modern times, it has been developed to a greater extent than formerly.  I think we would be well advised to leave the situation as it is.</P>

      <P>Deputies may remember that last year on this Estimate Deputy J. A. Costello urged that consideration should be given to the possibility of making the improvement of industrial design a larger part of the work of the Arts Council.  I agreed to look into the matter.  I was of the opinion, which I think I expressed at the time&mdash;I know I have expressed it on many occasions&mdash;that about the worst type of body to employ to interest businessmen in industrial design is one called an Arts Council&mdash;</P>

      <P>Few businessmen would accept that in any circumstances an Arts Council could teach them anything useful in regard to their business. In fact the Arts Council was <Col N="1826" /> never intended by the Act of 1951 to have any exclusive function with regard to industrial design.  Although it tried to interest itself in the matter, it was not able to do very much.  It organised a Package Design Scheme which was, according to their own report, more or less a failure.  Very few firms took an interest in the scheme.  Then they instituted this scholarship in industrial design to which I have already referred. That was, I believe, the limit of their activities.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there is a body very directly interested, because it has a trade function, in the improvement of industrial design and it is not merely actively engaged in that work but it has also succeeded in arousing the interest of large and important groups of firms. In the past year, it has considerably extended the scale of its arrangement for helping firms to improve design and reap the commercial benefit that follows from it.  It seems to be common sense, therefore, that we should accept that the Arts Council is not likely to be effective in that field and that the main Government agency to bring about what everybody recognises is important in the country's industrial progress, the improvement of manufacturers' designs, is Córas Tráchtála Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Corish that the Arts Council could use a lot more money.  They think that themselves.  In cultural fields of that kind, there is almost no limit to the amount of money that could usefully be spent.  I approached with considerable sympathy the idea of increasing the grant-in-aid of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, but decided to postpone taking a decision on the matter until I had an opportunity of looking fully into the whole question of the organisation of all our cultural bodies and their activities.  Some Deputies opposite may be aware that proposals have been made from time to time for the establishment of some central co-ordinating authority to help these subordinate bodies to do better work.  Whether that is a good idea or not I would not know, but I think we should examine these ideas and come to a decision about them before deciding to enlarge the scale of work of <Col N="1827" /> An Chomhairle Ealaíon or to provide additional funds for the work they are now doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I should like to raise this matter because for years I have been endeavouring to get some information about it.  Even on Estimates I was put off by the Minister's predecessor, now Minister for Agriculture.  He then assured me he would write to me, and let me know the answers to the questions I had asked on the Estimate but he never did so.  Then he was transferred to the Department of Agriculture and I had to wait again.  I have to thank the present Minister for anything I know about road grants because it was through his putting down a question on 9th May, 1956 to his predecessor asking about the various road grants that were made that I discovered that the grants for upkeep and improvement of County Waterford roads were £137,000 in 1953/54, £136,000 for the following year and £132,000 in 1955/56.  We got £5,000 each year in tourist road grants.  We got £250 in 1953/54 for employment schemes.  I was stunned by this figure of £250 when I considered that other counties were able to obtain £13,000, £14,000 and £15,000.  The tourist road grant to Waterford was £5,000 while other counties received £55,000 and £25,000.</P>
      <P>I have been watching these road grants.  Last February I put down a question to the Minister, as follows:</P>
      <P>If he will state the amount of road fund grants allocated to Waterford County Council in the years 1953/54, 1954/55, 1955/56, 1956/57, 1957/58, 1958/59 and 1959/60.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was:</P>

    <P>In his reply to my question today the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that the total allocation from the Road Fund has been consistently reduced for the past six years; it has in fact varied up and down, due principally to the effect of special grants such as the grants for bridges.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in grants for bridges.  I am interested in grants for roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister could say that the total allocation did go up and down because I notice that in 1956/57 the exact figure was £127,421; it went down in the following year to £127,420; it went up the following year to £127,421 and was £127,421 in the year after that. That is it went up by £1.  That is about the measure at the treatment that Waterford County Council has got.</P>
    <P>On 13th July Deputy Russell asked the Minister the basis on which allocations are made.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The basis, as may be gathered from the reply, rests on a number of factors, such as population, number of vehicles registered, valuation, etc.  Actually, before the war an improvement grant was made available on such a basis...</P>
    <P>...There are a great number of factors, population, number of registrations and the need.  Apparently the question of need comes into this matter.  It is not very closely tied, as far as I can see, from the past record in regard to these grants.</P>
    <P>As far as need is concerned, there are <Col N="1830" /> as many unemployed persons in Waterford as there are in any other county. My colleague, Deputy Kyne is here and he will be able to deal with that matter even better than I could.  Waterford County Council have been hit very hard by the manner in which we have been treated in regard to road grants.</P>
    <P>The figures I have obtained have confused me.  On 31st May, 1960, I asked the Minister if he would state:</P>
    <P>...the amount allocated to each local authority for the period 1960-61 in respect of (a) road upkeep and improvement work, (b) tourist road grants, (c) special grants for bridge works, (d) grants for schemes the technical aspects of which are administered through his Department, (e) the scheme for the improvement of roads and (f) the scheme for Fíor-Ghaeltact areas.</P>
    <P>The reply was in the form of a tabular statement and the figures given in regard to Waterford County Council were that the main and county road improvement grant 100 per cent. was £108,100 and the tourist road grant 100 per cent. was £5,000. That is all we ever get.  Waterford County Council never get any more than £5,000 in tourist road grants.  I have never been able to discover why it is called a tourist road grant.  I have been told that that has something to do with Gaeltacht and congested areas but what that has to do with tourist roads I do not know.</P>
    <P>Waterford can claim to be a tourist centre.  Waterford County Council have always struck ample rates and have had great roads long before there was such a thing as a Road Fund or road taxation.  Yet there are many roads leading to beautiful places which are dirt tracks.  The road into the Nire Valley, which is a most beautiful valley, is a dirt track.  The road going over Kilbrien from Dungarvan to the heights that give a view of all the land that slopes down to the sea and on to Helvick is an old fashioned dirt road. There are such roads in the heights going down to Kilmacthomas and into places where there is wonderful scenery.  It would be a great help to <Col N="1831" /> tourism if tourist road grants were made available for the improvement of these roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply today referred to grants for bridges.  There was a grant given for Bonmahon Bridge and another bridge.  I am concerned with roads.  I have the figures which show that the allocation consistently went down for the past six years but the Minister told me today that that was not correct.  He said:</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that the total allocation from the Road Fund has been consistently reduced for the past six years; it has in fact varied up and down, due principally to the effect of special grants such as the grants for bridges.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with grants for bridges.  I am concerned with grants for roads.  If there was a special grant given for bridges, I do not see why there should not be a grant for roads. Other counties have received substantial grants of £45,000, £38,000, £77,000, £12,000, £54,000, £45,000.  They were special grants of 100 per cent. and the main and county road improvement grants are not affected by the fact that these grants were given.</P>
    <P>I referred to this matter on the Estimate but the Minister did not extend to me the courtesy of a reply.  I thought he would have referred to the matter when he was concluding the debate.  Unfortunately, I was absent from the House when the Minister concluded. Had I been here.  I would have intervened and asked him to reply to what I had said on the Estimate.  I prefaced my remarks then by saying that I hoped the Minister would be tolerant of my appeal for the people of my constituency because&mdash;this is nothing to blame him for; this is something of which he can be proud and of which his predecessor can be proud&mdash;I understand that these road grants are allotted not on any basis of valuation or rates paid or on the basis of need but on the basis of who is the Minister for Local Government.  I discovered that in the allotment of tourist road grants, Cavan got £10,000.  I never <Col N="1832" /> heard of any Gaeltacht in Cavan, but we have Ring in county Waterford. Maybe it was because the previous Minister for Local Government, Deputy Smith, was returned by the people of Cavan.</P>
    <P>However, my attention was drawn to this by the present Minister when he put down a question to his predecessor, Deputy O'Donnell.  Deputy O'Donnell is a Donegal man and I notice that during his term of office the Donegal road grants crept up all the time.  I would be tolerant of that and I would say that he followed the example of his predecessors.  I suppose it is a good man who looks after his own people and if the Minister has that sentiment for his own people, he surely cannot blame me for having that sentiment for my constituents.</P>
    <P>There has been a big cut in this allocation since 1953-54.  It has been reduced from £142,000 in that year, on these figures the Minister gave me in February, to £127,000, notwithstanding the fact that a considerable number of new cars and lorries have been registered and increased revenue has come into the Exchequer and notwithstanding what the Minister said to Deputy Russell.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>There were uniform grants for a number of years and more recently these grants have not been uniformly applied.</P>
    <P>Mr. Russell: As the need increases will the grant go up?</P>
    <P>Mr. Blaney: Provided the money is available.</P>
    <P>Surely there must be increased money available to this Vote over the past five or six years, but as the revenue has increased, our allocation has constantly decreased.  Waterford should get special consideration. Waterford city pays about £65,000 into the Road Fund and gets back £5,000. We are getting £8,000 this year but we were getting £5,000 for a long time. We have entrance roads similar to those in Dublin and there is great difficulty in keeping them up.  They must be kept for the whole country and that is only right seeing that our people in <Col N="1833" /> Waterford use the roads of the whole country.</P>
    <P>However, we pay out much more than we get back.  I was going to refer to the extraordinary way Dublin Corporation is treated but the Dublin Deputies do not bother about it and it is their pigeon.  This is the first time I have raised any matter on the Adjournment.  I think my colleague Deputy Kyne has a word to say on this matter and there are five minutes left for him to speak before the Minister replies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the local authority by which these roads are controlled and administered, I am interested in the subject raised by Deputy Lynch.  May I express my appreciation of his courtesy in giving me five minutes out of his time to express my views?  I do not want to say that Waterford is in any way victimised as compared with any other county but Waterford roads have been kept in such good condition over the past ten, 15 and 20 years that we are now suffering from the fact that we were such good citizens, that we obeyed the suggestions of the then Minister by keeping our roads up to a good standard.  Unfortunately the counties that did not do that now appear to be reaping the reward and getting bigger grants.</P>
      <P>Without having any opportunity of seeking figures to support my arguments, I think what Deputy Lynch says is true, that the employment possibilities for the workers in Waterford County Council were never lower than at present.  Whether that is due mainly to the introduction of machinery, as in most other counties, plus the fact that the Local Authorities (Works) Act has been discontinued, the figure is almost 50 per cent. under what it was, say, five or six years ago.  That is a most unfortunate position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waterford County Council is a very essential employer of labour in the county.  Any saving or any reduction that had to be made did not come from the county council.  The amount of money put up for main roads and for county roads has continually been increased by the Waterford local authority. <Col N="1834" /> Proportionately these grants to main roads have increased but the total amount of money being made available to the county has lessened.  The reason for that is not for me to indicate but with all sincerity and with no desire to gain Party advantage, I say that the Gaeltacht or tourist grant of £5,000 is a very small amount of money.  Either from a tourist or a Gaeltacht point of view, Waterford county is deserving of more than the £5,000 allocated.</P>
    <P>The money allocated has been well spent.  How insufficient it is is indicated by the fact that it is partly this year and partly next year we have to carry out the schemes our engineers have submitted to the Department.</P>
    <P>Numbers of other schemes of utmost importance from a tourist point of view, even in the Gaeltacht area, have been put before his Department and will be put before it again if the need arises and if the Minister indicates there is any use in doing that.  I appeal to the Minister to see if any concession can be given to a county whose only sin is that in the past it carried out the requests of Ministers and contributed over and above what was done by other counties by providing some of the best roads in the country for the tourist industry.  Our secondary roads are comparable to the best in the country but there is still a need for further moneys to be spent for the sake of the tourist industry, for the sake of the employment of Irishmen in Ireland and for the sake of a continuation of the policy of road-making for which Waterford has been famed in the past.</P>

      <P>Quite a few points were covered, particularly by Deputy T. Lynch, which were not relevant.  In the time available to me now, it would not be possible to go into them in detail.  I shall confine myself to the question the Deputy asked today and try to elucidate the position as best I can.  The question is in two parts. He asked why the allocation to county Waterford from the Road Fund was consistently reduced for the past six years.  On another occasion, Deputy T. Lynch got, in reply to a Parliamentary <Col N="1835" /> Question, a tabular statement showing the Road Fund grants paid to the county.  That was in February of this year.</P>
      <P>In that table, which the Deputy has, the grant for 1953-54 is £142,328; for 1954-55, it is £141,721 and for 1955-56 it is £137,921.  That represents first the three years on the table I then gave him.  In the £142,000 for 1953-54, in addition to the moneys paid from the Road Fund, is included a sum of £30,000 from the National Development Fund moneys to supplement the moneys from the ordinary Road Fund income.</P>
      <P>In 1954-55, a sum of £28,000 from the National Development Fund also supplemented the Road Fund grant, bringing it up to £141,721.  In 1955-56, the National Development Fund money was no longer available.  We have then a drop in that year down to £137,000 which would have read £125,000 roughly were it not for a very late effort on the part of the then Government in late 1955 in allocating a sum of £500,000 divided out amongst the various counties, of which Waterford got £12,500.  That £125,000 figure then would be consistent with the figures that follow for the remaining few years of the Coalition Government's term of office, in the region of £127,000 for 1956-57, and then we come to the change of Government again in 1957-58.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at the Deputy, not so much for seeking this information as for misreading the situation to such a degree that he can come into this House and apparently in all good faith make the allegations that these figures of money have been reduced and that there is some mystery about how they came to be reduced.  The solution is in the £500,000 which could not be afforded in 1955-56 but which, nevertheless, was brought in in the tail-end of that year.  That £500,000 brought in at that stage and tacked on at the end of the financial year to try to boost the dying fortunes of the then administration could possibly have been got over were it not that in 1956-57 a sum of £500,000 was <Col N="1836" /> taken completely from the Road Fund and put into the general Exchequer Account.  These two sums came to £1,000,000.  I should like Deputies to keep the £1,000,000 in mind, because it is significant at a later date.</P>
    <P>Over and above, we found then that in the tail-end of that year, 1956-57, in which £500,000 was whipped out of the Road Fund by the general Exchequer, in February or January, 1957, with the General Election impending and known to be impending by the then Government although not by the rest of us except by guess work, an extraordinary thing happened.  No longer was it possible even to commit the Road Fund further because it had got into such a sorry condition, but what happened?  An Order went out to all the county councils that they could start spending the following year's money, the 1957-58 money, and that they were free to do so in February of 1957 which was the tail-end of the &ldquo;previous&rdquo; financial year.</P>
    <P>That is the position I should like to bring to the minds of Deputies.  Some months later, when the Government changed, we found a problem even in maintaining the road grants at the figure at which they had been sitting in the previous couple of years and which were only brought to that stage by misuse of the funds then at the disposal of the Road Fund.  We found when we came into office that to avoid cutting the grants by £1,000,000 or so we had to borrow from the general Exchequer a sum of £900,000.  Only this enabled us to carry on the grants at the rate at which they had been allocated in the previous years.  The situation has since improved, I am glad to say, to a considerable degree.</P>
    <P>For the present financial year, for the first time in many years past, the funds of the Road Fund are now in the condition that I have been in the happy position of being able to allow certain increases to every local authority and to give new allocations to local authorities for certain road purposes for which they never got any moneys in the past.  In regard to Waterford, this has meant that they have gone up to <Col N="1837" /> £130,800 in this current year.  That in itself is an indication of our wish to increase these grants whenever and wherever it is practicable.  But it has only been this year that it has been possible to do anything.</P>
    <P>The trend is still in the right direction. The Road Fund is going back into some sort of shape but do not blame this administration or my Department or myself for any of the shortcomings that may appear in the list of Road Fund grants that it was possible to allocate during the past six or seven years because the real answer is that without the advent of the present administration and the raising of loans from the Exchequer it would not have been possible even to continue the grants at the level they have been enjoying over these recent years.  Compare that borrowing from the central Exchequer with the raiding by the central Exchequer on this very much weakened Road Fund in 1956.  Those facts should be fully digested by all Deputies before they start accusing anybody of reducing the grants.  In particular, the allegation that there is some vendetta against Waterford is unfounded.  Whatever may be the pattern of the grants, whatever they have been, are now or will be in the future, they are based on established practice and principle over many years.  Nobody at any stage has seriously alleged&mdash;as Deputy Kyne mentioned; though he did not make the charge, the charge is being made&mdash; that Waterford has been singled out <Col N="1838" /> for very special disadvantageous treatment. That is not so.  If it were so then it surely would be an accusation of the Deputies from Waterford over the years that they kept so silent about this system, and the same system is operating today as operated over the past 10 or 15 years.  I can see no grounds whatever for Deputy Lynch's outlook on this matter.</P>
    <P>I trust that on digesting the figures fully he will see the position in a new light.  I agree with Deputy T. Lynch that replies to different questions he asked me give different figures to him. He may have intended the same question whereas if the details of the questions are fully gone into, he will find there are certain significant differences between them.  The questions may appear similar to him and the answers dissimilar.  Possibly, if the Deputy goes through all the various questions mentioned here tonight he will see the reasons for what appear to be discrepancies in the figures given in relation to different questions but those discrepancies are not real.  If I can help the Deputy between now and the resumption next October in sorting out this matter, I shall be very glad to do so.</P>
