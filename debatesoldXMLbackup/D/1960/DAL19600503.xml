    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoieach if he will explain why the form of Table 13 of <i>Economic Statistics,</i> 1960 differed from that used in 1959 (Table 9), and the exact significance of the material now omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>Table 13 of <i>Economic Statistics</i> 1960 differs from the corresponding table published in 1959 principally in that gross domestic fixed capital formation, which in the 1959 issue was broken down into the parts&mdash;&ldquo;Imported capital goods&rdquo; and &ldquo;Home-produced capital&rdquo;&mdash;is in the 1960 issue given as a single figure. This change was due to the introduction, since the publication of the 1959 issue, of revised methods of compilation, intended to improve the reliability of estimated total expenditure on fixed capital.  These revisions were taken into account in the preparation of the capital formation statistics for 1958 and earlier years published in the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> 1958.  The figures given in <i>Economic Statistics</i> 1960 for gross domestic fixed capital formation in the years 1956 to 1958 are the same as those given as item 31 (Table A.3) of the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> 1958 and a breakdown of these figures is given in items 72 to 75 (Table A.7) of the same document.  It was not possible to prepare a similar breakdown for 1959 in time for inclusion in <i>Economic Statistics</i> 1960 and, therefore, only a <Col N="420" /> total figure is given for each of the four years 1956-59.  The partial breakdown of the corresponding preliminary figure for 1958, which was given in <i>Economic Statistics</i> 1959, was based on the less complete compilation which had been used in preparing capital formation statistics for the 1957 and earlier <i>Statistical Survey</i>, so that it was possible to have it completed earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>There is a further slight difference between the layout of Table 13 of <i>Economic Statistics</i> 1960 and Table 9 of <i>Economic Statistics</i> 1959 in that the latter shows, for 1955 and 1956, a breakdown of home-produced capital into &ldquo;Private dwellings, hospitals, schools, etc.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other home produced capital&rdquo;.  As the figures for 1959 are not yet available a similar breakdown is not given in <i>Economic Statistics</i> 1960, but the figures for 1956-58 are available in the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> 1958 items 73 and 74 (Table A.7).</P>

      <P>Does that reply purport to explain the difference between the figures of £77,000,000 given in <i>Economic Statistics,</i> 1960, in respect of the year 1958, and £69,000,000 given in <i>Economic Statistics,</i> 1959, in Table 9, in respect of 1958 ?</P>

      <P>No, I do not think so.  It deals only with the particular point raised by the Deputy in his question.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he can give an approximate estimate of the total annual amount of (1) increased stamp charge and (2) Exchequer contributions under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="423" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the increases in contribution rates proposed in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 1960, will yield approximately £4,075,000 in a full year.</P>
      <P>In the absence of statistics of the number of persons over age 70 who were formerly insured, it is not possible to frame a reliable estimate of the cost of old age (contributory) pensions.  Tentative estimates of the cost of these pensions and of the cost of the other proposals in the Bill indicate that the additional Exchequer contributions to the Social Insurance Fund will be of the order of £2,850,000 a year.  There will, of course, be a saving in pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts, and taking this into account the net annual charge on the Exchequer resulting from the Bill, apart from increased administration expenses, is taken to be in the region of £300,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary with reference to the figure of £4,000,000 odd which he says is the probable approximate annual cost of the increased stamp charge, am I to take it that that would represent approximately £2,000,000 on the employers and £2,000,000 on the employees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it to be taken from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, therefore, that the Minister for Social Welfare is not now adhering to the principle that the State will contribute one-third to an insurance fund to provide for the benefits outlined in the amending Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill, as the Deputy will find, the State contributes about 41 per cent. of all the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did say that there would be a substantial amount of savings on <Col N="424" /> existing old age pensions which would very much offset the cost of the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I perhaps clarify? Am I correct in interpreting what the Parliamentary Secretary said by saying that under the new Bill the employers will contribute approximately £2,000,000. the employees will contribute approximately £2,000,000 and the Exchequer will contribute its share of that, but that offset against the contribution by the Exchequer, we may expect that a number of persons at present receiving non-contributory pensions will cease to receive them as a result of getting contributory pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiation of any measures necessary for the treatment of the junction referred to would be a matter for the local authority or authorities responsible for the road, viz: at this section, the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council. I understand that a scheme for the improvement of the road from Donnybrook to Foster Avenue is being formulated and that negotiations for the acquisition of the necessary land are proceeding.  Pending the improvement of the road, appropriate warning signs have been placed at the junction.  As regards restrictions on the speed of vehicles, these can be secured under existing law only by regulations made following an application by the local authority or by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and after the holding of a local inquiry.  As I indicated in reply to previous questions on similar situations, I consider it would be inappropriate to deal with particular proposals for speed limits pending the enactment of road traffic legislation, which will deal with this and other aspects of road safety.  There is no current proposal before me for a speed limit on this road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, concluding his statement on the Budget, spoke of the great disservice to national development done by those who belittle the advances made under different Governments and who, by spreading pessimism, lessen the determination we should all share to make greater progress in future.  Deputy Sweetman has already commented on the audacity of the Minister for Finance in addressing that admonition to the Opposition bearing in mind the propaganda operated by him and by his kept newspaper &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo; who sought to undermine every advance achieved under the inter-Party Government when it was in office.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that by the standards of four-fifths of the world's population we are very well off. We are now driven to desperate necessity when we are called upon to congratulate ourselves on our standard of living by comparing it with that of the residents of China and Malaya and the chronically under-nourished countries of the world.  We can all agree that our circumstances in Ireland are superior to theirs but I cannot feel that is a matter upon which we can very excitedly congratulate ourselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said our people are reasonably well fed and housed, that the conditions of life in Ireland are good, that our people have the safety and comfort of a peaceful and civilised society.  These are all propositions to which we are prepared to subscribe but I do not know what exact associations they have with the Budgetary position we are called upon to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> The Minister also made reference to housing.  On page 49 of his statement he says:</P>
    <P>Instead of the reduction in housing expenditure being a source of criticism, it should be a cause of satisfaction to all of us that we have progressed so far towards meeting our social obligations in this respect.</P>
    <P>I cannot allow those words to pass without recalling the gyrations of Deputy Briscoe from these benches when he was thundering in 1956 and in 1957 that the Government of that day were heartlessly withholding from local authorities the minimum funds requisite to house the people in tolerable conditions.  Deputy Briscoe is now, I believe, frisking through the United States.  I trust that the veracity of his observations there are more dependable than those which he made in this House and which the Minister for Finance now so emphatically and cogently repudiates in the Budget Statement.  It was an achievement upon which our Government and the Governments that went before us have reason to look back upon with satisfaction, that we did have the courage to make up our minds that the all-important thing was to get our people out of the slums, and we did it.  It would have been a wonderful thing if in those days that work had been acknowledged on all sides of the House instead of being confounded and complicated by the dishonest and fraudulent campaign carried on by Deputy Briscoe and the Fianna Fáil Party in this House at that time.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the Minister's speech in the context of our circumstances as we know them on this side of the House.  I interpreted the Minister's speech as bidding us to rejoice that all was well in the country.  In my considered judgment, with the fullest sense of responsibility, and bearing in mind the agreement which I gladly vouchsafe for the Minister's proposition that it is not right dishonestly to preach pessimism when there is no ground for it.  However, the picture drawn by the Minister for Finance bears little relation to reality as I know it. The facts statistically, and the facts <Col N="440" /> as we see them in the country where we live, clearly conflict with the picture which the Minister seeks to impose upon us.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say in respect of every policy that its best tests are its results.  There is no other valid test. I recall that the Taoiseach, when in Opposition, prepared a plan in 1956 and, having been Tánaiste for many years and having been a member of an Irish Government for 20 years, placed the whole prestige of that position behind the proposition.  It was no guesswork; it was a complete plan which only awaited the suffrages of the people to be put into operation. It was published in a supplement of their kept newspaper and put into the hands of every supporter they had and it carried an assurance on the authority of the Taoiseach that, given the opportunity over five years, he had plans in mind which would provide 100,000 new jobs in this country.</P>
    <P>No matter how comprehensive and detailed politicians' prognostications for the future may be, I suppose one must allow, and one is bound to allow, some discount for the excessive optimism of a pre-election speech. But the Taoiseach returned to this matter as reported on 17th June, 1957, after his Government had got a clear majority in Dáil Éireann on the representations they had made to our people&mdash;representations of a dual character: (1) that they had the means and the plans to provide 100,000 new jobs&mdash;and these were admirable proposals if they were honest, which I do not believe they were; and (2) carrying the disgusting and dishonest implication that the Government, then in office, to which I belonged and to which my colleagues belonged, were, by implication, relatively indifferent to the circumstances of the people unemployed at that time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach returned to that topic as reported on 17th June, 1957. Speaking as Minister for Industry and Commerce and Tánaiste he said:-</P>
    <P>The Government is declaring its policy or aim in all its aspects at expanding employment and accept that the increase of employment would be a measure by which the <Col N="441" /> effectiveness of all plans must be tested.</P>
    <P>That appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 17th June, 1957.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the Budget of the Minister for Finance for 1960, the booklet <i>Economic Statistics</i> was circulated. I refer to Table 7 which speaks of the situation obtaining in 1959, that is, after the Government had approximately three years in which to operate their plans.  That Table shows that in 1956 there were employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing 445,000 persons, while in 1959, there were employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing 420,000 persons&mdash; that is, 25,000 fewer persons employed than were employed in 1956.</P>
    <P>Further on appears Table 16 which speaks of the estimated number of persons at work in the main branches of non-agricultural economic activity, including mining, quarrying and turf production, manufacturing, construction, electricity, gas and water, commerce, insurance and finance, transport and communication, public administration and defence, and other economic activities.  It shows that in 1956 there were 718,000 persons employed in that group of occupations.  In 1959, there were 692,000 persons employed in that group&mdash;that is, 26,000 fewer than were employed in 1956.  If I read those figures correctly, the present position is that there were 51,000 fewer persons employed in 1959 than there were in 1956.</P>
    <P>All statistics have in them an element of uncertainty which constantly makes me suspect them, unless the picture they draw is substantially confirmed by what I see about me.  I think the ground for that suspicion is fortified by the matter which I mentioned to the Taoiseach at Question Time to-day when I directed his attention to the fact that in <i>Economic Statistics</i> for 1959 a figure of £69,000,000 appears while in the corresponding Table for 1960, a figure of £77,000,000 appears.  In that connection, I want to say to the Taoiseach that I feel that where basic considerations in preparing Tables of this kind have been changed for one reason <Col N="442" /> or another, it seems to me an odd procedure not to append some note to the Table itself directing attention to the matter which may appear in a preliminary paragraph which did not jump to the eye when these Tables were being prepared as they ordinarily are from one year to another.  Therefore, when I find that statistics tell me there were 51,000 fewer persons in employment in 1959 than there were in 1956, I check them with the atmosphere of the countryside in which I live, and the countryside which I represent, and with what I hear from those similarly circumstanced to myself in their knowledge of the conditions of the country.</P>
    <P>I want to say with full deliberation to this House that I cannot believe the Minister for Finance himself believes that the situation in this country presents the rosy picture he would ask us to believe it does.  Living in the west of Ireland as I do, and representing a constituency of small farmers in Monaghan as I do, I am bound to record in this House that in my opinion the circumstances obtaining in those areas are very bad.</P>
    <P>I challenge any Deputy who has any knowledge of the parts of Ireland to which I refer to deny that there is developing in those areas a phenomenon which I have never seen before in my life.  That is where the whole family locks the door and leaves the holding derelict and emigrates as a family.  That is going on now on a scale that I have never seen happen before.  It is going on, so far as I can find out, because these family holdings are ceasing to be viable.  The people cannot get a living upon them.  Not infrequently, what is happening is that when the father of a family seeks to persuade one of the sons to accept responsibility for the holding and to take it over he finds that none of them is prepared to do so but responds with the offer that if the father and mother and younger children will come, they can all go to England and make a living there.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to maintain patience, when I read the Minister's peroration telling us how happy we ought to be because we are not like the coolies in Malaya and when I match that exhortation <Col N="443" /> with the visit of a neighbour of mine to me within the past fortnight, a man of 71 years of age, who came to me to know if I could get his holding extended.  He had raised 12 children upon it.  He thought it hard that, in his 72nd year, he should be faced with the announcement that his last child proposed to leave him and emigrate to England because they could not live on the holding where he had raised 12 children.</P>
    <P>A number of people here may say: &ldquo;What is wrong with a family which itself was raised on that holding, not in luxury but with a standard that made it possible to raise 12 children to maturity and that enabled the father and mother to live into their seventies?  Why can they not do it now?&rdquo;  I think this House has forgotten these people.  We have sailed cheerfully along, quite indifferent that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government has gradually built up a cost structure which makes it impossible for these people to survive.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months, the price of young cattle&mdash;and young cattle mean existence to these people&mdash;has fallen by about £12 a head.  The price of pigs, while normally stable, has in fact very materially deteriorated.  The grading of pigs has become much stiffer.  A far higher percentage of total deliveries of pigs to factories has fallen into the unguaranteed grades. The price of sheep and lambs has catastrophically declined.  At the same time, there has proceeded under the Fianna Fáil technique a steady increase in the imposts these people have had to carry.</P>
    <P>It has always been the policy of Fianna Fáil, and it is a policy which I admit has considerable publicity value, to exclude from the annual Budget Statement to this House the bulk of the taxation which they propose to impose.  However, that taxation is falling on these sections of our people least able to bear it.  There arises no occasion to challenge it here because it never passes through our domain.  The Minister for Finance, in the course of his oration, congratulated himself on the stability of the balance of payments.  For that purpose, <Col N="444" /> he took the years 1957, 1958 and 1959 together, recalling that in 1957 there was a surplus of £9 million, in 1958 a deficit of £1 million and in 1959 a deficit of £8 million&mdash;not a very reassuring progress but, nonetheless, one on which he said we have reason to congratulate ourselves for a fall in that three-year period and for stability.</P>
    <P>The Minister forgot, when making that statement, all the things his colleagues had been saying about Deputy Sweetman whose courage and foresight produced the circumstances in which the surplus of 1957 was produced on which the present Minister has been living for the past two years. However, if we accept his three-year period, let us look at the other side of the picture from the point of view of the people living in rural Ireland both on the land and in the towns and villages which live by the land and where, let us remember, the bulk of employment provided in this country is being given to our people&mdash;because people forget that.  They tend to think that nobody is employed outside Dublin, Cork, Limerick and the City of Waterford.  If it were all tallied up. we would discover that there is a very great body of our people employed in the rural towns of Ireland catering for the requirements of the agricultural community who deal with them.</P>
    <P>In the three years to which the Minister has referred, Fianna Fáil have put 3d. on tobacco, 1d. on beer, 5½d. on the 2-1b. loaf, 3/7d. a stone on flour, 10d. a 1b. on butter.  At the same time, they have increased postal rates and bus fares. In respect of the tax on bread, flour, butter, postal rates and bus fares, no Resolution was ever passed through this House.  The only mention of it we have ever had was when the Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement of 1957, as reported at Column 947 of Volume 161 of the Official Report, that, in respect of the bread, flour and butter taxes, at that stage, they amounted to £9 million per annum.  Since then further impositions have gone on bread and butter which must bring that figure up to something like £11 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> All that extra cost has fallen on the rural community and on the industrial worker but the industrial worker was organised and was able, at least in some measure, to secure compensation for the extra charges Fianna Fáil put upon them.  But in rural Ireland, in addition to bearing those charges, the farmers are faced with the fact that the prices available for their output are steadily falling and that consequently, I think, the output itself is falling until we are now faced with the grim dilemma that families, who lived and worked on the land, are giving up the struggle by emigrating and going away.</P>
    <P>I regard that as the erosion of the whole economic foundation of this country because, with every one of these farms abandoned, the productivity of the land on which that family lived is going to fall to a half or a quarter of its potential.  In 90 per cent. of these cases these holdings are let on conacre which become covered with masses of rushes where few beasts are left to graze by whoever is prepared to take conacre from them.  Year after year that land will deteriorate and, in fact, the rent received for it does not fully pay for the degree of deterioration that takes place in the land on conacre.  Every month and every year that is suffered to go on reduces the capital assets of this country in a way that will be extremely difficult to repair.</P>
    <P>That has its repercussions on every small business in Ireland.  Any Deputy in this House who knows rural Ireland will confirm what I say, that every shop and business house in rural Ireland is finding business extremely slack at the present time.  They are finding it extremely difficult to meet their expenses.  As many city wholesale firms will testify, they are finding it extremely difficult to pay their debts. Today we are faced with the fact that on the charges which they have at present to carry, they and their employees will be required, under the Social Security legislation, to contribute a further £4 million a year or their share of it.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister <Col N="446" /> for Finance that unless we are able to take energetic measures to correct this situation, the future of this country is extremely difficult.  I do not know if the Minister believes it himself, but he told us in the course of his Budget statement that the gross national income was increasing at the rate of 3½ per cent.  I look at Table 12(b), which describes the gross national expenditures at constant (1953) market prices, which, I understand, corresponds with what is commonly described as the national income.  I find that in 1957 the total of that figure was £537.9 million.  It fell, under the impact of the catastrophic harvest and, presumably, the decreased turf production, to £521 million in 1958 and it came back in 1959 to £539 million.  That, so far as I know, represents an increase of 1.1 since 1957.  Am I correct in saying that is, in fact, an increase in real gross national expenditure of something in the order of one fifth of 1 per cent. per annum since 1957 instead of an increase of 3.2 per cent, which the Minister has arrived at by comparing the year 1959 with the exceptional year of 1958?</P>
    <P>I do not think it serves any useful purpose to deceive ourselves by reference to such illegitmate comparisons as I think the Minister sought to make, because I do not believe that our present difficulties are irremediable.  I believe they can be remedied and overcome if we go the right way about it.  The fundamental difference that I see between us and the present Government is that they are prepared to close their eyes to the facts that do not suit them, and they call upon everybody else, under pain of a charge of high treason, to do the same.</P>
    <P>It is no part of the duty of this House to close its eyes to the ascertainable facts.  I say that the ascertainable facts are that there are 51,000 fewer persons working in this country than there were in 1956; that the price of cattle has gone down by £10 per head in the past 12 months; that 80,000 fewer pigs were sent to the bacon factories of this country in the <Col N="447" /> first three months of this year than were sent in last year; that small farmers are emigrating and that the small towns of Ireland are in a bad way.</P>
    <P>There is only one way to correct that and that is restore the productivity of the land which is at present dwindling. Unless that is done, I do not believe anything else can remedy the fundamental economic difficulty in which we, in fact, are.  I was at the Spring Show today and I see that the farmers are exhorted to have further and better recourse to the Advisory Services.  It sought to demonstrate to them that if they do, real progress can be made on the smallest holding in expanding its output not only in quantity but also in quality.  I think measures can be taken along those lines to repair the grave deficiencies that at present exist in agricultural productivity.</P>
    <P>I deliberately refrained in this House and elsewhere from criticism of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme but I think the Government is not awake to the urgency of this problem or certainly, to judge by their activities, there is no evidence that they are.  I would ask the Taoiseach to consult with the Minister for Agriculture and ask him what are the prospects of raising the areas west of the Shannon to attested status, what are the prospects of their meeting the essential requirements or being in a position to export attested cattle in four or five years' time?  I would ask the Taoiseach to consult with his Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture as to what the consequences will be if we are not.</P>
    <P>What is the present impact on the cattle trade of the tuberculosis situation here and in Great Britain?  I think there is a very real danger of the cattle trade dwindling away west of the Shannon.  There is no reason why it should but far more energetic measures must be taken now to bring to the people's knowledge the means and the need of prosecuting the livestock industry effectively in the new conditions in which we find ourselves at the present time.</P>
    <P>I note with satisfaction an increase in <Col N="448" /> our exports of industrial goods, which arises largely from the inducements that were provided by our Government, and our successors, to those engaged in the export trade, by way of release of their profits from income tax.  I am glad to see the pretty substantial expansion in our exports of raw materials which it is well to remember consist very largely of wool and copper ores.  There is a grave danger in regard to the exports of wool because you will not have wool without sheep.  The ordinary farmer thinks of sheep as a useful industry for him so long as he can profitably sell the progeny of his flock. He looks on wool as a by-product.  It is a very valuable by-product now from the point of view of the country, but it all depends on the maintenance of our sheep numbers and the maintenance of our sheep numbers depends on the ability of the farmer to make a profit out of breeding sheep.</P>
    <P>I view with consternation and alarm the virtual disappearance of our exports of butter and the steady reduction in our exports of bacon.  I remember looking forward with confidence to an expansion of both of these and if they are allowed to disappear, I do not believe any alternative source of foreign exchange will ever be available to us, unless we can get from the 12,000,000 acres of land the kind of exportable product they are capable of producing. There is no other that will give you exports to maintain the standard of living to which the Minister for Finance referred in his statement.</P>
    <P>This is not the appropriate occasion&mdash; the occasion of a Budget discussion &mdash;to go into all the details of the methods whereby the productivity of the land can be restored but it is the appropriate occasion to direct the attention of those responsible to the fact that unless it is restored, there is nothing else which will act as a proper substitute for it.  This is the occasion on which to direct the attention of the Government to the fact that so far as I know, and so far as those whom I have consulted know, the position in rural Ireland is steadily deteriorating and very urgent measures are requisite to correct it.  I believe it is possible to <Col N="449" /> operate such measures but I believe it will make their operation doubly difficult if we are to be told that everything in the garden is lovely when in fact what is happening is that there are fewer people employed in the country than there were three years ago; that there are more people emigrating to-day than ever before, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>I am often struck by the complacent rejoicing of Fianna Fáil in the reduction of the weekly returns relating to unemployment.  These returns have been going down and the numbers of unemployed appear to be diminishing. If you are sitting in Dublin and reading these figures, you cannot but be impressed by them, but if you are living in the west of Ireland and see a notice in the paper that Mr. Wimpey's representative has arrived in Charlestown, and hear thereafter that in Charlestown, and two or three other towns, he has recruited 1,200 young men and taken them with him to London&mdash; from one area in the country alone&mdash; you begin to ask yourself what is it that is bringing down the record of the number unemployed.</P>
    <P>I do not know the position in the city of Dublin.  I do not know if people emigrate from Dublin as they do from the west of Ireland but certain this is, that if you ask anyone living in Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway, Clare and Kerry, and indeed in West Cork, to look around his own parish, to look up and down his own street, and to ask himself are the same people here this day as they were here this day twelve months, I think he will tell you some of them have gone and that more are planning to go.  If you ask him why, he will tell you it is because they see no future for them on the land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I think that is deplorable and I am not at all sure that the Taoiseach does not sympathise with the view that there is not much prospect on the land of Ireland.  I wish I thought otherwise but to those of us who believe in the future of this country and to those who are convinced that there is no economic future for Ireland unless its principal natural resource is <Col N="450" /> exploited to the full in the future, it is a grim catastrophe that the whole of rural Ireland should be in the doldrums while the Minister for Finance is telling them that they should all be intoxicated by the prosperity of the standard of living they enjoy.</P>
    <P>It will be a disaster for this country if Dáil Éireann suffers itself to be deceived by that kind of talk.  The situation is very far different and it requires urgent and heroic measures, which are well within our capacity if we are prepared to undertake them, but above all, it requires an understanding on the part of the Government that the assembly and export of sewing machines from this country is no substitute for pigs and butter and bacon and livestock and meat and wool, because in respect of one commodity, we are bringing in the parts, putting them together and sending them out again.  So far as that provides employment, it is a very welcome activity, if it is of an enduring kind but no country can abandon the natural resources with which it was endowed by God and commit itself wholly and irrevocably to the business of the assembly of foreign raw materials, abandoning the exploitation of its natural resources and the marketing of the products therefrom.</P>
    <P>Substantially, the natural resources of this country are 12,000,000 acres of arable land.  In their effective and efficient user and exploitation, there is abundant scope for the employment of more people.  There is abundant scope for the use profitably, through that land, of a great volume of industrial production.  There is abundant opportunity for the development of a great volume of foodstuffs, which we are told the world is short of at present, and it is true that for all the foreseeable future, as the Minister in his speech said, four-fifths of the human race will be more or less hungry.  I admit that this Government will require collaboration from other Governments if an effective bridge is to be built between the available food supplies and the hungry mouths that wish to consume them, but certain it is that if there is one good bet in the economic future of <Col N="451" /> the world, it is that the world's population will want more food.</P>
    <P>One thing is certain and it is that we here are more richly endowed than almost any other country in the world with the means of producing the highly specialised foodstuffs that can command the best prices in the foreign markets of the world.  One thing is certain&mdash;that we are side by side with one great market and that we have access to all the other markets of the world, if we go out to get it. One thing, I think, is certain&mdash;that we have potentially as competent a body of farmers in this country as there is in the world.  I think it is demonstrably clear that we have not yet brought within their reach the means effectively to apply modern methods to the comprehensive exploitation of that natural resource. For the want of that, I believe much employment in the processing and export of our output of agriculture is being lost in this country.  For the want of that, I think, we are ignoring markets that are vital to us while concentrating with enthusiasm on others which, in the long run, may be of relative insignificance.</P>
    <P>I welcome any market for anything that we are prepared to produce but if I have to choose between the export of sewing machines and bacon, I think the prospects for an enduring and prosperous industry here for pigs and bacon are much more alluring than those for sewing machines.  There may be no conflict between these two.  The danger is that such a conflict should be allowed to develop and that all our resources should be concentrated on the development of relatively unimportant exports, while we suffer those which are capable of indefinite expansion to the great advantage of all parts of the country to wither and die.  No economy can long endure one fragment of which is relatively rich and the rest of which is suffered to sink into poverty.  This country cannot endure if one province is to be well-to-do and three provinces are to be poor.</P>
    <P>The object of our Government and <Col N="452" /> the object of our economic policy should be to create a national income in which all sections of the community could equitably share.  The present situation is that with a national income which, so far as I see, is substantially stable, at present one section may be improving their position&mdash;and it is a relatively small section compared with the agricultural section&mdash;but as it improves, agriculture goes down and as agriculture goes down, not only the farmers are suffering, but all those who get their living by them suffer also.  I do not want to see one half of this country denuded of its population and deprived of its livelihood.</P>
    <P>I see in the Minister's attitude in his Budget speech the kind of attitude which suggests that he wants to put all that side of the picture out of his mind and forget about it.  If he does that, he will do it at his peril and, what is worse, he will do it at our peril, too, because if one half of the country is substantially abandoned by the working population and there is nothing left in it but old people and children, it will be too late to reverse the process then.  It earnestly and urgently requires recognition and confirmation now that unless we are prepared to take the measures requisite to restore prosperity to the agricultural industry, we are living in a fool's paradise, and if Ministers of this Government really believe&mdash;which I do not think they do&mdash;that things are truly as the Minister for Finance would suggest in his speech, then the situation of the country is extremely dangerous and will become more so.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we will face the facts and instead of seeking to secure cheap political advantage by distributing small benefactions to various sections of the community on the suggestion of various interested bodies that make representations to the Minister from time to time, rather adopt a policy designed to secure that all will share in an expanding prosperity, there is great hope for this country.</P>
    <P>I believe in this country.  Most of us on this side of the House have staked all we have on the prospects <Col N="453" /> of the country thriving and prospering in the future.  If it should sink, we shall sink with it.  I have never believed personally, and no one on this side of the House has ever believed, that, given the right policy, this country cannot provide a good livelihood for our people in their own land.  I have seen this country brought low twice in my lifetime by the activities of the Fianna Fáil Party and twice in that period a dominant influence in those Governments was the Taoiseach.  I mean no personal reflection on him, but I believe the policies he stands for and in which he believes have in them great danger for the country and unless, now that he is removed from Departmental responsibility into the wider responsibility of presiding over the policy of the whole Government, he awakes to the simple fundamental facts that the future of Ireland very largely depends on our success in exploiting our principal natural resource, the land, and that there is no prospect for Ireland half-pauper and half well-to-do.</P>
    <P>We shall be in a bad way if the Taoiseach does not wake up to that for himself and I suppose we shall have a general election pretty soon and we can only bring this argument to the higher tribunal of the hustings.  If we cannot win here, then we shall do our best to win elsewhere and I am satisfied that sooner or later we shall get the chance through the voice of our people to do what is necessary to make this country what we would wish it to be.</P>

      <P>This debate is supposed to be about the Budget and, if Deputy Dillon does not mind, I propose to say a few words about it.  I suppose no higher compliment was ever paid in any Parliament to a Minister for Finance after introducing a Budget than to have the Leader of the Opposition make a speech and say nothing, or very little, about it.  Everybody knows that if any fault could be found with the proposals of the Minister for Finance or with the general policy which inspired these proposals, we would have had that fault categorically indicated by Deputy <Col N="454" /> Dillon instead of having him treat us to the homily he has just delivered.  I do not mind dealing with these more general aspects of national economic policy as well, but it is about the Budget we are supposed to be talking.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall say a few words about them.  If the Deputy will hold himself in patience, I shall deal with that question in due course.  The most general comment made by the public after the Budget Statement was an expression of astonishment that so much could be done with one penny on the packet of 20 cigarettes.  I do not know if Deputies opposite have really studied the scope of the Budget proposals and the extent to which they are designed, skilfully and carefully, to achieve the two objectives at which the Government were aiming: (1) to stimulate and assist the country's economic expansion, and (2) to reduce, in so far as it was possible to do so in this year, costs and prices and give specific reliefs where needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me for a moment direct the attention of Deputies to the scope of the Budget proposals, taking them under the two headings&mdash;on the one hand, those designed to stimulate economic expansion and, on the other hand, those designed to give the people the benefit of lower costs and prices, and lower taxation where that was possible.  There are three proposals relating to agriculture.  There is the new potash fertiliser subsidy which will come into operation on 1st September next, in addition to the phosphatic fertiliser subsidy already operating and producing quite substantial results.  There is the increased capital provision for agricultural credit and there is a new scheme of price supports for fat cattle exports.  These are substantial additions to the very considerable aids to agricultural expansion already contained in the Book of Estimates.  I think Deputies opposite have not referred to that aspect of the Budget for the precise reason that they know these proposals have been well received and fully supported <Col N="455" /> by those who are engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There are other proposals dealing with industrial production and industrial efficiency and costs.  We have abolished the tax upon heavy oil used in industrial plants, a tax imposed by the Coalition Government in 1956.  I described the tax at that time as the craziest tax ever imposed by a crazy Government and I undertook to remove it during the lifetime of this Government.  It has now gone. Deputy T. Lynch seems to have something to say.  Deputy T. Lynch is, I gather, the shadow Minister for Finance in the Fine Gael Party. Some time, he may be over here as Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have introduced another change which, although it will cost nothing in this year, is nevertheless of very great significance for the future of this country; that is the expansion in time of the tax exemption arrangements for profits earned in export trade.  As the Minister for Finance announced, the Finance Bill will provide for the extension of these reliefs, in time, up to the year 1974/1975.  In addition to extending them in time, it is proposed now to extend them also to cover profits earned by merchant houses exporting Irish goods not of their own manufacture.  Every Deputy who has studied economic history appreciates that the biggest development of export trade in other countries came through the enterprise of adventurous merchants rather than through manufacturers.  I was always perturbed by the practical difficulties of extending tax inducements for exports to merchants as distinct from manufacturers and I am very glad that the Minister for Finance now finds himself <Col N="456" /> in a position to announce his intention so to extend them and to overcome the practical difficulties involved.</P>
      <P>There are increased tax reliefs for mining companies and an extension of tax reliefs to the mining of gypsum. There is a complete exemption of harbour authorities from income tax.  That is a change in our tax system which, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I urged on successive Ministers for Finance for many years.  That change is in accord with the general view of the Government that the efficiency of our arrangements for transporting and exporting of goods is just as important to the progress of the country as the efficiency of our methods for producing goods.  I hope that the harbour authorities will use the relief given for the purpose of revising the costs and improving the efficiency of harbour facilities.</P>
      <P>There is a higher amortisation allowance for capital expenditure on hotels, which already appears to be operating as a very efficient stimulus to the provision of new hotels and the extension of existing ones.  There is the proposal to extend that inducement from hotels to holiday camps.</P>
      <P>There is also in the Budget Statement an indication of an intention to provide this year quite substantial capital sums to bring about an increased production of steel and turf, and to improve still further telephone, electricity and transport services.  All these provisions add to our system of aids and inducements to expansion and should have important economic consequences.</P>
      <P>Turn now to the second group of proposals in the Budget Statement, those that are related to costs and prices or to specific reliefs.  We have removed the import levies on clothing, furniture, toys, sports goods and fresh fruits.  We abolished the customs duty on bananas.  We have reduced the import duty on tinned salmon.  We have reduced the duty on table waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, as the House is aware, the P.A.Y.E. system of income tax collection will be introduced.  That involves some tax reductions for wage earners. I heard a statement made by Deputy <Col N="457" /> Corish in a radio broadcast in which he complained that workers will not benefit from the increase in the children's allowance in the income tax code which the Minister for Finance announced.  Remarks of that kind show how absurd criticism can become.  He said that a worker earning less than £14 a week will not benefit by the concession. Under the Bill introduced last year a worker earning £14, or less, per week with two children, will pay no income tax at all.  The Deputy is, of course, quite right in saying that he will not benefit by any reduction in the rate of taxation; you cannot go less than zero in matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>There has been an extension of death duty reliefs.  There are higher salaries and wages for civil servants, the Garda, the Army and teachers. Increases have been given to a number of State pensioners.  There will be improved social welfare insurance benefits under a Bill which has been introduced but has yet to be considered by the Dáil, including a new system of retirement pensions. &ldquo;Retirement pensions&rdquo; is not the term used in the Bill and is not, in fact, an accurate description of the proposal.  It is a term used previously, because that was what we had contemplated when we were originally preparing the Bill, but we ultimately decided that it was unnecessary and undesirable to impose a retirement condition in respect of these pensions.  Therefore, there is no retirement condition and the pensions are called &ldquo;contributory old-age pensions.&rdquo;  That, I agree, is the major development in the social welfare services which we contemplate this year.  But, in addition, the Budget provided for small improvements in non-contributory pensions and social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>We have reduced the tax upon newsprint used in the production of papers and periodicals; removed the tobacco dealers' licence fee; and reduced the beer and spirits retailers' licence fee.  Is there any Deputy opposite who will not agree with me when I say it is the best penny's worth this country ever got?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. But the social services legislation involves a charge on the Exchequer, which has to be provided for out of taxation. Deputy Dillon was very much concerned to tell us that we have every reason to be sorry for ourselves.  I am not at all sure that the main weakness in the Irish character, if there is any weakness at all, is an undue disposition to be sorry for ourselves. I personally hold the philosophy, which I think applies to nations as well as to individuals, that once you start getting sorry for yourself, you are finished.  I do not think there is any occasion to be sorry for ourselves.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the mentality which Deputy Corish revealed when he spoke last week and when he seemed to imply that Almighty God had put some mark on the foreheads of the Irish people which said they are always to be better fed and better off than those who live in Africa, Asia or some other parts of the world.  It is a fact that we are much better off than the great majority of mankind. Some people are better off than we are. No doubt we would all like to be the richest people in the world.  We are not that, but certainly from the point of view of the mass of mankind we are very well circumstanced indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, the national income increased in real terms by three and a half per cent.  There is no point at all in trying to disparage that achievement of our people.  When we were drawing up the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> published in 1958, we did not venture to plan for a higher annual rate of increase in national income than two per cent.  That three and a half per cent. improvement in the national income recorded in 1959 is most encouraging.  It means that if we can continue to increase the production of this country so as to yield a corresponding rate of increase in the years ahead, the doubling of the national income, to which the <i>Programe for Economic Expansion</i> is <Col N="459" /> directed and which we contemplated could be achieved in 25 years, will be achieved in 20 years instead.  That improvement last year was a real improvement.  It did not merely represent an adjustment to higher price levels of the same volume of output, as increases recorded in many previous years were.  On a money basis, the national income last year increased by 5 per cent.  There are at present some encouraging indications that we may do at least as well this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman when he spoke last week made reference to the limits of national taxation and to a statement, which he said I made some five or six years ago, to the effect that taxation had at that time reached the highest limits practicable.  He did not seem to have appreciated that the Budget which the Minister for Finance had just disclosed brought about a net reduction in taxation or to realise the significance of the statistics which he gave showing that central government taxation is now taking a lesser proportion of the national income than in previous years.</P>
    <P>All the indications available in the statistics published by the Central Statistics Office and reflected in the buoyant revenue which the Minister for Finance had available to him, do not mean we would not wish to be doing better or going ahead more rapidly. Of course we would.  Other countries we know have, during intensive periods of national effort, occasionally done much better than that.  But the important point&mdash;and this is the point which both Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman were at pains to avoid&mdash;is that we are not now going backwards as we were in 1956 and 1957; we are now going ahead.  I must confess I am astonished, as a professional politician watching other professional politicians in action, to hear leaders of the Fine Gael Party trying to represent to the people of the country the year 1956 as a sort of Golden Age.  Do they really think that the public memory is as short as all that?</P>
    <P>Whatever we achieve in this country, it must be by the methods of a free democratic society.  That means that <Col N="460" /> progress here, as in every other free society on the earth, depends upon a multitude of individual decisions, decisions which result from an understanding of the national need and the inducements which are provided by Government policy and not by methods of compulsion or dictatorship.  If we are to endeavour to achieve our national progress by the means which are open to a free democratic society, then we have to recognise that if one section drags its heels, it could by so doing hold up the national progress and could even, by following perverse policies, bring it to a stop altogether. I think the great achievement of the present Government is that we are beginning to secure understanding amongst the people, by our policy of speaking frankly and directly to them, not only of the essential requirements of progress but of the extent to which it depends on the efforts of all of us. The days are gone when people can be induced to believe that they can vote themselves to be prosperous or that employment and prosperity are things that a Government can turn on or off like water out of a tap.</P>

As far as this Government are concerned, let me make it clear we are not undertaking to bring about by our own efforts alone, by the enactment of legislation or the issue of decrees from Government Buildings all that can be or has to be done.  We have provided inducements by tax changes, by grants, subsidies and loans facilities, to all who are prepared to participate in the great effort to bring about expansion of the nation's productive capacity.  Everything depends on the extent to which these aids and inducements provided by Government policy can succeed in realising the objectives we have set ourselves.</P>

      <Col N="461" /> Deputy Dillon talked about Party interests.  We have no Party interest in this matter.

I can give this assurance, on my own behalf and on behalf of every member of the Government, that we will hew to the line of the policy we have laid down in the White Paper we have published, and let the next election look after itself.  We have never tried in our public speeches specifically to maintain public confidence in the Government.  What we are trying to do, and what we should try to get the co-operation of Deputies opposite in doing, is to get the nation to have confidence in itself.</P>
    <P>Let me be quite clear: any progress we achieve in this country will depend entirely upon ourselves, upon the fortitude, capacity and energy which we as a nation can put into what we do. Out on the other side of the Atlantic there is Puerto Rico, a small country in a situation not dissimilar to ours in which they are facing similar development problems to ours.  They started on their own campaign under a much more imaginative title than ours.  We called ours the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> while they gave their programme the name &ldquo;Operation Shoe Strap&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in that way conveying a compelling image of a virile nation whose self-respect would not allow itself to solve its basic economic problems except by its own efforts.  That is the kind of image of the Irish I should like to see presented to the world.  But, while there are some similarities in the circumstances of the two countries, we are starting off our campaign with advantages the Puerto Ricans have not yet got.  We have not to pull ourselves up by our shoe straps though we may have to give a hitch to our braces.  We have here, already, all the basic requirements of economic development: <Col N="462" /> a sound banking system and a sound currency, adequate transport and communication facilities, fertile land, a temperate climate and an intelligent, adaptable people, and we are now getting ourselves better organised to use these very great assets for the nation's progress.</P>
      <P>I would ask Deputies opposite, however, not to try to brush away, or fail to understand, the significance of what is happening in this country at the present time.  Look, for example, at the character of the new industrial products which are now being announced almost daily in the newspapers&mdash;the organisation of an industry for the building of deep sea ships in Cork, the considerable expansion of the manufacture of steel, the new heavy metal working industries in Killarney, Galway, Dundalk and elsewhere.  We have gone a very long way from the packaging and finishing plants with which our industrial revival began.</P>
      <P>I know there is concern in agriculture because there appear to be limits to the scope for the development of exports in some of our traditional lines.  We know that in cattle, beef, sheep and lambs there are possibilities of greater trade, but in regard to butter and bacon, let us face the fact that market conditions are difficult, that exports have to be subsidised and that that can create problems for us.  However, there is no suggestion in the minds of any members of the Government&mdash; as Deputy Dillon appeared to imply&mdash; that these forms of production should be allowed to disappear.  I am personally convinced that milk production will again become a viable economic activity in this country as technical developments open up new markets for milk and milk products, and as world demand expands.  I think it is a good business to stay in milk, even at some present cost, taking all these long term prospects into account.  But this must be emphasised again and again&mdash;everything that tends to increase the efficiency of its production, particularly proper grass land management, is vitally important to the future of the industry.</P>

      <P>If there appear to be limits to the scope for development in some of our traditional lines, there are unlimited opportunities, in my view, for development in the production of processed fruit and vegetables. I hope Deputies fully appreciate the importance of the new enterprise announced last week by the Irish Sugar Company.  The success of that development initiated last week could be the salvation of rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are two points I want to make in that regard.  It is not intended, or desired, that the Sugar Company should have any monopoly in that development.  The aim is to show what is possible and our hope is that private enterprise will follow along the road which the Sugar Company is now blazing.  The second point is that it is essential, if we are to succeed in that field to the extent I believe to be possible, we should proceed on a strictly commercial basis from the beginning.  The idea of subsidies should not be thought of.  It is only on commercial lines we can succeed and achieve the full potential and full possibilities which are there to be realised.</P>
      <P>I am convinced also that there is another major field for development and that is in fish and fish processing. The Government have recently received the report from the Swedish expert consultant who was engaged to report on the improvement of fishing harbour facilities and his report is now under consideration.  Our active and energetic Minister for Lands who, like the rest of us, is an enthusiast and an optimist in regard to this development, is now seeking expert advice from F.A.O., the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations, as to the lines upon which our fisheries should be developed as an export industry, how to develop catching capacity, how to improve processing facilities, how to develop our marketing arrangements, how to attract the necessary capital and we intend to explore fully the possibilities of a major development in that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> If, in addition to the strides which ordinary manufacturing industry is now making, we can exploit to the full the possibilities of our horticulture and fisheries, then the foundations of our national economy can be made very sound indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spent a large part of his time analysing, or purporting to analyse, the economic statistics made available to him in a Government publication. Deputy Sweetman last week also queried the form in which these statistics were published and he went on to suggest that the form was determined by the Government's desire to conceal information from the public. That brochure, <i>Economic Statistics</i>, was prepared before the Budget for the first time last year.  If we wanted to conceal information from the public we could have done as the previous Government did, withhold the information until much later in the year when it would become available to Deputies in the ordinary Statistical Summary.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the House would consider the policy of the Government, as expounded in the Budget Statement, with all the available information previously in the hands of Deputies we commenced the policy of publishing that brochure.  That, indeed, has been our aim from the beginning: to give the public all the information&mdash; the reliable information&mdash;that we can get regarding the national position because it is our conviction that it is only by giving accurate and reliable information about the national problems and the national opportunities that we can get from the public the response that we desire.</P>
    <P>In this regard Deputies opposite are playing round with a term called &ldquo;the total labour force&rdquo;, which was used in this brochure last year.  I confess I am not very clear as to what the term means.  It seems to me to be an extremely vague concept.  If it means the number of workers who are insured under the Social Insurance Act, then, that is a definite figure which can be calculated from time to time.  If it means all the people in the country who could be induced, under any circumstances, to take work for wages, even married women or relatives assisting farmers on <Col N="465" /> their farms, then it is a different picture altogether and, in my view, a completely wrong type of concept to insert into our statistical returns.</P>
    <P>However, we do not have to get involved in these statistical arguments in order to understand what is happening in so far as there is information available to us.  Deputy Dillon did recognise that in many respects the available information is unreliable and already, as he would have seen from this brochure, the Central Statistics Office has had to revise quite drastically estimates for employment published in respect of the years 1957 and 1958.  Right throughout the whole of that document the compilers, the officials of the Central Statistics Office, have emphasised the margin for error that there is in the available information and that will persist until we take the next census in 1961.</P>
    <P>Unreliable statistics are always dangerous when used as a basis for policy decisions, and that is why members of the Dáil should be at pains not to allow themselves to be led into false conclusions by a too casual, a too superficial, reading of reports of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that we experienced last year, as in previous years, a decline in the number of people occupied in agriculture.  The decline is put by the Central Statistics Office at 2.1 per cent., that is, as in June, 1959, compared with June, 1958. The point, however, which every Deputy should realise, is that there is nothing happening in this country in regard to employment in agriculture that is not happening in every country in Europe.  It is completely erroneous for Deputy Dillon to talk about that experience of ours as indicating the erosion of the economic foundations of the State.  He will see from the available figures that the number of people occupied in agriculture in Denmark last year declined far more substantially than it did here.  There are very few people who do not think that Denmark has been going ahead strongly in its agricultural industry.  There are, I am certain, no politicians in <Col N="466" /> Denmark talking about these figures as implying the erosion of the economic foundations of their State. The fact is that in every country in Europe a similar movement of people out of agriculture has been recorded. The movement recorded here is not different from the average for Europe as a whole, and in many countries, such as Denmark, the number of people occupied in agriculture is declining considerably more rapidly than it is here.</P>
    <P>Who are these people who are leaving agriculture?  They are mostly young boys and girls who are expected by their fathers to give unpaid work on the family farms.  Are we to regard it as a disaster, an erosion of the economic foundations of the State, that these young boys and girls are moving out to employment in which they are paid?  I refuse to look at it in that light.  But, if there has been that diminution in the number of people occupied&mdash;&ldquo;employed&rdquo; would be the wrong term to use&mdash;in agriculture, why should that be used to conceal the fact that a very reliable statistic, the number of insurance stamps purchased, shows that at the end of last year, December 1959, there were 11,500 more people on the average, one week on the other, in employment, as compared with the corresponding period of 1958?  Is there no Deputy opposite who can find it in his heart to rejoice at that evidence of the improvement in the national circumstances?</P>
    <P>During the course of the speeches made on the Budget last week Deputy Corish referred, in a way which considerably misrepresented me, to a statement which I had made regarding wage increases in an earlier debate here on the Vote on Account and Deputy Sweetman represented me on the same occasion as having criticised these increases.  Here is precisely what I said.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am doing so.  However, I am sorry, I have not got the text of his statement here.  Here is what I said on the Vote on Account:</P>
      <P>Let me make it clear that neither I, nor any member of the Government, nor any Deputy on this side of the House, grudges the workers concerned the advantages which they have secured by these increases. We knew that the national income had expanded somewhat, that the level of production in industry had improved and for that reason the country could stand some improvement in living standards without adverse consequence on the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>But, I went on to refer to three aspects of that development with which the Government were concerned.  The first of these was the social and economic implications of a situation in which wage and salary earners alone seemed to be benefiting from that improvement in the national income; the second was the effect on the cost of living; and the third was the possible effect upon our export trade.  Should not we be concerned about these matters?  I cannot understand the mentality that would suggest that we should avoid reference to these very important considerations of policy just because it might be possible to misrepresent what was being said or politically inadvisable to say it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the implications of a situation in which it seemed that one section of our people only, the wage and salary earners, were benefiting from the improvement in national income recorded, I said this&mdash;as Deputies know, I then foreshadowed the action which the Government has since taken in relation to farm incomes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am certain that the workers who have received wage increases during the past few months will not begrudge paying something more for some farm products to enable farmers and farm workers to get some benefit also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can say with confidence that the public reaction to the decisions taken <Col N="468" /> and announced by the Government justifies what I said on that occasion.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, these increases in prices implemented by Government decision affected butter and milk.  I am conscious of the fact that the Government decision to increase the price paid to milk suppliers appears to be contrary to the general economic policy of the Government which is, as has been repeatedly asserted, directed towards helping producers to reduce production costs and thereby to make the constitution of export business in milk products likely.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies appreciate, higher prices paid to suppliers for milk delivered to creameries not only involves higher export deficiency payments when butter exports resume but also involves immediate problems for other exporters of milk products, such as chocolate crumb, who, because a higher price is now being made for milk delivered for butter manufacture, have themselves to pay a higher price for the milk they require for their manufacturing processes.  The Minister for Finance has had to add £550,000 to his Budget this year to cover a possible Exchequer liability in respect of exports of both butter and other dairy products, pending the establishment of the new Dairy Produce Board foreshadowed in a White Paper published by the Government a short time ago.</P>
    <P>The justification for that decision, notwithstanding the apparent conflict with the general policy of the Government and the consequences of it, is that we desired to give a direct benefit to an important section of the farmers, the most important section of the farmers, and we could not see any method by which it could be given otherwise.  The fertiliser subsidies are of tremendous importance and have this very great value, that they confer the greatest advantage on the most progressive farmers.  The more progressive the farmer, the more benefit he gets out of them.  But the increased use of fertilisers involves all farmers in some outlay.  Notwithstanding the subsidies, the much higher yields which the more extensive and <Col N="469" /> intelligent use of fertilisers brings about, some outlay is involved.  We could not meet the immediate situation as we saw it merely by the extension of the fertiliser subsidy system which we are operating.</P>
    <P>Our wheat is dear.  The price we pay for Irish wheat is dear in relation to the world price, and there is obvious reason for concern over the fact that the existing price tends to produce too much wheat, which will involve almost certainly the reintroduction of the levy this year.  Barley and oats sold off farms, omitting for the moment the barley and oats sold to brewers or oatmeal millers, are mainly sold to other farmers and higher prices to some producers would just mean higher costs to others.</P>
    <P>Then there was the final consideration that milk is the foundation of our cattle trade, which is the country's chief export trade, and taking the long-term prospect into account, it is important that our dairy herds should not contract.  There was no method of increasing the return to producers, of giving a higher price for milk delivered to creameries other than by increasing the price to home consumers. Definitely and clearly, this Government do not contemplate returning to any system of food price subsidies.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that the higher butter price may turn some part of the public demand to margarine and thereby increase our butter export surplus, involving the operation of the levy on the creameries to meet their share of the deficiency payments on exports.  It is all, as many Deputies, I am sure, understand, part of a very intricate problem, and the Government took the decision which appeared best to them in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>These increases in butter and milk prices arise directly as a consequence of the higher wage levels now operating. Some other price increases following on higher wages have taken place, and there may be more.  It is too soon yet, however, to say to what extent the general price level will be <Col N="470" /> affected, because there are many factors operating.  Some of the Budget provisions will tend to check any general increase in prices and offset those that have occurred by making possible reductions elsewhere.  The slight downward movement in prices which was noticeable in the second half of last year is not likely to continue, but I do not think it probable that any increase in prices that may take place in the immediate future will bring the cost of living index higher than this time last year, above the mid-May index of 1959.</P>
    <P>As regards the possible effect of higher wage levels on export trade development.  I can see no sense whatever in trying to conceal from the people the elementary facts of our situation, and these can be very clearly and simply stated.  We can increase employment here, in this situation that Deputy Dillon was complaining about, and raise the living standards of our people only if we can expand exports. Higher exports are possible only if our prices are competitive.  In no part of the world are there any people who are willing to buy our products for any reason except that they can get them at prices competitive with those of other suppliers.</P>
    <P>The effect of higher wages on production costs must be offset in whatever way is possible, offset by changes in management procedures, changes in production methods.  If they are not offset, the resulting higher prices will reduce sales, cause unemployment and reduce the prospect of future improvements.</P>
    <P>That is what I and other Ministers have been saying to the workers, to the leaders of the workers, to the general body of our people.  Nobody is thinking of trying to bring about that adjustment of costs following wage increases by methods of legal compulsion.  It has got to be achieved in the only way possible in a free society, by a more general understanding of these elementary considerations by all concerned.  That understanding is growing, very particularly in the Irish trade union movement.  The statements made by trade union leaders and their active and enthusiastic participation <Col N="471" /> in the work of the National Productivity Committee are an indication of that.  Now, as I see it, the main problem is to get these considerations equally well understood amongst business managements.  I do not have to tell Deputies opposite or any other Deputies that there are some very queer and very antiquated ideas still prevailing in some management circles.</P>
    <P>We wish to see the problem of relating wages to productivity, and rising with productivity, dealt with by an agreement between the parties.  We hold that the duty and the right to organise the people's work belongs to those immediately interested, the employers and the employees.  If the Government can help to solve any problems, we would, on the joint request of the parties, be very willing to try to do so but in view of our general approach to the issue and in view of the acceptance by all Deputies that these are matters that have to be resolved outside the House, resolved by agreement between the two parties in industry, we think it is bad business for anybody here to try to confuse the workers in their minds about them by misleading statements.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of economic development, as we understand it, is to make the people as a whole, and particularly the wage earners, better off than they are now and to bring about, if possible, a continuous improvement in their living standards.  It is a matter of major national policy, as we see it, whether by using that term &ldquo;making the country better off,&rdquo; we mean creating more jobs and ending unemployment or mean, alternatively, higher wages and higher living standards for a diminishing number of workers.  We, as a community, have to make up our minds on that very fundamental question.</P>
    <P>In the Government's view&mdash;and the Government have never hesitated to express their views in this regard&mdash;it is far better business for this country to use our expanding resources to create more employment.  Everything we have said and done is directed towards getting that idea generally accepted and applied throughout the <Col N="472" /> country's economic organisation.  A remark made by Deputy Sweetman here last week appeared to imply that he shared that view but apparently he thought it was, nevertheless, good tactics to criticise the Government for having expressed it.</P>
    <P>In other countries, so far has the acceptance of that idea gone already that agreements have been negotiated and exist between employers and workers' organisations to meet periodically to examine the available information relating to output trends and to consider the prospects and problems of continuing the expansion of activity within their economies, and then to agree on the extent to which improvements already won or reasonably anticipated justify improvements in the living standards of the workers without danger to their employment.</P>
    <P>That is a far more intelligent approach than the old &ldquo;law of the jungle&rdquo; attitude and the Government hope that we, in this country, can progress in that direction also.  If expansion of the national income continues, we can expect to have, and to enjoy, a continuing improvement in our living standards, provided we keep our aims and our ambitions within the limit of our resources, and have primary regard to the need for increasing investment activity, so that total employment will continue to increase, and ensure that all sectors of our people, the farmers and the farm workers, participate fairly and also appropriate a due share of further additions to the resources of the State to the improvement of our education, health and social welfare services.</P>
    <P>That is another factor which arises in this connection and I referred to it when speaking in the debate on the Vote on Account.  I said:</P>
    <P>I hope the country will always be willing to accept the proposition that when any expansion in national resources is brought about by increased activity in agriculture, industry or in any other economic field, some part of the added resources thus gained will be used to relieve personal hardship due to causes outside the control of individuals...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> That means, in practice, an improvement of our social welfare services.</P>
    <P>This year, because of the increase given to the old age pensioners last year, the cost of the old age pension service is up by £1,000,000.  I mentioned also in the course of that debate on the Vote on Account how heartbreaking it is when we are considering possibilities in that direction to discover how meagre are the benefits that can be given, with a very great cost. If we had not to meet the cost of that increase in the old age pensions last year, this year we could have either a further relaxation in taxation, further tax reliefs, or a more substantial increase in old age pensions.</P>
    <P>We are, as I said, making a further modest improvement in social welfare payments in the course of the year. The aim of Government policy&mdash;and I want to say this without any possibility of ambiguity whatsoever&mdash;is to keep on expanding our social welfare services in accord with increases in national income as they are brought about.  It is true, as Deputy Dillon endeavoured to emphasise in the course of his speech, that the higher insurance benefits which the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill will provide will necessitate increased contributions by workers in employment. That illustrates precisely what I have in mind, the need to emphasise and secure a willingness on the part of everybody to share the benefits which increased national income makes possible, in that way or in some other way, for those who otherwise would not participate at all in the improvements brought about in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>We, in the Government and in the Fianna Fáil Party, are not, as Deputy Dillon said we are in a speech over the weekend, under any illusions as to how things are going in the country. We see employment rising; we see unemployment declining; we see production and trade expanding.  We have never suggested that the country's rate of progress is adequate.  We have always tried to exhort our people into making a greater effort.  We believe that the way to do that is to convince <Col N="474" /> them in the first instance that they have the capacity to do it and to show them the fruits of success, not to go rooting in the bottom of the basket for some dead fish with which to discourage them.</P>
    <P>There is, as was made clear by the speech by the Leader of the Opposition, this evening, no alternative to the policy of the Government.  There is no political Party or other organisation in this country which has, in a consistent or systematic way, put forward an alternative to the policy which the Government are now applying.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has almost excelled himself this evening in his outline of Government policy and Government achievements. He almost equalled the speech of a a few months ago in which he announced that the Government and the country would be faced with a serious budgetary situation.  He asserted that then with as much confidence as he has just shown, and he made that assertion at a time when he <Col N="475" /> knew there could be no budgetary difficulty.  That was only a few short weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach charged the Leader of the Opposition with avoiding talking about the Budget, and then made a very good effort himself to avoid any reference to it either.  The Leader of the Opposition and the Fine Gael Party here has put forward the view that the only way to judge a policy or a programme is by its results.</P>
      <P>No matter how the Taoiseach or the Government may now try to paint a different picture, they will not succeed. Their statistics prove beyond question that unemployment is high and that fewer people are now employed in agriculture and industry than at any time in the past two or three years. It is clear to all except to those who are wilfully blind that the situation is not as good as it should be.</P>
      <P>I could hardly believe my ears when the Taoiseach said that this Budget impresses upon the people that they cannot vote themselves prosperity.  In the course of elections in the past 30 years there was never an occasion when Fianna Fáil did not assert that all the people had to do to achieve prosperity was to vote Fianna Fáil. In their 1932 election programme Fianna Fáil said that employment could be provided for 87,301 additional persons.  This afternoon, the Taoiseach blandly announced that they never said that they had additional jobs for a certain number of people. I have that old poster as evidence that the Fianna Fáil Party put it to the people that if they voted them into office they would achieve prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the former Taoiseach declare at Ballinasloe that they had decided to put aside a sum of £25 million&mdash;£5 million per annum to be spent for five years&mdash;to give employment in the western areas and to build up industries that did not meet with the requirements of the Industrial Credit Corporation or other such body.  The people of Ballinasloe and district listening to him were impressed to such an extent that if their mouths opened a little wider it would seem as <Col N="476" /> if one of the millions could drop into them.</P>
    <P>I asked shortly afterwards where the £25 million would come from.  I was told by a person in a position to know that there was no sum of £25 million available.  Today we have the proof of the pudding.  The people in the western counties who, the Taoiseach said, could vote themselves prosperity are locking their doors.  There are Deputies here from the western counties.  They will give statistics of the number of houses closed and of the number of families who have emigrated.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach challenged the Leader of the Opposition's statement that there has been an increase in the cost of everything.  I would refer the House to page 8 of <i>Economic Statistics</i> of this year, in which we read:-</P>
    <P>In 1959, as compared with 1958, the output of cattle declined by 72,000 or by about £5 million in value.  The value of total milk output fell by £2.2 million and the output of pigs by £1.7 million.  A fall of £1.4 million in the output of sheep and lambs was offset to some extent by a rise of £.07 million in wool.</P>

    <P>Who is right?  Can it be that the people who prepared the statistics are frauds and do not know what they are talking about?  This document is issued with the authority and under the supervision of the Taoiseach's Department.  He is the real authority.  He then says that unemployment is decreasing and employment is increasing.  He makes that statement when everybody knows that the total number of people employed to-day has been reduced by 51,000. One has not to check any statistics to <Col N="477" /> find that out.  All one has to do is to look at any church congregation or any area where it was usual for groups of people to come together at certain times.  They are not there now.  Only the older people and the young people are left.</P>
    <P>A great number of people were frightened by the Taoiseach's announcement of a dangerous and difficult budgetary situation.  They heaved a sigh of relief when this year's Budget proposals were announced. They feared the situation would be worse.  It is a very old technique to threaten that things will be very bad so that there will be a sigh of relief when they turn out to be not quite as bad as expected.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach explained today that when he said that taxation had reached the limit, that it could not extend any further, he meant the local sum of taxation at that particular time.  This afternoon, he said, in effect: &ldquo;What I wanted to say was that the percentage then of national production taken by taxation was too high.  National production has now increased to the extent that we have not increased taxation but, as a matter of fact, reduced it.&rdquo;  Surely the Taoiseach had his tongue in his cheek when making that assertion?  The Book of Estimates is up by several millions.  Local rates, post office charges and bus fares are up.  As I said already, it was a case of promising to take something off but putting more on instead.  It has ever been their philosophy in life.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach has such high hopes of the fertiliser project because it is true that if our farming community make full use of fertilisers they can increase production but it is essential that, when that increased production takes place, there must be a market for it and there must be compensation for the labour involved. It will be of no advantage whatever if there is an increase in production and then a fall in price, as happened with turkeys and pigs last year.  I do not want to go into the recent Trade Agreement but it has been properly said that, if the Government paid more attention to our markets and our <Col N="478" /> marketing system than they paid to proportional representation, the country would have been better served.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Budget should make provision for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Like Deputy Dillon, I am firmly convinced that that is not being properly handled at the moment.  It is very hard to get concrete evidence of what is happening but the complaints are many and serious.  I trust, without going into any further detail, that the Government and the Minister will see to it that they will get good value for whatever money is spent on the project.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach made a good deal of fuss about the increased production which would arise from steel and turf. Let us hope that there will.  Without desiring to comment on the matter of steel, outside of Grangegorman I do not think you would get a more insane scheme than that which we find there. The raw material comes down on the train.  It has to be transferred to a boat. It has to be taken off again, taken in and out again and put in a boat and once more put in the train.  Why could we not develop our steel industry on the mainland where one handling would be better?  However, it is there I suppose but it is part of the mad Fianna Fáil set up in which the costs of production are increased to a very considerable extent.</P>
    <P>I feel that before we put in these two new furnaces and all the costly machinery that will now be installed the whole question should be re-examined to ensure that if we are to have that expenditure, as in the case of the bovine tuberculosis scheme, we should get good value for our money.  With regard to turf production, let us hope we shall have a good year because if we have a good year, then agricultural production will go up because turf is included in it.  The better the season the higher turf production will be.</P>
    <P>We are told that there was an increase of 3 per cent. in production. The Taoiseach told us that one of the ways to judge this was by seeing the increase in the volume of exports.  We find this extraordinary situation as announced in the quarterly issue for <Col N="479" /> 1960 of the <i>Exporters' News Letter.</i>  It shows that the value of exports by groups of commodities is as follows: 1958, live animals, £47,292,000; 1959, £39,128,000; cattle, £38,460,000 in 1958 and £30,032,000 in 1959; foodstuffs, 1958, £38,869,000 and in 1959, £36,683,000.  Then follow drink and tobacco and so on right down the list. The net result is that the total exports for 1958 were £130,709,000 and in 1959 £129,744,000.  Where is the 3 per cent. increase?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said a moment ago that the way we were to judge the increase in productivity was to look at our exports.  In that connection all the Taoiseach is saying is what the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Aiken, said in Athlone, that instead of having to tighten our belts we would have to widen them: &ldquo;You could not sell the cattle and sheep to Britain and it was a great blessing.&rdquo;  Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that the national income is not based upon what we produce but on tourism and on capital coming into this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the national income made up of?  The test for the national income is whether we produce more for sale and for export.  If the national income has gone up by increased dividends from shares in Britain, the tourist trade and things of that kind, I shall accept that but that does not represent increased production. It is increased activity and that is the best you can say for it. That is dependent upon good weather conditions here and the good will of other people.  Even when some people kicked up a row about the export of horses, the tourist industry was endangered for a short while, since you had an agency saying they would not book any tourists for Ireland.  That had some effect&mdash;not much, I know. <Col N="480" /> It was a very windy threat.  However, we get these things now and again.</P>
      <P>On the documents produced by the Government bodies, it is clear that the case we make is substantiated, and that is that the policy of the Government has not the result which any of us would like it to have.  All of us want to see this country improving, economically and every other way.  We all have to live in it.  No matter what Party forms the Government, if the country does not improve all of us go down together.  Never at any time was it a satisfaction to any Irishman I know to see things going back, to see taxation increased, to see as much being taken out of the people's pockets as they were able to put in and to know that every burden put on them was bound to affect every section of the community in the long run.</P>
      <P>We have the Taoiseach telling us to-day that he has been able to convince labour that increased production is essential and that they realise that, and that the big job now is to convince everybody that it is essential. Quite blandly, he says that, of course, some of the managerial systems in business are antiquated.  If any member of Fine Gael said that any business in the country with which he was associated at any time had an antiquated managerial system, it would have been high treason.  It is a great comfort to know that he has found that out.  I am not aware of these, but if there are such, let us hope that they will take the Taoiseach's advice, because, for good or ill, the Government are the legitimate Government of the country and, while in office, have the obligation and the duty to improve the conditions of every section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach tells us that this Government have made substantial sums available for hotels and so on, I should like to ask him this question: Will the capital he is expending on these new hotels, and on the reconstruction of hotels, give the best return?  I feel that if some of that capital were directed by way of grant towards improving conditions on the farms, it would be a great help. <Col N="481" /> To build a hotel, you can get a 50 per cent. grant and a loan at a low rate of interest and then a further grant and loan for the furniture.  That is very valuable I know, and it is something which will benefit the tourist trade, but I am not satisfied that that expenditure is the best way to improve the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I thought the Taoiseach's best remark&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;was in regard to the new taxation relief on the profits of merchants in the export trade other than manufacture.  I think that is right but he used a phrase which struck me as being rather peculiar. He referred to the &ldquo;enterprise of adventuresome merchants.&rdquo;  It was the enterprise of adventuresome merchants that had always brought profit to the country he said, and I thought to myself: &ldquo;Good Lord, think of the adventuresome merchants&mdash;Jameson in the South Africa raid and Clive in India!&rdquo; They were certainly adventuresome merchants.  It is a phrase which should not have been used. They should have been described as merchants who were showing intelligence and business ability.  But &ldquo;adventuresome merchants&rdquo; was not a happy phrase and I do not think they will thank the Taoiseach for that description of them.</P>

      <P>The enterprise of adventuresome merchants, the Taoiseach said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, of course, that there are adventuresome merchants in Mountjoy trying to get out.  However, we cannot help that.  To return to where I was, it is true to say that the people gave a sigh of relief that things were not worse but they are disturbed by the various ways in which the nation's money is being expended&mdash;not indeed that they grumbled about the small pittance of one shilling a week for the old age pensioners and others.  It is valuable and I suppose it could be said that the shilling a week could meet the increased cost of bread and butter. It has that value and far be it from me to say it has not got it; but at the <Col N="482" /> same time, there is the threat, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare told us this evening, that under the new social welfare arrangements an additional £4 million per annum is to be taken from the employer and the employee. They will get a benefit, provided they live to the age of 70.  If they do not live to the age of 70, they will have contributed towards the benefit of their fellowmen.  In the long run, however, on the figures that have been produced, it is quite clear that this is an impost upon industry and the workers and the State, while making a big to-do about it, is to get away with the lowest possible sum from the Exchequer.  The sum of £300,000 approximately is to be the additional State expenditure.  That is a cheap way of doing a thing and pretending it will be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>I finish as I started by saying that three years' activity by the Government has left conditions much worse than they were.  I am saying they were good but there was such an attack on them then and such denigration of the Government then that one is astounded, when things are much worse than they were then, that the Government of the day should have the cheek and the audacity to say things are very bright and that nobody should say differently.  I believe that this Government never had a policy. I heard the Taoiseach say there was no alternative policy and, of course, again he was talking with his tongue in his cheek.  That is the sort of thing that would have been said in 1932 or 1937. Nobody could put up a policy against the policy they put up but they did not intend to put theirs into effect and they never did.</P>

The truth is that Fianna Fáil could not have put their policy into operation because they never meant to do so.  On the other hand, we have in Fine Gael a policy which can be and will be, please God, put into effect at an early date.  Unless and until that policy is put into effect this country can never make economic headway.  When you consider that this Government got into office on a programme that was to reduce taxation, that they have instead increased it, that they said the rates were too high and would have to be cut down and that the country would have to get complete de-rating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Taoiseach today was quite amazing because he does not usually resent criticism.  The theme of his whole speech today was that there should not be any word of criticism from this side of the House or from any part of the country and he deplores, as he said, the attitude&mdash;as did, of course, the Minister for Finance&mdash;of members of the Opposition who tried to enlarge upon the unsatisfactory features of our economic situation.</P>
      <P>Either we have an Opposition or we have not, and surely the Taoiseach does not expect that the most that an Opposition desire to say is: &ldquo;Sure, the Government are doing their best&rdquo;. If this is their best, we believe it is not good enough and that is why we make the criticism.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says we should not enlarge upon the difficulties of the present situation and the difficulties of the present Government.  He must have a very short memory because surely his mind can go back pretty quickly to 1956.  Mark you, he was a very severe critic of the Government at that time but we did not go around crying: &ldquo;Do not hit me now with the child in my arms.&rdquo;  That is what the Taoiseach is saying at the present time &mdash;&ldquo;Do not criticise now because we have certain difficulties: do not attempt to talk about the difficulties we have in agriculture, in emigration, in employment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think from the Taoiseach's remarks that Deputies are unpatriotic to speak or to criticise the Government at present but he it was who protested when he was in Opposition that it was the duty of the Opposition to be a watch-dog, to be ever vigilant and ever critical.  If we were to sit in this Assembly and merely <Col N="485" /> say that the Government was doing its best and that we should not criticise them, we could never make any progress.  We remember the attitude of the Taoiseach during 1956 when this country was in a difficult situation and when those difficulties were not, to a very large extent, created by the Government in power at that time. We are big enough, and grown-up enough to admit, as the Taoiseach has only recently admitted, that this country is, to a very large extent, dependent on outside influences, whether they be good or evil.</P>
    <P>We had a particular difficulty in 1956 due to the attitude of the Bank of England and the attitude of the British Government in regard to a credit squeeze and the Bank rate.  We were also subject to the difficulties of the Suez situation.  Deputies opposite laughed and still laugh when anybody talks about the Suez situation difficulties. We were also subject to the difficulty that cattle did not fetch good prices in Britain and our economy suffered as a result.  But we did not resent any criticism from the Taoiseach or his present Ministers, from the Tánaiste or the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for External Affairs.  We faced that criticism but the Taoiseach now says we are unpatriotic if we attempt to criticise the Government or to try to tell the people what we believe the real situation is.</P>
    <P>Talking about sabotage and unpatriotic actions, the Taoiseach was once&mdash;in 1956, I think&mdash;in control of three newspapers in this country. They did tremendous damage to the country in times other than when there was a Fianna Fáil Government in power.  Do we not remember the exaggerated reports of factories closing down, of unemployment and of emigration?  We can recall, in one case that I remember, an article in one organ when a number of young girls were going to America to become nuns.  They were represented in the <i>Irish Press</i> as being emigrants.  Does the Taoiseach not remember that or does the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance not remember it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Do they not remember what was said in 1956 and what was appearing in the three organs of the Government Party?  If two or three people were sacked in Burtonport, Ennis or Scariff we had reports in the newspapers about &ldquo;mass sackings&rdquo;. We had gross exaggeration by these organs and by Fianna Fáil spokesmen about emigration but, listening to the Taoiseach today, one would think that none of us, as Deputies in our constituencies, was concerned about employment and unemployment, about the establishment of factories.</P>
      <P>I think every Fianna Fáil Deputy and every other Deputy can say of his colleagues or his opposite numbers in his own constituency that they have shown a real interest in the promotion of employment and in the establishment of factories.  One would imagine from the Taoiseach's remarks that we make criticism merely to create mischief. Such is not the case.  As was stated here recently, we in the Labour Party believe in the Irish nation and our ability to solve our own difficulties.  The difference between us and Fianna Fáil is that we believe Fianna Fáil are not tackling these difficulties correctly, and we believe that we can.  I was amazed that the Taoiseach should disparage so greatly this publication <i>Economic Statistics</i> produced by the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>I remember many occasions here when, if there was one word said about the figures produced by the Central Statistics Office, the former Taoiseach nearly threw a fit.  The suggestion that the figures produced by the Central Statistics Office were wrong used to send him into a frenzy and to a very large extent, I think, he was sensible in his reaction.  If we cannot depend on the figures, the statistics compiled and the information generally produced by the Central Statistics Office, where can we get statistics upon which we can rely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These statistics, of course, do not <Col N="487" /> make good reading.  They are not good reading for anyone who alleges that there has been progress here over a number of years.  They are not good reading for any Fianna Fáil Deputy who wants to allege there has been progress in the past three years.  They are very sorry reading, indeed, but it is a shameful thing that the Taoiseach should come in here today and to a very great extent repudiate the figures produced by a section of his own Department.</P>
    <P>He says the only true statistics are those compiled in a census year.  The last census year, according to him, for some of this information was the year 1951.  Is it right that we should have no reliable information about employment, industrial production, agricultural production, agricultural output and the national income since 1951?  It must be remembered that when Fianna Fáil were out of Government they quoted these very same statistics in discussions here on the Budget, on the Vote on Account and on various other matters over the years 1954 to 1957.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Taoiseach is serious when he says we should not refer to these figures.  He said that the figures, with regard to exports and imports, are not reliable.  Is it not a sad reflection on the country that we have it to say that for nine years we have had no reliable figures on important aspects of our economy? We believe these figures are the best we can get and, contrary to what the Taoiseach said, there are not many reservations in relation to the figures produced in this booklet.  There are some footnotes that there have been slight revisions, but only slight revisions.  There are also some footnotes to the effect that the figures for certain parts of the year 1959 may not be entirely accurate.</P>
    <P>Remembering that, surely it is wrong to incorporate figures which cannot be guaranteed as to accuracy for a particular period in a booklet of this kind.  We accept the figures for what they are because, if there was an error in 1959, surely there was an error in 1955, 1956, 1957 <Col N="488" /> and 1958.  Surely there were footnotes to that effect in the other years and surely the necessary corrections were made subsequently.  Having regard to the fact that, on balance, mistakes can be made, I do not think it is unreasonable for any member of this House to use these figures for the purpose of his argument.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite wrong that the Taoiseach should speak after the fashion he did to-day in regard to these figures.  It is quite legitimate for us to use any arguments we can to show that the country is not as prosperous as the Taoiseach would have us believe it is.  If people, generally, are led to believe that everything in the garden is lovely, we shall not get the effort for which the Taoiseach called to-day.  Listening to the Taoiseach to-day, one would imagine that we have at last turned the corner, the corner to which he so often refers here.</P>
    <P>I said here last Wednesday that Fianna Fáil spokesmen and members of the Government describe 1958 as the year of recovery as compared with the years when an inter-Party Government were in office, a Government other than Fianna Fáil.  The year 1959 is described as a year of progress. I do not believe 1958 or 1959 were years of either recovery or progress. I hope, and everybody hopes, that there will be some progress in the year 1960.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach today tried to play down the figures with regard to employment on the land.  Employment on the land has diminished. There are many reasons for that diminution.  One of the reasons&mdash;it may not be the most important one&mdash; is the fact that machinery was introduced so very rapidly in the past ten years.  Certainly in the past four or five years, there has been an altogether too rapid introduction of machinery in rural Ireland on the land and on the roads.  We have been deliberately diminishing employment on the land without getting a substantially increased production.  For the past ten years, we have been diminishing employment on the roads through the introduction of machinery.  None of <Col N="489" /> us would object to machinery, if the machines were assembled here but the position was that British, German, Canadian and U.S.A. workers were manufacturing the machinery we imported to render thousands and thousands of farm hands and road workers unemployed.  The situation is more grotesque when one remembers that these farm hands and road workers had to leave their own country and go to Britain, and elsewhere, to manufacture the machinery which rendered them unemployed at home.</P>
    <P>With regard to unemployment on the land, the Taoiseach said very positively that those who were rendered unemployed and who emigrated to Britain, and possibly elsewhere, were mainly the sons of farmers who could not be sustained on the incomes their fathers derived from the land. It would appear that the Taoiseach has not studied this document produced by a section of his own Department, the Central Statistics Office.  The overall decrease in the numbers of males engaged in farm work between 1957 and 1959 was 9,500; 9,500 fewer workers were employed on the land in all capacities from 1957 to 1959. In the case of the permanent agricultural worker, the number was reduced by 2,200 from 1957 to 1959.  From 1957 to 1959, the number of temporary workers was reduced by 3,000.  Then the Taoiseach tells us that the greater part of the reduction in the numbers employed on the land is accounted for by the sons of fathers who could not sustain them on the land.</P>
    <P>Where are we if we do not know how many people we have employed in the country?  If we cannot rely on these figures, we are entitled to throw out any figure we like.  The Government side can say that we have 100,000, 300,000 or 500,000 more employed now than three years ago, while we, on this side, can say that there are 100,000 or 500,000 fewer. But we prefer to rely on the statistics produced by the Taoiseach's Department. They show to anybody who can read that there were, in 1959, 51,000 fewer workers than there were in 1956.  There is no use pretending otherwise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> I do not know what the Taoiseach meant when he said I tried to misrepresent his statement concerning the last round of wage increases given to the workers.  I have the reference.  I quote from the debate of last Wednesday.  I said:</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach when he spoke here on the Vote on Account; his words were to the effect that the Government were most seriously concerned about the recent wage increases.  He also, like many other people in the country, seemed to have the impression that the workers had done very well so far as wage increases were concerned. The Taoiseach may not have said it in that speech but he did say on other occasions that workers were justified in obtaining increases if there was increased production as a result.</P>
    <P>I did not attempt to take the Taoiseach to task on that occasion but I used what the Taoiseach had said merely to make a point about the workers' share in the increase in national income.  The Taoiseach said the workers were entitled to an increase, provided they showed an increase in production.  On the figures from 1955 to 1959, they did show an increase in production.  In 1955, the volume of industrial production, base 1953, was 107.5 and the number of persons engaged therein was 156,600.  In 1959, the figure increased to 114.5 with fewer workers, 155,100.  I merely made the point, and I want to make it again&mdash;not for the Taoiseach or the members of the Government who know&mdash;that although the national income increased by 5 per cent. from 1958, the worker's share of that was less than 4 per cent.  Yet many people continue to think the workers have got more than their share.</P>
    <P>If we cannot use the statistics produced by the Taoiseach's office, our guess is as good as anybody's, as far as emigration is concerned.  Even without statistics like these, I remember that Fianna Fáil in 1954 and 1957 used to allege fantastic figures for emigration at that time.  No figure was big enough to throw at the then <Col N="491" /> Government.  It was expressed in terms of 50,000, 60,000 and 70,000. None of us wants to see emigration or to be critical of the Government because people emigrate.  Apart from politics&mdash;and I note that the Taoiseach described himself as a professional politician today&mdash;it is galling for us, for Fianna Fáil Deputies, for every member of the House to see individuals and families leaving the country.  We do not want to see people emigrate.</P>
    <P>There is no point in disguising the fact, however, that Fianna Fáil have not stopped emigration.  I did not expect them to do so.  I do not think that any member of Fianna Fáil believed&mdash;even though they made speeches to that effect&mdash;that they could stop emigration in two or three years. But it is wrong for the Taoiseach or any member of the Government or the Fianna Fáil Party to tell us that the emigration tide has been stemmed.  It has not.  The indications are that emigration is taking place at the same pace; perhaps slightly greater than last year and a little less than the year before, but it is still going apace.  It is idle for anybody to pretend that emigration has in any way diminished.</P>
    <P>Here, in three cuttings from one of the papers in Wexford, are examples of how this question of emigration is brought home to our people:</P>
    <P>Emigrated&mdash;Messrs.  James Kavanagh and Daniel Kendrick, two well-known men from Rathangan district, emigrated to England on Saturday week and have found employment.</P>
    <P>It goes on to tell us something about the two gentlemen concerned.  Then we have:</P>
    <P>Emigrated&mdash;Mr. James Kelly, Garrynisk, Oylegate, left recently to take up a position in Scotland.  Mr. Pat Doyle, Coolamain, left on Saturday for employment in London.</P>
    <P>A third cutting says:</P>
    <P>Gone to England&mdash;Mr. Patrick O'Brien, Coonogue, Adamstown, left on Saturday night to take up employment in England...</P>
    <P>When I read that in my local papers in Wexford, I do not rub my hands <Col N="492" /> and say: &ldquo;Emigration has gone up again.&rdquo;  I do not know the five gentlemen mentioned but I know other people in Wexford town and various parts of the county, some of whom have been forced to emigrate and others who have voluntarily emigrated. I do not like to hear that&mdash;nobody does&mdash;but I think it is a wrong and shameful thing for the Taoiseach or any member of the Government to try to pretend that we rub our hands with glee when we hear of people emigrating to Great Britain and say to ourselves: &ldquo;This will be a further embarrassment for the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House, but I must refer to the Taoiseach's statement to-day when he said that people were surprised at what the Government could do with £1,000,000. Mind you, it is very surprising what can be done with £1,000,000 and, to give the Minister for Finance all credit, on the surface he did a fairly good job with that amount of money. However, the Taoiseach's statement reminded me that somebody said last week it was like a children's party, where each child is given a little present, let it be a little penny doll or a small box of sweets and they will go away happy, but if a big box of sweets were divided up between them that would be no good.  In his Budget the Minister for Finance did exactly that by giving a concession to the publicans, a concession to the dance halls, a concession to the cinemas and a concession to some groups in the income tax or surtax bracket, and this appeared to make the whole country happy.  It did appear to be an attractive Budget on Wednesday last, but, when its different implications sank in, there was disillusionment after two or three days.  If you ask the first ten people you meet on the street what they got out of the Budget, you find that the first nine got nothing.  It was a well painted picture, but I am afraid the varnish has gone off of it, and people are now asking themselves what was in it.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the 1s. increase was something old age pensioners did not expect.  When I say that I mean <Col N="493" /> they expected the usual hand-outs they get from Governments of 2/6 per week.  It was a sad thing for an old age pensioner of 75 or 80 years of age to know that that was all he was getting out of the Budget, while he was told that those who would become pensioners in 10 years' time, when he was gone off the face of the earth, would get a pension of 40 shillings per week on a contributory basis with no means test.  When all the indications are that the Government are going to save a substantial amount of money assisting old age pensioners, I believe they should now try to do something in a big way for those people who will not be alive to enjoy the benefits of the proposed contributory scheme.</P>
    <P>I have no details or inside information to refute what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare said today, that the estimated income from employers will be roughly £2,000,000 per year, and from employees another £2,000,000 per year. I believe it will be bigger.  I believe it will be bigger by anything from £500,000 to £1,000,000.  I may be wrong but I reckon that there are approximately 750,000 or 800,000 insured workers in the country at the present time.  The maximum increase in contributions will be 1/9d. per week.  I know agricultural workers pay somewhat less but, if we take an average of 1/6d. for the vast majority, there will be an increase in contributions of £3,800,000, and if there is an increase in the number of insured workers or in the average amount they pay in contributions the total will be £3,000,000.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary cannot estimate accurately what will be realised but I believe the saving to the State on existing old age pensions will be very substantial indeed.  I believe it is morally wrong to save at the expense of people who are now receiving a miserable 27/6d. per week.  Even if they live so long, a big number of them will not be able to qualify for the proposed 40/- per week because they will not have enough stamps or enough credits to fulfil the conditions <Col N="494" /> which it is obvious will be laid down in the Bill to be introduced.  Therefore, I think it would be only right if we were now to give them a fairly substantial increase before the new Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Once again, may I say that I do not see any indications in this Budget that it will do anything to alleviate unemployment and emigration?  We wish those connected with the various projects mentioned luck in the establishment of factories.  We wish the Government luck in any schemes of major importance that they undertake for the provision of employment but in conclusion, and as a note of warning to the Government, I want to say that to some extent our people are becoming cynics; do not make them too cynical.</P>
    <P>During the last three years more factories have been built in this country than would employ all our unemployed, according to the three newspaper organs of the Government Party. These same organs between 1954 and 1957, every day, every evening, and every Sunday, proceeded to close down factories but despite that there was no decrease in employment.  On the contrary the figures rose during those three years and were at a peak in what was called the crisis year of 1956. Employment was not affected by reason of the fact that the organs of the <i>Irish Press</i> closed down so many factories in that time, but during the past three years the <i>Irish Press</i> newspapers have been building factories all over the country and yet employment has gone down.  I want to say to the Government that they should not make people too cynical.  Do not pretend there is more employment in the country than there really is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is unusual inasmuch as an interval has elapsed since the Minister introduced his statement, and the customary commencement of the debate was deferred, due to the understanding that the Minister was not available.  That was a good thing because it gave all members of the House an opportunity to give it more consideration than would have been possible if the debate had commenced immediately <Col N="495" /> after the Ministerial statement.  Like Deputy Corish it has been my experience, and I am sure the experience of others, that the more consideration given to the Budget statement, and to the claims made on its behalf, the less attractive it became.  One's immediate reaction was different, but when one met the people one was considerably influenced by two things, one of which is the lack of interest in the Budget.</P>
      <P>I am sure any Deputy will agree with me, no matter to what Party he belongs, that we never had a more disinterested debate in this House from the point of view of public concern. The Public Gallery was never as empty on Budget Day during my membership of the House as this year, and any Deputy could bring in as many members of the public as he wished.  We can remember other occasions when intense public interest was evinced in the pronouncements of the Minister for Finance on Budget Day.  The explanation of the present lack of interest is that the people have come to realise that this Government launch small Budgets on every possible occassion during the year and thereby extract tax that would normally be levied in the annual Budget itself.</P>
      <P>It is not long since the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs increased charges relating to the Post Office.  Then we had the price of butter increased by 3d. a pound.  I can recall the occasion when the Taoiseach intervened in the debate on the Vote on Account.  He caused considerable interest by the tenor of his speech and by its content. It was my responsibility to rise after him and, at the time, I had to try to make a quick calculation of what he had in his mind.  I put forward a number of possible explanations but one to which I adverted is now proved to be the correct one, that the Taoiseach surprised the country by an announcement that he would have to increase taxation in the present Budget for an express purpose.  He led the agricultural community to believe that they would receive as a result of the Budget this year, substantial benefits to assist them in overcoming difficulties of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> Following on that statement, the Minister for Agriculture gave us the details before the Minister for Finance introduced the Budget, but what do we now find?  We find that what was presented by the Taoiseach as of considerable importance to the agricultural community was very little, indeed, in relation to the substantial losses that farmers have suffered over the last couple of years, but, on the other hand, the consumers&mdash;and when we talk of consumers we are talking of producers and consumers because the producer consumes as much, and quite often more that the general consumer, the people far removed from the production and preparation of foodstuffs &mdash; have to meet this additional impost of 3d. a pound on butter.  When this occurred before the Budget, is it any wonder that there was such lack of interest in the actual contents of the Minister's statement on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke here to-day at length and resumed on a line which has been noticeable in statements by members of the Government in recent times&mdash;a testiness in relation to the Opposition.  Last year, an ineffective attempt was made to try to rid the House of Opposition or to reduce the Opposition to such an extent that it would be negligible.  In his Financial Statement, the Minister for Finance appealed to the Opposition not to criticise the Budget too harshly, not to be critical.  The Taoiseach proceeded on much the same line to-day.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Opposition to criticise legislation.  Members of the Opposition are very often far more intimate with the ordinary people than are Deputies supporting the Government or members of the Government.  It is our bounden duty to represent conditions as we know them in our constituencies and in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the House to-day, the Taoiseach repeated a previous performance.  On the occasion of the debate on the recent Trade Agreement with Britain, he expressly denied that it was ever the policy of his Party to decry the value of the British market, or that his predecessor at any time ran it <Col N="497" /> down or said that there was no future in it.  Of course, we shall have other opportunities to produce evidence of the wild, ridiculous statements that were made down through the years by the former Leader of the Party and by many of his colleagues, in that connection. I merely mention that as being comparable with the allegation made here to-day by the Taoiseach that he did not at any time claim that it was within the power of the Government or that it was part of their policy to provide 100,000 jobs within a given period.</P>
    <P>I now want to give the House the authority for our contention that that was an express assurance given to the electorate before the general election. I quote from the Government's kept newspaper, the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The date is Wednesday, October 12th, 1955:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's aim for full employment.</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass outlines proposals.</P>
    <P>This is not an <i>Irish Independent</i> reporter and it is not an <i>Irish Times</i> reporter or a <i>Cork Examiner</i> reporter. It is an <i>Irish Press</i> reporter and, consequently, we must assume that he was careful in reporting what the Taoiseach said at that time:</P>
    <P>An increase of 100,000 jobs in five years.</P>
    <P>&mdash;could anything be more explicit?&mdash;</P>
    <P>or an average rate of increase of 20,000 jobs a year.</P>
    <P>In case anybody might expect that all this would emanate at the end of the five year period, he went into details and gave exactly what would occur in each of the five years.  He said:</P>
    <P>This would result in full employment here as normally understood</P>
    <P>&mdash;bringing it down to the ordinary man's understanding of what he meant&mdash;not equivocation&mdash;quite clear&mdash;</P>
    <P>and the end of abnormal emigration.</P>
    <P>They give particular prominence to this statement:</P>
    <P>This is the proposition on which Fianna Fáil bases its draft proposals for full employment.  The proposals <Col N="498" /> were outlined last night by Mr. Seán Lemass when he addressed Comhairle Átha Cliath.</P>
    <P>Further on, we come into the details and there is this statement under the heading &ldquo;Expansion&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>This is the sliding scale on which Fianna Fáil suggests that employment-making expenditure should be stepped up:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Then, in heavy print:</P>
    <P>In the first year, public investment outlay to be expanded by £13,000,000, thus raising total national expenditure by £20,000,000 and creating 20,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>This is the statement in reference to which the Taoiseach told the House to-day that the Opposition were unjust. That was the description he applied to the Opposition's claim that that statement was made.  He described it as unjust.  In face of this publication in the paper which he controlled, can he or the Minister for Finance or any Deputy supporting the Government claim that the Opposition are unjust? Is it not the basis on which the Government were elected?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his Ministers seek to take refuge behind the fact that things are fine, that we have never had it so good, because of the fact that there are fewer people registered as unemployed.  Everybody knows what has happened.  People have not registered as unemployed because they were in the frame of mind that there was no future for them here and they fled the country.  All the figures indicate that.  To-day the Taoiseach again sought to take refuge behind the fact that the sale of stamps last year showed an increase.  He did not advert to the fact that there was a change made and that classes not formerly eligible became insurable for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach opened his remarks by referring to the fact that statistics can be unreliable.  In regard to some statistics, even though they were produced under the authority of his own Department, he was inclined to be sceptical of their value.  He was not above using a figure which any Deputy knows was inflated because <Col N="499" /> classes were brought into the insurable category for the first time.</P>
    <P>It is very important to note that there is not even a heading in the Index to the Financial Statement as to the balance of payments position. In years gone by, it was a very important factor.  Is it not only right to record that when this Government assumed office, they were presented with the situation that the balance of payments position was never healthier? In one paragraph of his Financial Statement, the Minister claimed that our external payments have been in balance over the three year period. Taken at its face value, that would appear to be a claim by the Government that, if not progressing, the position was stable over that period.</P>
    <P>He did not refer to the fact&mdash;or, if he did, he glossed over it&mdash;that there was a substantial surplus following on the activities of his predecessor, that the consequence of the previous Government's policy and action was to leave to this Government a substantial surplus and that in the year after they resumed office, the best the Government could claim was a balance and that then we had a deficit, although not a serious deficit.  The Government would have a much poorer record to show if the situation in relation to the balance of payments had not been dealt with so courageously and so well by the Minister's predecessor.  We would then find that a considerable part of the Budget Statement this year and perhaps in years to come would refer to the fact that this was a serious problem and one which required serious steps to rectify it.  The fact that it was rectified before the Minister took office and the fact that he was left with a surplus is certainly to the credit of his predecessors.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I want to put on record conditions as I see them in the country.  Particularly in the villages and small towns, things are far from good.  The Minister need not assume we are adopting the <i>béal bocht</i> attitude to which he referred.  We know how bad conditions are from our constant meeting with the people <Col N="500" /> in business in rural Ireland.  What other conditions could exist with the exodus from the rural areas we have experienced in recent years, with people fleeing from the countryside seeking employment in Britain and elsewhere?  Were it not for the fact that the people who have gone have been in a position to send back to their families what they could afford from their earnings, the situation would be far more serious still.</P>
    <P>Government figures recorded a drop in the country's exports of agricultural produce during the past year. In case there is any doubt about that, may I draw the attention of the Minister and his Government to their own publication, <i>Economic Statistics</i>? There the Government have put on record that in 1959, as compared with 1958, the output of cattle declined by 72,000 or about £5,000,000 in value. That is a fairly substantial drop in such a short period.  The value of total milk output fell by £2.2 million. When one considers that as distinct from other categories, milk is mainly produced in the Munster counties, the drop of £2.2 million is a very substantial amount.  The output of pigs decreased by £1.7 million.</P>
    <P>A fall of £1.4 million in the output of sheep and lambs was offset to some extent by a rise of £0.7 million in the export of wool.  Deputy Dillon and other Deputies adverted to the fact that the healthy increase in the export of wool was attributable to the incentives given by the previous Government to those engaged in sheep farming which resulted in the dramatic increase in the sheep population, and it is of some concern that there are indications that that industry has not been faring so well in recent times.  The lower price for turkeys caused a drop of £0.6 million.  The output of livestock and livestock products fell by £11.7 million, from £141.5 million in 1958 to £129.8 million in 1959.</P>
    <P>These are not our figures.  They are the Government's figures and consequently no Deputy can say they are not true.  In face of that situation, how can anybody have the audacity to claim that there is sufficient provision <Col N="501" /> in this Budget to make up to the agricultural community for such a substantial drop?</P>
    <P>At the commencement of this year, particularly in the constituency I represent, the small farmers suffered a considerable setback in their incomes due to the dramatic reduction in the price which obtained and still obtains for suckling calves.  This is a very serious loss of income to those unfortunate people.  Over the winter, debates accumulate and they look to the value of the dropped calves to clear their winter debts and to start off the new year.  The loss this year could be conservatively estimated at £10 per head and if it was spread over the year would represent a substantial loss per gallon of milk.  We all know the furore that would arise if any Government reduced the price of milk to the consumers in the dairying areas; yet the reduction in the value of the dropped calf is as serious as that, £10,000,000 per annum.  Therefore, it is obvious that only lip-service is being paid to the fact that it is the cradle of the whole agricultural industry.  This is a grievous loss of income to those people and there is no provision to ease their lot.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach created high hopes when he made a statement on the Vote on Account that it was the intention of the Government to do something worth while to cut these losses.  The indications now are that despite the fact that the consumer has been mulcted in the sum of threepence per lb. of butter, the increase which farmers will receive in consequence of the Government's action will be niggardly.</P>
    <P>It is not long since the Government exacted a levy on the milk delivered to creameries.  Since that time, costs of production have increased.  It is only some months since the Minister for Local Government came into this House and made his contribution by the exaction of a sum in the neighbourhood of £100,000 in increased taxation on certain types of vehicles used extensively in the transport of milk to creameries.  These increased costs of operating creameries will also play their part in reducing the residue <Col N="502" /> that will be available to the primary producer.  Therefore, we cannot see that in this Budget there is all that is claimed by way of assistance for the people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach struck a pessimistic note again to-day when he referred to the drift from the land.  He fell back on the argument that this was universal. On the other hand, I contend that some few years ago we had mechanisation in rural areas to which Deputy Corish, the leader of the Labour Party, referred and which resulted in the displacement of much manual labour.  I agree with Deputy Corish that in many instances that mechanisation was overdone and that it was detrimental to the country as a whole because almost all of this machinery had to be imported. Furthermore, it accelerated this movement of labour from the land.</P>
    <P>The countries to which the Taoiseach adverted are highly industrialised countries in which the attraction away from the land is far greater than it is in Ireland.  The movement from the land here is not so much a movement from the land to industry within the country but from the land to industry in other countries, which is the serious aspect of the problem because it spells one word: emigration. The Taoiseach, to my mind, showed a complete lack of understanding of conditions in rural areas when he said that farmers' families were there in an unpaid capacity.</P>
    <P>If he only realised the pride of ownership which is inherent in the farming stock of this country, he would realise that the boys and girls, the sons and daughters of farmers, work on the farms for what would appear to a city dweller to be a negligible amount, if for anything at all.  They look on it as a labour of love.  They work for years in order that some day they may enjoy the rights of ownership of those holdings. When one recalls what their fathers and forefathers suffered to enjoy that ownership, one cannot look upon the closing of the doors of the farmhouses with anything but extreme concern.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to give attention to these areas which would, if not completely curtail the flight from the <Col N="503" /> land, certainly minimise its effect.  Previous Governments accelerated the project of rural electrification.  They did so with the object of bringing to these parts of the country some of the amenities which would help to keep the people in those areas.  There is no doubt that it helped very considerably. There were other magnificent schemes such as the bringing of running water to the farmhouses and the erection of farm buildings which all helped in that respect.  Having furnished the people in the remote parts with those amenities, it should now be a much easier task for any Government to give encouragement to them and to make it possible for them to have a future in those areas.</P>
    <P>All the emigration which is deplored is not peculiar to the rural parts only.  Far removed from the so-called depressed areas of the west of Ireland, there are also depressed pockets in the south and the east.  In towns in my own constituency, I know that every day young men and girls are leaving, not to take up employment in the cities of Ireland, but in Britain. That is a situation which is very serious and which gives no grounds at all for complacency.</P>
    <P>These are the points I want to bring home to the Government in connection with the current situation in the country.  The fact is that a grievous mistake was made by the Government when they assumed office in cutting away the food subsidies.  By so doing, they placed upon the backs of hundreds of thousands of our people additional and unforeseen burdens from which the people were led to believe they would be secure because specific undertakings were given that the food subsidies would not be touched.  When these subsidies were removed, the Government stated their desire to reduce expenditure.  It was stated in many places that the result would be that in relation to the amount which had been levied in taxation, to relieve the people of the burden of the increased cost of living, that amount would be remitted to them when these food subsidies were removed.</P>
    <P>We now see the highest figure on <Col N="504" /> record in the history of the State for the cost of running the country, despite the fact that day after day, for every meal they consume, the people have to pay the normal increased prices in the increased cost of living which were formerly met out of taxation. It is no doubt true that many sections of the people got increases in wages and salaries but, nevertheless, no amount of bonanza which came into the hands of the Government could possibly compensate the people who were grievously affected by their action at that time.</P>
    <P>Listening to the appeal for understanding and confidence which the Government are making, it is very hard to refrain from recalling incidents in the not too distant past in which people very prominent in the Government today played a part in which they certainly can never take pride. When a previous Government were in difficulties&mdash;and not only the Government but the country itself&mdash;they made statements and took actions which could have had no result other than to aggravate the conditions then obtaining.</P>
    <P>We hear of the confidence which exists in the country whenever national loans are successful, but can we ever forget that at a time when a previous Government were floating a national loan, the organisation which elected the Government plastered the dead walls of the city with the pawnbrokers' sign?  When the head of the Government which preceded this one was honoured by an invitation to America the cohorts of the Party now in office spread through the cities of Dublin and Cork, and through the country, the suggestion that he was there as a mendicant seeking aid in order to preserve the Government of the time.</P>
    <P>Those dreadful statements were made and because of them it was more difficult to overcome the situation then obtaining.  Certainly, it comes ill from people who resorted to such methods to make this thin-skinned appeal they are making.  We must not say anything about conditions and we must not criticise conditions as they are in the country because we <Col N="505" /> would be making it more difficult for the Government.  We are doing that with the sole objective of bringing these conditions home to the members of the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance so that they may not be complacent and take vigorous action.  We are showing the urgent necessity of saving the people in those areas to which I have referred from any further loss of income or any further deterioration of the conditions in which they are living at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange that some years ago Budget day in this country was a day of great importance to everyone.  Those people who could avail of a radio were crammed around it and many others eagerly awaited the evening papers or the following morning's papers to find out what was to happen in the coming year.  Nowadays, it seems nobody takes any interest in the Budget outside of this House.  Whether or not that is because they have become pessimistic about the future, I do not know.  While undoubtedly this year it would be very difficult to be enthusiastic, we must admit that that trend for some years back was becoming more noticeable, and I believe even when the inter-Party Government were in office it was there.</P>
      <P>On this occasion it is our duty to discuss the Budget and to express our views on it.  Like my colleague, Deputy Corish, I think it well to remind the Taoiseach, not of his past sayings&mdash;I am not interested in them&mdash; but of the fact that so long as there are any Labour Party members in this Chamber, we shall retain the right of criticising or praising the Fianna Fáil Party or any other Party according to their merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's Budget Statement, he made what he himself apparently considers one very important point.  He drew attention to the bank advances to agriculture and it seemed that he took great pride in drawing attention to the fact that in January, 1958, these advances amounted to £17,000,000.  Whether it was due to the activities of the Government or not, he did not state, but, <Col N="506" /> at any rate, apparently in January, 1958, that figure jumped to £22,000,000, while in January of this year, the advances by the banks to agriculture amounted to £29,000,000.</P>
    <P>I wonder is there so much for the Minister to rejoice about.  After all, that is only half the story.  A very important booklet was issued to us last Wednesday dealing with the Tables in connection with the Budget.  Let us, for instance, consider Table 11.  The statement shows the capital liabilities of the State.  If we take but the first 16 items and tot them together, the liability amounts to £243,458,000.  It is all under the same system.  The Minister takes pride in the system whereunder £29 million is being given to the farmers by the banks.  It is all based on an up-to-date system of usury.  The Minister and, indeed, his predecessors had to beg for money whether in relation to any of these liabilities, national loans or otherwise. He had not just to throw a sop but to give an extraordinarily high rate of interest in order to help in the provision of capital.  Bear in mind that its repayment would have to be made with money provided by the people.</P>
    <P>When the Minister mentions £29 million advanced by the banks, probably he knows as well as his advisers that there is no guarantee but that at any time they will put on the pressure and do as was done last week in Britain, namely, resort to the usual technique of a credit squeeze.  Deputies on my left have been speaking of the tragedies of 1956.  I was sorry for that, too, but not so sorry for the Government of the day because they in an inter-Party Government, just as in the case of the present Minister, seemed to be quite content.</P>
    <P>It is all right to give a shilling a week from 1st August to the old age pensioner but we dare not in any circumstances question the people in control of finances as regards what they will charge us for the loan of money.  Let us consider, for instance, Table 8 in this important booklet.  I shall not go over the headings as they are available to every Deputy.  In Table 8, there is one very nice heading: <Col N="507" />&ldquo;Money Raised by the Creation of Debt.&rdquo; Therefore, we come to it again&mdash;&ldquo;Money raised by the creation of debt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We seem to be satisfied to fool the people, whether it is a case of central government or of local authorities, by the system we adopt in the creation of debt.  Whether it be in this booklet before us or in some of the various important documents submitted to this House during the past year or two, though there may be a lot to be said for some of the items in them, on every occasion the author seems to find it convenient to avail of the problem of the overall national debt in this country, to avail of the problem of the Minister for Finance in trying to balance his Budget and accounts for the year through the various Departments or the provision of capital expenditure for the next year.  In my opinion, that is an item that seems to be avoided on both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Until we get a Minister and a Government prepared to work not on the text books of the past but in full realisation of our dangerous position whereby a small minority are controlling the lives of the huge majority, until we realise that and are prepared to try to remedy it, it is as well for us to forget what Party we belong to, to forget the teachings of the 1916 leaders, Connolly, Pearse and the others.  We must realise individually and collectively, the danger not alone of leaving the country in bond but of handing it over to the money grabbers who are making a good living out of it.</P>
    <P>Day after day, in various newspapers, one important page is devoted perhaps to benefit a certain section of the community.  Every section is entitled to fair play and fair consideration. I wonder why our people are encouraged to such a large extent by holding before them the possibility of wonderful profits from foreign investments.  Whether it be in an inter-Party Government or otherwise, the Minister tells us we are handicapped in relation to a capital Budget because the finances being <Col N="508" /> made available are limited.  Nevertheless the Government are prepared to allow the people to be encouraged to spend £1 on giving employment in foreign countries if they get back 23/- or 24/-.  That is another weakness, in relation to the overall position here, in what some Deputies on both sides have been complaining about, unemployment and emigration, and still we see no remedy for it.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made by the Minister and also this afternoon, by the Taoiseach, of exports.  We hear a lot about exports.  We know that exports are important.  Apparently they are very important to Japan, too, when they can send stuff to Dublin.  We do not know the conditions in which they work and live in Japan; perhaps we are not interested in such matters.  All we may be interested in is where we can get stuff and, apparently, if it is one penny cheaper, we are satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, in shouting so much about exports, we very often forget the enormous potentialities of the home market, if we are making use of the home market.  I believe we are not making full use of the home market.  The returns issued by the Statistics Branch every three weeks show us how many thousands are unemployed, how many people with means receive unemployment assistance and how many people without means receive unemployment assistance. There is another indication of a potential market, if we do not shout exclusively about exports but give a little more thought to the possibility of building up a home market to which, perhaps, I may be able to draw attention later on.</P>
    <P>Consider external markets.  Every person realises that when we rush for the export market, we are faced with the problem of supply and demand. The Taoiseach mentioned that to succeed on the export market our prices must be comparable.  That may be. However, a further complication has arisen.  There are now trade associations known as the &ldquo;Six&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;  Between the &ldquo;Six&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seven&rdquo;, where do we come in?  After all, in building a home market and in trying to give internal prosperity to <Col N="509" /> the people, we are guaranteeing a market for our manufacturers, our workers and our farming community. Have we had any guarantee from year to year, no matter who is Minister for Finance, when we are depending on prices in the market in Britain controlled by people who have no love for us any more than they have for the people of any other nation?  Are we satisfied that because we have a small toe-hold in some of the other markets all is well with us?</P>
    <P>There are some countries at present &mdash;and I do not intend to enlarge on this&mdash;where we could develop our own markets without the necessity to subsidise as we do in the case of butter and agricultural products in the British market.  I shall give the Minister and the Government credit for concentrating upon trying to get into these markets.  I do not agree with the Minister that there is any danger that a wage increase would affect us in John Bull's market.  They give us all we want as long as we can pay for it.  They take from us only what they want to buy from us.  We know that from the recent Trade Agreement.</P>
    <P>What struck me as rather strange was the remark of the Minister for Finance on Wednesday last when he spoke of stability in price levels. Apparently, he is satisfied that since 1958 there is stability in price levels based on the consumer price index. We all know that it is not a case of the consumer price index in relation to the price level.  We know what it is based on.  I shall not waste the time of the House in quoting the various items which go up in price day after day and which went up in price as well prior to the advent of the present Government.</P>
    <P>There is no use criticising the Government because they want to close their eyes to certain things.  The plain truth is that day after day in different villages and towns, you will find in various shops different prices but you will never find a lower level in any of them.  It is always an increase.  We hear a lot about this cost of living index figure.  On what basis is it computed at the present time?  Do they find it convenient, when checking in <Col N="510" /> the various cities and towns, to get the lowest price to suit themselves?  Would the Minister tell us whether there is a real check carried out to ensure that an average of the higher and lower prices is taken into consideration?</P>
    <P>I draw attention to this because of the Taoiseach's remarks.  Whether he likes it or not, we certainly have no intention of letting him forget.  He spoke on the Vote on Account on the question of agricultural wage increases. Apparently he was satisfied that the 4/- was going to affect such commodities as butter.  It was proved when the Department increased the price by 3d. per lb.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance showed the House last week, again by quoting statistical returns, that the agricultural worker's rate of wages had increased since 1953 by 14 per cent.  It sounds very nice but on what was the 14 per cent. based?  Surely the members of this House, as well as the Minister, know full well that the agricultural wage rate can be considered little better than a slave wage rate. Even though an increase was given in the wage rate of agricultural workers during the term of office of the inter-Party Government, surely the Minister did not hope that the people would be fooled when they heard there was an increase of 14 per cent. in the wage rates for agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>It would have been far better to state in plain language what the increase was and what the miserable wage amounted to before the increase was given.  That is one of the points I strongly resent.  That is why I drew particular attention to the erroneous attempt to prove that the cost of living remained stable for the past two years but that there was an increase of 14 per cent. in agricultural wages in that period.  It sounded well.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the question of unemployment in agriculture. Other members have already dealt with that matter and, therefore, I shall be very brief.  However, I want to draw the attention of the Taoiseach to one important point.  Questions were asked in this House and very clear answers were given.  There is no need for me to quote them.  Any member who <Col N="511" /> wishes to procure the information can have recourse to the various questions and answers.  The serious unemployment in agriculture is affecting the agricultural worker engaged by the farmer.</P>
    <P>I shall not deny that the Government to some degree gave certain benefits to the agricultural worker, as did the Government before them. That in itself increased the income of the agricultural community.  The farmers and their families had increases but the big problem concerns those dependent on agriculture for a day's work, the man living in a cottage on side of the road or the man living in a workman's house.  In large parts of the south and the midlands, it is the custom for the farmer's sons or daughters to enter the various professions. That is a healthy sign.  If there is emigration in that sense it is no harm.  They are a benefit to the State and themselves when they stay in the State and if they go abroad, they are also a credit to themselves and their country.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of the situation is that the ordinary worker, who finds himself unemployed in rural Ireland and who cannot get work with the farmers and the local authorities, has no hope of getting employment whether he moves to Cork or Dublin city.  He finds himself forced into the <i>Innisfallen</i> on Monday, Wednesday or Friday or finds himself forced to emigrate from Dublin or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That is the problem in rural Ireland. We see that there are people on unemployment assistance with or without means.  The tragedy is that there are a great many of these hidden under the name of farm workers, men who have no hope of getting employment, due, as Deputy Corish said, to a certain extent to the overemployment of machinery but due equally, perhaps, to other causes which the Taoiseach apparently is not prepared to admit or wants to gloss over as he did this evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech last Wednesday admitted that there was a problem regarding the building industry. <Col N="512" /> He and the Government knew that they were within the period of a slow-down in building.  Because of that there was a saving of roughly £1¾ million in local authority housing and sanitary services.  First of all, let me say that from my experience in County Cork there is a slowing-down of building caused by Departmental action, at a time when we could go on with building and employ more people.  I know, of course, it will be more appropriate to discuss this on a certain Departmental Estimate but I cannot let the occasion pass without commenting on the fact that the Minister for Finance is worried that we have not enough employment now for workers in the building trade.  We have it but we are not prepared to give it to them.  It is also available in the cities and in many large villages and it cannot be given because of Government action.</P>
    <P>Employment could be given to tradesmen and to all those engaged in the building industry but the trouble and the tragedy there is&mdash;and I cannot blame the present Government solely for it, although I suppose they have to take the blame while they are in office&mdash;that no work is encouraged in these areas on reconstruction because of Government interference through extraordinarily increased valuations on those reconstructions. That in itself is causing unemployment.  If that interference did not exist, we would find many people in towns and villages who would be prepared to spend a little money on improving their homes and business places and, incidentally, give much needed employment in the building industry.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday the Minister was happy to be able to draw attention to certain savings.  First of all, he mentioned increased revenue amounting to about £2¼ million and then, owing to agricultural price supports and social insurance not being drawn in full, there was a saving of £1¼ million.  Between these the Minister had at his disposal over £3½ million. He also found himself in the happy position that the Prize Bond system introduced a few years ago gave him <Col N="513" /> increased receipts of £2¼ million in the year at a fair rate of interest. From the point of view of small savings, there was the healthy sign of an increase of another £2,000,000 in Savings Certificates.  Taking these totals, he found himself with over £8,000,000 plus the money that had been saved for the last couple of years through the subsidies.</P>
    <P>He did utilise portion of the £8,000,000 to give certain benefits. There is no need to go into all of them but a few of them were of particular interest to me.  We all know that old age pensioners, the blind and those receiving social assistance, will get 1/- a week from the 1st August but not long ago the present Government made it clear by their actions, and by their votes in this House, that they would not give an increase in these benefits.  Not many months ago the money could not be found; they said that it could not be made available. Some people may now think that they are showing a change of heart to a very small degree, but even with the 1/- a week from the 1st August if we take the money values of 1938 as against those of the present time, we know that in 1938 7/- would buy as much as 21/6d. or 22/- now.</P>
    <P>Where do we stand when we boast of our Christian charity and justice in regard to our old age pensioners, our blind and these unfortunates to whom we are giving another 1/- a week in August?  If we are being just to them now, apparently we were over-just to them prior to the war. The Minister may say that he could not find any more for them but he mentioned other pensioners, central and local government pensioners and disability benefits in a certain category and between them they are getting £150,000.  Naturally it would not be for me to object to their getting a fair crack of the whip but they are not getting 1/- a week from the 1st August.  Oh, no; that would not be fair.  They are getting an increase based on 5 per cent., and in some cases, a 7½ per cent. increase calculation so that while the unfortunate blind person must be satisfied with 1/- a week from the 1st August, or <Col N="514" /> the old man or woman who may be reaching the age of 80 or over, must be satisfied with 1/- a week, certain individuals can draw anything from £50 to £100 based on past figures.  Is that fair?</P>
    <P>The Minister could not give more than 1/- to the old age pensioner.  He thought he would move off in another direction.  Apparently the green light showed that it was favourable to move and to give a reduction in death duties to the extent of £50,000.  I am not raising this as perhaps some members may wish to raise it but the fact is he gave a relief to the cinemas from May and to the dance halls from July and the total there is £350,000.  To the table water manufacturers he gave £70,000.  Perhaps these sections may be in need of that money; I do not know, but when we consider that the total given to the old age pension group, to the blind, to widows and those on unemployment assistance is £450,000 and that the Minister can give relief under the heading of death duties, cinemas, dance halls and table water manufacturers to the extent of £470,000, would it be too much to ask the sections who will gain from these concessions to wait another 12 months? Would it be unfair to give that £470,000 to the old age pensioners?  I believe it would not.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Minister found it necessary to be generous, he could have found it in his heart to forget the dance halls, the cinemas and the table water manufacturers and not worry about those who have to pay death duties, because the unfortunate old age pensioner or the blind and the widows will never be leaving their dependents in the awkward position of having to pay death duties.  Why not be at least a little more generous and pool the whole lot in their favour and forget the others for 12 months?  Had the Minister done that I would have given him credit but I can hardly be expected to give him credit for the shilling a week from the 1st August to the one section of the community whom not alone should we respect but for whom we should show a sense of decency by remembering their difficulties at the present time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> Finally, I shall come to the point which I think is of vital importance, the question of the Capital Budget. The Minister drew attention to the increases given, bringing it up roughly to about £54,000,000 this year.  He mentioned an increase to the air companies which apparently goes from £2.55 million to £6.27 million this year. He is providing money for a television service under the Capital Budget. Apparently he is proud to draw attention to the fact that in agricultural credit, forestry and fisheries the jump in five years has been from £6,000,000 to £12,000,000, doubling the amount. He is very happy, apparently, to be able to inform the House and the country that the increase in industrial grants jumped in these five years from about half a million pounds to £6,000,000.  There was also an increase from £7¼ million to £11½ million in the case of public transport, ports and harbours.  It sounds all right but I wonder is it a little over-balanced in favour of certain lines?</P>
    <P>While the increase from £2.55 million to £6.37 million for the air companies in connection with the jet planes, may be advantageous, would it not be more advantageous to put that money into agriculture, for instance?  I may be told that agriculture has been provided for but that has not been done to a sufficient extent in my opinion.  I am not clamouring that money should be just thrown to the farmers because I believe if we give the money, we must get a return for it, because it is State capital.  Nevertheless, the incentive bonus, of which we have heard so much from the Minister for Transport and Power when he was Minister for Lands in regard to forestry, could very well be introduced in agriculture.  I am convinced that a lot of money in the form of various grants to agriculture is going down the drain.  Why not, for a change, give encouragement to the man who will make good use of the money?  The tragedy is that while we know some people make good use of the grants, many do not. In regard to these increases, I believe we could wait and not worry about jet transport for another couple of years <Col N="516" /> and instead hand the money over to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes a pride in the provision for agriculture and includes television in his Budget but I think agriculture should come first.  When I see the increase for agriculture, forestry and fisheries, a jump from £6,000,000 to £12,000,000, I ask is that enough?  I believe it is not.  I believe, as do many members and many outside, that there are great possibilities in forestry and fisheries but we cannot explore them unless we are prepared to provide the necessary finance.  We hear from various Ministers, irrespective of what Government they are members, about the problem of money and it seems strange that it should be allowed to hold us back.  It is strange that, at a time when it is supposed to be holding us back, instead of chanelling money into what will give an immediate return, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, we are prepared to fly in the air with another £4,000,000.  We are prepared to erect our television aerials and spend more money.  We are prepared, apparently, to see industrial grants go up from £500,000 to £6,000,000.  These grants are good but I wonder how we shall stand in future in regard to some of them because I am sorry to say that a tight check must be kept on some of the fly-by-night gentlemen coming in and getting these grants.  We know of the difficulty of securing proper wages in industries for which certain people get grants and I hope it does not happen in the future that we find ourselves at sea and that the fly-by-night gentlemen can fly back again and leave us with empty factories.</P>
    <P>I believe we must concentrate directly and indirectly on agriculture. We know of the good news that emerged in the past few days in regard to the margarine factory.  I hope it will be a success.  I believe that with the development of processing industries for agricultural products, we have a way of dealing with the raw material we have in the country and that we should spend more money on it because it will be of more benefit than jets or television.  We should not continue with heavily increased expenditure in one direction and at the same <Col N="517" /> time allow rural Ireland to become more depopulated.  That is the problem which I think the Government are not inclined to face realistically. I may be wrong.</P>
    <P>It is not my aim to take from any credit to which they are entitled, but, going through the Minister's statement and listening to the Taoiseach's contribution today and on the Vote on Account, it must be admitted that the present policy is not helping to remove the cancerous sore of unemployment and emigration.  In my opinion, the only remedy is to switch more money into rural Ireland.  I believe that the weakness of the present system of dealing with so many of these industrial grants&mdash;it does not arise in Britain where, apparently, they are able to tell the companies where to go&mdash;is that we are not able to tell companies where to set up factories. We are afraid of offending them, with the result that we have pockets in the 26 Counties where we have a good state of employment and a certain amount of happiness from the knowledge that all the workers in the area are employed, but we have huge areas, including large towns, in different counties where there is no sign of action in regard to the development of employment.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that these would-be industrialists coming in to get grants should be directed to certain areas. That may be difficult but we are approaching the time when if we want to continue dishing out money to them, we cannot allow them to go into any corner they wish.  It is incumbent on the Minister to approach the problem of unemployment in rural Ireland by providing a number of industries. These need not be in every town or village necessarily because in many counties it may be found that a certain, centrally-sited town with certain amenities is suitable for industries. We should aim at helping each county. I think that is the only way we can prevent or even ease emigration in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister drew attention to the balance of trade position over three years.  He first mentioned the deficit of £8.7 million in 1959, virtual equilibrium in 1958 and a surplus of <Col N="518" /> approximately £9,000,000 in 1957. Surely, that makes the point that I was, perhaps inadequately, trying to make of the uncertainty of world conditions and of the uncertainty involved in striving entirely for export markets. Our surplus or deficit is, to a large extent, dependent on conditions abroad and if, under the present credit squeeze in Britain, conditions alter, they will alter our prices on the British market. Or if from South America they can import cattle in the next 12 months, it is possible we shall find the prices will not be very helpful to us.  Then we are caught again and forced to toe the line, whether or not we like it or whether we have agreements or not. We know that they will seek their own advantage.</P>
    <P>If there is such a substantial swing in the balance of trade over a few years, while naturally we would be anxious to get into the export market, I think we must realise that the one market that we should most foster and encourage is the home market to which we are closing our eyes.  We are doing that because we have to pay such a high rate of interest to the money grabbers&mdash;the money grabbers of whom the Minister is afraid, as his predecessor was afraid; and because they could not get what they wanted then, they decided they would get their &ldquo;pound of flesh&rdquo;, namely, the unemployment of the Irish worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies who have spoken have commented on the lack of interest shown in this Budget, not only outside the House but inside the House as well.  It would not be inapposite to describe this Budget as a &ldquo;Shrove Tuesday Budget&rdquo;; it was as flat as any pancake I have ever seen.  The proposals contained in it were flat; its reception in this House was flat; and its reception by the people outside was flat.  There was nothing in the Budget about which people felt they need get excited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as reliefs were given, the reliefs were naturally welcomed by the recipients; but, by and large, the feeling was that this was a colourless Budget, just as colourless and ineffective as Fianna Fáil policy has proved to be since they were returned to <Col N="519" /> office in 1957.  There was nothing in it upon which the people felt the Government could be complimented. A number of people believe they are entitled to be disappointed because after a little over three years in office, we still have the same old Fianna Fáil policy in operation&mdash;the policy of dynamic words and promises on public platforms during a general election campaign, followed by a policy of &ldquo;little or nothing&rdquo;, once the election is over.</P>
    <P>I understand the Taoiseach felt today that it was unjust to criticise Fianna Fáil now on the basis of the programme they put before the people during the last general election campaign with regard to unemployment. The people were promised then a firm policy, or plan, which would mean that, if Fianna Fáil were returned to office, they would provide 25,000 new jobs per year over a period of four years, or 100,000 jobs altogether.  I want to put on record now some of the facts in relation to that programme of Fianna Fáil, but, before I come to that, I want to refer in general terms to the Fianna Fáil campaign which succeeded in returning Fianna Fáil to office in 1957, and to the literature produced prior to and during the general election.</P>
    <P>This short quotation will illustrate the type of propaganda indulged in by Fianna Fáil in order to denigrate the inter-Party Government and return them to office.  This is a quotation from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 12th November, 1956.  It is from a speech delivered by Deputy Davern during a by-election in Kilkenny.  He said:</P>
    <P>The present Coalition is utterly discredited and the people have shown in no uncertain manner that they have no confidence in it.  This Coalition, like the first Coalition, is a Government of pledge breakers and the people should be ruthless in passing judgment on them.</P>
    <P>That was the central theme of all the Fianna Fáil propaganda before and during the last general election: the inter-Party Government were a Government of pledge breakers.  The literature produced is typical.  One page is <Col N="520" /> devoted to a number of illustrations headed &ldquo;50 Broken Promises&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the context that the predecessors of the Government were a Government of pledge breakers, and in the context of the Fianna Fáil pamphlet headed &ldquo;50 Broken Promises&rdquo;, I want to ask Deputies opposite to consider seriously some of the items of policy they put before the people prior to and during the last general election, and to ask themselves to what extent&mdash;possibly it was to a very considerable extent&mdash; there was an implied promise of performance on their part should they be returned to power, whether or not they would like now to pour scorn on their own heads and whether or not they would like to describe themselves, in the descriptive phrase of Deputy Davern in Kilkenny, as &ldquo;a Government of pledge breakers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking from these benches as an Opposition Deputy on 8th May, 1956, at column 49 of the Official Report, had this to say:</P>
    <P>In 1953 the Fianna Fáil Government of which I was a member took a decision that taxation in this country had reached the danger limit. We announced that we had made up our minds on that fact and that, so far as we were concerned, there would be no increase in tax rates above the 1953 level.  We made it clear that if any Budget difficulty arose that difficulty would be met by a reduction of expenditure and not by increasing the burdens on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>That is the first Fianna Fáil commitment entered into with the people at the last general election: the bosses of the Party had taken a firm decision that, as far as they were concerned, taxation rates would not go above the 1953 level.  That is the Fianna Fáil commitment on taxation.  Let us examine how Fianna Fáil have measured up in performance to that promise or implied promise.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil gave some very definite commitments on the question of unemployment. No matter what the Taoiseach or any member of the Fianna Fáil Government may say now to the effect that the plans announced by <Col N="521" /> them were not really concrete plans, that they were simply debating points put before the people for discussion, I think every Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party knows that that is not how they were interpreted.  I very much doubt if there is any member of the Fianna Fáil Party who believes that that was the way it was intended they should be interpreted.  I think every member of the Fianna Fáil Party felt that when the then Deputy Lemass announced the Fianna Fáil plans for full employment, that was a banner around which they could rally and on which they could campaign during the general election.</P>
    <P>These plans for full employment were announced by the Taoiseach when he spoke in Clery's Restaurant. Fianna Fáil themselves were so impressed by his speech that they got out a special Fianna Fáil supplement containing those proposals in full.  At that time the Fianna Fáil Party were publishing a pamphlet known as <i>Gléas.</i> This contained a summary of the proposals for full employment.  I am quoting now from the issue of <i>Gléas</i> for November, 1955.  In their summary or explanation of these proposals, they say:</P>
    <P>An increase over five years in the number of jobs by 100,000, or an average increase of 20,000 per year, would result in full employment and the end of abnormal emigration. At the end of the five years, 15,000 new jobs per annum would enable full employment to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Later on, the article states:</P>
    <P>Simultaneously with the operation of these proposals, policies to expand production, to improve efficiency, and to open up new avenues for private investment in all sectors of the national economy will need to be applied.  These will be contained in the Fianna Fáil programme when it is completed. This plan for full employment is put forward in the belief that this country's inability so far to achieve the same employment conditions and living standards as other small <Col N="522" /> West European countries is due solely to the circumstances which have prevented the full use of available resources.  It is not due to any incapacity of the Irish people to accomplish the same productive effort as these other countries have achieved.  It is along these lines that Fianna Fáil is planning the nation's future progress.  In the present task of completing these plans, and the ultimate task of fulfilling them, Fianna Fáil asks the cooperation and support of all sections of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Reading that myself&mdash;and I think the same would apply to any ordinary person throughout the country reading that kind of statement issued by the Fianna Fáil organisation, obviously for use by their canvassers and propagandists&mdash;the only meaning I could get out of it is that Fianna Fáil had a plan for full employment, that they had a plan which would create 100,000 new jobs in five years or 20,000 new jobs each year.  I say that that was a commitment by Fianna Fáil to the electorate in the general election.</P>
    <P>In case any Deputy is in doubt about it, in case anyone is inclined to agree with the wishy-washy type of argument which says that that was not a definite plan and that these were only proposals thrown open to the ranks of Fianna Fáil and the country as a whole for discussion and debate, I would ask those Deputies who think along those lines to have a look at the general Fianna Fáil pamphlet produced for use by Fianna Fáil Deputies in every constituency in the country at the time of the last general election. In page 2 of that, they will find in a large black heading these words: &ldquo;All energies devoted to one aim: Full Employment.&rdquo; Then it says:</P>
    <P>The whole energies of the Fianna Fáil Government will be devoted to the realisation of the objective of full employment.  This can be achieved only through a rapid and substantial increase of national resources&mdash;and it is to this end that Fianna Fáil will apply its economic policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> Then we turn to page 3 of this election address used by every Fianna Fáil Deputy in the general election and we see the words &ldquo;Action Can Start Now!&rdquo; and underneath that:</P>
    <P>Over 90,000 people are now out of work.  The Coalition says it can do nothing for them NOW.  Fianna Fáil believes that work must be provided <i>at once.</i></P>
    <P>Is there any doubt about that?  Is there any ambiguity about that? Surely that is a clear message from the Fianna Fáil Party bosses at the last general election to the voters telling them: &ldquo;If you vote for Fianna Fáil, there will be 20,000 new jobs created for the workers of this country for every year Fianna Fáil remains in office and at the end of five years, Fianna Fáil will have created 100,000 new jobs and there will not be a solitary man out of work&rdquo;?  Is that not what they told the people in that pamphlet in the last general election?</P>
    <P>In case Deputies still have any doubt about it, in case they are inclined to say: &ldquo;Oh, they never mean what they say,&rdquo; let us see how the Taoiseach interpreted that commitment in the last general election.  Deputy Lemass, speaking in Drogheda and as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 16th February, 1957&mdash;he was telling the people how a Government's work and policy should be judged&mdash;had this to say:</P>
    <P>The measure of the worsening of the national situation is the increase in unemployment.  That is the real test of the soundness of the policy of any Government.</P>
    <P>Unless the policy of the Government is successful in putting people to work, of giving a chance of getting work to all who are dependent on it for their livelihood, it is not good enough.  The aim of any worth-while policy must be full employment.</P>
    <P>And about a fortnight later, on 23rd February, 1957, the Taoiseach was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i>, having addressed a meeting in his own constituency of Dublin South-Central.  In the course of his speech, he said:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil would ask the public to face whatever had to be done to <Col N="524" /> get the unemployed workers back into jobs, to make the jobs of other workers more secure and to reduce emigration.  We believe the public will respond to the need of the times, and will accept and help whatever has to be done.</P>
    <P>Later on in the same speech, he is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>... that the rise in unemployment during the past few months was indisputable evidence that things are wrong with the country.  The policy of any Government should be judged by its effect on employment. If it is putting more people into work, it is all right.  If it is putting them out of work, it is all wrong.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has never refused to accept that test.  Its main economic aim was to bring about conditions in which every Irish man and woman can get a livelihood through work in Ireland.  Full employment must be the objective of any worthwhile programme.</P>
    <P>There we have the Fianna Fáil commitments to the people on the question of employment.  Deputy Lemass, as he was in 1956, committed his Party on the question of taxation by telling the people, through a public announcement from these benches, that the Government of which he was a member had taken a decision that taxation rates were not to increase beyond the 1953 level.  Through the mouths of many Fianna Fáil spokesmen, and through the printed word of the Fianna Fáil propagandists during the General Election, they committed themselves to the people that they would end unemployment, that they would create 100,000 jobs in five years, and that they would do that at the rate of 20,000 jobs a year.</P>
    <P>They also made commitments to the people on the question of the cost of living.  I do not want to weary the House with quotations.  If the Minister assures me now that he accepts the position that Fianna Fáil committed themselves to the people at the last General Election not to do away with the food subsidies or allow prices to increase, I shall spare the <Col N="525" /> Minister and Deputies opposite any further quotations along these lines.  I know he is not going to do that.  The Minister would prefer to see the tips of the ears of Deputies opposite becoming redder and redder because he will be able to brush these protests aside when he is replying, simply by not referring to them at all.  However, if the Minister does not feel like assuring the House that he accepts that Fianna Fáil committed themselves in that way, let us see what Fianna Fáil said at the time of the General Election.</P>
    <P>First of all, let me again give precedence to a statement of the present Taoiseach.  Speaking in Waterford on 28th February, 1957, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 1st March of that year, he had this to say:</P>
    <P>Some Coalition leaders are threatening the country with all sorts of unpleasant things if Fianna Fáil becomes the Government&mdash;compulsory tillage, wage control, cuts in Civil Service salaries, higher food prices and a lot more besides.  A Fianna Fáil Government does not intend to do any of these things because we do not believe in them. How definite can we make our denial of these stupid allegations? They are all falsehoods.</P>
    <P>According to him it was a falsehood that there would be higher food prices if Fianna Fáil became the Government and his then Chief, the former Taoiseach who is now the President, went to Deputy Lindsay's constituency and in Belmullet put himself on record on the same topic.</P>
    <P>He was concerned at that time to show the people that, as far as Fianna Fáil were concerned, there was no need to worry, that they could trust Fianna Fáil to see to it that things were going to be all right and that there would be no increases.  He was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 1st March, 1957, as saying:</P>
    <P>The Coalition Parties were urging the people not to vote for Fianna Fáil because there was hell around the Fianna Fáil corner.  You know the record of Fianna Fáil in the past.  You know that we have never <Col N="526" /> done the things they said we would do.  They told you that you would be paying more for your bread.</P>
    <P>The poor voters listening to him in Belmullet must have gone away shaking their heads and saying: &ldquo;Is it not a shame all his political opponents tell you you will be paying more for your bread if you vote for that poor man and his Party?  Is it not a terrible thing that these politicians are doing?&rdquo;  I wonder how many people in Belmullet remember that speech by the former Taoiseach during the last General Election.  If they do remember it, I wonder what they think of it now?  Will the Minister for Finance agree that the former Taoiseach and the present Taoiseach, in those speeches which I have quoted, gave commitments to the people that there would be no increase in food prices if Fianna Fáil went back to office?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 1st March, 1957, speaking at a meeting in Dublin, described as &ldquo;a blood curdling story&rdquo; the warning by Deputy Norton in an election broadcast that Fianna Fáil, if elected to Government, would withdraw the food subsidies.  He said that &ldquo;the Coalition groups, having no further promises to make for themselves, had switched to making sinister promises on behalf of Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Lynch, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 23rd February, 1957, said:</P>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil Government is the housewife's choice.  It must be; there is no alternative.  The housewife, the mother of a family, has been the greatest victim of Coalition bungling. Housewives, use your intelligence, your practical experience and your sound reasoning.  Vote in strength for the Fianna Fáil candidates.</P>
    <P>At the same time as these speeches were being made, there were the Fianna Fáil posters which read: &ldquo;Wives, get your husbands out to work;&rdquo;&ldquo;Let us get cracking;&rdquo;&ldquo;Unemployment is the test,&rdquo; and all the rest of them.  There is another item on which Fianna Fáil entered into a <Col N="527" /> commitment with the people.  There was to be no increase in taxation.  Unemployment was to be reduced to nil, to be completely solved; we were to have a State of full employment and there was to be no increase in the price of foodstuffs and in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern gaily referred to the last Government as a &ldquo;Government of pledge-breakers&rdquo;.  How do Fianna Fáil feel now as measuring up to Deputy Davern's definition?  What have they done about the cost of living?  It did not take them very long, by deliberate positive action of the Government, to remove food subsidies, to dismantle the machinery which was there and which was keeping down the cost of foodstuffs to the people, particularly the less well off sections of the people.  By deliberate action, the Fianna Fáil Government pushed up the cost of living on every section of the people.</P>
    <P>Time after time Fianna Fáil have been called to account in this House for their failure to do anything effective with regard to the question of unemployment and we find that now, after three years, or more than three years in office, instead of creating, as they should have according to the election commitment, 60,000 new jobs for the workers of this country, there are some 24,000 or thereabouts fewer people at work than when Fianna Fáil were bemoaning the situation. Fianna Fáil have failed miserably to deal with the question of unemployment, and side by side with that, they have failed to deal with the question of emigration.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to weary the House by referring to Fianna Fáil's record as far as taxation goes.  I think it sufficient to say that the firm decision taken by Fianna Fáil in 1953 that taxation under a Fianna Fáil Government was never to go above the 1953 level has been thrown overboard, and that nothing further is to be heard about it.  In their present unexciting Budget, Fianna Fáil have given some reliefs but I do not think that the old age pensioner who is to get an increase of 1s. a week will feel that his fortune is being made by the Fianna Fáil Government, particularly <Col N="528" /> when one has regard to the fact that if he purchases a lb. of butter in the week, 3d. has gone straightway from his increase and that if he smokes three packets of cigarettes or three ounces of tobacco in the week, another 3d. has gone from his 1/- increase.</P>
    <P>Anyone who wants to examine the situation with a statistical mind will find that an old age pensioner or any other pensioner getting an increase of 1/- a week from Fianna Fáil under this Budget is in no way adequately compensated in respect of the havoc which Fianna Fáil have created for him in his finances since they came back to office.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have proved in this Budget, as indeed they proved in all their policy efforts since they returned to office, that they have failed to tackle the job, have failed to live up to their own election poster, have failed to get cracking.  Even 12 months ago, the people might have forgiven the Government if they had made up their mind after two years in office that it was time to let the brake off and to get cracking.  They have not done that.  They have wandered on aimlessly for another 12 months, doing nothing, getting nothing done, talking a lot.  They will not avoid rendering an account of their stewardship to the people very much longer and I would earnestly recommend to the Minister and his colleagues, if they want to bring all the Fianna Fáil crew back in their boat at the next general election, they had better pay some attention endeavouring to honour the commitments entered into by Fianna Fáil at the last general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wondering this evening if this was a debate at all.  A debate on a Budget is regarded as the most important debate of the year. Such a debate is not confined to the taxes imposed or remitted.  The Financial Statement of a Minister is a statement of Government policy for the coming year.  I regard this evening's performance as showing a real dictatorship.  I say that because the Minister and the leaders of Parties were the only people who spoke on the Budget last week and today the Taoiseach <Col N="529" /> gave the Government's statement of policy and since that not one member of the Government Party has taken part in the debate.  Is it not to be expected that it is up to members of the Cabinet, the prominent members of the Party and the back benchers to support the policy enunciated by the Minister?  The dictatorship rules that only one man can state policy and that every other man must remain silent in case he might contradict the Taoiseach.  It brings politics to a very low state when every man in the Government Party is muzzled.  We often hear them called &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; but this evening they are silent men.</P>
      <P>I regard the taxes imposed in the Budget as the final taxes to all those imposed during the past year.  There was an increase in the price of cigarettes and tobacco announced in the Budget.  The Minister did not wait for the Budget to announce the increase in the price of butter or to announce the two increases that took place in the price of bread during the past few months.  When the people had absorbed the severe increases in the cost of living of the ordinary family man, the Budget was introduced which imposes a nominal increase of a penny in the price of cigarettes and tobacco but first, the people had taken the hard blow of the increases on bread, butter and bus fares.</P>
      <P>A normal family buys two lbs. of butter a week.  What will be the change out of a 10/- note?  Not one shilling, but pence.  The same applies to bread.  At present bread is in the luxury class of foods.  There is talk about building hospitals, sanatoria and other institutions.  Would it not be much better to devote some of the revenue this year to giving the people bread and butter?  That would be most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that he did not spend £1¼ million which he had estimated for last year for housing.  As he said, the housing problem is tapering off and in quite a number of areas housing has been completed. That may be all right as far as it goes but there is another side to the question.  I admit that in certain areas housing has been completed but <Col N="530" /> there is a clamp-down on local authority housing by the Government, not alone in areas where housing has been completed but in areas where that is not the case.</P>
    <P>In Kilkenny city, a housing scheme was passed by the former Minister for Local Government; a site was bought and plans were made for the erection of 68 houses which we hoped would solve the major part of our housing problem.  What happened?  The Government have clamped down and allowed only 32 houses to be built while a big number of people are looking for houses.  I am a member of the local authority and I know the demand there is for houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am dealing with the policy in regard to housing. The Minister suggested that the problem was being tailed off.  I am allowed to point out that in all cases it has not tailed off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into detail.  House building would help to relieve the unemployment problem. We all welcome the increased grants for hotels but luxury hotels will not house the ordinary working class.  The working class want houses, not hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made fine statements about the buoyancy of the revenue and the prosperity of the country.  It is a case of plenty for the few and scarcity for the many.  Certain sections of the community have in the past few years received a reasonable share but among large sections of the people money is scarce.  Central authority and local authority officials and organised workers have been able to get increases to cover the cost of living as far as possible.  I did not object to that at meetings of the local council of which I am a member. The Minister may say I am becoming too parochial but in Kilkenny County Council £13,000 was voted for increases to workers which is only a minute part of the whole increase. <Col N="531" /> These people have done very well and I do not begrudge them these increases, but I should like to see such increases given to the majority of the people by way of a reduction in food prices, by making food available to the people at a reasonable price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Fianna Fáil Deputies for staying away from this Budget debate.  I do not blame them for not wanting to hear what is said.  The miserable increase of 1/- in the old age pension which was granted in the Budget was a great disappointment to the ordinary people, but it must have been a much greater disappointment to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  At a council meeting in my county, a motion was proposed by a Labour member to have the old age pension increased, and two respected colleagues of mine in Kilkenny stood up and said the Minister and the Government were giving sympathetic consideration to the question of increasing the old age pension and they hoped that would have a satisfactory result for the pensioners.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Deputies must feel let down by the Minister and by the Government when as a result of this sympathetic consideration, the pensioners are to receive this miserable increase.  If the shilling increase is the measure of the Minister's sympathy for the old age pensioners, the Fianna Fáil Deputies were let down very badly, considering the promise that was made to them at the Party meetings. The statements they made at the council meeting in that regard were reported in local papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years ago, the House was pleased to hear the Minister announce that he was providing a sum of £250,000 for improved marketing of agricultural produce.  The Government have now been three years in office which is average term for which the past four administrations have enjoyed office, that is, 1948 to 1951, 1951 to 1954, 1954 to 1957 and 1957 <Col N="532" /> to 1960.  We were very pleased at the prospect of an increase in exports as a result of the provision of this £250,000.  What has been the result? We have just got reports on this subject, which have been pigeonholed, and more is the pity.</P>
    <P>Our industrial exports went up considerably last year.  What a picture it would have made if our agricultural exports had gone up as well. What a fine picture we would have had if that £250,000 had been used as it was intended it should be used and as every member of the Opposition thought it would be used, for the promotion of the better marketing of agricultural produce.  What a great advantage it would have been to the people and to the farmers who are getting £10 a head less for their cattle and those who having sheep to sell were lucky to get even an offer for them.</P>
    <P>I am sure Fianna Fáil Deputies thought the Taoiseach would come under fire again for his blueprint for prosperity: 100,000 people to be put into employment in five years at the rate of 20,000 a year.  What has happened to that?  The Leader of the Opposition has quoted the figures: there are 51,000 fewer in employment than in 1956.  The Taoiseach stated in his speech this evening that according to the members of the Opposition 1956 was a golden year. The members of the Opposition did not regard 1956 as a golden year.  It was anything but a golden year when the inter-Party Government had to impose levies to cope with the balance of payments problem.  It was a very bleak year but we felt that from that year any Government could improve the situation, improve employment. What do we find?  Instead of an improvement in employment from that very low year, employment has gone down by 51,000.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach before he assumed that office was a responsible Minister and the people paid great attention to what he stated.  He stated that he had plans to put 20,000 into employment each year.  Could you blame the people for giving the Fianna Fáil Party the greatest majority ever given <Col N="533" /> to a Party in this House?  Look at the way they used the majority: they have 77 members, but not one Deputy of that Party offered to speak.</P>
    <P>I conclude by referring to a statement which I never thought would be made by an Irish Minister for Finance.  In his Budget statement, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The present situation is one of greater employment opportunities both at home and abroad and the good effects are seen in the much reduced numbers on the register of unemployed.</P>
    <P>Can any honest-to-God Irishman clap the Minister on the back for that statement?  Is it not bad enough that people come home on holidays and invite their friends to go back with them to England&mdash;boys and girls come home with new suits bought specially for the occasion of the visit to encourage their friends to go back with them&mdash;without the Minister for Finance stating that there are &ldquo;greater employment opportunities both at home and abroad&rdquo;?  If the Minister had said that greater opportunities were being provided at home, it would be all right.  The Taoiseach spoke this evening about confidence in the country.  How can the people have that confidence when the Minister for Finance has not confidence in his own Government?</P>

      <P>It is very gratifying to receive such a welcome from the Opposition, but I should like to reassure Deputy Crotty that there is no question of back-benchers being silenced.  What we are suffering from is a complete lack of criticism.  We are quite happy about the Budget as it was introduced by the Minister for Finance, and it would be rather boring if we all took turns to get up and simply say: <Col N="534" />&ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo; We rather rely on the Opposition to criticise this Budget in the way which is suitable for an Opposition and give us something to get our teeth into.  So far, not even the Leader of the main Opposition Party, Deputy Dillon, has been able to give us anything at all into which we can get our teeth.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach remarked this afternoon, his speech was different from Deputy Dillon's mainly because he dealt with the Budget, whereas Deputy Dillon markedly did not.  So I can assure Deputy Crotty there is no question of our Party being silenced. I, for one, find it easier to make a speech if I can do so to rebut criticism offered by the Opposition and up to now, I have found very little which needs any rebuttal from me or anyone else.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crotty, however, has commented adversely on the increase in the prices of milk and butter.  How curiously that compares with the speech of Deputy Dillon, his own leader, earlier this afternoon, who pleaded eloquently, though inappropriately, possibly, for increased consideration for the farming community.  What has been done is that some measure of justice has been given to the farmers and all those engaged in agriculture, by giving them the same increases in their incomes as the industrial workers received in theirs.  He referred to bread as the staple diet of the people, quite forgetting, or ignoring, that the flour millers are having tremendous trouble and are spending a lot of money in order to try to persuade people to eat more bread. It is not because of the price&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but because of the increased standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what some people in Dublin think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an invariable fact that as the standard of living increases, the consumption of bread decreases. Bread is the staple diet of the people only where the standard of living is low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Crotty, I would very much have liked if it could have been <Col N="535" /> managed that the old age pensions were further increased, but I am sure he and other members of the House fully appreciate that the increase which has been granted is not just a rise in pay, as it were, in the same way as it would be to a wage earner, but is simply compensation for the increase in the prices of milk and butter, which is very reasonable.  When one considers the cost of any increase in old age pensions or other social assistance, it is obvious that an increase of any magnitude at all would mean inevitably a very great increase in taxation.  It is a matter of deciding whether it is better, in the interests of the economy generally, to increase taxation in order to raise pensions or to try to increase productivity and incomes and thereby to increase revenue so that old age pensions can be raised without increasing the general rate of taxation.</P>
    <P>I have some comments to make about this Budget but I have no serious criticism of it.  The Minister has done some very valuable spring-cleaning by removing some minor, and even some major injustices.  That spring-cleaning was probably overdue.  I particularly support the measures which are being taken to make some economies in the Civil Service.  I was very glad to hear that was being done in full co-operation with the Civil Service and its representatives.  The Government have been criticised before for not acting quickly enough, but it would have been very dangerous if the Government had used the axe too viciously.  To retain the co-operation of the Civil Service is essential but, at the same time, like many other members of the public, I feel, and I think the Minister feels, that some pruning is essential.  I support him in that, not only because I believe there will be some immediate financial economy, but because I believe it will give better service.</P>
    <P>The Minister is, I am sure, well versed in the intricacies of Parkinson's Law.  I do not want that to be taken purely as an attack on the Civil Service, because it is also an attack on businessmen, and is equally justified in each case.  The fact remains that there is a danger, if you have too many <Col N="536" /> grades in the Civil Service, that when a matter is referred to A, he will refer it slightly down the scale to B and so down to C, D and E.  E then gets to work and makes some recommendation, passes it back to D who adds his comment, up to C who probably radically revises it again and so on, and in actual fact, you will find five or six people doing one person's work.  For that reason, I strongly support the move to reduce the number of grades. I believe it will achieve financial economy and I believe it will also result in more efficient work.</P>
    <P>I was glad, too, to see that some effort was being made to ease the burden on cinemas.  I was interested in the comments on death duties and on the relief which has been granted there.  It is interesting to note, in reply to a recent Question by Deputy Sweetman, as reported at column 33 of the Official Report, Volume 181, No. 1, that out of every £1 of revenue only 5d. is attributable to death duties. This matter deserves further consideration. I spoke in this connection on the previous Budget.  I hope the Minister and the House will excuse me if I raise the same matter again because it is of very great importance.</P>
    <P>Death duties on small family businesses can mean the ruin of a concern which has been built up over very many years.  They can result in the disemployment of staff and the collapse of a business which it has taken years to build up.  The amount of revenue received from death duties seems to be insufficient to justify that risk and it is a very real one.  It is a curious form of revenue-raising.  It is simply playing on the natural weakness of mankind.  If only parents were prepared to trust their children, the revenue from death duties would disappear altogether.  It seems an unsafe and unwise way for raising revenue. I hope further consideration will be given to the matter so that eventually such duties will disappear altogether.</P>
    <P>I admit it would be a fairly drastic step because the raising of 5d. in the £1 in some other way would produce its own problems.  I suggest further consideration so that some concession or relief from death duties might be given in respect of Irish property or <Col N="537" /> investment.  In that way, foreign investment might well be attracted to this country and capital, which is lacking at the moment, might become available for investment in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>While very many people comment on the cost of living, a number of people comment equally bitterly on the cost of dying.  A man in my constituency kept a considerable establishment there.  He also had a very big farm down in Meath.  He was a very big employer.  He found he could not afford to die here.  He had to sell up and get out.  There was an inevitable loss of revenue because he went away.  Mercifully, he has not died yet but, even if he had, we would not have got the death duties because he had got out.  If we could relieve all Irish property from death duties it might attract back to this country some of the investment which has been made abroad over the years.  It might well attract other people to live here in their declining years and pay ordinary taxes until they die.</P>
    <P>There is a small point to which I should like to refer and to which I have already drawn the Minister's attention in correspondence.  There is a very small class of people who could well receive some concession; I refer to those people who were adopted before the passing of the Adoption Act. The adoption of children was not common but it was carried out before that Act was passed.  There is a small number of people who were adopted but not fully legally adopted and who cannot now be fully legally adopted because they are over the age limit. I would hope the Minister might still be able to find some way in which a child who has been brought up as the full legal child of a married couple could be treated for death duty and succession duty purposes as a full-blooded relation.  At the moment, they are treated as strangers in blood which is a very heavy penalty to them with very little gain to the Revenue.  I fully appreciate it is difficult to draft the regulation.  I would hope that some way might be found so that anyone who could satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that he or she was, for the <Col N="538" /> past 10 or 15 years, always treated and regarded as the full legal child of a married couple would be so treated by the Revenue Commissioners in that regard.</P>
    <P>There has not been very much comment on income tax.  I suppose it is simply because the rate has remained the same.  I hope I may be permitted to repeat something I stated on the last Budget.  I would hope that increasing stress would be laid on taxes on spending, with a consequent relief on tax on income. Deputy Haughey took me up on that last year and pointed out, probably very correctly, that expenditure tax is repressive and may be unduly onerous on those who are less well off.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to see the reply to a question by Deputy Sweetman, to which I have already referred, in which the Minister indicated, in relation to each £1 of revenue, that 4/7d. comes from taxes on income and capital; taxes on spending accounted for 11/11d. and non-tax revenue accounted for 3/6d.  Already taxes on spending account for much more than half of our revenue.  I feel that that is right.  I hope that procedure may even be extended further. I do not want to impose a heavy burden on those who are not well off. I believe that taxes on luxuries could be increased.  By that means, direct encouragement would be given to saving and investment.  If you know that if you buy a television set the price is so-and-so and the purchase tax is 30/-, £5, or whatever it may be, you may be very wise to think again. Instead of spending the total cost, plus the £5, you may decide to put it in the Post Office Savings Bank, Prize Bonds or into an industrial investment.</P>

I am sure that the people who sell T.V. sets insist on getting paid.  Consequently, I still feel that all these T.V. sets are being paid for.  I do not want to speak against T.V. sets.  I enjoy looking at T.V. myself.  I instanced that at random.  I feel that a purchase tax on T.V. sets could produce a very considerable revenue and I insist that a T.V. set is a luxury and not a necessity.  I would not say the same thing of household equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I am aware of that.  I am only trying to put ideas into the Minister's head.  I approve of them myself anyway.  I feel that much stress on a tax on income does discourage initiative and investment.  I believe we should try to encourage both of them.  Deputy Dillon in his rather rambling speech, with all due respect to him, this afternoon made a tremendous play for increased stress on agricultural development and agricultural exports.  At the same time, I think he overlooked the fact that if we had too much stress on our agricultural exports last year to the prejudice of industrial exports we would have had an extremely dangerous balance of payments crisis.  We were criticised repeatedly by the Opposition for placing too great a stress on industrial development and too little on agriculture. In actual fact, I think that criticism could not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech this afternoon made some relevant comparisons with Denmark.  I should like to carry that a little further because it is very noticeable that people regard Denmark as an ideal.  The Taoiseach said this afternoon that the rate of disemployment of agricultural labour <Col N="540" /> there is even higher than with us.  There is no realisation of the fact that the proportion of the population employed in industries in Denmark is still very much higher than it is in Ireland.  We do make mistakes in our ignorance and I share in that criticism because I was very ignorant of it until very recently myself.</P>
    <P>We feel that Denmark is predominantly an agricultural country. Its prosperity is very largely due to its industrial development.  I think we have to realise that we have to develop along the same lines.  We have to plan and build up a balanced economy.  If we were to direct policy as Opposition spokesmen are constantly advocating and concentrate upon the development of the cattle export trade alone or even give too much attention to it to the exclusion of other things, I think it would be a very bad day's work for the country. We cannot afford to place all our eggs in one basket.  We cannot afford to rely exclusively, or even mainly, on our cattle exports.  Even if they did help in our balance of payments they certainly would not help our employment position.  We must expand our industry if we want to maintain our population and increase our standard of living.</P>
    <P>It would be somewhat easier for me to address the House if I had something to reply to.  I should like to make it perfectly clear that the lack of speeches from this side of the House is entirely the responsibility of the Opposition.  If only they could say something which would even invite a reply, we would rise to reply with much more enthusiasm but our lack of enthusiasm to dash into the fray should not be taken for one moment as lack of enthusiasm for the Budget.</P>

Deputy O'Higgins spoke for a long time about the last general election campaign and carefully avoided, until <Col N="541" /> the very end, referring to the Budget. Deputy Crotty started better.  The references to the actual provisions of the Budget were reduced to the absolute minimum.  On this side of the House we would prefer to discuss the Budget and limit our references to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual debate on the Budget usually presents this House with an opportunity of reviewing and discussing in detail the activities of the Government, particularly over the past twelve months.  If we are to take the periods as Deputy Crotty pointed out, of the lifetime of a Government on which their record should be judged, we have the lifetime of Governments in recent years&mdash; from 1944 to 1948 and from 1948 to 1951.  You had the period of office of a Government from 1951 to 1954 and of a further Government from 1954 to 1957.  Then you have the period of office of the Government from 1957 to the present day.  The period since the present Government took office, equals in length the period over which each of the last four Governments carried on their administration. Bearing that in mind, we should now give serious thought to the conduct of that Government in relation to their financial policy, their commitments and undertakings to the people.  It is the duty of this House to offer their criticisms in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to place on record that the Taoiseach never sought a mandate from the people, never obtained a mandate from the people and that the Government he appointed some time ago are in office because of the vast majority which the Fianna Fáil Party obtained by false promises in the general election.  It is generally believed <Col N="542" /> that because of the present economic conditions, the gloom that hangs over agriculture, the mass unemployment which prevails, the severe burdens imposed on housewives in relation to the cost of living and the many other problems which face our people today, if the Taoiseach sought a mandate from the people, we could not venture to prophesy anything for his Party but their complete elimination from this House.</P>
    <P>That is why I feel that the time has come when the Government should face realities and should do that bearing in mind that, as they have been reminded in this debate, they sought office from the people on promises which they have failed to keep.  In the course of this debate, it has been contended that no undertakings or commitments were entered into by the Government.  Everybody who remembers the last general election&mdash;and I do not blame Deputy Booth for not wanting to revive memories of the last general election because if I were a member of his Party, or even a humble supporter, I should like to forget it&mdash; knows that Fianna Fáil went through the length and breadth of the country not for the purpose of contributing, in a constructive way, towards the building up of the economy of the country, but for the purpose of getting every vote which they could in order to secure office and obtain power.</P>
    <P>That is why I say the Taoiseach has no mandate from the people for this Budget and never obtained one.  The Government have not got the confidence of the people.  The farmers are only waiting for the opportunity to put this Government out.  The workers of this city particularly are waiting for the same opportunity as they had some months ago in the Presidential election to tell them what they think in regard to the cost of living and unemployment.</P>
    <P>We were told that no promises were made in the last election but everybody knows, particularly the Minister for Finance who made the promises from every platform from which he spoke, that promises were made to the farmers in relation to wheat and barley prices, that promises <Col N="543" /> were made to the electorate that bread prices would not be interfered with and that the price of butter would not be increased.  A promise was also made that work would be found to the extent of putting 20,000 people into employment per year.  A promise was made to the dairy farmers that the price of milk supplied to the creameries would be increased and to the taxpayer that the level of taxation was already too high and that the Fianna Fáil Party had plans which they would bring in immediately they assumed office for a general all round reduction in taxation.</P>
    <P>We were told that all that was required was a Fianna Fáil majority and that their policy of providing work, their policy in relation to the cost of living and particularly their policy in relation to agriculture would be put into effect.  We were told that we were to experience a boom period, and that all sections, farmers, workers, business people, industrialists and every other section of the community, would experience a great period of prosperity.</P>
    <P>However, if we were to compare, on the occasion of this Budget, the record of service of the inter-Party Government and their achievements with the record and achievements of the present Government the inter-Party Government would stand the test. During the period of the previous Government, the period which has been criticised by many Fianna Fáil speakers, this country had a Government which kept down the cost of living, a Government which reduced the price of butter and a Government which had a Prices Tribunal sitting and the price of foodstuffs could not be increased without a public sitting and the pros and cons examined fully.  In every case in which the price of foodstuffs was increased, it had to be justified at a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>It is quite true to say that the greatest period of economic development this country ever experienced since native government was established was the period in which the inter-Party Government were in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that is quite true and nobody knows it better than the people themselves. The facts are there.  From 1947 to 1957, we increased the volume of our exports by 100 per cent. and their value was increased from £39,000,000 to £131,000,000.  Can any Deputy deny that?  Can any Deputy deny that that in itself showed a picture of terrific achievements and great development?  Again, in addition to keeping down the cost if living, we provided work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act which gave a volume of financial assistance to every local authority throughout the length and breadth of the country.  Very useful and valuable work was done through the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
      <P>We had the Land Rehabilitation Scheme working at full steam and providing work for numerous people who are now probably working abroad.  Our great record of a 100 per cent. increase in exports during those years and the increase in value from £39,000,000 to £131,000,000 is an achievement which has been very much envied by the Fianna Fáil Party, an achievement which in their wildest dreams they could never achieve.  The same Government provided the Land Project, the Lime Scheme, the Farm Building Scheme, the Parish Plan, the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we are to view the activities of the Government over the past 12 months, we must admit that it has been a year of very serious strain on the agricultural community. It has been a year in which there is a new type of emigration, a type referred to on many occasions in this House.  We had the usual cases in which the father of the family emigrated and sought work elsewhere and sent his weekly allowance home to keep the home fires burning.  But in the past twelve months all over the country there has been a complete removal of entire households.  Every Deputy, no matter on what side of the House, knows numerous houses today with the windows barred and padlocks on the doors; in no place does that prevail more than in the west of Ireland.  Deputies from the west know that sight is more familiar in the past twelve months than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few minutes ago we had a statement from Deputy Booth that a very well-to-do citizen, the owner of an extensive farm, sold out and he also emigrated.  Now, we have an admission that the rich are emigrating as well as the poor.  We are now told <Col N="546" /> that every section of the people are leaving the country.  Why are they going?  What concrete steps have been taken by the present Government to stem emigration in the past year? What provision is there in the Budget to stop the exodus of boys and girls week after week?</P>
    <P>The Budget is a keen disappointment to those who expected an improvement with regard to employment. Is it not true that last Christmas was the blackest Christmas in this country since the Famine?  Is it not true that there were never such long queues in living memory outside labour exchanges and Garda barracks as in the past year because of the large numbers signing for unemployment benefit and dole, trying to get work they cannot obtain?  Is it not true that because sufficient money was not provided in last year's Budget&mdash;and the same applies to the present Budget &mdash;no work was available for hundreds of fathers of families last winter and that those of them who were not lucky enough to emigrate were compelled to exist on the assistance of charitable organisations?</P>
    <P>If the Government want statistics they are available from every local authority to show that the amounts paid in home assistance and under the footwear scheme and allowances provided under the milk scheme have vastly increased in the past year.  That in itself has added an additional burden to the taxpayers by way of increased rates.  How can the Government congratulate itself on that?  Is that not far from the picture the Fianna Fáil Party painted at the last general election?</P>
    <P>It may now be admitted, and the House may take it for granted, that the present Government has no policy on unemployment, that there is no prospect of work, no future, no money provided for work, no useful schemes coming forward to provide work and no future whatever for young people only the emigrant ship.  May we take it that this Budget is a complete admission that so far as promises are concerned, the pledge given by the Taoiseach when he was in Opposition that he would provide 20,000 jobs a <Col N="547" /> year was all ballyhoo and that he knew very well it could not be done?  He knew that if he was in office he would not do it but he thought&mdash;wisely and correctly&mdash;that it would be a great move to assist him in getting into office.  There may now be a clear admission on his part that that was ballyhoo.  He did get into office with a big majority&mdash;the biggest any Government ever got&mdash;and they cannot say anybody in this House can stop them doing anything they want to do. It is in their power to provide the 20,000 jobs they promised, but time is rolling on very fast.  The present Government is in its fourth year and no time flies quicker than the last few months.  Very shortly, an opportunity will be given to the people to pass judgment on undertakings of that kind.</P>
    <P>Having admitted that there is no policy for employment, we must also admit that the Government has no policy to cure emigration, particularly of the serious type involving entire families.  Is it not true that the Government has no policy in relation to the prices of agricultural produce? Are the Fianna Fáil Party ashamed of themselves?  How do they expect to face the agricultural community in the light of the promises they made? This Government has acted not alone callously but with great dishonesty. While that is so in regard to unemployment and emigration, they see fit to bring about relief in this Budget for cinemas and dancehalls.  I have often wondered if it was because of the very generous cheques and subscriptions that flow into Fianna Fáil funds from those people that they always seem to be able to get great concessions from Fianna Fáil.  I know that in this city a number of influential people connected with dancehalls place their ballrooms freely at the disposal of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>This is one of the means the Government has of repaying them.  Those people who give their dancehalls free to the Fianna <Col N="548" /> Fáil Party are the very people who lead the agitation and send deputations to the Minister for Finance seeking concessions.  This is dishonest politics; it is dishonest Government. If we see that favours are to be conferred on any section of the community because of financial benefits and advantages to be sought from them in another direction, I think it is something that should be exposed.</P>
      <P>I admit the cinema will experience a rather thin time when television becomes available.  Nevertheless is this the right time to give relief to the cinemas when the most the Government can provide for the old age pensioner is 1/- per week?  In the <i>Irish Press</i>, the <i>Evening Press</i>, and some of the provincial newspapers favourably disposed to Fianna Fáil, we had the experience some weeks ago of seeing bannerlines proclaiming: &ldquo;Pensions at the rate of £2 per week.&rdquo;  The reference was to the Social Welfare Bill which will be before the House shortly.  So cutely phrased and so carefully edited was the news, that old age pensioners were under the impression they would get £2 per week forthwith.</P>

    <P>Whom do Fianna Fáil think they are fooling?  They succeeded fairly well in fooling the people at the last general election.  The position of the <Col N="549" /> old age pensioner today will take some explaining at the next general election.

      <P>I am concerned for the old age pensioner.  This Budget gives the old age pensioner nothing.  To offer old age pensioners 1/- per week with one hand, and then take it back again with the other, is certainly a step upon which the Government could have no cause to pride themselves.</P>
      <P>This is a disappointing Budget.  It gives the people nothing.  It holds out no hope of any constructive policy over the next twelve months.  It is high time Fianna Fáil packed up and got out.  They must know very well that their survival will be short lived. They must know their hopes of re-election are daily growing more slim.  The position of the country is too serious for playing politics.  The proper course for the Government to adopt would be not to stand in the way of national progress and to allow the Leader of the Opposition, a man of sound judgment, a man held in great admiration by all sections of the community, an opportunity of giving the country a Government which will have some regard to the undertakings they give, a Government which will endeavour to keep taxation within bounds, and a Government which will cater effectively and efficiently for the one and only industry in this country, agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach speaks of the development of this, that, and the other industry and the main industry in the country is allowed to die from lack of attention.  The sooner this Government gives the people an opportunity of electing the kind of Government they really want the better it will be for everybody.  Many people believed in the promises made by Fianna Fáil at the last general election.  Today their eyes are rudely opened and they do not propose to close them again in a hurry. Let Fianna Fáil go out now.  They will not come back.  If they believe this is an honest Budget, let them go out and give the people an opportunity of deciding whether or not it is honest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust this will be the last Budget we shall see introduced by Fianna Fáil.  I trust that before the next twelve months are out the people will have an opportunity of electing a Government <Col N="551" /> which will provide employment, stem the tide of emigration and cater for the one and only industry we have, agriculture.  I hope that the farmers will return to a period of prosperity and that business people and other sections of the community will have a protecting ceiling put on taxation. Taxation has gone beyond all limits.  The cost of Government is too expensive; spending is too extravagant. The sooner there is a change of Government the better it will be for all sections of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>In my long experience of listening to Deputy Oliver Flanagan I have never heard him at such disadvantage as he was tonight. He has said most of the things he said tonight so often that he might now, with advantage, make a record and substitute it for future speeches in this House.  He has suddenly become a powerful champion of agriculture and the farmer.  Nothing amazes me more than to hear Deputy O.J. Flanagan championing the farmer and supporting agriculture.  I was in this House when Fianna Fáil increased the price of milk by 1/- per gallon.  Deputy O. J. Flanagan protested at the temerity of Fianna Fáil in giving that increase in order that, as he said, the rich farmers of Kilkenny and Limerick might get something more for their milk, the &ldquo;something more&rdquo; increasing the price of butter by 2d. per lb. for his constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan described that as the greatest crime ever committed in this country.  It was the greatest crime that we should try to make the farmers of Limerick and Tipperary &mdash;the dairy farmers who the Deputy tells us now are the lifeblood of farming&mdash;prosperous. To hear him mouthing the words &ldquo;farming prosperity&rdquo; is something hard to believe.  Of course, he is a man of wonderful imagination. He talks about emigration and employment, about agriculture being the only industry in the country, as if anybody in the world would believe him.  He talks about the dishonesty of Fianna Fáil, knowing perfectly well that the Budget we have introduced now is definitely the best this country has known <Col N="552" /> for many years and that it is a clear indication we have reached a stage from which we can definitely go forward.</P>
    <P>This Budget gives some benefit to every section of the community.  The Deputy even mentioned this question of the shilling we gave to the old age pensioner and said we tried to confuse the people by making an arrangement whereby in future insured workers will get £2 per week contributory pension and will be allowed to earn another £10 per week if they can.  What does he think the ordinary people of Ireland are?  Surely they are an intelligent people?  Does he imagine we could confuse them by making a statement of that description and lead them to believe that the non-contributory person will get the same sum?  I can assure Deputy O.J. Flanagan that the ordinary working men here are as intelligent as the majority of Deputies and perhaps more so.  They know what the Government have done.  They know that this is a contributory scheme and they welcome it.  Furthermore, they do not talk solely of what the old age pensioner will get.  They talk of the provision in the scheme for the man who loses his employment and the great increase he will get for himself and his children when the scheme is in operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan is really an astonishing person.  I sometimes think he believes what he is saying, but of course I know perfectly well that he knows the statements he makes are full of what he called himself baloney or ballyhoo, or whatever he called it a few minutes ago.  As I told him on one occasion many years ago, he reminds me of a man I knew down in my home town who said of another man similar to Deputy O.J. Flanagan that &ldquo;He opened his mouth and let it say what it liked.&rdquo;  That is what always strikes me when I listen to him.</P>
    <P>Talking about old age pensioners, I was concerned to note that Deputy Kyne on one occasion here about a year ago&mdash;this shows the inconsistency of the opposition to this Budget&mdash;suggested to the Minister of the day that he should increase the tax on beer, spirits, tobacco, cigarettes, cinemas <Col N="553" /> and other luxuries and that the benefits realised should be devoted towards increasing the social services.  Therefore, it was to my amazement that I saw him go into the Lobby to vote against the very thing he had recommended to the Minister.  We put 1d. on tobacco and the benefit of that penny is to be devoted to the very people he suggested.  The one vote we had was on that item; yet he and his Party went into the Lobby to vote against that resolution.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what the Deputy says, I know that for many years the country has never been in as good a position as it is in to-day.  We all know, of course, that, due to weather conditions and other conditions here and across the water, prices did drop. If the inter-Party Government had been in power last year, the same thing would have happened and nothing they could do could have changed it.  We cannot change or affect the weather conditions.  But we know that the revenue was buoyant, that we had a surplus at the end of the year and that we were able to give concessions all around.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan objected to the concessions to dance halls and suggested&mdash;very scandalously, I suggest&mdash;that a Fianna Fáil Government or any Government would give concessions to a dance hall group in order that these dance hall owners could subscribe monies in lieu of the benefits they were getting.  I resent that suggestion very much.  I am glad that the Minister gave these concessions to the dance halls.  I am getting so old now that I do not go to dances but I realise that the young people are entitled to the enjoyment they want and particularly to dances, which they really enjoy.  I am not against dances.  I agree that amusement and entertainment should be provided for our people and that, where necessary, the State should help.</P>
    <P>As far as the cinemas are concerned, the Deputy says that the cinemas are facing a lean time with advent of television.  Of course, he realises that everybody will not be in the same position as he is in.  He confessed <Col N="554" /> to us on the Television Bill that the people he knew did not have television sets and that he would not be able to afford a television set, but we take that with a grain of salt.  His leader said precisely the same thing. His master's voice spoke and the Deputy had to say &ldquo;ditto to that&rdquo;.</P>

This concession the Minister has given will benefit the cinemas and possibly, because of it, they may be able to give better service to their patrons.  I need not tell anybody in Dublin that they are patronised very much.  I am sure both the proprietors of the cinemas and the people who attend them will appreciate the concessions to which Deputy O.J. Flanagan objects.</P>
      <P>The Deputy seems to think that this Government would be defeated, if we appealed to the people.  First of all, I should like to disabuse him of the idea that this Government have any intention of appealing to the people.</P>

As I already said, this Government is stronger now in the opinion of the people than ever it was and I have no doubt that when we appeal to the people again in 1962 we shall be returned with a stronger majority than we have now.  In this Budget we have given a great number of concessions to the people generally and I am hopeful that when we come to introduce the next, and last, Budget of this Parliament we shall be able to do better.  Maybe the Deputy may not like to hear this but, as a result of the next Budget, the people may be convinced that they did a good job when they got rid of the inter-Party Government and gave the country a Government which could do good work for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like yourself, Sir, I have been sitting here most of the night.  I almost thought I was Ceann Comhairle but it was interesting listening to both sides.  A point which I have just realised is that when you talk to yourself, you seem to hear yourself better and I say that because the House has been empty most of the night.  In my opinion, this Budget is not too bad but it was artificially created.  The Minister for Finance said that he had certain moneys to spare and that he would skim them around like butter on bread.  In my opinion he missed a few patches.  I refer to the miserable 1/- increase in old age pensions which I shall deal with in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present I am just wondering if the 100,000 people who left the country in the past three years had no England to go to what would be the position?  Would the Minister have a few million pounds to spread around, or would it have cost £7 million more to maintain those people and provide benefits of one form or another for <Col N="557" /> them?  Suppose there was no England and there was only America to absorb our emigrants.  A person just cannot go to America with his fare and £2 so, believe it or not, we are lucky that they have England to go to.  One can imagine what the position would be if there were no English-speaking country beside us and most of our emigrants had to remain at home.  It would not be so well for the Government.  That is why I say that if there seems to be any slight improvement it was artificially created.  If the Government do a lot better next year, it may be for the same reason that in the interval another 30,000 or 40,000 people will have left the country.</P>
    <P>A development of that kind might seem all right for the few left in the country but eventually it will make for a weak State.  A State with a small population cannot be too secure.  It has always been recognised that a substantially large population gives security in certain forms; but this country is getting weaker, even if the few who remain seem to be doing a little better.  I do not know what will happen if some great European crisis arises and there is a danger of the use of nuclear weapons. Such a crisis could cause a big rush home of our emigrants.  What would we do if 500,000 of them came back here overnight?  I admit there has been, or appears to be, some little progress but I maintain, on the grounds I have stated, that it has been artificially created.  With regard to the Budget itself, I have not as much time as some people to delve into all the facts and statistics.  Anyway I do not know that they prove an awful lot because it has been demonstrated here that if one takes different phases of the history of this House one can make a damned good case for both sides.  Therefore, I shall keep to the Budget as it is, particularly that part of it in which I am interested, the question of social benefits.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The increases in food prices resulting from the Government's <Col N="558" /> agricultural policy will mean additional charges on family budgets.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>These increased payments will more than cover the additional weekly cost of the price increases to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>He was referring to the 1/- increase and dealt solely with increased cost in foodstuffs.  He seemed to forget that during the past year, apart from the increased cost of foodstuffs, there was a general increase in most respects.  For instance, he made no mention in his statement about increased bus fares and it is important to remember that a very large number of the poorer people in the city of Dublin are living on the city outskirts. If they have to come in to the labour exchanges two or three times a week it is true that they may walk, but if they travel by bus it costs them an extra 1d. for the journey.</P>
    <P>Apart from that there has been an increase in rents; in Dublin city recently there was an increase in both rents and rates.  For instance, there are 40,000 corporation tenants and they had their rent increased by a couple of pence per room.  Tenants, who also pay rates, had to meet an increase in them also.  As far as a very large number of people in this city are concerned those increases in rent and rates meant paying almost an additional 10d. a week, but the Minister made no mention of that.  In addition, three or four thousand of them are largely dependent on social benefits and again the Minister made no reference to them.</P>
    <P>It has been indicated that a new Rent Restrictions Bill will come before the House and that landlords will be given power under it to increase rents because of maintenance costs and so forth.  The increases which will arise from the Rent Restrictions Bill together with the other increases will create a general increase in rents.  Therefore, in the case of persons in receipt of social welfare benefits there have been increases in the price of food, in rents and in bus-fares.  The bus fare is the same for the wealthy man and the <Col N="559" /> pauper.  Therefore, the claim cannot be made by the Minister that the shilling increase in social welfare payments will cover, at least, the increase in the price of food.</P>
    <P>In addition, there have been numerous hidden increases.  Employers who have given increased wages to their workers will have to increase the price of their commodities.  The Taoiseach admitted that.  For instance, last week I was in a small shop and a salesman told me that the laces on sale were now sixpence.  They had been four-pence. In cases where the price of a packeted commodity has not been increased the quality and quantity have been reduced.  In other words, there have been, and there will be, increases in the price of almost every commodity. When the Minister suggested that the shilling increase in payments is to cover the few increases mentioned in foodstuffs, he ignored the other increases that have taken place in rents, bus fares and so on.  All these increases mean that the people concerned are far worse off now than they were.  There will be further increases.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say the Minister's shilling is a miserable contribution.  It may be suggested that the recipients do not contribute and, for that reason, are not entitled to anything.  We have a responsibility to these people which should be acknowledged.  There used to be a certain mentality in certain countries that non-productive people were of no advantage to the community and should be got rid of.  In China, girl children were regarded as non-productive and were got rid of. Some African tribes did away with their old people because they ceased to be productive.  We seem to think that way also because apart from treating social welfare recipients in a miserable way, it would seem that we also would like to shove out of the country those who are getting any little benefit.  For instance, when the Parliamentary Secretary, last year, put thousands of persons off the miserable assistance, that was a shove to go to England.  There was a saving of £80,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about a surplus. <Col N="560" /> The surplus was created as a result of people leaving the country and being shoved out of the country by the cutting off of their little pittance.  That is what I mean when I say that the little improvement shown was artificially created at the expense of the most unfortunate elements in the country.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the £2 contributory old age pension.  It might appear that the Government is giving away something.  Actually the Government is giving away nothing.  The rest of the community will pay for it and the Government hopes to profit out of it.  One thing certain is that it will further increase the cost of living because all employed persons will have to pay 1/9, in addition to the increase in rents, if they are on differential rents, and the increase in the cost of other commodities.  In a year's time there will probably be another round of wage increases and, again, recipients of social welfare benefits will suffer more. The employed person can demand his right because he has a union behind him to threaten strike action and he will get 10/- or 12/-. The recipient of social welfare benefits will get a miserable 1/- or 2/-.</P>
    <P>I maintain that the shilling increase does not cover the increases in the cost of living.  I have proved that.  Therefore, I am most disappointed with the Budget.  There has been some slight progress but it was artificially created and the Government has nothing about which it can pat itself on the back.</P>
    <P>I would have been happier if the Government could have made the case that there has been no emigration this year and that they required time to develop industries.  The fact is that emigration this year was as bad as it was last year and it will probably be worse next year.  If there were more housing accommodation in England there would be no limit to emigration. That is the only reason the rate of emigration is not double what it is at the moment.  A percentage of emigrants are returning for no other reason than that they cannot get digs in England. In spite of any artificial form of prosperity that there may be, the nation is weakening from year to year and the Government has nothing to shout <Col N="561" /> about.  My final word is that the shilling which has been given does not cover the increased costs.  It is a miserable allowance.  The Government should have given at least 2/6.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach was nominated and elected in this House he made a speech which gave rise to the hope that his attitude towards politics, public life and the prestige that attaches to high office would be radically changed.  I had thought that the recklessness to which we had become accustomed and which we automatically and justifiably associated with his career both as Minister for Industry and Commerce and in Opposition would disappear. In his speech in this House today, dealing with the Budget and the circumstances of the country generally, he did a great disservice to the prestige of the high office which he holds and lowered the standard of dignity and truth which we must expect and have every right to expect from public men. On an interjection that he had promised 100,000 jobs, he interrupted and flatly denied it.  Words almost fail one to deal with a situation charged with such appalling disregard for the truth, disregard for high office, disregard for the dignity of Parliament and magnificent contempt for the intelligence of our people.</P>
      <P>What is the truth?  The truth is that, the <i>Irish Press</i> of October 12th, 1955, under full front page headlines dealt with an address by Deputy Lemass, as he then was, to a gathering of prominent Dublin Fianna Fáil supporters, in Clery's ballroom.  The <i>Irish Press</i> says in the first, smaller heading that the primary task is the provision of 100,000 jobs in five years and the solution of abnormal emigration. In bigger headlines it says: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil's Aim is Full Employment. Mr. Lemass outlines proposals.&rdquo; This report is made by the <i>Irish Press</i> reporter and he goes on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increase of 100,000 jobs in five years&mdash;or an average rate of increase of 20,000 jobs a year&mdash;would result in full employment here, as <Col N="562" /> normally understood, and the end of abnormal emigration.</P>
    <P>We are accustomed now to hearing that private enterprise must bear the brunt of providing employment but listen to the next heading from the <i>Irish Press</i> reporter who is summarising the events of this famous evening in Clery's Ballroom:</P>
    <P>Early work is for Government,</P>
    <P>Private Investment Follows</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass said Fianna Fáil's view was:</P>
    <P>(1)  That the successful application of a sound development policy required a carefully prepared investment programme.</P>
    <P>(2)  That this investment programme must, in its earlier stages, be undertaken mainly by the Government.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Expansion&rdquo; it is further reported:</P>
    <P>This is the sliding scale on which Fianna Fáil suggests that employment &mdash; making expenditure should be stepped up:&mdash;</P>
    <P>First Year: Public investment outlay to be expanded by £13 million thus raising total national expenditure by £20 million and creating 20,000 new jobs (at this stage no private contribution is reckoned with)....</P>
    <P>Second Year: Gross national expenditure again increased by £20 million bringing total increase to £40 million, with a corresponding effect on employment....</P>
    <P>Third Year: A further £20 million rise is assumed, likewise in the fourth year.  By the fifth year, on this calculation, full employment should be achieved and 100,000 new jobs created.</P>
    <P>There is a further heading: &ldquo;How Best to Use Money&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Mr. Lemass suggested that its main uses should be:</P>
    <P>1&mdash;To improve the land and raise its productive powers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> 2&mdash;To find more efficient industrial equipment and develop our resources of fuel and power.</P>
    <P>3&mdash;To develop our technical knowledge and skills.</P>
    <P>Said Mr. Lemass: &ldquo;It is what the people of a country do to improve themselves that matters in the last analysis...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The hours they work ... what they put into production ... the habits of independence and cooperation which they bring to their work ... these are the things that determine their progress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is along these lines that Fianna Fáil is planning the nation's progress,&rdquo; Mr. Lemass concluded. &ldquo;In the present task of completing these plans, and the ultimate task of fulfilling them, Fianna Fáil asks the co-operation and support of all sections of the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this were not a plan put forward to delude an unsuspecting people the Taoiseach would not, as the Press reporter records, have spoken for an hour and a quarter: &ldquo;There was long applause for his speech, from an overflow audience.&rdquo;  His principal law officer now the Attorney General, presided.</P>
    <P>To-day we had the miserable spectacle of the Taoiseach denying that he ever said that or denying that he ever promised it.  So important was it regarded at the time as a piece of vote-catching propaganda that the <i>Irish Press</i>, the Fianna Fáil Party organ, thought fit to issue the full text of his speech in a special supplement and said so on the front page in case any member of the electorate would fail to see it.</P>
    <P>To-day, too, the Taoiseach rather peculiarly tried to minimise the effect and, indeed, went so far as to disregard the truth of the statistical statements made by the Office of which he himself is in control.  He said that the year 1959 was the year in which we were going ahead and from which we could look ahead, that it was not a backward year like the years 1956 and 1957.  I want to take the statistical <Col N="564" /> record issued prior to the Budget of 1959, entitled <i>Economic Statistics</i> and compiled by the Central Statistics Office.  I quote from page 5:</P>
    <P>Live cattle exports in 1958, at £38.5 million, were £7.2 million less in value than in 1957, though fairly substantial rises took place in the average prices of the different categories. This was a continuation of the decline in numbers which began in the autumn of 1957.</P>
    <P>There is another picture of the decline in our staple industry from the booklet similarly entitled <i>Economic Statistics</i> issued prior to the Budget of 1960 and again compiled by the Central Statistics Office.  On page 8 it says:</P>
    <P>In 1959, as compared with 1958, the output of cattle declined by 72,000 or by £5 million in value. The value of total milk output fell by £2.2 million and the output of pigs by £1.7 million.  A fall of £1.4 million in the output of sheep and lambs was offset to some extent by a rise of £0.7 million in wool. Lower prices for turkeys caused a drop of £0.6 million and egg production declined by £1.1 million. The aggregate output of livestock and livestock products fell by £11.7 million from £141.5 million in 1958 to £129.8 million in 1959.</P>
    <P>This is the year from which we are told we can look ahead, when there is a history of decline from the Office of which he himself as Taoiseach is in charge.  He accuses us blandly across the House of having no alternative policy.  I interpret that, not as a challenge, but as a policy&mdash;bereft orphans cry for some proposal from this side of the House which he could gobble up as has been done on two occasions since November of last year in matters of national policy, both proposals taken from Deputy Dillon's published pronouncements.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach deplores what he calls, if we have any weakness at all, our great weakness, namely our disposition to be sorry for ourselves, and says there is no need for that, that we are well circumstanced.  I wonder if the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers <Col N="565" /> go into the shops of our cities, our larger urban towns or any of our villages, if they go to the fairs or to the markets or meet people where they usually congregate and discuss their affairs, will they detect in any one of those places this wonderful optimism, this wonderful cause for joy which the Minister for Finance, followed by the Taoiseach to-day, would have us believe exists?  One would have thought that the Minister for Finance, in company with the other Ministers of the Government presided over by the Taoiseach, had been applying wet towels to their heads, in the months gone by, in an effort to give tax reliefs or other concessions which would benefit the community or certain sections of it.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Budget Statement side by side with the document entitled &ldquo;Submission by Association of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland to the Minister for Finance in regard to the 1960/61 Budget.&rdquo;  This Submission contains certain recommendations in regard to &ldquo;Income Tax&rdquo;.  At paragraph (4) the Submission says:</P>
    <P>At present trading losses can only be carried forward for six years.  After that period any unrelieved loss lapses and cannot be set-off against future profits.  Under Section 342 of the British Income Tax Act, 1952, business losses can be carried forward indefinitely and it is submitted that similar legislation should be adopted in this country.</P>
    <P>At page 46 of the Budget Statement under the heading &ldquo;Business Losses Relief&rdquo; the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will introduce certain alterations with respect to the treatment of business losses for tax purposes.  At present such losses as have not otherwise been relieved may be carried forward and set off against profits of the same trade, etc., for the six following years of assessment.  I propose to remove this time limit and to allow the losses to be carried forward indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (5) of the Submission of <Col N="566" /> the Association of Chambers of Commerce says:</P>
    <P>Under Section 34 of the Finance Act 1918, the loss incurred in the closing years of a business can be carried back for only one year.  It is considered that this period should be extended to three years which (under Section 18 of the British Finance Act, 1954) is the current British practice.</P>
    <P>At page 46 of the Budget Statement, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>I also propose to allow losses incurred in the closing year of a business to be carried back and set off against profits of the same business for the preceding three years.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (6) of the Submission says:</P>
    <P>In accordance with Section 7 of the Finance Act 1932 (as amended by Section 7 of the Finance Act 1956) an allowance is made of 20 per cent. on the tax on dividends paid on stocks issued for public subscription, after 4th August, 1932, by Irish manufacturing companies who comply with the conditions laid down in the Act.  In order to encourage further investment in Irish Industries it is submitted that this relief should be extended to the dividends paid by all Irish companies including utility companies.</P>
    <P>At page 40 of the Minister's Statement, we see this rather amazingly original piece of thought:</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, as amended by subsequent enactments, including the Finance Act, 1957, provides 20 per cent. income tax and sur-tax relief on dividends or interest from certain securities issued after 4 August, 1932.  I have decided to eliminate the distinction between securities issued by manufacturing companies after that date and securities issued on or before it.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (11) of the Submission of the Association of Chambers of Commerce says:</P>
    <P>The present taxation allowance for <Col N="567" /> children is restricted to £100 for each child under sixteen, or receiving full-time instruction, or serving an apprenticeship.  It is considered that this allowance should be increased.</P>
    <P>At Page 38 of the Minister's Statemen we find the original proposal thought up by the Minister or by the Government, as the Minister would have us believe when he says:</P>
    <P>I am inserting in the Finance Bill a provision to raise the income tax and sur-tax deduction allowable in respect of a child from £100 to £120.</P>
    <P>In the Submission by the Association of Chambers of Commerce, we find this suggestion with regard to death duties:</P>
    <P>Death duty is levied on all estates passing in excess of a capital value of £2,000.  This tax is entirely indiscriminate and the duty is charged at the appropriate rate irrespective of the number of dependants or the personal circumstances of the deceased.</P>
    <P>At page 39 of the Budget Statement, the Minister again comes forward with a piece of original thought about death duties and rather than have people believe that the Government absolutely sweated blood in their efforts to find ways and means whereby reliefs could be provided, the country should know how much they are indebted for this piece of thinking on death duties to the Association of Chambers of Commerce in the submission which they made, which has been in the Minister's hands since January, 1960, and which was circulated to us after the Budget.</P>
    <P>The old age pension increase of 1/- is applauded and lauded by the Fianna Fáil side of the House, but, as Deputy Sherwin correctly remarked in his contribution this evening, the Budget Statement failed to take any cognisance of the fact that substantial increases had been levied on the community prior to the Budget and were not incorporated in it.  I refer to the increase in transport costs, the increase to post and telegraph users, the increase in rents, as well as those contemplated, and the various increases in the price of almost every commodity one has to buy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> Side by side with that, in relation to social welfare benefits recipients, there is, through the length and breadth of the country, a horde of social welfare officers working overtime trying to reduce the widow's mite and the inadequate pensions the old age pensioners receive, prying into every possible avenue and applying the means test with a vigilance and ruthlessness one does not usually associate with a country which enjoys the beautiful state of affairs the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach would have us believe this country enjoys to-day.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan was quite correct when he said that the contributory pension scheme, as announced, contains a very strong element of propaganda.  We shall wait and see and I do not think I shall be proved wrong when I say it will be found that very few people in rural Ireland will benefit under that scheme, having regard to the conditions that must be complied with.  I do not know if anyone will have the necessary ten years in insurance and if anyone within those ten years will have 48 continuous contributions or credits in each contribution year.  In any event, the Government should not take credit for this because, according to the answer to a question at Question Time today, the scheme will cost employers £2,000,000, employees another £2,000,000, and it will cost the Government some few thousands of pounds.  Deputy Corish says those must be conservative estimates because it is bound to cost more.  It will turn out to be the same sort of seed as was sown with the Health Act and which brought forth dragons' teeth.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made with the progress in our civil aviation and our likely progress in television.  It must be great comfort to people to know that the jets will provide them with a lower emigrant fare.  It must be of equally great comfort to know that these emigrants will recall the closed houses they left behind them and over which no television aerials stand.  As Deputy Sherwin correctly says, the situation surrounding this Budget is purely artificial, particularly in relation to unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> I have not so far seen the figures for 1959 but I have the figures given in reply to a Question in the British House of Commons relating to the years 1957 and 1958.  In those two years, the first two years of Fianna Fáil administration, there applied in Britain for the first time for new cards 106,365 persons from this country. What the figure is for 1959 I do not know.  I have concrete evidence which leads me to believe that the figure for 1959 was equally appalling and still continues.</P>
    <P>While the Taoiseach was speaking this afternoon about the beautiful state of our country, I could not help thinking that, at that moment, the trains from the south, the west and the north-west were making their way to Amiens Street and Westland Row to catch the boats at the North Wall and at Dún Laoghaire.  Last weekend, I carried out a certain investigation in my constituency.  It could not be a very exhaustive investigation.  I had to confine it to three areas which form one whole parish, on one hand, and two parts, roughly half, of two other parishes.  If the Minister still thinks along the lines indicated in his Budget Statement, I shall make him a present of these figures now.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>By the standards of four-fifths of the world's population, we are very well off.  The great majority of our people are reasonably well fed and well housed.  The conditions of life in Ireland are good.  Our people have the safety and comfort of a peaceful, civilised society.</P>
    <P>In the parish of Ballycroy in my constituency, 17 houses have closed since 1957.  The windows are barred and the doors are padlocked.  In the Budget debate of that year, I said that if I could see one thing happening to the people for whom I spoke, it was that emigration would be more severe and that it would arise for people at an even younger age than had ever been anticipated.  My words were only too true.</P>
    <P>In the Island of Innishipple, which is part of the parish of Ballycroy, three houses are similarly closed and the <Col N="570" /> whole family in each case has gone away.  Therefore, the total for that comparatively small parish in three years is 20 houses closed and 20 families lost to this country.  I do not think they will come back.  Certainly, they will not come back on the reply the Taoiseach gave me some few weeks ago when I asked him if he were aware that this parish had been hit by emigration and unemployment, what he proposed to do about it and if there were any plans in any Department to relieve the position.  I was told work was available at Bellacorick which is at least 20 miles away from the nearest inhabitant resident in that parish.  I was told a new school was about to be built which might employ three or four persons.  I was told the Land Commission might do something in that part of the country at a very early date.  There is plenty of outlet in that district for forestry, for fishing development, for very many plans that would be of benefit to the people there and which might result in keeping, the remaining houses open.</P>
    <P>I do not hold out any hope of the other families coming back.  My fear is that more houses will close and that other families will join them in the not too distant future.  This is not the pessimism which the Minister deplores. This is not the pessimism which, on the Vote on Account, he deplored from Deputies on this side of the House.  These are facts which it is our duty not to conceal but to bring to the notice of the Legislature. I wonder how the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach would feel if, driving through their constituencies, they saw these once happy homes with the windows barred, the doors locked, families gone, no smoke in the chimney any more.  How does one feel, as a legislator, hoping to do one's best for one's people?  How consciences must smart at such dullness and decay in rural Ireland.  I have given the particulars in relation to one parish.</P>
    <P>I now move into the half parish of Achill where it cannot be said I get anything like the majority support, where it has been boasted by my colleagues from my constituency that I <Col N="571" /> have no need to go into Achill as they are all Republicans there; where they can attend their meetings and do queer things through the Department of Transport and Power.</P>

They can be checked and I defy contradiction.  Shraheens, 15 houses closed; Blenaskill, five houses closed; Derreens and Achill Beg, 20 houses closed; Dooega, 30 houses closed; Ashleam, 9 houses closed; Saula, four houses closed; Currane, nine houses closed; Belfarsad, seven houses closed; Cashel, two houses closed; Bunacurry, 13 houses closed.  In and Doonivor, 13 houses closed.  In half a parish of industrious people whose form of leaving the country to earn money was hitherto migratory or seasonal&mdash;the kind of thing that is well known to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, from West Donegal&mdash;a total of 143 houses closed.  Here is a new development. The house is closed and the entire family goes away.  I have no figures yet for lower Achill.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment, Deputy Palmer gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question 14 on the Order Paper of the 28th April, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last, I asked the Minister for Finance the following question:</P>
      <P>If a scheme has yet been worked out between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Local Government for the relief of flooding in the Glenflesk area, near Killarney; and, since the matter is one of extreme urgency, if he can now make a statement which may relieve the anxiety of the flood victims concerned.</P>
      <P>This is the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained to a deputation <Col N="573" /> in November last, the Commissioners of Public Works could deal with flooding in the Glenflesk area only by means of scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, for the Laune catchment, and it will be several years before that catchment can be reached in the arterial drainage programme.  There was no question of a joint scheme being worked out between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Local Government but in furtherance of my promise to the deputation, I mentioned the matter to the Minister for Local Government so that he would be aware of the circumstances of the case if proposals in respect of road improvements were made to him.</P>
    <P>I recollect the representative deputation which saw the Parliamentary Secretary on that occasion.  We had the parish priest of Glenflesk, Deputy Mrs. Crowley and myself, members of the Kerry County Council and some local representatives.  Having considered that the Parliamentary Secretary gave us to understand that it would be too long to await the introduction of the arterial drainage of that particular area and that it might be considered as a scheme in relief of flooding rather than drainage, we felt that some scheme might be advised by which the flooding could be relieved in the area.</P>
    <P>It is known in the Board of Works and elsewhere that the river Flesk flows through a valley which, in a sense, is lower than sea level.  The Flesk flows into Killarney Lakes and the Laune flows out of the Lakes into Dingle Bay.  It would, therefore, come under the Laune catchment area.  So far as we know, there is no need at all nor will there ever be, I am sure, for any drainage scheme under arterial drainage for the river Laune.  Therefore, if they have to wait until that catchment area is reached in 50, 60 or 70 years' time, the people now living in Glenflesk will be dead and gone and none of their descendants will live in it.</P>
    <P>The difficulty that so often arises in connection with the flooding was explained to the Parliamentary Secretary. Serious trouble arises in connection <Col N="574" /> with the flooding of these valleys.  Torrents pour down the mountain and when there is a heavy rainfall they rush down into the main river which is slow-flowing.  The position would be much worse than it was for some years past were it not for the fact that under the Local Authorities (Works) Act certain drainage was done.</P>
    <P>Bushes along the banks of the river were cut down.  Certain curves in the river and also some islands were cut away.  In fact, if the Local Authorities (Works) Act were still in operation, provision was to be made by the Kerry County Council by which an island in a certain part of the river would be cut away.  It was felt that if that could be done the real flooding would be eased.  When sudden flooding occurs at certain times of the year in this area the people are oftentimes surprised in their beds.  Their cattle are surrounded by water and their houses are flooded. Their lives and the lives of their livestock are in danger.  In fact, I understand that they have to keep a kind of watch whenever there is danger of flooding so as to give sufficient warning for the people to move their cattle up the mountain sides before the flood comes.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in his reply to my question on the 28th, said:</P>
    <P>There was no question of a joint scheme being worked out between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Local Government but in furtherance of my promise to the deputation, I mentioned the matter to the Minister for Local Government so that he would be aware of the circumstances of the case if proposals in respect of road improvements were made to him.</P>
    <P>It is very bad if he only &ldquo;mentioned&rdquo; the matter.  The deputation went away satisfied that something would be done and that the Parliamentary Secretary would do more than merely mention the matter to the Minister for Local Government so that he would know all the circumstances of the case made to him.  I think it was perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary himself or some of his engineers present who <Col N="575" /> spoke of relieving flooding on the roads.</P>
    <P>The roads are flooded but we are not so much interested in the flooding of the roads as in the flooding of the houses and the lands and the danger to human beings and the fear of their livestock being drowned.  If you raise the roads in the hollows where serious flooding occurs, what are you doing? You are throwing the flood waters right into the lands and the houses. That would be a rather peculiar arrangement to relieve the flooding.</P>
    <P>The deputation made a good case. The Parliamentary Secretary, his officials and the engineers of the Board of Works were impressed by the case made.  In fact, we all went away&mdash; and Deputy Mrs. Crowley could confirm this fact, if necessary&mdash;under the impression that something special would be done; that, if necessary, some kind of short legislation would be introduced which would give power to the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Local Government to relieve the flooding.  That is the impression we got.  When the people in the area are informed of the reply by the Parliamentary Secretary, I am sure they will be seriously disappointed.</P>
    <P>I thought it only right that I, on behalf of those people, should tell the Parliamentary Secretary even at this stage it is not too late to look up the file in connection with the matter and see if something could be done to relieve flooding.  I know very well, of course, that the Minister for Local Government and the Department concerned would not like to put the Local Authorities (Works) Act into operation. For some reason, they do not like it.</P>

I am sure that there are places, even in the Parliamentary Secretary's <Col N="576" /> own constituency in Donegal, where such legislation would be necessary to relieve flooding in cases like this.  There is no use telling the people of Glenflesk that they must wait for the operation of the Arterial Drainage Act in that particular area.  That would be a wait in <i>saecula saeculorum.</i> In any case, as I say, there is no question of drainage; it is a question of relieving flooding.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will do something in the very near future, before next winter when the serious flooding may occur, so that the people in the area may live in comfort in their homes and feel assured that their livestock will be safe.</P>

      <P>Deputy Palmer's statement is basically true to a point.  However, he may have gone away with an impression which I certainly did not intend to give him and which I do not think I did convey.  It is true to say that the deputation made a very good impression because, like every other deputation concerning drainage, they had a very good case to make.  The Flesk is a river which is subject not to ordinary flooding as much as to torrential flooding periodically, and it is a question of control rather than drainage.</P>
      <P>It was shortly before I received the deputation that the parish priest and the curate were marooned as a result of flooding, and it created a lot of local feeling at the time, possibly resulting in the deputation coming to Dublin.  But it was just one of the many cases which we have been asked to deal with in my short time in that office and every deputation asks for a portion of a major catchment area to be taken before the catchment is reached.  That is exactly what the position was and I think I made it perfectly clear to the deputation on that occasion that what they were asking was outside the scope of the programme of arterial drainage and that it would have to be taken as portion of the major catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Palmer pointed out, it is the river which flows into the lake and not the outflow river, which would <Col N="577" /> make it all the more difficult to take that portion of the catchment without taking the catchment as a whole.  The Deputy referred to the sea level.  I doubt if that is true&mdash;it may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The engineer's report on it is that it is a torrential river and that flood control is what is required.  We thought of many possible solutions to the problem, something which might offer an immediate solution, but we could not undertake them.  There was no question of our cooperating with the county council but I did promise that I would discuss the matter with the Minister for Local Government, as I did on more than one occasion, in the hope that the local authority could justify the expenditure of some money on the drainage of that river and relieve the flooding on the road.</P>
      <P>It was emphasised by the deputation that the railway somewhere contiguous to it, or adjoining it, was about to be closed and that that would divert a certain amount of extra traffic to the road which was subject to flooding as a result of the Flesk river being in the condition it was in.  In that way, we saw a possible reason why Local Government might interest itself in paying some attention to the road.  Naturally the thing to do would be to relieve the flooding so as to leave the road immune to floods and solve the problem for the time being of the drainage of the Flesk river.  That is one of the things which I saw as the only possible immediate solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke of the Local Authorities (Works) Act and of making money available for work under that Act.  I would remind the Deputy that £2,500 was spent on this river under that Act and it is something which goes to prove that any type of scheme for drainage work of that magnitude is actually wasted money unless some provision is made for maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If that money had not been spent, the people and <Col N="578" /> their livestock would all have been drowned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody was drowned there at any time and that amount of money was expended and my information is, and I am afraid the deputation was of the same opinion, that the position is just as bad as it was before the £2,500 was expended on it.  It is very likely that it has aggravated the problem.  That has happened in many cases and it just shows again, that the problem cannot be tackled piecemeal.  To tackle it piecemeal sometimes only aggravates the entire problem and creates a worse problem than that which we undertook to remedy at the time.</P>
      <P>However impetuous the Kerry people may be about solving this immediate problem, they must realise&mdash; they have two big arterial drainage schemes, one which has been completed successfully, the other being well under way, so that Kerry is not doing badly&mdash;that arterial drainage is really the solution for serious flooding of any type.  I do not agree that it will be so many generations until it is undertaken, if we maintain the present rate of progress.</P>
      <P>The Deputy would be well advised to pursue the question of having some relief afforded of a more permanent nature than in the past.  I am afraid the Office of Public Works have no scheme under which they could undertake piecemeal catchment areas already on the list of areas to be undertaken as major catchment schemes.  We have had a deputation from Boyle which felt that part of that area should be undertaken, and deputations from several parts of Tipperary which felt that tributaries in major catchment areas should be undertaken for the time being.  If one were to accede to any request in that respect, the whole arterial drainage programme would resolve itself into one of piecemeal drainage and leave us where we were before the 1945 Act was put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that it is not possible to say something more encouraging.  As I explained to the deputation at the time &mdash;I thought I had made the position <Col N="579" /> clear, but Deputy Palmer may have misunderstood at the time&mdash;I did not and could not undertake to give a promise that the Office of Public Works would co-operate with the county council because there is no such scheme under which they could co-operate to relieve flooding of that type at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Laune catchment scheme is a worth-while scheme and when it is carried out, it will be the third of its type in Kerry&mdash;which is a very good record in the county.  I was definitely impressed by the very good case made by the deputation, and even the officials of the county council who were fully conversant with the situation at the time appreciated the position.  In fact, some of the county council officials requested assistance from the Office of Public Works by way of survey and advice and even the hiring or loan of machinery to enable them, if they undertook it at any time, to carry out the job.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Department of Local Government have fully examined the situation&mdash;and, mark you, I would be very careful not to say anything that would commit them to something to which it is not my responsibility to commit them&mdash;they may find some reason, as I have suggested, for alleviating road flooding problems which will have to be tackled at some stage and in that <Col N="580" /> regard, the relief of the flooding might be the only possible solution.  That would meet the dual purpose of safeguarding the roads and controlling the floods for some time until the Office of Public Works get round to doing a really complete job on it.</P>

I am hopeful that they may see good reason for doing something that will remedy the flooding on the road and alleviate the flooding from the river.</P>
