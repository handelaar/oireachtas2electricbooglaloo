      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the number of emigrants from this country to the United States is limited to a fixed quota; if so, what was the quota for each of the years 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960; whether the quota for each of these years has been filled; and what is the number who have already left this country for the United States in the current year.</P>

      <P>Apart from special categories such as the spouses and children of United States citizens, the spouses and children of natives of Western Hemisphere countries and ministers of religion and their spouses and children, the number of emigrants from this country to the United States is limited to a fixed quota.  The quota for the years mentioned by the Deputy has been 17,756. Published reports of the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the United States Department of Justice indicate that the quota was not filled in the years 1956, 1957 and 1958.  The 1959 report does not appear to have been published yet.  The number of persons who have left this country for the United States in the current year is not available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the heavy cost in bus fares which has to be incurred by unemployed persons in the Ballyfermot area, Dublin, who must attend twice weekly at Werburgh Street employment exchange; and, if so, if he will arrange for such persons to sign on in some building in Ballyfermot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy) Michael Joseph Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons resident in the Ballyfermot area reside mainly between two and four miles from Werburgh Street Employment Exchange.  In accordance with normal procedure such persons should attend at the Exchange on alternate days.  A concession was, however, granted a few years ago whereby the persons concerned are required to attend on only two days per week.  Unemployed persons residing more than four miles from Werburgh Street Exchange&mdash;of whom there are some in the Ballyfermot area &mdash;are required to attend on only one day per week.  I regard these requirements as very reasonable and, therefore, do not propose to provide a signing centre in Ballyfermot.</P>
      <P>To comply with the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance, recipients must show that they are available for and genuinely seeking employment.  As the main sources of employment are to be found in and around the City centre it is to be expected that unemployed persons in Ballyfermot will regularly approach these sources in search of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> I would point out to the Deputy that it is incumbent on me to see that such arrangements are made as will satisfy me that those who claim unemployment benefit or assistance are not only capable of work but are genuinely available for work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give the name and date of appointment of each member of the outgoing Dundrum Old Age Pensions Sub-Committee: how many meetings of this sub-committee were held during its term of office, and the attendance of each member; who is responsible for notifying members of meetings; and if each member is entitled to receive such notification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the appointment of members of old age pension sub-committees rests with the parent local pension committee in each case, and my Department is not notified, nor has it any details, of these appointments; neither has it any details of the numbers of meetings held by sub-committees or attendances at such meetings.  Arrangements for the holding of meetings of sub-committees, and for notifying members of meetings, are a matter for determination by each sub-committee, subject to any provisions which the parent local committee may make in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say whether it is a fact that certain people, duly appointed to this sub-committee, were not, in fact, notified of the meetings during the years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is a great irregularity if a secretary does not carry out his duty of notifying every member of meetings so that each member <Col N="826" /> will be able to attend the meetings and do his duty?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received and investigated one such complaint.  No member of the staff of the Central Scrivenery Office is now engaged on work relating to a case which is the subject of criminal proceedings. While, due to a combination of circumstances, there has been some delay and accumulation of work in the Scrivenery Office, I am not aware that undue hardship has been caused, as special arrangements were made to deal with urgent cases.  There are at present no arrears of work of any consequence in the Central Scrivenery Office, and the position will continue to be kept under review.</P>

The Dáil has already approved one Supplementary Estimate for it, pending the enactment of a Bill which is now almost ready for consideration by the Government.  The first Supplementary Estimate was not sufficient for the purpose of the company.  They now require further moneys.  The matter has, I think, already been approved in principle.  Again, if there is any embarrassment or difficulty about taking it on Thursday we shall consider taking it later.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to amend and extend the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1958, and the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1959.</P>

      <P>Am I correct in believing that the Money Resolution in connection with this Bill is designed to provide for the Exchequer contribution which is to correspond with the contribution made by employers and employees?  Further, am I correct in <Col N="845" /> thinking that the transfer of persons now in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions to the category of those who hereafter will enjoy contributory old age pensions is calculated to save the Exchequer approximately £2½ million, thus leaving the net contribution from the Exchequer in respect of this service at about £300,000?  These figures deserve attention.  We ought, when considering the nature of the contribution hereafter to be paid by the employer and the employee which, between them, will amount to approximately £4 million per annum, to appreciate that what that will mean to a section of the existing old age pensioners is a supplement of 11/6 per week to the old age pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the old age pension aspect is concerned, at present he is entitled to 28/6 per week.  When he becomes a contributory old age pensioner, as a result of the contribution by employers and employees of £4 million a year, he will get in respect of his old age pension a supplement of 11/6 per week.  As the Minister says, there are other benefits in connection with widows and orphans and certain other services which are also referred to in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the contributory old age pension principle has attracted much attention in the country.  It is desirable that we should clearly know the exact nature of the proposed benefit. While I think it is the desire of Parties on all sides of this House to collaborate in the improvement of our social services, nothing is more important than that when we impose additional taxation we should try to get for that taxation the best possible value for the beneficiaries we have in mind.  Four million pounds per annum is not a small sum.  A sum of four million pounds per annum represents approximately two shillings on income tax&mdash;that is my recollection.  That is a formidable tax burden to carry in this country and there is a great danger which has grown up in recent years <Col N="846" /> of short-circuiting the Budget and we manage to impose very substantial taxation without any reference to the Budget at all, with the result that there is no annual accounting for the charge thereafter.  But what we are in effect doing in this Bill is bringing in a Supplementary Estimate which is to involve the employee and the employer in the payment of £4,000,000 per annum more than they are paying at present.</P>
    <P>I have studied the benefits set out in this Bill &mdash; 11/6d. on the old age pension for this very restricted number of pensioners and certain benefits under the Widows' Pensions Act and other allowances &mdash; and we are all in considerable difficulty here because the calculation of these benefits is an extremely abstruse, actuarial procedure which I certainly am not competent to investigate adequately, but, having been associated with a good deal of insurance legislation in this House in the past, both of commercial and social character, I know sufficient about it to realise that £4,000,000 per annum is a pretty formidable premium.</P>
    <P>I often wonder if the whole of these premiums were offered to insurance companies, plus the charge that falls upon the Exchequer for the administration of these payments, would we get better value than we get at present? Frankly, I do not know but, mark you, whatever the source of Exchequer contributions is &mdash; and in one sense, you may say it is being provided by the old age pensioners themselves &mdash; the total annual payment hereafter for the total benefits for insured persons under this code will amount to about £6¾ million per annum.</P>
    <P>I wonder what a premium of that character would purchase from commercial insurance?  I wonder if the Minister has caused any inquiry to be made into that matter and if he has, I should be very glad to have the fruit of his inquiry but I should be especially grateful if he would tell us to-day whether he thinks that, having regard to the substantial additional taxation which we undertake &mdash; £4 million per annum&mdash;the benefits envisaged in this Bill will be commensurate with the <Col N="847" /> burden that will fall upon the employee and the employer.</P>
    <P>It is very important that that should be made clear because the reason for inviting a young man on the threshold of life entering employment at 18 or so, to undertake this very substantial annual burden to provide against contingencies which, to the young mind, are very hard to envisage and which he naturally wonders if they will ever come to pass, is something that you have a duty to make very clear and precise.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Money Resolution is the appropriate time to mention one detail of this matter.  The stamp, that is the contribution made by the employee hereafter, is now assuming formidable proportions. Would it be possible in any way to provide where a young boy enters employment at, say 16, or whenever he first becomes liable to stamp his card, that instead of levying upon him from the first day of his employment the full subscription, it would be for the first five years, say, a graduated subscription working up, say, at 21, to the full stamp which he is required to pay under the section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for the first time I have some sympathy with the point of view which has been expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, although I think that he rather understated perhaps the position which will exist as between contributory old age pensioners, on the one hand, and the other categories of beneficiaries who will benefit pretty considerably under this Bill, on the other.  It is not true to say that the Bill will benefit mainly the existing holders of non-contributory old age pensions who will receive <Col N="848" /> contributory old age pensions under the Bill because the other extensions and the increases of benefits under other heads will be very considerable also.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that the contributory old age pensions will perhaps account for two-thirds of the total cost of the Bill and, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, they will pay&mdash; perhaps &ldquo;pay&rdquo; is not the right word &mdash;there will be savings in respect of the non-contributory pensions which they now enjoy which will enable us to defray the cost of contributory old age pensions to these pensioners to the extent &mdash; and I am doing a sum in mental arithmetic to which I hope the Deputy will not hold me too strictly &mdash;of about two-thirds again of the content of the new contributory pensions.</P>
      <P>The other benefits which arise under this Bill, apart altogether from contributory pensions, are very substantial and those who will be called upon to pay increased contributions will be paying them in order to enjoy increased benefits in respect of periods during which they may be ill or unemployed and also very considerably and very substantially increased benefits for their widows and for their own children. Therefore, I think it is not true to say that this Bill will merely provide benefits for persons who are now 70 years old or over or who will in the near future attain the age of 70 years.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this Bill covers the whole range of social maintenance services, in so far as these include pensions for old people, allowances for those who are unemployed, pensions for widows and pensions for orphans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal more is being given under this Bill than just merely increasing the amount paid to holders of non-contributory old age pensions. The Deputy in his speech suggested that really the only benefit to be conferred under this Bill would be an increase in the rate of pension enjoyed by the holder of a non-contributory pension who had been in insurable employment during his lifetime.  Of course, that is not so because, first of <Col N="849" /> all, there is no means test and also the dependant of an existing old age pensioner who has been in insurable employment and who has fulfilled the conditions for securing a pension will immediately be given an allowance under this Bill, an allowance which she will not lose during the remainder of her life unless she happens to remarry or breaks one of the other conditions attaching to that dependant's allowance.  Once the dependant's allowance is given to the spouse of a person who has become entitled under the Bill to a contributory old age pension, that allowance will continue and exist during her lifetime and it will be paid irrespective of means. There is no means test in relation to this Bill.  I think we could regard that as a great social advance.  Of course, the Bill is based on the insurance principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there no means test in respect of a non-contributory old age pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That comes under another Bill which I hope to bring before the House tomorrow but this Bill is based entirely on the insurance principle and relates only to those persons who have been in insurable employment during their lifetime. Therefore, so far as the dependants of these persons who become entitled to contributory old age pensions are concerned, there is no means test.  I think that represents very much more than the Leader of the Opposition adverted to when he was speaking to me because this concerns not merely a man, but a spouse; not merely a woman, but her spouse and it means that there will be some provision made for them during their lifetime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No short-circuiting of the Budget is taking place under this Bill, as the Leader of the Opposition alleged.  The provisions of the Bill were envisaged in the Budget speech and it was quite clearly indicated there what the additional net contribution from the Exchequer would be.  There was also a very clear indication that these proposals were based, as I have said, on the principle of insurance and, of <Col N="850" /> course, that principle involves the payment of premiums at whatever rate may be regarded as equitable.</P>
    <P>The Deputy put a question as to whether the whole scheme had been offered to an insurance company and asked would we get better value from an insurance company.  First of all, in our circumstances, I do not think any of our insurance companies would be prepared to take the risk.  The fact of the matter, quite frankly, is that the Exchequer is taking what might be described as an open risk in regard to this matter because we have not been able, despite everything we have done, to get very close estimates as to what this will cost the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am coming to the House on the basis of what I think is a comprehensive estimate.  I do not want to state what the cost will be to the Exchequer. I am saying that this is what we expect it will be but there are so many imponderables, such lack of any data on which we could base an actuarial calculation, that I think we can say we are coming here with an open risk, the extent of which we do not know, but we are assuming for the purposes of the Budget in this year that it will amount to about £334,000 or something like that.  It may be a great deal more; it may be a little less; but it certainly will not be very much less than £334,000.</P>
    <P>So far as the scheme is concerned, this represents what can be done immediately for all those persons who come within its ambit, the old as well as the young, and it is true that, perhaps, we are weighing the balance a little bit in favour of the elders.  I do not think that we have any great need on either side of the House&mdash; because this is not the Bill of the Government; this will be the Bill of the Dáil &mdash; to be very apologetic for anything we may do now for that age group who, say, are over 65 or 70 years of age, because do not let us forget that that was the generation which bore the brunt of the last phase of our struggle for independence and, if we are able to do this for them now, we are only giving them a little bit, a very small proportion, of the <Col N="851" /> fruits which younger generations will, I hope, live to enjoy.</P>
    <P>So far as the future is concerned, I think, the position will be that, without increasing the rates of contribution, we ought to be able, within a very few years, substantially to increase the benefits and in that way the people who are now entering into insurance at a comparatively early age will obtain the due measure of what they might be properly entitled to under any contractual engagement which they might enter into with an insurance company.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any other aspect of this matter which the Leader of the Opposition raised which calls for any comment at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 refers to the Minister's power to make regulations. It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 3 (other than subsection (4) thereof) of the Principal Act shall be construed and have effect as if:&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  references therein to a power to make regulations included references to any power to make regulations under this Act, and</P>
      <P>(b)  references therein to regulations included references to any regulations under this Act. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I avail of this section to ask the Minister if he has considered whether it would be desirable under his power to make regulations to graduate the rate of subscription for new entrants into employment.  I mean by that that, if a young person enters employment at 16 years of age, it seems to me a hardship to ask him to meet the full burden of the social insurance stamp. It would, I think, be more equitable <Col N="852" /> to provide that, in the first year, he would make a reduced contribution and, in the second year, that would be stepped up, and so on, year by year, until in his 21st year, when he had reached maturity, he would undertake the full burden prescribed by the Bill. I think there is a precedent for this in some other Social Welfare Acts, where the stamp in the early stages is at a lower rate than when the contributor reaches maturity or is deemed to be so circumstanced as to be able to bear the full burden of the charges envisaged.  Without unduly delaying the House, I simply refer the Minister to the precedents and I should be glad to know if he would consider following them in respect of the stamp envisaged under this Bill.</P>

      <P>On the general question of the powers to be given to the Minister to make regulations, I am sure he is as conscious as I am of the confusion that existed after the coming into operation of the 1952 Act &mdash; a confusion that can to some extent be appreciated because one knows how <Col N="853" /> difficult it is for the Minister and his officials to provide for all sorts of contingencies by making regulations.  The regulations were made in January, 1953, and they had to be changed very often and very radically subsequently. I trust that on this occasion the Minister will try to make enduring regulations. Apart from that, I trust that these regulations will be published in booklet form so that the public will have an idea as to whether or not they qualify for certain benefits.  I know it it difficult to provide against everything. From my own experience, I know that after the coming into operation of the 1952 Act very few of us knew whether or not people qualified for certain benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, this is a new scheme and we do not know exactly how it will develop.  Naturally, when one introduces a comprehensive code, such as the Social Welfare Act of 1952 was intended to be, that code cannot cover every possible contingency. One has to proceed on trial and error.  In the early stages, therefore, there necessarily has to be a good deal of chopping and changing in the regulations.  When one gets out of the experimental stage it is, of course, quite easy to formulate basic, fundamental regulations and say that they will govern the vast majority of the cases.  I think that is how we will proceed in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point that I think ought to be raised now on this regulation section.  Here, again, if the Minister chooses to deal with it on another section, I have no objection. One of the difficulties that has arisen &mdash; I do not blame anybody for it &mdash; in connection with the introduction of this Bill is that a very large number of existing pensioners do not know what their rates will be under this Bill, and I understand nobody can tell them what their rates will be under this Bill until regulations have been made.  Perhaps, the Minister would enlighten me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a man who is now 73 and who has been in insurable employment and stamped cards regularly <Col N="854" /> under the appropriate social welfare code up to his seventieth birthday. He has been receiving a non-contributory old age pension from the age of 70 until the age of 73.  He writes to me and asks me: &ldquo;Can you tell me am I entitled to the contributory pension under the new Bill?&rdquo; So far as I know, my correct reply to him is: &ldquo;I cannot tell you until the regulations have been made.&rdquo;  Is this the appropriate section on which to raise that matter?</P>

      <P>Perhaps, the Minister could give me some information on this section since I am not quite clear on the matter despite the provisions in the section and despite the White Paper.  As it is, voluntary contributors for the purposes of widows' and orphans' contributory pensions pay a contribution of 2/-.  I do not know what the contribution is for those who receive all the benefits but the White Paper says that for a contribution of 4/9d. per week all benefits may be received, that is, including the old age or retirement contributory pension.  I cannot find any information in this booklet as to what the voluntary contribution is and I was wondering what was the difference between that and the 4/9d. which is now supposed to entitle a person to all the benefits including the contributory old age pension.</P>

Last week I had a Question down with regard to the employability of a person who was 63 years of age.  I was told by the Minister that at 63 this man was not considered suitable for the type of employment which he sought which was labouring work.  There is not a lot of difference in labouring work in one place or in one trade as against another.  It is fairly heavy work.  There are degrees of heaviness in relation to the work but the Minister should consider&mdash;possibly he has&mdash; reducing the age to 65 in the case of a man and 60 in the case of a woman.</P>

Sixty-five for some men can be pretty old as far as their suitability or adaptability for work is concerned.  In regard to men from 65 to 70, provided they have the necessary insurance contributions or credits, they may draw unemployment benefit for the five years from 65 to 70.  That is and has been a tremendous advantage to them.  It may be somewhat different in the case of the women <Col N="857" /> because a big proportion of them are engaged in domestic employment and are not insured for the purpose of receiving unemployment benefit.  They, too, have a strong case for a reduction of the age limit at which to qualify for the old age pension.  As per your ruling &mdash; rightly I suppose &mdash; an amendment to that effect may not be moved but I should like to express that opinion on behalf of the members of my Party who believe that the optional retirement age should be 65 in the case of men and 60 in the case of women.</P>

      <P>I understand a number of the amendments put down in our names have been ruled out of order, particularly those affecting State funds. Nevertheless in a general way I should like to advert to the problem of those who retire from industry at 65 years of age, in the case of men.  While Deputy Corish did advert to the fact that men retiring at 65 years of age could under the social welfare scheme draw unemployment benefit and possibly unemployment assistance subsequently, in many thousands of cases this represents the only income of those people.  They are not in the same position as their fortunate fellow citizens who have pension schemes from which they can get benefit.  Many old established firms who were previously quite prepared to let the workers continue in employment up to 67, 70 or 72 years of age, provided they were in reasonable health and were able to make a reasonable contribution to the industry, have in recent years, since the accent has been put on increased productivity and on achieving the largest <Col N="858" /> possible output from the labour force involved, adopted the attitude that these workers should be retired around 65 years of age.</P>
      <P>In some cases where this occurs, pension schemes are operated by grace of the undertakings concerned but there are other cases, only too common in the industrial sphere, particularly in urban areas, where employers who operate no pension schemes take the first opportunity possible to release workers approaching the age of 65 years.  We would ask that these matters be taken into consideration in due course.</P>
      <P>In the case of a woman, the normal practice in many employments is to cease work at 60 years of age, but the period between that and 70 years is often a difficult one for them.  In many cases they may exhaust their claims to social welfare benefits and either be reduced to seeking social assistance or falling back on public assistance.  In these circumstances, we felt that another look might be given to the age limit laid down.  Of course, a Cheann Comhairle, we accept your ruling that the amendments may not be moved, but, nevertheless, I should like to take this opportunity of saying a word on behalf of that group of citizens.  The majority of them are workers who have given conscientious service, who worked hard for the best part of their lives, but who will have to wait a further five or ten years to obtain the benefits provided in this Bill.  I shall content myself with presenting these aspects of the matter to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a word or two in support of what has been said by Deputy Corish and Deputy Larkin.  I know a number of people who are feeble, who are not really able to carry on and who would retire if they thought they could get a pension earlier.  If that were made possible, I believe it would provide work for those who are idle and, in a roundabout way, the State would save in the amount it has to provide for those drawing assistance.  One should be balanced against the other and perhaps <Col N="859" /> the ultimate cost then might be seen to be not so high.  Plenty of people have expressed their desire to retire, but, knowing they would not get old age pensions and would receive only a little from their employers, they struggle on until they are 70 years of age.</P>
      <P>It is common knowledge that the death rate is very high for people around 70 years of age and I should like to ask: is it fair to ask people to work until they are almost dead? They ought to have a few years leisure, especially if they feel they are not able to continue working.  As Deputy Larkin said, employers are anxious to get rid of workers when they reach the age of 65 years because they are not able to do the work they formerly did.  I think the matter of the pension scheme at 65, or even the happy medium of 68 years, ought to be considered because these people should not be asked to struggle on until they are 70 years of age and are infirm. My own father went on pension and in three months he was dead.  I only refer to that as evidence that he did not get much of a break.  It is human nature to be feeble at that age.</P>
      <P>If there is a statutory retirement age of 65 years in England, why should that not be the case here?  I think the Minister ought to balance the costs involved against the fact that it would help to provide employment for those drawing assistance in one form or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The first objection I have to the proposal advocated by Deputy Corish, Deputy Larkin and Deputy Sherwin is that we just cannot afford it.  If we were to concede what is being asked, I think it would cost us well over £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no savings whatever.  The net cost would certainly be well over £2,000,000 and, in present circumstances, we cannot afford that.  The next objection I have is that, if we were to make the contributory old age pensions payable at any age less than that which will <Col N="860" /> qualify for non-contributory pensions, then we would have to attach to the contributory pensions a retiring condition. We must start with the general principle that the State has no justification for saying to any man born into this world: &ldquo;Thou shalt not work,&rdquo; whether his age be 50, 60 or 70.  If a man is entitled to fulfil the Divine dispensation, he has to earn his bread whatever age he may be but, apart from that, we could not enforce a retirement condition attaching to contributory old age pensions.  We should have all sorts of evasions, fraud and cheating, and it would be administratively impossible to enforce such a condition.</P>
      <P>This Bill, let me again remind the House, is based on the insurance principle, that a man gets what he pays for.  It may be that the State and the community &mdash; and we all know it is the community who will pay for this in the end &mdash; will come in and supplement the contribution paid by the wage earner and give him terms which he himself in present circumstances may not be able to pay for, but, if we couple that with a condition that a man must stop earning at a certain age and after that has to account for every drop of sweat and every move of his hands to some sort of social welfare inspector, where will we be?  Quite frankly, we cannot have liberty and at the same time enforce a retirement condition.</P>
      <P>Though it may press a little on some people to say to them: &ldquo;You will get your contributory old age pensions when you reach the age of 70 but up to that you have got to continue as you were predestined to do from the day you were born &mdash; to fend for yourself,&rdquo; there is another aspect to the matter.  The general standard of physical health and, shall I say, intellectual capacity in the community as a whole, is growing, and in the most advanced communities in the world to-day the general tendency is to raise the age limit at which a person is considered as not being capable of maintaining himself by his own efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of Norway and Canada.  Norway is a country very much like our own &mdash; a small country <Col N="861" /> not endowed with any great natural resources, a community which has to live by a great deal of hard labour in very unpropitious circumstances.  In Norway and Canada, the age is 70. In Great Britain, where the Beveridge Plan was welcomed so enthusiastically, even Beveridge was very definitely opposed to this idea of compelling people to stop working at the age of 65.  In Great Britain, the general recommendation now is to raise the age at which a person may secure a retirement pension.</P>
    <P>I think the point of view which has been advanced here&mdash;not, I would say, with any great fanaticism &mdash; by Deputy Corish, Deputy Larkin and Deputy Sherwin, is now tending to be rejected by those who have had experience of how the retirement condition works in practice.  In any event, let us face the fact that this is a beginning.  I do not say it is perfect.  I am perfectly certain that when it has been in operation for 12 months or two years, we shall discover a great many things we have overlooked, but at least it is a beginning. If the productivity of the community &mdash; which is, of course, the fundamental condition which has to be fulfilled &mdash; justifies retiring people at 68 or reducing the age for non-contributory as well as contributory pensions to the age of 68, then we can have another look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may possibly be misinformed in this.  The amendment ruled out of order did not ask to have people retire at 65 years of age.  In the course of my remarks, I pointed out that in recent years there has been a deliberate policy by those engaged in agriculture to retire workers who formerly could look forward to working, so long as they were in reasonably good health, until the age of 68, 69, 70, 71 or 72.  Partly as a result of the policy of seeking to extract the most production from those engaged in industry, there has been growing up this policy of retiring workers earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic reason why the Labour Party put down this motion was to draw the Minister's attention to that <Col N="862" /> fact and also to make the point that where men and women are in fact retired at 60 or 65 years of age, it would be much better from their point of view that they should receive initially a contributory pension.  I think we on these benches have accepted in general that this Bill is a beginning, and we appreciate the Minister's indication that he is prepared to have the matter examined again as circumstances develop.  I merely wanted to make clear that what we were seeking was consideration of an earlier age at which the pension will be payable. Certainly, we were not asking that people be put out of employment at an earlier age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not agree that the increase and the charges which fall on the worker are fully justified.  The increase from 2/9d. to 4/6d. appears to us to be much more than would be required to meet the workers' share. The Bill provides a pension at a certain age.  It also provides for certain other things but the actual situation is that the workers are called upon to make too heavy a contribution towards the benefit they will receive under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that the workers, the employers and the State shall each contribute.  In the case of the State, we cannot move any amendment which <Col N="866" /> will seek to increase the charge. Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5 deal with the amounts which will be contributed by the workers and the employers.  It is our view that, having regard to the contributions the workers make initially to the progress and the profit made by their employers, they should not have the increase passed on to them to the extent set down in the Bill. Consequently, we feel that the sum of 4/6d. set out in line 23 should be deleted and the sum of 4/- substituted. That would have the effect of reducing by 6d. per week the worker's contribution.</P>
    <P>We also feel that the sum of 3/5d. in line 24 should be deleted and become 2/11d., which is a reduction of 6d.  We feel sure that, having regard to all the aspects of the matter, the increase which would then result would be more than adequate to meet the responsibility which should properly fall on the workers in this matter.</P>
    <P>The proposal in regard to amendment No. 4 is to reduce the amount set out in the Bill from 2/3d. by 8d. In this regard, the same general basis exists&mdash;that the amounts charged under the Bill and which will be paid by the workers are excessive and should be reduced on the lines suggested in the amendments.</P>

If they live only a few years beyond 70, the State will have profited by almost 100 per cent.  I support Deputy Larkin when he says that too much is being <Col N="867" /> asked of the workers.  Perhaps the Minister might calculate how much a person who commenced work at 20 years of age will contribute when he is 70 years of age?  My calculation is that he will have paid £500 or £600 in contributions and he will get only £100, so that the State will profit considerably.

      <P>Deputy Sherwin has a very acute mind but the trouble with the Deputy is that he is rather naive. He directs a spotlight on one particular aspect of the problem and is inclined to build a very great theme on that.  In this case, of course, it may be that a person will not live very long after he reaches the pensionable age but do not forget he is insuring against a great many other things than the possibility that he may live to reach the age of 70.  I suppose that is a possibility that he would devoutly like to mature but after all he is insuring against unemployment, against ill-health and against his early demise, in which case his widow and his children are going to be provided for.  So it is not just a case of paying a contribution in the hope that you will reach the age of 70 and that then you will become a centenarian and enjoy £2 a week for yourself and, as the matter stands at present, 28/6d. for your dependants. There is a great deal more involved in this 4/6d. which the contributor is paying. He has got a comprehensive insurance which he himself could never provide for 4/6d. per week.  His employer has to pay a similar amount and when the employer has paid his contribution the taxpayers, the ordinary consuming public, have to come along and bear the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my answer to the amendments which have been put down here. Let us face it: there has been a traditional assumption that the costs of these social insurance schemes should <Col N="868" /> be borne in three parts: firstly, one-third by the person who hopes immediately to benefit, the person who is directly concerned; a second one-third by his employer who has had the benefit of his services for remuneration during the employee's lifetime; and then one-third by the community of which the employee is a part.  I think that is a fair and reasonable division. In any event, it is one which has been traditionally associated with all social insurance schemes in this country since they started.  It was embodied in the 1950 Bill and it is embodied in the 1952 Act and we are continuing to accept that as a fair and reasonable division of the cost.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to argue that the employee's contribution should be reduced.  What is going to happen in consequence?  Any relief which is granted to the employee must be carried by one or other of the two remaining parties.  If the employer has to carry the whole burden, then having regard to the fact that he must make ends meet and must make provision for all his overheads and all the contingencies that have to be met by any business, he will definitely pass that on to the person who buys his products, to the consumer.  If he does not meet it, it will be passed on to the Exchequer, to the taxpayer.  I do not think that a case could be established for relieving those who are engaged as employees any further of the responsibility which properly attaches to them of providing for themselves and their families in their old age.  I think we shall have to leave it at that.</P>
    <P>If we were to start on the assumption that gradually a person were to be relieved of that obligation, even though in certain circumstances it would be a normal obligation, and if we were to accept that principle, I do not see where we are to stop.  Ultimately, everybody would become a charge on the community.  I for one think that that means that the community begins to exert a degree of control over the individual which is not compatible with the ordinary standards of human life and freedom.</P>

      <P>We are giving a great deal of it back.  There would appear to be a rather specious justification for the plea that a young person entering into employment should have to pay a lesser rate than an ordinary adult person.  My first objection to that is that when a person enters into employment, he is normally looking forward to a lifetime of opportunity to earn a livelihood as an employee, or perhaps he may be ambitious and want to become an employer.  At all events, the average person is hoping that he will continue to be in employment until he retires and he is looking forward to the benefits which will accrue to him as a result of the contributions he has paid.  If we are to reserve these benefits to him at a certain specific standard, then he has to pay uniform contributions during his whole life because if he does not do that, it will mean that those in the older age groups will have to pay correspondingly more.  If they do not pay more, then the concession which is being granted to the younger person will have to be borne by the Exchequer and the community as a whole and that is not an equitable arrangement.</P>
      <P>The whole basis of insurance is that you more or less enter into a long term contract and your premiums are fixed from the beginning and the benefits which will accrue to you are more or less firmly determined.  Now, there are a great many qualifications to that, the first being that as time goes on, it may prove that the basis of your estimation was wrong and that instead of being able to give a benefit of the standard which you anticipated when the insurance scheme began, you may be able substantially to increase those benefits.  I think that has been the general experience in relation to most insurance schemes, but at all events the general principle is that you pay a fixed premium or contribution over a prolonged period and at the end of that period, you can anticipate that you will get a definite benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There does not appear to be any great justification for conceding to young people the right to pay at a <Col N="870" /> lower rate.  If you do that, you do it only at the expense of the elders, and I do not see how, in equity, a case can be made for that.  After all, they are young people in the prime of life, with all the opportunities which their level of civilisation&mdash;to put it that way&mdash;will offer to them and they are likely to have much easier and better lives, with all the amenities which are readily available to them, than their elders would have.  I think it would be a complete reversal of the old injunction that children ought to contribute to make the lives of their elders easier.  I am one of the elders and I feel very strongly about it.</P>
    <P>The idea that a lower contribution would have to be paid in respect of young persons is a possible inducement to certain classes of employers&mdash;I shall not make a statement which could be universally or generally applied&mdash;to concentrate upon getting young people into their employment because they might perhaps save a shilling a week, and at the end of the period they might dispense with their services and get some other young people to fill their places.  I am not shutting my mind on this matter but, speaking in this extempore way, I think there is not very much to be said for the case of granting concessions to persons who are young when they first enter into employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to these young people as being in the prime of life, but I am thinking of those who are not in their 20's at all.  I am thinking of teenagers who have to take up employment. Normally, they are perhaps the eldest or the second eldest of their family, and their parents look forward to the day when these older children will obtain employment and supplement the family income, even in some meagre fashion.  Their contribution may be small, but it is of considerable assistance, and this Bill is levying a considerable charge on these young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a discouragement to them to take up some position in which they could assist their parents and the younger children.  Quite often such <Col N="871" /> people assist in the education and the clothing of the younger members of their families, although they have not reached the age at which one could regard them as having secured an income that would warrant the imposition of a charge such as this.  The Minister referred to their looking forward to getting benefits.  Have they not a long way to look forward? Surely there is less likelihood of these young people becoming a charge on this fund than people of more mature age?</P>
    <P>It cannot be contended that there would be any charge on the fund with regard to their dependants because, due to the normal expectancy of life, it would be most unlikely that more than a fraction of these people would pass away at such an age.  Surely with the normal expectancy of life it must be considered that they will have a long period ahead of them in which to make a weekly contribution to the fund, and it is very unlikely that they will impose any charge on the fund until very many years have passed. That is one of the reasons we think it would be desirable to ease the charge on those classes.</P>
    <P>The Minister is inclined to refer to the partners in these contributions, and there are three contributors.  He said that if relief is given to this category there must be an increased imposition on the older groups.  I claim that is not necessarily so because, of the three partners to these contributions, the Exchequer is getting out very well. It was contended at first that the three contributors were contributing equal amounts, but the figure of the Supplementary Estimate which the Minister seeks is conclusive proof that, even in the first year in which there must be a big charge on the fund, in the absence of an increased contribution at that stage the State can look forward to a diminishing contribution towards this fund.</P>
    <P>I respectfully submit that this&mdash; which is really a rather minor matter in relation to the number who will be insured&mdash;could be dealt with by the Exchequer facing up to slightly more contributions than hitherto.  If they were payable by the Exchequer they <Col N="872" /> could be met by the Exchequer without any additional imposition on the older groups.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is looking at one side of the picture only, in relation to old age pensions.  This is a comprehensive Bill which deals with sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and widows' and orphans' contributory pensions.  There is no limitation on families at all, and every child benefits under this scheme.  I have not the exact figures with me, but on examination I think it will be conceded that the picture painted by Deputy O'Sullivan really should be looked at the other way.  The Exchequer contribution goes up under this Bill.  Instead of being 33-1/3rd per cent., it is stepped up as a result of all the benefits.</P>
      <P>This Bill takes in the contributory old age pensions, sickness benefits, unemployment benefit, widows' and orphans' benefits, etc., and all the things that dovetail into the contributory old age pension, such as dependants, both spouse and children. All these added together will make for a departure from the principle of the 33-1/3rd. per cent. contribution by the State, which will be stepped up very much more than heretofore.  Of course the community will have to bear it too, but in view of the increased charge on taxpayers, and the Exchequer which is the same, there is no justification for reducing the charge on insurable people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, in reply to Deputy O'Sullivan, it is our experience in the country <Col N="873" />&mdash;and I am sure it is the same in Cork&mdash;that when a youth goes into employment, be it a shop, a bakery or anywhere else, the cost of the insurance stamps is deducted by the employers.  There is a mutability about it.  It is understood the rate is there.  The stamp is 3/2d. for an agricultural worker.  If a man earns £5 a week the amount may be paid in full, without any deduction.  The general principle is that the employer, whether he be a trader, a baker or a farmer, gets the card and stamps it and that is that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party amendment seeks a reduction in the amount the worker will have to meet having regard to the fact that&mdash;this Bill becoming law and the changeover from payment of the old age pension from a form of gratuity to a pension by right for which contributions will be forthcoming from employer and worker&mdash;there will be very considerable savings in State expenditure. The figure is estimated at about £2½ million and I shall not argue it.</P>
      <P>Nobody denies that there are benefits in the Bill.  The workers are asked to make excessive contributions towards the benefits.  The principal benefits come under the contributory allowances, the old age pension and adult dependant and orphans' contributory allowances.  Existing old age pensioners are entitled, without any payment, to 27/6d. and we now have that figure of 1/- which I am sure is the subject of very great rejoicing among all our old age pensioners.  If this Bill were not introduced and the rates of benefit were unchanged each old age pensioner would be entitled to 28/6d. per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to people, the bulk of whom, so far as my experience in Dublin City is concerned, have very little means. Workers are asked to contribute an additional 1/9d. per week.  That represents a very considerable sum to many workers.  Take a labourer with a family who is earning £7 a week or <Col N="874" /> so and who is committed, almost to the last shilling, to meet the essential expenses falling on his family.  He is asked to make an additional contribution for a direct benefit for himself, if he reaches 70 years of age, of 40/- instead of 28/6 he would get without a contribution.</P>
      <P>Women workers also are asked to contribute an additional 1/9d. per week.  Many thousands of women in industry earn 50 per cent. and maybe 60 per cent. of what adult male workers earn.  There would appear to be a case of hardship there also.</P>
      <P>There are some additional benefits in the Bill.  We agree with the application of the insurance principle.  We welcome such advantages as are provided in the Bill, but we are satisfied the State is on a very good thing.  It is such a good thing that the contributions are clearly excessive and should be reduced by the amounts set down in our amendment.</P>
      <P>Reference may be made to the means test at present in operation in social welfare schemes.  Deputy O'Sullivan made inquiries about dental and optical benefits.  The benefits are in a position somewhat akin to that of those who have the right to work. They have the right to work provided they can obtain work.  One has the right to obtain dental and optical treatment provided a number of circumstances make it possible.  It is not such an absolute right that if the young person who is paying the contribution needs dental and optical treatment he will get it without any difficulty.  Rather is the reverse the case.</P>
      <P>Our main contention is that an increase of 1/9d. per week for both men and women workers is excessive.  I am interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say the good employer carries the worker's contribution.  In the city, employers do not pay the worker's contribution.  Once the worker registers at the employment exchange and gets his card the amount is deducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without desiring to cast undue doubts on the veracity of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, having listened to cases made here from time <Col N="875" /> to time and in view of our experience of what occurs in the agricultural community, I doubt very much if a substantial percentage of employers in rural areas, small towns, and so on, pay something they are not directed to pay.  I am sure my colleagues who are acquainted with the situation there would assure me that cases of the employer paying the worker's contribution are few and far between.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are a good deal better off than the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLarkin" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard that story before.  Workers who leave the land do so because the employment there is available only at semi-starvation wages.  If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks farm labourers are better off in that regard I am afraid his idea of a standard of living for farm workers is far below what we would consider a proper standard of living for them.  We have proposed that the figure of 4/6d. be reduced.  We do so because we feel that amount is not necessary having regard to the very substantial savings which will accrue to the State as a result of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we wish to point out that under present circumstances in our view the workers should not have this increase imposed upon them.  I think an increase is called for&mdash;I do not think any worker would object to an increased contribution to help to provide these benefits&mdash;but what we are concerned with in these amendments is the measure of that increase.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter again and I urge him to accept the proposals made in our amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate on the section because I think the result will be the same in the end but I want to correct one misapprehension under which I think Deputy Larkin labours.  The fact is that the State is not making anything out of this Bill.  On the contrary, the State's contribution to this insurance scheme has gone up from what is the present fraction of one-third <Col N="876" /> to well over 40 per cent.  When we talk about the State or the Exchequer let us be clear that what we are talking about are the ordinary people of Ireland who are paying that 40 per cent. and who will get no benefit from the scheme except the consolation of knowing that they are not allowing the old people to die in destitution.  The ordinary citizens who may or may not be in this scheme as taxpayers will not be in the scheme at all but will contribute over 40 per cent. of the cost.  The State is not making &ldquo;a good thing&rdquo; out of it.</P>
      <P>The next point is this.  I know Deputy Larkin is a realist as much as I am&mdash;what is the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes?  Three and two pence. What is the maximum increase which any worker will be called upon to pay under this Bill?  One and nine pence, 2d. over the cost of a packet of ten cigarettes.  And the Deputy wants me to believe, with all I see around me in Dublin, with television aerials all over the place and everything else, that the increased contribution will be an inordinate burden on the workers of Dublin.  Let us look at this as ordinary men of the world with some degree of commonsense.  One cannot say in these circumstances that we are imposing an undue burden on any employee in asking him to contribute an additional 1/9d. in order that he may have a retirement pension for himself and, I hope, for his wife when he reaches the age of 70.  Women live longer than men as we know and the two would get £3 8s. 6d. which is not bad, no matter how one looks at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>A penny may be only a penny and 1/9d. only 1/9d. but when you add it up it comes to £4,000,000 between the employers and employees. I think all of us could agree with the Minister that 1/9d. in the case of many workers will not constitute a severe burden on them but unfortunately the well-off workers are not in the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all at a disadvantage in submitting any arguments in regard to the contributions: none of us is qualified to make actuarial calculations and that is our difficulty.  The only thing I <Col N="877" /> know about this from past experience is that for an increased contribution of 4d. or 5d. it was possible, four years ago, to give a benefit that ranged from 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. in all cases.  Here, the majority of the workers are being asked to increase their contribution by 1/9d. and, in respect of the main group of benefits, they are receiving a basic increase of 2/6d. with very good increases, I admit, for dependants in the cases of unemployment benefit and sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>I think it would be relatively simple for the Minister to tell us what part of the 1/9d., the proposed increase, is in respect of the increases in existing benefits and then we shall have a fair idea as to what is left and what the cost to the insured worker would be for a pension of 40/- a week and an allowance for his wife when he comes to the age of 70.</P>
    <P>It has not been possible for us in this or any other amendment to suggest that the State should contribute a little more.  I believe it should contribute a little more.  It is true that £2,850,000 approximately is being devoted by the State to the insurance fund to be used for the provision of these increased benefits and the old age contributory pension or retirement allowance, but it is not right for people to get the impression that the State is raising an extra £2,850,000.  The State proposes to raise from the taxpayer by the means outlined by the Minister for Finance in the last Budget a sum of £300,000 and let us be clear, as the Minister has admitted I think, that there will be a saving on existing old age pensions of about £2½ million.  The Minister is not going to give that back to the Minister for Finance; he will use it to provide for these increased benefits and the retirement allowances.  I suppose I cannot argue too much on this but the State should have been prepared to contribute a little more for the purpose of reducing the contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pursue it but I honestly believe the employers could contribute more.  Many Deputies can give examples of those who cannot contribute more but I think the bulk of the employers could do so.  The 1/9d. increase per week will be a burden to many workers but while I think this has&mdash;I had better not say nothing to do but not much to do with the amendment&mdash;there is a case for a reduction in the contributions in respect of, let us call them, teenagers. Many of these are apprentices and their wages, or whatever you like to call it, come to only a £1 or £25/- a week.  In other cases, I agree, it may be 30/- or £2 a week but I know apprentices who get 25/-.  They may be exploited as workers in being termed apprentices but that is a fact and to take one-sixth of their weekly wage is not good enough.</P>
      <P>If my memory serves me well there is a reduced contribution provided for in the case of the wet time stamp for juveniles.  That is my impression. There would not be any danger in extending this&mdash;the age could be fixed at 18.  In that particular age group, to take 4/6d. from poor chaps earning £1 or 25/- or 30/- per week will not encourage them to pursue the occupation in which they are at present employed.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister said that it is inevitable that this increase that is being imposed on the employers will be passed on to the consuming public.  I suppose he is right in that; that has been the practice, but I think it is a practice that ought to be discouraged.  The worker cannot pass on the 1/9d. unless he makes a new wage demand.  If he makes a new wage demand he starts the circle again and prices go up again. It would be preferable for stability as far as the workers are concerned that employers would make some gesture particularly in respect of a retirement allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many employers who have introduced and who run very efficiently and, I may say, very generously, schemes to provide for their older employees in their old age.  I know that they, in particular, would not be averse from making some increased <Col N="879" /> contribution if they knew how much of that increased contribution would go to the provision of a retirement allowance.  It might be only twopence or threepence or some such amount. Many of them would be prepared to forgo that few pence in order to ensure that employees who served them for 30, 40 and in some cases 50 years would have a retirement allowance.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to argue at length that the State should contribute more but I do think, first of all, that the Minister should tell the House the cost of the stamp that will go towards the provision of a retirement allowance and, secondly, that he should certainly consider a change in the balance to provide for a lesser contribution by the employee and a slightly increased contribution by the employer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I raise one point on Section 16?  Under Section 16, paragraph 6, on page 8, one of the contribution conditions for an old age (contributory) pension is that the claimant has entered insurance before attaining the age of sixty.  I was asked to put down an amendment to this Bill to cover a certain number of people, a very small number I am told.  I found it rather difficult to draft an amendment and felt it might possibly be out of order and that I would just ask the Minister if he would be good enough to consider an amendment that has been suggested to me by some of my constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to grant retirement pensions to insured persons on reaching 70 years provided they enter insurance before reaching the age of 60.  The suggestion is to include in <Col N="881" /> the Bill insured persons suffering from defective vision or blindness who enter insurable employment between the ages of 60 and 62 provided they had paid at least eight years' contributions before they reach the age of 70 years.</P>
    <P>That is the amendment that I was asked to suggest to cover some people, a very small category, who apparently are anxious that their case should be considered and I would ask the Minister to give it such consideration as he should find possible.  I apologise for putting it so abruptly to the Minister.  I am sure he would not have time to consider it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that it strikes at a fundamental condition of the whole scheme, that is, that the person must have entered into insurable employment before the age of 60. What I am asked to do here, in the case of persons suffering from a very sad affliction, is that if they enter insurance not later than the age of 62 they will then become qualified.  I would have to give that a great deal of consideration. If I can find a reasonable ground, I shall have an amendment brought in in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) No scheme or arrangement for the provision of pensions may be modified or woundup save only where two-thirds or more of the employees concerned in the scheme or arrangement have signified their consent to the modification or winding-up where such scheme or arrangement has been in operation for more than five years, or more than one-half of the employees concerned <Col N="882" /> where such scheme or arrangement has been in operation for less than five years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know it is putting the cart before the horse but I should like some information with regard to the section because this amendment, quite frankly, is designed to elicit information. There is a fear amongst prospective pensioners in certain types of employment that these pension schemes will be discontinued.  Whether or not that is the intention, I do not know, and I must confess it is not clear from Section 18.  For example, I have in mind those who are contributing towards a superannuation fund in the various county councils. They are, in the main, road workers. Road workers contribute a halfpenny per shilling of their wages and for that they receive a pension in accordance with their service when they reach the age of 65 or if they retire on account of ill-health.  I should like to know whether or not that superannuation scheme may be or will be wound up.</P>
    <P>There is also in C.I.E. a superannuation scheme which was recently passed through this House and was sponsored by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Does it necessarily mean this scheme will also be wound up?  If that is the case, on whose initiative will such pension schemes be discontinued? Will the Minister give a direction to the county council that the scheme is to be wound up and will the workers' contributions be refunded to them? Will the initiative lie with the county councils or have they any discretion as to whether or not they will wind up that superannuation scheme of 1948?</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to ensure that such schemes will not be wound up, save under certain conditions. These conditions are expressed in the amendment and if the Minister will be so kind as to give us a little more enlightenment on Section 18 we may be able to proceed a little further on amendment No. 12.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apropos of what Deputy Corish has said, I should like the Minister to clarify the position in <Col N="883" /> relation to existing schemes being superseded by the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister must be aware that in relation to the requirements by the local authorities as to the number of days worked by the qualifying person, it is infinitely easier to qualify for superannuation under the local authority requirements than under this Bill.  Two hundred days is accepted by the local authority as a qualifying number and if that arrangement is to be superseded by this Bill, a great number of road workers will have no chance whatever of deriving benefits from this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make this quite clear.  It is not intended to enforce the amendment of any existing scheme under this section.  What is intended, first of all, is to enable those who are participants in a scheme to amend the scheme by agreement so as to fit the provisions of their specific pensions scheme into the framework of this Bill.  That will be done by agreement but there may be a wide field where it would not be possible to have any degree of consultation and where the Minister, having considered any representations which may be made to him, may lay down general principles in regulations and allow schemes which conform to those principles to be modified without having to seek any great degree of formal agreement.  The section was really designed to facilitate the amendment of schemes where such amendment was desirable and to avoid the expense and delay of a complex procedure of amendment, passing new legislation, and so forth.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is possible that some people may become suspicious of the section but let us not forget the section follows very closely the section which was in the 1950 Bill and the section which was in the 1952 Act, so that we are not breaking any new ground except in the reference to redundancy. There is not the intention to do anything more than to give those who are concerned with the provisions of the C.I.E. scheme the right to amend that scheme if they wish to do so because that scheme does cover redundancy as distinct from retirement on age grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> The question of the position of local employees under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act of 1956 has arisen but there again it is felt that if the road workers themselves desire to have that scheme amended or if the local authorities desire to have it amended, they can endeavour to reach agreement among themselves.  This merely gives power to implement the agreement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the whole of this matter, it is not my intention, and I am sure it is not the intention of any of my colleagues who may be concerned in this matter, to try to force the amendment of any scheme.  All we really want to do is, if a reasonable proposition is put up to us for the amendment of the scheme and if that proposition has been agreed to, to enable the scheme to be amended.  If a reasonable proposition to amend the scheme is put up, the Minister will consider that scheme in the light of the representations which may be made to him and will, acting&mdash;I shall not say in a judicial capacity; that might create some constitutional difficulty &mdash;perhaps as an honest broker among all Parties concerned, make regulations which will enable the scheme to be amended to the best advantage of all concerned.</P>
    <P>If the regulations which the Minister may make are not acceptable, I presume the scheme will not be amended and that there will be an opportunity for reconsideration of it.  First of all, let the scheme go back for second thoughts to those who are concerned in it and if they have second thoughts, let it go back to the Minister so that he may have second thoughts about it.  Any scheme may be modified, or any scheme may be wound up, by agreement or in accordance with regulations made.  This is merely an enabling section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 14, after &ldquo;person who&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;has attained pensionable age and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsections (1) and (3) of the next section, Section 20, provide that a widow who has attained pensionable age and who is receiving a widow's contributory pension shall be disqualified <Col N="886" /> from receiving a non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that where the widow is receiving a pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts and is awarded a widow's contributory pension, any payment of the non-contributory pension in the period covered by the award and the widow's contributory pension will be treated as paid on account of the widow's contributory pension. A pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts includes a pension under those Acts paid to a blind person who is under 70 years of age.</P>
    <P>A widow under 70 years of age may at present receive a non-contributory pension as a blind person under the Old Age Pensions Acts in addition to a widow's contributory pension. It was not intended that the Bill should alter that position. Accordingly, disqualification for a pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts in subsection (3) of Section 20 of the Bill was limited to a widow who had attained pensionable age.</P>
    <P>Without the amendment which I am now putting to the House the anomalous position would arise in which, while a widow under age 70 was not disqualified from receiving a pension as a blind person under the Old Age Pensions Acts, it would be necessary to set off payments of such non-contributory pension against payment of the widow's contributory pension for a concurrent period.  That, in fact, would be tantamount to disqualification and the amendment which I am now proposing has the effect of limiting the arrangements for setting off concurrent payments of non-contributory old age pensions against arrears of contributory pensions to widows who have attained the age of 70.  This will preserve the <i>status quo</i> in such cases.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to add to the section the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Where a person who is in receipt of a pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1959, is a person in respect of whom the <Col N="887" /> weekly rate of old age (contributory) pension payable to another person is increased by virtue of subsection (2) (inserted by this Act) of section 26 of the Principal Act, any payment on foot of the first-mentioned pension in respect of a period in respect of which the old age (contributory) pension is so increased shall be treated as a payment on account of the old age (contributory) pension.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section we are discussing provides that a non-contributory old age pension paid while title to the old age contributory pension and the widow's contributory pension is being determined be treated as paid on account of the contributory pension, when awarded.  The amendment which I am now proposing extends the arrangement for treating non-contributory old age pensions as paid on account to include such pension paid to an adult dependant, in respect of whom an increase in the old age contributory pension is granted.  The effect of the amendment is that it will now be possible to set off against arrears of old age contributory pension which includes an increase in respect of an adult dependant the amount of any non-contributory old age pension paid to the adult dependant in the period covered by the award of the contributory pension.</P>

      <P>I have just a few remarks to make on the Money Resolution. It seems to me that this House, and in particular the Minister and his colleagues, should pause a while to examine the trend that has occurred in the recent past in the manner in which we are dealing with what are generally called juvenile delinquents.  I wish to direct attention to the development which has followed the bringing of Borstal from Clonmel to Dublin in which a number of short-term offenders are brought into the existing Borstal institution and mix with young offenders who are undergoing a longer period of corrective training.  This is a trend which has developed in the last few years and I do not think it is desirable.  As I say, it would be desirable if the Minister would consider whether this trend is something that should be stopped now, and that a serious effort should be made to segregate offenders who are doing short-term sentences, in the ages between 16 and 21, and those who are doing corrective training in St. Patrick's Institution.</P>
      <P>What is happening now is that St. Patrick's has become a wing of Mountjoy Prison so that the stigma of Mountjoy attaches to people doing this corrective training.  That is a direct result of Borstal being moved from Clonmel to Mountjoy.  It should not happen and I think steps should be taken in the near future to try to build a proper institution to house those who are doing corrective training in Mountjoy.  As the Minister himself indicated, such a building should be in semi-rural surroundings.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 25, to delete &ldquo;seventeen&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;sixteen&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this amendment as an important one of principle and I should be glad if the Minister would give it serious consideration.  The Bill proposes that a person can be detained in St. Patrick's Institution if he is not less than seventeen or more than 21 years of age but, in fact, at the present time power is given to the courts to sentence youthful offenders to Borstal <Col N="891" /> training from the age of 16 years.  We are now taking away that power and making Borstal training available only for boys between the ages of 17 and 21 years.  The purpose of this amendment, standing in my name and that of Deputy Ryan, is to leave the existing lower age figure as it stands.  I think I can say that persons who are connected with the administration of the present criminal code, in the courts and elsewhere, agree with the view that it is desirable district justices should have discretion as to whether they should send a boy between the age of 16 and 17 years to a reformatory or to Borstal training.</P>
    <P>In some circumstances it could be very undesirable that a certain type of offender over the age of 16 years should be sent to a reformatory with a lot of younger boys, and in certain circumstances youthful offenders might be much better off doing corrective training in a Borstal institution.  Since 1941 district justices have had power to send boys up to the age of 17 years to a reformatory, but in that particular age group between 16 and 17 years the problems involved in individual cases may very frequently be of a marginal nature, and in individual cases Borstal sentences might be preferable to reformatory sentences.  I feel it is undesirable that legislation should take power away from district justices to sentence a youthful offender, who is 16 years or over, to Borstal training and I would ask the Minister to consider this matter carefully because it is of the utmost importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The section in the Bill provides that a person within the age group of 17 to 21 years who is liable to be sentenced to a term of penal servitude or imprisonment may, in lieu, be sentenced to be detained in St. Patrick's.  The amendment would extend this category to those 16 year olds who are liable to be sentenced to imprisonment.  The only 16 year olds who, under existing law, are liable to be sentenced to imprisonment are that small category provided for in Section 102 (3) of the Children Act, 1908, which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A young person shall not be sentenced <Col N="892" /> to imprisonment for an offence or committed to prison in default of payment of a fine, damages, or costs, unless the court certifies that the young person is of so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under this Part of this Act, or that he is of so depraved a character that he is not a fit person to be so detained.</P>
    <P>In effect, then, Section 13 of this Bill, as amended by the insertion of 16 for 17 years of age, would enable the Justices to send a boy of &ldquo;unruly character&rdquo; direct to St. Patrick's instead of to Mountjoy.  The same boy if sentenced to imprisonment can be transferred to St. Patrick's by an Order of the Minister for Justice under Section 3 of the Prevention of Crime Acts, 1908.  Therefore, the amendment accomplishes very little.</P>
    <P>From the discussion here to-day, however, it appears that what the proposer of the amendment had in mind was a provision to enable the courts to commit overgrown, mature boys of 16 years of age to St. Patrick's instead of to an industrial school.  The amendment does not accomplish that purpose. However, I am inclined, with some misgivings, to accept what the Deputies have in mind and I hope to have a suitable amendment drafted, which I shall move on Report Stage.  I hope that I shall get that Stage, and if possible, the remaining Stages of the Bill, next Thursday so that this legislation can be brought into effect at a reasonably early date.</P>

If it does not fit in with the intention Deputy Ryan and myself had when putting it down, I willingly withdraw it and look forward to getting an amendment from the Minister to achieve the purpose we had in mind, namely, to permit the district justices to have this discretion in regard to the type of boy which I and the Minister mentioned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before subsection (2), to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Section 4 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, is hereby amended by the addition thereto of the words &lsquo;provided that in the case of a convicted person who is not less than sixteen nor more than twenty-one years of age he may be sentenced to detention and corrective training in Saint Patrick's Institution for a period not exceeding three years&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give express powers to the district justices to sentence a convicted person not less than 16 and not more than 21 years of age to corrective training in St. Patrick's institution.  It seems to me that it is desirable that the Criminal Justice Act should be amended so that an express power of this sort can be given to district justices.  At present, district justices under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, can sentence a boy, or any person, to a sentence not in excess of 12 months, only if the matter is dealt with in a summary way.  I feel it is likely that many of these youthful offenders may get themselves dealt with in a summary way by the district justice who would then merely have the power, as I understand the present legislation, to sentence them to 12 months and they will serve their sentence in St. Patrick's.  I feel it is desirable that an express power should also be given to the district justice to impose in suitable cases a longer period of corrective training in St. Patrick's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to empower the district court to send a convicted offender between 16 and 21 years of age to St. Patrick's for a period not exceeding three years, the sentence to be one of &ldquo;detention and corrective training&rdquo;.  At present the district court may not sentence an offender to imprisonment for a longer period than 12 months, so that under Section 13 (1) of the Bill, as it stands, the district court can only sentence an offender between 17 and 21 years of age to detention in St. Patrick's for a maximum period of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> This amendment is unacceptable for the following reasons.  First, such a radical extension of the district court's powers would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution which authorise the district court to try only minor offences.  That is the main reason why the amendment could not possibly be accepted.  Apart from this aspect, the power to deprive a near-adult of his liberties for a period of up to three years is not one which should be given, in the first instance, to a court of summary jurisdiction.  The present law is that apart from one or two exceptional cases, the district court cannot sentence an offender to detention in St. Patrick's for a minimum &ldquo;Borstal&rdquo; term of two years, but must refer the case to the Circuit Criminal Court for consideration of the offender's suitability for such detention.  This recognises the desirability of having a second opinion before a decision is taken to lock up a youth for such a long time.</P>
    <P>The third reason is this.  The question of empowering the district court to commit an offender direct to Borstal was specifically considered at Government level in 1949 in connection with the Criminal Justice Bill which was introduced that year.  The Government of the day decided against having such a provision.  These are the general reasons why it would not be possible to accept the amendments. I am sure the Deputy, being a lawyer himself, will immediately see that the district court could not deal with a case other than that which would be regarded as a minor case and could not impose a sentence of greater length than 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the general principle which the Minister enunciated with regard to the powers of the district court and the powers it should exercise over the liberties of the citizen, but I feel we are dealing in this matter with a special case.  We are dealing with, first of all, a special type of criminal with a special problem, and we are also dealing with the whole mechanism by which the youthful offender, if he does get the more serious sentence, can be released on parole, on licence, for good <Col N="895" /> behaviour.  He would be treated in a very different way from the ordinary criminal facing a serious sentence if he were to be tried summarily in the district court.</P>
      <P>I feel the present system is a rather anomalous one by which the district justice refers the matter to the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court has only got power to send a person for this Borstal training for three years.  The reality of the situation, as the Minister must know, particularly in Dublin, is that the district justice of the Children's Court is a person with a great deal of experience in these matters.  I feel that the power given under this amendment&mdash;admittedly, a power of quite a considerable character&mdash; to the justices of the Children's Court would not be abused.  I feel it would be one which would be beneficial to the individuals coming before the particular court and would also be beneficial to society.  I made an error with regard to the district justices concerned.  I mean the district justices who deal with these matters, particularly with these juvenile offenders, would have particular experience and would exercise the discretion given to them reasonably.</P>
      <P>The matter is one obviously that has come up before.  It was a matter that was considered before, as the Minister said, in 1949.  I feel it might be worth while putting into practice for a period, particularly now that the Minister has got this power in regard to the parole system so that any grave abuse that might exist would be obviated.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that an offence that could be punishable by a sentence of three years would be far from being a minor offence.  Anyhow, in Article 38 of the Constitution, which deals with the trial of offences, it is stated clearly in subsection (2) that minor offences may be tried by courts of summary jurisdiction. That is where we are tied up.</P>

      <P>There is just one little point, if we are arguing the constitutionality of this.  There must be a great number of offences that come <Col N="896" /> before district justices which are committed by youthful offenders and which can be regarded as minor offences and in respect of which, from the point of view of society and the defendant, a sentence of Borstal training would be preferable to the present power of sentencing for a period of twelve months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  The purpose of these amendments is to take away the stigma of a prison sentence from Borstal training.  At the present time, the Borstal institution has been moved up and is now a wing of Mountjoy.  That is the position, but, in addition, the prison regulations apply to the treatment, care and training in St. Patrick's Institution.  I think it would be most desirable if the prison regulations, as such, did not apply to St. Patrick's.  It is a separate institution. It should be physically a separate institution as well as in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as the prison regulations apply to this institution, the stigma of prison will attach to it.  It should not, in fact, be a prison.  It is a special type of institution&mdash;something that has grown up over the years.  It is for corrective training for a special type of offender and the fact that it is such a special type of institution should be recognised by the making of special regulations in respect of it.  The purpose of these amendments, therefore, is to take away what is suggested now, namely, the imposition with modification, of course, of the prison regulations and to provide that regulations will be made that persons sentenced shall undergo a course of corrective training, shall receive psychiatric treatment, shall be trained in a trade or craft and shall engage in such educational, occupational, recreational and athletic activities as may assist their reformation and rehabilitation.  As we <Col N="897" /> are dealing with St. Patrick's and this special institution, it would be desirable to recognise that fact in the legislation before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware, in the first instance, that the decision to take the Borstal institution from Clonmel to Mountjoy was a decision by my predecessor.  It may be that it is unfortunate that the place which was decided upon was associated with the name of Mountjoy Prison but that is only in passing, so to speak. St. Patrick's is distinctly separate from Mountjoy Prison and it is not connected with it except from the point of view of taking boys, who are committed to Mountjoy, through a door into St. Patrick's.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that these boys who are sent for a term of imprisonment to Mountjoy should not be left in Mountjoy and that we should have in such contiguous position another place to which we can take them without having to transfer down the country or do something of that description.  I can assure the Deputy interested in this whole question that St. Patrick's is to all intents and purposes a separate institution, without any connections whatever with Mountjoy other than those I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the amendment, it is necessary to say that subsection (2) of this section, which the amendment proposes to modify, is merely intended to give the Minister for Justice power to make regulations for the management of St. Patrick's in so far as it is being used for the detention of persons sentenced under Section 13. Those offenders who are already liable to be detained in St. Patrick's are already provided for under rules made under the Prisons Acts and regulations made under the Prevention of Crime Act, 1908.  These rules and regulations apply only to persons who may be detained in St. Patrick's under the present law, that is, persons sentenced to Borstal detention or persons transferred to the institution from a prison under Section 3 of the 1908 Act.  It is necessary, therefore, to have a regulation-making power for the <Col N="898" /> institution in so far as it is used for detaining persons sent to it directly from the courts under this section but there is no good reason why these persons should not be subject to exactly the same regulations as those who may already be sent to the institution.</P>
    <P>If this amendment were accepted, the Minister would not be in a position to apply the rules and regulations applicable to the persons already liable to be sent to St. Patrick's to the inmates who would be sent direct to the institution from the courts.  It would be impracticable, even if it were necessary or desirable, to introduce a special régime for the offenders who happen to come into St. Patrick's direct from the courts.  For example, there would be no question of providing a separate visiting committee for them.  The most convenient way of placing the direct arrivals under the same régime as those already liable to be sent or transferred to St. Patrick's is to apply the existing rules and regulations to them.  Any other procedure would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    <P>It may be said that it would be undesirable to apply old Prisons Acts and rules made under them to St. Patrick's as this may over-emphasise the prison aspect of St. Patrick's, but no magic can be worked by deleting unpleasant words like &ldquo;prison&rdquo;. St. Patrick's must remain primarily a prison and the possibilities for corrective training must continue to be limited so long as the factors mentioned in the Second Stage speech continue to apply&mdash;small total number of prisoners, preponderance of inmates, extravagantly high cost of building separate institutions, etc.  Nevertheless, subject to these limitations, what can be done is being done.  We are dealing with two amendments, I understand?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear from the Minister's remarks, and in regard to the four subheads in the suggested subsection by Deputy Ryan and Deputy Costello, whether or not the regulations which the Minister <Col N="899" /> may make at the moment can provide for the kind of corrective treatment and training suggested in the new subsection.  The Minister did not make it clear to me whether he already has power to provide for these four aspects. I feel the Minister should have power to make regulations on those lines.  I recognise that that is not really what is at issue in the moving of these amendments by Deputies Ryan and Costello.  They wish to emphasise&mdash; and, I think, rightly to emphasise&mdash; that notwithstanding the passage of this Bill, there is a distinction between what might be described as the successor to the Borstal institution and the ordinary prison or prison sentence. I think I am correct in saying that is what underlies these amendments, but, as a corollary to that, I suggest that the Minister should at least ensure that he has power to make regulations which will enable those detained in St. Patrick's to undergo a course of corrective training, receive psychiatric treatment, be trained in trades and crafts or engage in educational and other facilities such as suggested here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer to these amendments amounts, in effect, to saying that it is difficult to accept them because of the number of short-term offenders mixed up with the prisoners doing corrective training for a longer period.  That is the very situation to which we are taking exception. This situation, in which a number of short-term prisoners are doing a sentence of twelve months and less, have been transferred from prison as such into the Borstal institution and are mixed up with prisoners serving the longer sentence&mdash;a development which has occurred in recent times&mdash; is something to which objection is rightly taken.  As I said earlier this afternoon, I feel that the Government would do well to take stock of what has been occurring in the comparatively recent past with regard to the treatment of these boys who have to undergo this special corrective training. They are a special problem and <Col N="900" /> they are a special class in themselves and mixing in with them these other youths who are undergoing the shorter term training is bad for both sets and I feel that to use this development as an argument against these amendments is not really answering the suggestions which were in the minds of Deputy Ryan and myself when we put them down.</P>
      <P>I repeat that it is not desirable that the prison regulations as such and the Prison Acts as such should be referred to when dealing with St. Patrick's.  The purpose of these amendments is to give the Minister power not to make the regulations which of course he must make under the Prison Acts and not to apply, even in modified form, the prison regulations to St. Patrick's but to apply separate regulations to this separate and distinct institution.  May I say that although the Minister says that St. Patrick's is a separate institution, it is no more separate from Mountjoy Prison than the Seanad is separate from the Dáil?  You walk through a gate and you are into a wing of the building and that wing happens to be known as St. Patrick's.  You walk down a corridor here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they are parts of the same institution, Mountjoy. I feel that the families of boys there and the boys themselves and prospective employers are all affected by the aura of Mountjoy Prison which is attached to the present institution.  The Minister referred to the cost of building another institution or acquiring a suitable institution.  I do not know what the cost would be but I feel it should be investigated very carefully with a view to seeing if such a new institution could be acquired or if necessary built, away from the precincts of Mountjoy but not too far from the city.  It would be of considerable benefit to the boys and society generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise to the Minister for being late but I was detained elsewhere&mdash;not detained within the meaning of the Act but otherwise.  We have to face this problem <Col N="901" /> bearing in mind that 40 per cent. of our crime is being committed by people under 21 years of age.  That is not something about which we should panic but it is something about which we should be realistic.  It has been the trend in all so-called civilised societies that the youth tend to monopolise the amount of crime being committed. That being so, if we are not to face a terrible future in crime, we must lower the amount of crime being committed at an early age.</P>
      <P>I doubt very much if the treatment in our adult prisons is entirely appropriate to the correction and reformation of young people.  I appreciate that within the power to make regulations which the Minister has at the moment, he may mould and change the regulations so that they will apply in particular ways to the juvenile prisons and to St. Patrick's, but it is undesirable that we should treat it all as a common prisons code, that we should treat St. Patrick's, and the staff of St. Patrick's, as cogs in a very large machine.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with a new problem in this modern age where there is greater freedom for young people, where youth have more opportunities for getting into trouble than they had in olden days, where the discipline of the home and society has become somewhat relaxed in regard to youth, and I believe there is only one way of curing the youths who are starting off on the wrong road, that is, by applying a different form of correction and treatment to them from that to which we are accustomed in our adult prisons.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that the Minister and his predecessors&mdash;and his successors will have, I am sure&mdash;have the same intentions and wishes as we have regarding the youth of the country and those who find themselves sent to St. Patrick's, but I feel there might be a greater readiness on the part of the courts to send young people to St. Patrick's for longer terms, if they felt satisfied that the correct remedial measures were being applied at the right time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Costello in his <Col N="902" /> criticism of the location of St. Patrick's.  I am quite conscious that those who moved the Borstal from Clonmel to Dublin did so with the best intentions and that, in fact, it was almost a necessity to do it for the good of the boys themselves, because the ordinary routine of the institution&mdash;washing floors and washing dishes and such things &mdash;had to be carried out by the long term inmates, as there were not sufficient numbers in the institution to keep the ordinary day to day duties ticking over.  It was felt that if the institution were moved to Dublin, the short term juvenile prisoners might do the more menial tasks of washing floors and dishes, leaving the boys sentenced to Borstal treatment the opportunity of getting the education, treatment and training which they were sent to get.</P>
    <P>However, whatever the cost may be &mdash;I suppose it would run between £100,000 and £150,000&mdash;in fairness to the young people, most of whom have mistakenly gone the wrong way, if we are to recognise our duty towards future generations, we are bound to spend that money now by building a new institution away from the grey walls of Mountjoy.  If any person takes a bird's eye view of Mountjoy, though we may talk here about the female prison and the male prison being separate institutions, he will see that they are neighbouring institutions behind each other, and they are inside one grey wall which we commonly know as Mountjoy Prison.  I appreciate that there is a separate entrance to St. Patrick's, but, nevertheless, it is very much the same institution in the public mind.  Whatever the Department of Justice or Deputies may say, that fact still remains.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be a very desirable and necessary contribution towards the welfare of the State in general to remove that institution, and to have a separate code which could be built up, not with an eye to the old prison regulations, but with an eye to the future, and to the needs of the time, and with an eye to what is necessary for the correction and improvement of these young people <Col N="903" /> before they go on the path which will lead them into greater trouble.</P>

      <P>We are getting away a little from the rules which we were to discuss.  We are now dealing with the question of the suitability or otherwise of St. Patrick's as an institution. That is a matter for discussion.  It is not a matter I could deal with here and I am sure both Deputies will realise that.  The decision with regard to substituting a new building for St. Patrick's does not lie with me.  As Deputy Costello said on Second Reading, it would involve the expenditure of something in the region of £100,000 or £200,000 and if might, indeed, exceed that figure.</P>

      <P>Personally&mdash;I might as well be blunt about it&mdash;I cannot see any hope, in the foreseeable future, of a building of the kind the Deputies appear to have in mind.  I should love to be able to come into the House and say we propose to expend £250,000 on the building of an institution to meet all the needs of those young inmates, but I just cannot do that.  That would be a matter of major policy, a decision on which would have to be taken by the Government, and not by me.  While I might espouse that cause, I do not know how far I could influence my colleagues into expending that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am personally satisfied that in all the circumstances, limited as we are at the present moment, St. Patrick's is a reasonably good institution, and that it is being run in a manner which is a credit to those responsible.  There is a visiting committee which takes a very personal interest in its running, and I know several of the individuals <Col N="904" /> there who take almost a personal managerial sort of interest in its running. From that point of view, I think the interests of the inmates are being thoroughly well looked after.</P>
    <P>There is religious instruction, and there is a full time chaplain who looks after the religious instruction.  There is Mass every morning in a church which is available and, generally speaking, the suggestions which have been made by the Deputies are already in operation.  For example, the inmates of St. Patrick's are kept usefully occupied throughout the day.  As I said on Second Reading:</P>
    <P>They are given instruction in the assembly of motor-cars and cycles, in tailoring, shoe repairing, carpentry and they are employed in woodcutting and in the maintenance and repair of the buildings.  As regards recreation, facilities are provided for football, boxing and other indoor games.  Football matches are arranged from time to time and boxing tournaments are regularly held during the winter months.  Films of entertainment and educational or religious interest are shown during the winter season and lectures are given by interested outsiders.</P>
    <P>Prolonged and really useful training can be given only to those serving long sentences and it is to be hoped that the courts will have regard to the facilities available in St. Patrick's and tend to impose somewhat longer sentences.  It is true that a high proportion of the inmates will be serving sentences which, when allowance is made for the usual remission and low educational standard, will still be far too short for them to benefit by occupational therapy.</P>
    <P>That is the situation which exists there at the present moment and not much more can be done.  The great difficulty which the authorities in the institution are up against is the low educational standard which exists there and an effort to do anything that would be of value is almost nullified by reason of the very short period the inmates are in the institution. Only those who are sent there for a period of two or three years can <Col N="905" /> reap the real benefit that corrective training brings to them.</P>
    <P>There is no use in talking about operating corrective training in respect to boys sent there for four or six weeks, or anything like that.  You just cannot do anything about it.  In some respects, you would not have time to teach some of them the alphabet. However, within these limits, I assure Deputies who have a deep interest in this matter that the most effective steps are being taken to see that these regulations are carried out to the benefit of the boys.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like if any words I uttered were to be taken as criticism of the existing management of the Saint Patrick's institution.  I am very well aware of the wonderful work done there and, furthermore, as the Minister very rightly said, by the Visiting Committee and the full-time Chaplain.  The Minister touched on the trouble that is agitating our minds on this side of the House, namely, the fact that a great number of the boys in Saint Patrick's are not there for any length of time.  They are there only for a short period.  Properly speaking, they are not undergoing corrective training.</P>
      <P>I fear the short-termers who are there for a month, six months or even nine months may disrupt the organisation of the boys there for the longer period.  That is the gravamen of our criticism of recent developments with regard to Saint Patrick's institution. I welcome what the Minister has now said.  As I understand it, he would like to press for a separate institution for Saint Patrick's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that, in a Government, Ministers of every Department have their own special concerns and must put them up and take their chance in the list of priorities to be drawn up by the Government.  In his Second Reading speech the Minister said he did not feel justified in making a suggestion to the Government that a new institution should be built or purchased.  If the Minister can persuade his colleagues of the wisdom of erecting a new institution, even at a considerable cost, I feel <Col N="906" /> he will meet with no opposition from this side of the House on coming forward with such a proposal.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves of:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Control of Imports (Quota No. 45) (Cotton Piece Goods) (Amendment) Order, 1960.</P>
      <P>This is a Quota Order amending the Control of Imports (Quota No. 45) 1949.  That Order appointed quotas for woven cotton piece goods and general exemptions for cloths less than 12 inches in width and having two selvedges.  The exemption was designed primarily to admit for import woven cotton piece goods which included machinery belting, tapes and other such piece-goods not made in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Order is to exempt from the quota cotton towelling of 12 inches or less in width.  The towelling involved is the type one sees in hotels, offices and other public buildings.  Hitherto, that type of towelling was in widths of 18 inches and in lengths of about three yards and used on rollers.  The trend nowadays is to use towelling of a much smaller width, 12 inches or less, which is used in <Col N="907" /> lengths of about 56 yards from cabinets which is a much more hygienic method of operation.</P>
    <P>Up to quite lately the home mills were not in a position to produce such towelling but they now are.  Their capacity, I believe, is sufficient to produce our full requirements of such towelling.  The purpose of the Order is explained in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated and which embodies what I have just said. I commend the Order to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any likely change in the price of the towelling as a result of the proposed Order?  Can the Minister say how many firms are engaged in the manufacture of such towelling here?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices will remain the same as hitherto.  They will be slightly in excess of the imported article largely because the imported article is made by firms who can concentrate on its manufacture and who therefore would have a longer and more economic run.  Three firms in this country are engaged in the manufacture of this type of towelling.  They are (1) Robert Usher and Company, Limited, Drogheda; (2) the Greenmount and Boyne Linen Company, Limited, and (3) Charles Gallen and Company, Limited, Balbriggan.  I am informed that about 40 people are engaged between the three firms in the manufacture of this type of towelling.</P>
      <P>I cannot say specifically how many of the 40 persons would be engaged in the manufacture of towelling of 12 inches or less but unless this exemption is removed the employment of these 40 persons will be affected by reason of imports of quantities of similar width towelling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> The object of this Bill is to confirm an Order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, relating to trade practices affecting the supply and distribution of carpets, carpeting and floor rugs.</P>
    <P>There are three principal manufacturers of machine-made woollen carpets: Navan Carpets Ltd., who are the largest manufacturers, make Axminster carpets; Youghal Carpets Ltd. who also manufacture Axminster carpeting; and Kincora Carpets Ltd. who produce Wilton carpeting as well as Axminster and Brussels carpets.  The Navan company's policy has been to distribute direct to the retail trade where it is economic to do so and to supply the balance of the retail trade through their wholesalers.  Up to 1958, Kincora Carpets Ltd. supplied wholesalers but in April of that year, they decided to distribute exclusively to the retail trade.  Youghal Carpets Ltd. adopted a distribution system similar to that of the Navan company.  Total sales through wholesalers have been somewhat less than 50% of the total.</P>
    <P>In 1954, the Fair Trade Commission made fair trading rules relating to the supply and distribution of carpets. These rules provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that in the application of his conditions of supply, a manufacturer should not discriminate between traders in the same class and that the conditions should not be unreasonable or be operated in such a way as unjustly to exclude new entrants to the trade. After the coming into operation of the rules, certain firms engaged in the wholesale trade in floor coverings represented to the Commission that the conditions of Navan Carpets Ltd., particularly those relating to the size of orders, were beyond the competence of prospective new entrants.  To facilitate all parties, the Commission subsequently made revised fair trading rules which came into operation on 1st April, 1958.</P>
    <P>The new rules provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for quantitative limits to the purchases which a manufacturer might require a wholesaler to make as a condition of supply.  However, renewed representations <Col N="909" /> were made to the Commission by the complainant wholesalers that they were still unable to obtain supplies of carpets from the Navan company.  Subsequently, this company filed with the Commission a statement of terms and conditions which, though showing a considerable relaxation in requirements concerning the size of orders, retained a number of other conditions which seemed to be in defiance of the rules.</P>
    <P>About the same time, Kincora Carpets Ltd. decided to withdraw the wholesalers' discount and the established wholesalers represented to the Commission that, as the Kincora firm were the sole manufacturers in this country of Wilton carpeting, their action was a breach of the rules in that it unreasonably and unjustly eliminated wholesalers from the trade in this type of carpet.</P>
    <P>The Commission decided that the appropriate way of dealing with these representations was to hold a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>At the inquiry, a number of wholesalers stated that they were unable to enter the wholesale trade in home-produced carpets because of unreasonable conditions prescribed by the largest manufacturer.  One of the wholesalers considered it unfair that they should be excluded from the carpet trade because they handled other products.  The complainant wholesalers agreed that it was reasonable for a manufacturer to specify that a wholesaler should have a showroom but they regarded it as unwarranted interference for him to prescribe minimum showroom space and to indicate the details of fittings and shelves.</P>
    <P>The condition requiring wholesalers to employ fitters and sewers was thought to be unreasonable on the ground that the retailer is the obvious person to provide this service for the consumer.  The requirements to give an initial order of 10,000 sq. yards, valued at from £12,000 to £15,000, and to guarantee an annual intake of 20,000 sq. yards, valued at from £24,000 to £30,000, were considered to be not alone unreasonable but impossible for a wholesaler since he would have to test the market and build up his trade gradually.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> The wholesalers accepted that it was reasonable to insist that orders should be of a certain minimum size but they considered that the requirements should not exceed 1,500 sq. yards for an initial order and 6,000 sq. yards for the annual intake.  It was the view of the wholesalers that it was unreasonable to require that all orders should each be equal in size to the initial order.</P>
    <P>In their report of the inquiry, the Fair Trade Commission express the view that a manufacturer is not justified in specifying that a wholesaler must deal exclusively in carpets nor is he justified in denying supplies to a wholesaler firm which has only a remote connection with a retailer of carpets.  In the Commission's opinion a manufacturer may legitimately require a wholesaler to have a showroom but it is not necessary that he should specify a minimum size or any other minimum requirements.  The Commission consider that a manufacturer should not insist on the provision of making-up facilities as a condition of entry to the wholesale trade.  It is the view of the Commission that the requirement imposed by Navan Carpets Ltd., to place an initial order costing about £15,000 and guarantee an annual intake costting £30,000 is unreasonably onerous.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of Youghal Carpets Ltd. were regarded as reasonable by the complainant wholesalers and the Commission agree with that view.</P>
    <P>At the time of the public inquiry, Kincora Carpets Ltd. were no longer supplying wholesalers and marketed their products exclusively through retailers. As the purchases of the three established wholesalers from this manufacturer in recent years did not come anywhere near the requirements specified in the manufacturers' conditions, the Commission consider that the company's decision to supply exclusively to the retail trade was not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The Commission consider that the conditions perscribed by one of the manufacturers has the effect of excluding, without good reason, new entrants to the wholesale trade in carpets.  They recommend, therefore, that an Order should be made requiring <Col N="911" /> a manufacturer to lodge with the Commission a statement of his terms and conditions of supply and providing that, if a prospective wholesaler does not agree that the conditions are reasonable, the Commission should examine the position and should have power to require the manufacturer to make whatever alterations in the conditions may be prescribed by the Commission. The Commission also recommend that a manufacturer should be required to apply his terms and conditions in an equitable manner to all wholesalers seeking supplies.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I have made an Order to give effect to the recommendations contained in the Commission's report.  The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953 provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the House is the Confirmation Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the Order.</P>
    <P>In the case of Confirmation Bills of this kind, the arrangement is that the Order which it is proposed to confirm would not be capable of being amended by the House but would be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters dealt with in the Order have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission and the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the Order are set out in the Commission's report.  I have no hesitation in commending to the House this Confirmation Bill which, on enactment, will, I hope, put an end to unfair restrictive practices in the trade in carpets.</P>

      <P>The information required by the Deputy is set out in page 6 of the Report, Table 1, which gives the home production, imports and exports year by year from the year 1956 to 1958.  If I quote the 1958 figures, it will give the Deputy sufficient figures to satisfy the purpose of his query.</P>
      <P>Home production amounted to £544,000; imports amounted to £108,000, making a total of £652,000 worth of carpets.  The total value of exports was £100,000, leaving the estimated home consumption at £552,000 worth of carpets.  These figures, I understand, have been slightly increased as a result of the success of some of these firms in the export market in recent months.  I could give the Deputy the figures but I have not got them with me at the moment.</P>

      <P>The observations I have to make are not many but I was rather <Col N="913" /> anxious that the Minister should be here when I was making them but if it is not convenient for him to be present I can refer to these figures in his absence.</P>
      <P>I remember very distinctly that housing finance was a matter which engaged the anxious consideration of succeeding Governments after the war as soon as materials became available with which to build houses.  In considering that matter one of the principal preoccupations of Governments was to examine the total national capital programme and to determine in what order various desirable projects should be accommodated.  I remember very distinctly that a decision was taken by the Government of which I was a member&mdash;I am not in a position to speak of the intervening Government of 1951 to 1954&mdash;that a very high priority, if not the highest, was to be accorded to housing and throughout the period of great financial stringency and difficulty which swept around the world in the period from 1956 to 1957, when the British Bank rate went up to 7 per cent and when capital projects in Great Britain were mercilessly slaughtered, we mobilised the capital resources of this country and deliberately resolved that we were prepared to take any risk necessary to get our people out of the slums, out of condemned houses, and to enable people who needed houses for the maintenance of family health to get those houses.  Anyone who did not like that policy could lump it.  We were prepared to defend it on the grounds of the strictest economic orthodoxy and on the grounds of sound democratic practice in a community where we were all virtually <i>ex aequo</i> and where no section in the country was remote from the problems of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember then, in 1956, Deputy Briscoe being chosen by the Fianna Fáil Party to start what always seemed to me to be a peculiarly disreputable, disgusting campaign.  The campaign was to the effect that there was a plan on foot by the then Irish Government to starve housing and particular emphasis was laid on the suggestion that the Irish Government of that day was quite indifferent to the circumstances <Col N="914" /> of the people living in the most sordid slums in Dublin and that they had given instructions to leave them in the slums.  Deputy Briscoe conducted that campaign most energetically here and sought to establish its truth by the quotation of copious figures.</P>
    <P>I remember on one occasion, when I was sitting, as Minister for Agriculture, in the benches where the present Minister for Defence is now sitting, intervening in a debate and denouncing Deputy Briscoe's activities as being disreputable, dishonest and false.  We are all familiar with the fact that in matters of abstruse calculation of that kind if a sufficiently strident clamour is maintained by somebody who pledges his personal honour that certain statements are true and if he is sustained by three newspapers, no matter how fantastic the falsehood he promulgates, if it becomes the concern of a political Party and three newspapers to promote it, it will mislead the people.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned to chew the rag over general elections that took place in 1957 or in the past because they are settled and disposed of.  What I am concerned with is this: I like vigorous, energetic, political debate in this House.  We ought to be strenuous in the advocacy of our opinions and fearless in their proclamation.  I do not think any Deputy has any business in this House if he is so thin-skinned that, having given out, he is not prepared to take it.  It will be a bad day for this House when Deputies are not prepared to give out and to take it in return.  In that atmosphere of vigorous and energetic debate let the truth emerge whatever it is.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to suggest to anyone that we should become mealy-mouthed or excessively solicitous for our respective feelings.  I have often pointed out to strangers about the procedure of this House, that it is quite illusory to imagine that if Deputies become involved in very trenchant debate across the floor of this House, when they meet outside they are necessarily deadly enemies.  The <Col N="915" /> very reverse may be true; the most energetic debaters in this House may outside be the most cordial friends. It is part of the essential operation of a free, democratic Parliament that there should be energetic debate.</P>
    <P>I find no fault therefore if Deputy Briscoe has a complaint to make that he should make it in the strongest possible terms and make it as often as is requisite to arrest the attention of the responsible Minister or Government and impress upon them the need for reform.  I do suggest, however, that it does not serve the best interests of public life or of this House or of the Deputies who constitute it that any of us should allege against another to whatever Party he may belong that he is callously indifferent to the sufferings of our own people.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to allege against Fianna Fáil their incompetence, that they are obscurantist, that they are stupid, that they are lazy, but I have never alleged against them that they are indifferent.  I remember during the period of the economic war I challenged them most energetically that they were sacrificing the interests of a defenceless section of our community to certain political objectives they had.  I denounced them for that most energetically but I never said: &ldquo;You do not give a damn.&rdquo;  That was the burden of Deputy Briscoe's charge and it was a peculiarly evil allegation to suggest that an Irish Government was quite content to allow our people to rot and possibly to die in housing conditions that many of us knew were scandalous and stood in urgent need of reform.</P>

      <P>I am delighted this matter should be challenged and it is for the purpose of drawing into our debate such public-spirited souls as Deputy Noel Lemass and the Minister for Defence that I have raised this matter now.  A question was put down to the Minister for Local Government and the answer appears at Column 1193, Volume 180 of the Official Report of 29 March, 1960.  The question was to ask the Minister for Local Government:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he will state in respect of each year from 1945 to date the number of new houses built by (a) local authorities and (b) private enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sum of these two figures represents the total of new houses built with State assistance.  These are not my figures; they are figures supplied by the Minister for Local Government. In 1948 there were 2,295 houses built; in 1949 there were 5,959 houses built; in 1950 the number was 11,879; in 1951, 12,125 houses; in 1952, 13,018; in 1953, 11,858 houses; in 1954, 10,490 houses; in 1955, 9,016; in 1956 the number was 10,077 and in 1957 there were 8,048 houses built.  Now Fianna Fáil remedial measures began to operate.  In 1958 the total number of houses built was 4,937, and in 1959, the number was 5,465.  That is the latest figure the Minister was in a position to give us.</P>
      <P>In subdividing these two figures into houses built by local authorities and houses built by private enterprise, it is apt to recall a very profound remark once made in this House by the late Deputy Dockrell, the father of the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  I always remember it.  He intervened in a housing debate one day and said: &ldquo;You would think there were no houses built in this country except the houses that were built by the local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has anyone ever stopped to ask himself the question: when a man <Col N="917" /> builds a new house where does he come from in order to occupy it?  He has not been living in a tree.  He has come out of a smaller house to go into a bigger house.  If a man builds a house in Foxrock or in Ballsbridge that makes a contribution to the solution of the housing problem.  He leaves a house to go into a bigger house and somebody leaves another house to go into his house.  When you go back to the start of the whole business you find at the root of the housing tree that a small house, perhaps a tenement house or a room, has been vacated so that a newly married couple can start their family life.  Once a new house is built anywhere it means that all the way down the line, to the humblest dwelling, even to the tenement room, a vacancy is being created which makes room for somebody else. In a community like ours, where the common policy of all of us is to eliminate bad housing conditions, the net result usually is that a condemned tenement room is vacated forever and the family which had been condemned to it moves to a more suitable residence and the tenement room ceases to be an Irish home.</P>
    <P>Let us look now at the number of houses built by local authorities bearing in mind that that is not the only contribution made to the solution of the housing problem.  It is a partial contribution but unless it was powerfully assisted by the contribution made by private housing such as that under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts or the various other schemes to help house building, local authority building would not in our society ever meet the housing problem.</P>
    <P>Taking local authority housing, we find that in 1947 742 houses were built. It is right to bear in mind that 1947, which was the last year of Fianna Fáil administration, was a period only two years after the conclusion of the war and the problem then was not primarily one of money but of materials.  In 1948, the number was 1,371; in 1949, 4,026; in 1950, 8,117; in 1951, 7,258.  Fianna Fáil were returned to office in 1951 and, in 1952, there were 6,938 houses built; in 1953, 6,320; in 1954, 5,697; in 1955, 4,143.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> Now, the Minister for Local Government will express at great length his anxiety in relation to one of the great difficulties facing an incoming Government, namely, the fact that it cannot start building if its predecessor has not made long-term plans to facilitate the maintenance of the rate of building and, therefore, one must look behind the Government in office for the cause of a rise or fall in the yearly average of house building.  Applying that test, Fianna Fáil's three years of office read: in 1952 there were 6,938 houses built by local authorities; in 1953, 6,320; in 1954, 5,697.  The number built in 1955 was 4,143; in 1956, 4,218; in 1957, 4,123; in 1958, 2,033; in 1959, 2,399.</P>
    <P>For the same period, the houses built by private enterprise were: 1947, 779; again, we should bear in mind the scarcity of materials; in 1948, 924; in 1949, 1,933; in 1950, 3,762; in 1951, 4,867; in 1952, 6,080; in 1953, 5,538; in 1954, 4,793; in 1955, 4,873; in 1956, 5,859; in 1957, 3,925; in 1958, 2,904; in 1959, 3,066.  The plain fact is that, despite all the protestations of Fianna Fáil, in both their periods in office the figures would suggest that the rate of housing declined.</P>
    <P>I believe the housing situation to be correctly represented by the fact that, as a result of the great exertions that were made between 1947 and 1957, the acute problem of housing, particularly in rural Ireland, was brought under control.  I believe that there still remains a substantial volume of housing to be done in the city of Dublin but that it has to be done as opportunity offers, having regard to considerations of space, alternative accommodation for those at present in occupation, and a variety of other considerations.</P>
    <P>What I want to condemn, to deplore, and to denounce now is the filthy, dishonest campaign of Deputy Briscoe, his colleagues, and the three newspapers that support him, which he conducted in this House in 1956. The whole campaign was based on falsehood.  He undoubtedly misled a considerable number of people in this city and in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> There was no valid foundation for the campaign and it was a disgrace to the Deputy who embarked upon it and to the Party which encouraged him in it.</P>
    <P>I hear people complaining now about the difficulty of availing of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  So far as I know, anybody who has £100, and a steady job, has the right to get a loan under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts up to 90 per cent. of the value of the house that he proposes to purchase and, inasmuch as the grant which he is in a position to get for a new house is substantially in excess of £100, so far as I am aware anyone who has a job which appears to the local authority to be approximately a permanent job can now get a loan under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  My recollection is that, in order to ensure that the funds available under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts would be made as abundantly available as it was possible to make them to those who could not ordinarily look elsewhere for funds, certain sections of the community were urged to apply to building societies and to avail of other sources of finance in order to leave to the most deserving section the funds available under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  I think that was a good idea.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the present situation is but I imagine there ought to be abundant funds now to provide for everybody out of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts scheme, if that is the way they want to go about it.  But I imagine it is also still true that in so far as people can find alternative accommodation with building societies, it is desirable that those who can get their needs met from that alternative source should avail of it so that the available funds under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts will be there for those who have not the resources freely to avail of building societies' facilities.</P>
    <P>The general matter of this Estimate has been pretty effectively covered by speakers prior to me, but there are two matters to which I wish to address the attention of the Minister.  I, like <Col N="920" /> every other Deputy, travel a great deal. In the course of the last fortnight I have covered, I suppose, some 1,500 miles and I want to direct the Minister's attention to a fact which is now assuming, I think, significant dimensions. Very substantial sums are been spent by local authorities in straightening curves and removing hazards on trunk roads.</P>
    <P>In principle, it is a good thing that, where possible, such schemes should be carried out, but has anybody but myself noticed that the surface of many of these roads is beginning to deteriorate very gravely?  I think it is the poorest kind of Government policy that we should be spending vast sums of money removing bends and corners, if, at the same time, we allow the surfaces of the existing roads seriously to deteriorate.  In this context, I am referring to trunk roads.  I was struck by this matter recently when speaking to a very experienced American traveller who has a wide knowledge of conditions in Europe and in his own country.  He spoke somewhat disparagingly of our roads and I took him up on that and said: &ldquo;I don't agree with you.  I think the road system in Ireland is extremely good, all things considered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said: &ldquo;In most cases there is room for two or three lanes of traffic on Irish roads but at home in America we have four, six and eight lanes, and on the Continent there are usually four or six lanes.&rdquo;  I replied: &ldquo;That is all very well but compare the results in Great Britain and the United States of America with the results here.  I am told that in many parts of the country, in seaside areas in any case, if you drive out on a general holiday, you are bumper to bumper on these magnificent autobahns.  The autobahns may be your pride but sitting bumper to bumper on very wide roads isn't an agreeable way of spending your holiday. You should not look at our roads only in regard to their size.  You should look at them in regard to the traffic likely to travel on them.  It is extremely rare in Ireland to experience any traffic block of that character, except on the occasion of a race meeting or something of that sort.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> He was obliged to admit that and, on reflection, was prepared to say that, bearing in mind the total volume of traffic encountered, probably our trunk roads compared favourably with arterial roads in the United States of America and Great Britain, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they would shake the teeth out of you.&rdquo;  I countered that, though I was not prepared to counter it with as much vigour as the other proposition he put forward, but, ever since that view was expressed by a stranger, I have had it in mind when I travel on our roads.</P>
    <P>I should say that this man was in no sense concerned to run down our country.  On the contrary, he was anxious to sound its praises and merely was mentioning these matters to me as a friend because he wanted an answer so that he could put it to others himself. However, bearing in mind the criticisms he made with regard to the surface of our roads, in all the travelling I have done since, I felt he had something.  I noticed as I travelled that more and more the surface of our trunk roads is deteriorating and that it is striking how little surface work is proceeding.</P>
    <P>This is the beginning of July and I understand surface work of that kind cannot be undertaken in the winter months.  I understand that from the month of April onwards, county surveyors in every county are anxious to get as much of that work completed before winter as they possibly can.  I wonder has any other Deputy had my experience&mdash;that the amount of surface work going on seems to be very inadequate and that the surface of trunk roads seems to be deteriorating on a scale I have not noticed in previous years?  One man's impression is worth consideration and I should be interested to hear from the Minister if he has heard any other complaint of an analogous kind?  I do not make it as a complaint really; I merely draw the Minister's attention to it, so that if it be necessary to suggest to county engineers at large that there should be a greater concentration on road surface repair, representations might be made to them, having a useful dual purpose, one, to preserve the roads and two, to <Col N="922" /> provide a good deal of very necessary employment in rural Ireland at this time.</P>
    <P>I know that some Deputies from Eastern counties may protest that this is not the season in which it is desirable to provide such employment because the demands of the agricultural industry are more than sufficient to take up all available labour.  That may be true in certain counties, but there are counties in the west where there are many small farmers who have plenty of time available to work on this work if they are asked to do so.  It has been a good season until now and they have all their turf saved.</P>
    <P>The last matter I wish to mention is that we must entertain a sense of great anxiety for that, in the recent local elections, only about 30 per cent. of the electorate voted.  If that fact were truly indicative of the political consciousness of our people, I should be greatly depressed.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that the day our people lose faith in the power of their individual votes, parliamentary democracy in this country will perish, but I am encouraged when I recall that despite the gloomy prognostications that precede every general election, there is always a pretty exhaustive poll in such an election. Despite the fact that on the eve of the Carlow-Kilkenny by-election, we were told few people were taking any interest in it, there was quite a respectable poll. There was a vigorous campaign in it, but we are left with the fact that while that was actually going on in Carlow-Kilkenny, in neighbouring counties, only 30 per cent. of the people went to the polls and from 60 to 70 per cent. of the people all over the country did not even bother to vote.  That is something to which we should not close our eyes and I have been trying to find some explanation of it.</P>
    <P>The first explanation, I think, is that in a parliamentary election, there is the whole press and publicity of the national political organisations campaigning in every county with all the attendant newspaper, poster and other publicity that is ordinarily employed. That arrests the attention of the people and concentrates it on the political <Col N="923" /> significance of what is proceeding, but in local elections, though the political element does enter in, the fact that people are interested in local candidates from their own areas cuts across clear political issues and this may result in a large number of people taking the view that there is no political issue sufficiently joined to raise their enthusiasm and draw them to the polls.</P>
    <P>I think, however, there is a third and more potent reason operating which, I believe, is beginning to constitute a danger and my impression in this regard is confirmed by the fact that in certain areas of which I have personal knowledge, it was extremely difficult to get candidates to stand at all, and on certain occasions you had to put forward as candidates men you did not really think were the kind of candidates you wanted but who had to be put forward because nobody else would go.</P>
    <P>When you are face to face with that situation, plus the fact that 70 per cent. of the people did not record their votes, something begins to emerge and I think it is this.  Rightly or wrongly, the impression is spreading that the member of a local authority has no power and, proportionately, little prestige.  Rightly or wrongly, the impression is spreading that if you become a member of a local authority, you get a series of mandatory requirements thrust at you either by the central Government or by the county manager which impose upon you a certain minimal outlay, that the scope left to the local representative to exercise any discretion in the fixing of the rate is so small that, in fact, he has no power at all, and that, as a result, if he does consent to become a member of a local authority, he gets all the kicks and none of the plaudits.</P>
    <P>No matter how eloquently he tries to explain to his neighbour, it is no use.  The rate has gone up to over £2 in the £.  As to 95 per cent. of that, there is nothing he can do about it, and in regard to the remaining five per cent., he has wrought powerfully, but what he was able to do by way of reduction was very small.  In regard to a number of items, he thought he could have used his influence to have <Col N="924" /> them reduced to a more close relationship with the capacity of the ratepayers to pay, but the county manager told him: &ldquo;That is a reserved function. Here is the bill and you have got to make arrangements to have it paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have often said to local representatives who complain to me: &ldquo;That is not the case, because if you feel that the county manager's demand upon the ratepayers is excessive or if you feel he is providing a service incorrectly or improvidently, you have the final say.  When it comes to striking the rate, you can refuse to strike the rate.  If he asks you for 39/- in the £, there is nothing to stop you saying: &lsquo;We are going to vote 35/- in the £. You had better bring down your demand to within that limit.  He is bound to bring down his demand within that limit or appeal to the Minister for Local Government. The Minister for Local Government will not override the local authority, unless he is satisfied that their action is capricious and is not providing the county manager with the minimal sum requisite to carry on the essential services.&rdquo; I have often said to them: &ldquo;If in the last analysis it comes for the consideration of the Minister for Local Government, you can stand firm and all the Minister for Local Government can ultimately do is wind up the council and appoint a commissioner.  You will then have the right <i>vis-a-vis</i> your neighbour to say: &lsquo;That releases us from our responsibility but we are satisfied that they are spending too much and could provide adequate services for less.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But I am told by members of local authorities that, in practice, it does not work out in that way.  I am not in a position to say because I have not been a member of a local authority since the County Management Act was extended to the point at which it now functions. When I was a member of a local authority, there was no county manager, but at that time the secretary of the county council was subject in all his decisions to the members of the local authority.  Now, on balance, speaking as a member of a county council before there was any County Management Act, I believe it was a good thing to bring in the county <Col N="925" /> management system.  I think it was badly needed.  I remember with horror the vast agenda where every minimal purchase for the institutions controlled by the local authority had to be approved by specific resolution, with the result that at the end of every day when we met in the county council one half of the agenda was never properly considered at all.  I can remember in those days the county council used to have actually to approve the purchases of utensils in the county home, but the proceedings were so cumbrous and inefficient that local government was practically breaking down.  Therefore, I believe on the whole that there is much to be said for the institution of the county manager.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far the county managers have usurped the functions of local representatives or how far the centralisation of these powers in the county manager justifies the growing feeling amongst the people, particularly in rural Ireland, that they have no work to do in local authorities, but I want to make one concrete suggestion to the Minister.  If he shares my view that local authorities are becoming more and more difficult to man with the right type of public representatives, there is one contribution that can be made.  A practice has grown up in recent years of the Minister for Local Government holding conferences with the county managers and the county managers returning to their local authorities and saying: &ldquo;That is what has to be done&rdquo;, the local authority experiencing a higher and higher degree of frustration.  They have now reached the stage when county managers return from conferences with the Minister and inform them that that is the decision and there is no more talk about it.  I think possibly that impression is a mistaken impression, but there is one ready means by which that sense of frustration could be very largely allayed, that is, to provide that the Minister would not meet the county managers unless accompanied by the chairman and the vice-chairman of the local authority or some group of that kind.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting&mdash;I do not think it would be practicable or sensible to <Col N="926" /> suggest it&mdash;that the county manager should never meet any officer of the Department of Local Government or of the Department of Health to transact routine business.  I do not think that ordinary routine transactions of business between the appropriate officer of the Department and the county manager give rise to any serious misunderstandings. But I do think it is worth considering establishing a principle&mdash;and I deliberately say a &ldquo;principle&rdquo;, not only a practice but a principle&mdash;that the Minister for the time being will not meet any county manager without at the same time inviting the chairman and vice-chairman of the local authority to accompany him. Then at least they have the feeling that in any consultation proceeding between the ministerial head of a Department and their own chief executive officer, the elected head of the local authority will also be there and will know what transpired.</P>
    <P>I think that arrangement might profitably be extended to the administrative head of the Department and that consultations should not take place between the permanent secretary of the Department and the county manager, unless in the presence of the chairman and vice-chairman of the local body concerned.  Certain it is, I think, that some revision will have to be made of our local government procedure if we are to preserve the representative capacity of our local authorities.  I think we can pay too high a price for efficiency.  I suppose that an intelligent burgomeister in rural Ireland or in any urban area would probably do the job as well as a local authority but I think it would be a great mistake to purchase that rapidity of action and possible superior efficiency at the expense of representative government.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that a small executive, delivered of Parliamentary responsibility, would probably get a great deal more work done than a Government answerable to Parliament, but in the long run I believe that we are better off for the delays which are the purchase price of parliamentary deliberation and of the freedoms founded thereon.</P>
    <P>I believe that representative local government is a good thing.  I believe <Col N="927" /> there are forces now working which are going to make its maintenance more and more difficult and we have the evidence before our eyes.  There is a great danger that, having legislated along the lines of county managers, people will begin to feel that it is a matter of prestige that they adhere rigorously to the decisions arrived at up to now and that to go back on any such decision would represent a loss of face and a confession of error.  I think that is all nonsense.</P>
    <P>There is only one way of testing policy and that is by results.  There are lots of things we all do with the best possible intentions which do not have the results for which we hoped.  In that connection, it is very fundamental to ask: Are you prepared to review what you have done and in so far as possible put right the mistakes you made?  We made some mistakes in our desire to improve the efficiency of local government.  It is time to enquire into that and restore the status of local authorities in the country at large so that the right type of citizen will at least be prepared to offer himself as a candidate for membership of them.  I think that if we can achieve that, we can restore that degree of respect for our local government which will revitalise the whole system of representative local government in Ireland which is now in grave danger of dying.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, the time has not yet come to express that anxiety in respect of the House to which we ourselves belong but so long as we suffer the local authorities to be overwhelmed, it will only be a matter of a very few years until we ourselves shall be panic-stricken by the imminence of a similar danger to Oireachtas Éireann. Now is the time to act.  There is not a Deputy who does not know that what I am saying in respect of these matters is substantially true.  It ought not to be beyond our wisdom to prepare plans to avert the danger which is now upon us.  It will take our joint wisdom and our joint goodwill.  It will take, upon the part of everybody, a capacity to recognise past mistakes and a resolution to do what is good and right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised when <Col N="928" /> I read the Minister's brief, in view of the fact that he told us several times at Question Time about the great activity that was going on in building throughout the country.  On this Estimate and a few other Estimates, I am more concerned with my own constituency than with any other place.  As this is the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, I can be excused for being parochial and talking about my own constituency and the city in which I live.</P>
      <P>There has been great difficulty for some time past in obtaining sanction for the building of houses.  We had a pitifully small scheme before the Minister's Department&mdash;a scheme for about 38 houses.  It has been on the way up and down between Waterford and Dublin since last November 12 months.  I think they were going to start building in a month, two months or three months but the position in Waterford city is that there are applications for over 450 houses and we have not built a house there for the past year.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the Minister, the Department, the local authority or anybody else.  When schemes are put up in the future by local authorities, I would ask the Minister, in respect of Waterford city and county, to give sanction as quickly as he can.  From what I am told, in the very near future, schemes will be submitted to his Department for many more houses.  I hope for something in the neighbourhood of 200 houses at least in order to relieve the situation.  As I said recently in Waterford, it is more than ten to one against anybody now who has applied for a house getting a house when this new lot is finished.  We should be able to reduce the odds there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister intends some time this year&mdash;we have not been told yet&mdash; to introduce a new Traffic Bill.  That will be very welcome.  There has been a demand for it from all over the country and from members of this House.  I have persistently asked questions to discover when and I was always told that the matter was under consideration.  At one time, I was told <Col N="929" /> it would be done before the end of the year and then early the next year.  It has not been done yet.  I ask the Minister to show some urgency in this matter.</P>

      <P>Am I to be allowed to say something about the employment of an expert who was brought in here?  A German expert was brought in here to report on Irish traffic conditions. I do not see why we should have to send to Germany for anything. There seems to be a consensus of opinion on the Government Benches that when you want anything, you must send to Germany.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very serious about this.  This is a matter of people being killed.  I had to take a few dead people out of cars on my way home from the Dáil a few times within the past couple of years and it is not something you can be lighthearted about.  I am sure this gentleman was brought over to see if he could help us, but I submit that it was not to Federal Germany that the Minister's officers should have sent for a traffic expert.  There are 44,000,000 people in France, 51,000,000 people in Federal Germany and 51,000,000 in the United Kingdom of Scotland, England and Wales.  These countries all have about the same population.  The number of motor vehicles registered in these countries is some 5,300,000 in France, 5,500,000 in England and 3,100,000 in Germany. This is what staggered me when I saw that we had to send to Germany for a man who would solve our traffic problem.  The German Government should send somebody somewhere, or find some fairy godmother to solve their problem and they have a problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want to develop this.  There are 5,000 people killed on the roads in England; there <Col N="930" /> were 8,000 people killed on the roads in France and 12,500 killed in Germany, and they have a little over half the number of vehicles on the road as there are in England and in France. These are the people for whom we should send to solve our traffic problems.  I would exhort the Minister to bring in this legislation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps at some time the Chair will be able to tell me when it is possible for a Deputy to ask a Minister to bring in legislation or to speed it up.  I should be grateful to be told that.</P>
      <P>I shall leave that and move on to a matter about which the previous speaker, Deputy Dillon, spoke&mdash;the low poll in the elections.  I submit that for the future the Minister's Department should ensure that provision will be made to notify each voter of his number on the register and the polling station where he is to vote in local elections.  That is very important, especially in country districts.  I would direct the attention of the Minister to what must be a state of confusion in Cork for the citizens where they were faced with a ballot paper with 78 names for 22 seats.  We had over 40 in Waterford for 15 seats and something the same went on in Limerick.  Dublin is divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that the first place this was tried was in Waterford.  The Waterford City Management Act was passed in 1939.  The Waterford Corporation had been dissolved in 1938 and, of course, having been dissolved the members had all disappeared as a local body and there was nobody in Waterford whom the Department thought they could consult except the Waterford Chamber of Commerce.  In my opinion and in the opinion of others that body had very little experience of contesting elections or even bothering about them or even voting in local elections.  They recommended that the city should be treated as an entity and that there should be one ballot paper for the whole city. <Col N="931" /> Out of that came the system of elections which you have in Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the number of vehicles in this country had practically doubled.  In 1949 there were fewer than 123,000 vehicles licensed and about 173,000 drivers.  Ten years later these figures had increased to over 278,000 vehicles and over 305,000 drivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>The vehicles were still in mothballs in 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the Minister's brief for the benefit of Deputy Moher.  A great many cars had come out of mothballs and were on the road in 1949, but the Minister has given a true figure.  In 1949 there were fewer than 123,000 vehicles&mdash; that was not bad for the time&mdash;and ten years later these figures had increased to over 278,000.  I have to repeat that because this is one of the mysteries of public administration about which I am grateful to the Minister. I must be grateful to the Minister because it was he who first drew my attention to it when he, as Deputy Blaney, was sitting over here.  On the 9th May, 1956, he asked the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy O'Donnell, for the amount allocated in each of the financial years 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956 for road upkeep, improvement work, tourist road grants and so on.</P>
      <P>I discovered that the constituency which I represent got a total of £142,000 in 1953-54.  Mark you, the number of cars was going up all the time, but in 1954-55 we got £141,000 and in 1955-56 we got £137,000.  In 1956-57&mdash;still going down&mdash;we got £127,000.  In 1957-58 we got £127,000, in 1958-59 we got £127,000 and in 1959-60 we got £127,000.  We are told that we are going to get a little back this year.  I ask the Minister is he prepared to make restitution?  If we were getting £142,000 in 1953-54 and £141,000 in 1954-55, taking into account the increased number of cars on the roads how much should we be getting now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be asked is there a demand for this money?  Well, on a challenge <Col N="932" /> I brought some friends of mine who had returned to Ireland through county Waterford.  I drove them up a road to Kilbrien to see the stupendous view from there and it it still a dirt road. On last Sunday week I went to the west of my constituency and drove over towards Araglen where there was more beautiful scenery.  Here there was a piece of good tarred road, then a dirt road and then a tarred road again.  I went to the Nire Valley to discover again that we have a road there which would be suitable if we wished to film scenes of the famine period.  I am sure this road was in as good condition in 1847 as it is in 1960.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fair that a constituency like Waterford should be treated like this.  I have protested in this House on other Estimates this year that enormous sums of money are being siphoned off into other counties and given continuously year after year by this and other Departments.  I have come here to make my protest about this matter.  When I read the tabular statement the Minister obtained from his predecessor, I saw that of the counties which got portion of the road grants, Waterford got the smallest amount, £5,000.  Since 1956, I have been endeavouring on this Estimate to find out how these grants were allotted and I always got some sort of brush-off. The Minister's immediate predecessor, now Minister for Agriculture, told me at the close of one of his Estimates that he would communicate with me but he was transferred to another office.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured to raise the matter at a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee.  I suppose that was not the proper place, but I was a little desperate, or perhaps I should say my curiosity was sharpened because the more I tried to get a reply, the more the Minister's predecessor seemed to avoid giving it.  I read in the Minister's brief that they are discontinuing the tourist road grants.  Are they burying the body?  Would the Minister tell me how these grants were arrived at and how the counties were selected?  I know there is a point about the Gaeltacht <Col N="933" /> and the congested areas, but I am speaking about counties which I doubt are either Irish-speaking or congested areas.</P>
    <P>On 4th June, 1957, at column 266, Volume 162, when Deputy Smith, the then Minister, was closing his Estimate, I intervened and said that I had hoped he would explain how the allotments were made to the various counties for tourist road grants and for the road grants from the Road Fund. The Minister replied that in the case of the 101 different questions which are asked in the course of a long debate, it was not really possible to dig up all the information required and that he relied on dealing with the broad aspect of local government matters.  I said I would bear with him as it was a good while since I had spoken on this Estimate. However, I said I would ask the Minister if he would let me have some idea as to how these amounts are arrived at&mdash;the road grants and the tourist road grants.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The area of Rinn is a very small Gaeltacht area compared with some of the other counties.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. T. Lynch: The area?</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith: Yes.  The Irish speaking area around Rinn is very small compared to the Irish speaking area in Galway, Kerry or Donegal.</P>
    <P>I was not challenging the Minister about Galway, Kerry or Donegal but I was interested at the time to know how Cavan had come into it.  Clare had come into it; Cork was in it but they had a big Gaeltacht; Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo came into it. The quotation goes on:</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith: The tourist road and the Gaeltacht road are paid on the same basis.</P>
    <P>Mr. T. Lynch: I would be grateful if the Minister would let me know how the allotment is made.</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith: I shall do that.</P>
    <P>I never heard another word about it. I cannot help noticing that the county borough of Waterford pays £50,000 <Col N="934" /> or £60,000 and gets back £5,000.  I know we are told that we have only a small portion of the roads to do and that the rest of the money has to be used on the rest of the roads in Ireland. At the same time, it is an extraordinary state of affairs, as I have said before, that so much money is siphoned off into counties which are favoured.  I shall not make any innuendoes about the favoured but come out with it.  The day the Minister got the information from Deputy O'Donnell that his county, Donegal, got £55,000 for tourist roads grant, and £14,500 for employment schemes, we learned that we got £5,000 and £250 respectively. That is about our height in all those matters&mdash;we get the buttons.  For improvement of roads in Fior-Ghaeltacht areas, Donegal got £14,500 and we got nothing.</P>
    <P>I cannot help looking at the great city of Dublin.  Dublin got about £130,000 or £140,000 out of the Road Fund to improve the Naas road, for people to be bumped to death with all the traffic from Cork, Limerick, Waterford and the southern counties. The whole Naas road appears to be a butcher's road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin ratepayers can pay for it but we get very little out of the Road Fund.  I am looking at this last figure.  On 31st May, 1960, I asked the Minister for Local Government a question and in his reply he said the Waterford figure for main road improvement grants was £108,100, and for tourist road grants, £5,000.  We are down to £108,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not come up here to submit to the Minister that he should do this or to ask the Minister to do it.  I think we are entitled to it and I believe the people in my constituency are entitled <Col N="935" /> to it.  They pay their road taxes and in my short term here from 1953-4 to 1960-1, I have seen it go down from £142,000 to £113,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister very much resented it when somebody asked him about reconstruction grants.  Perhaps he thinks Deputies put down questions to embarrass him.  It is very embarrassing for Deputies when their constituents come to them and say the reconstruction work has been carried out, the inspection has been carried out and that they are waiting for the money. The people concerned are generally people who cannot afford to remain long out of the money and small contractors usually carry out the work.  I realise that frequently there are administrative delays.  I trust the Minister will take my remarks in the spirit in which I make them.  I said the same thing to the Minister for Lands the other day.  I do not want to know whose fault it is; I ask that the matter be remedied.  Housing reconstruction grants should be paid out with greater despatch.</P>
    <P>Of all the constituencies and of all the local authorities in Ireland, the Waterford County Council and the Waterford City Council have been treated vilely as far as the allocation of road grants is concerned.  The Minister looks to his own county and I admire him for it.  He should be fair and tolerant when I try to look after my county and my people.  I hope he will review the position and realise the wrong that has been perpetrated on my constituents for the past five or six years.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Minister should ensure that housing reconstruction grants are paid more quickly.  The county boroughs of Waterford, Limerick and Cork should have a different method of election.  All voters should be notified of their numbers on the register and the polling station at which they should vote at all elections whether Dáil or local government elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate concerns us all.  There is not a Deputy who has not something to say in regard to it.  The Department is concerned with <Col N="936" /> the everyday life of our people in every district and constituency.  The roads leading out of Dublin towards the city boundary and the county are very bad. Deputy T. Lynch mentioned the Naas Road.  I could say the same about other roads leading out of the city.</P>
      <P>It is time the Department considered increasing grants for roads leading from the city to the county of Dublin. A reclassification of these roads is very badly needed.  The Minister has contributed reasonably well but we still have prairie tracks as I would describe them leading out of the city into the county.  Dublin County Council may not always have co-operated with various Government Departments to try to rectify the position.  On Sunday week last I got into a motor queue at the top of Dorset Street.  I live at 251 Swords Road which is about two miles from that point.  It took me three-quarters of an hour to reach my home that day.  The cars were lying bumper to bumper.</P>
      <P>If the day is fine and citizens want to go to the sea, our roads cannot accommodate them.  We talk about improving the roads and other things.  We have not handled the position properly. We have disgraceful roads radiating from Dublin city.  Normally, a road is good enough when only a few cars are using it.  If we are to encourage the tourist industry, in addition to meeting the increasing needs of the growing population of the city we must improve our roads.</P>
      <P>County Kildare has handled the position reasonably well.  They have made a jolly good job of their roads and have provided a headline to the county and city of Dublin.  The roads leading from Dublin city and county to seaside resorts should be the joint responsibility of both bodies and there should be an increased road grant from the Department of Local Government to meet the present almost hopeless position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past ten or twelve years I have been trying to get something done about what I would describe as a prairie track from the Howth Road to Baldoyle Racecourse.  There is room for only one car to pass.  The House will appreciate the position when there <Col N="937" /> is much traffic there.  Portmarnock Golf Course and the strand at Portmarnock as well as the racecourse at Baldoyle are tourist attractions apart altogether from their attraction to our citizens. For the past ten or twelve years I have been trying to have that roadway attended to.  Some dead hand seems to prevent the work from being carried out.  I am aware it is not so much the responsibility of the Minister as that of the local authority.  The local authority will say they have not the money to carry out the work.</P>
    <P>These are matters of vital importance to the tourist industry.  We had the Canada Cup in Portmarnock recently and the greater part of the traffic went along that prairie track from Howth Road through Baldoyle and part of this road is under the jurisdiction of Dublin Corporation and part under the county council.  I suppose I cannot speak for both bodies yet, but I consider that the road conditions leading from Dublin call for improvement.  This applies equally to the Naas Road and to the Bray Road. The Department gave a grant for the reconstruction of the Bray Road and they did not get very much co-operation from the council then in office. The Minister should bring the officials of both the county council and the corporation together and tell them to put their house in order and improve the roads leading from Dublin city. That is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate people on the Hill of Howth were told when the trams were taken off that the road would be done almost immediately.  I thought I would hardly be down from the Hill after hearing a statement from a member of the county council that everything would be done immediately before the work would start, but although that was a year ago, they have not even started yet.  This leads to a feeling of complete frustration and the people feel that the public representative is just coming there making statements and putting them off.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the problem we have here and it is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for making a statement about a week ago that he would encourage all local authorities to get water and sewerage extended to the people's homes.  There are areas in the suburbs of Dublin still <Col N="939" /> without water or sewerage and I urge the Minister to impress on local authorities the desirability of availing of grants in this connection.  There are people in county Dublin still drinking out of old wells infested by rats and other vermin.  Now that I am a member of Dublin Corporation, I shall make my voice heard so far as extending water supplies is concerned.  Water is essential for our people; in some parts of county Dublin the water supply is shocking and people have very unsatisfactory water for drinking purposes. Any move by the Minister to improve matters and to extend the water supply to really populous areas along the coast will have my co-operation.</P>
    <P>I asked a question recently about the north county Dublin regional water scheme and was told that officers of the Department and officials of Dublin County Council were considering this scheme.  I hope an early decision will be reached because I have been hearing about that scheme since I first came here in 1944.  I know something practical is going to be done and I hope the Minister will see that the work is carried out.</P>
    <P>The county Dublin seaside resorts at Skerries, Rush, Donabate, Malahide, Portmarnock and Balbriggan, all along the coast, are badly served. There is only a partial water supply at Portmarnock; Malahide recently got one, in the past year or so; Donabate has no water and Lusk has no water supply except for an old pump. Rush has only a partial water supply and when the weather is fine the water goes off at seven in the evening and if you stay in bed until 10 in the morning, you will have some water by then, perhaps.  In Skerries, the same thing applies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Now that I am a member of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, I shall try to do something to end that position, if possible.  I shall make no false promises but I shall keep trying.</P>
      <P>I am very much opposed to the present policy of the Department of trying to compare the cost of houses in Dublin with the cost of houses in Kildare or the midlands or in Mayo or Galway or some other place where they have not got to pay trade union rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>More power to you.  In Dublin, if any recognised builder takes on a house building job, he has to pay trade union rates and his costs might be £200 per house more than in other areas for the same type of house.  A lot of frustration has been caused by comparing county Dublin and the suburbs of Dublin with other counties where labour may not be as expensive and where possibly the work can be carried out more cheaply.  The same yardstick should not be applied to Dublin county and city suburbs where builders have to pay trade union wages and also travel money, if they bring tradesmen out from the city.</P>
      <P>It is not equitable to compare the cost of building a house in County Dublin with the cost of building a house in other areas.  It is reasonable to expect that the cost of building in Dublin would be slightly higher.  The cost of building a terrace house is cheaper than the cost of building a detached house.  Very few small builders are available now and it is the larger builders who want to take this work.  It is a disadvantage to County Dublin to be measured by the same standard as the Department of Local Government applies in other counties in respect to building costs.</P>
      <P>We do not want elaborate houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> We want houses of a reasonable standard.  Dublin County Council have been asked as an experiment to build houses of the same type as were built in Ringaskiddy.  The tenants will be charged the same rent for houses of that type as they are for the better type of house.  I shall oppose with all the energy at my command the building of that type of cottage for our people. If such cottages are built the rent should be considerably reduced.  That would be one way out of the difficulty. I condemn the building of that type of house for the purpose of bringing the cost down to the same level as applies in the midlands.  I do not want to be a party to a reduction in the standard of building.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points that I raised recently at meetings of the Dublin County Council.  That council provided almost £10,000,000 for the building of houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.</P>
    <P>A number of tenants who have to pay the full rates find the half-yearly moieties burdensome.  I raised the matter at a meeting of the Dublin County Council some time ago.  I want the Department of Local Government in consultation with the local authorities of the city and county of Dublin, to consider giving tenants the option to pay rates monthly.  Some of the people on whose behalf I am speaking have to pay £40 to £50 rates.  The repayments on the house are payable monthly and it would be a great assistance if they could pay the rates monthly.  The local authority would benefit by the rates coming in more speedily.  It would reduce the overdraft charges.  There is a demand for that facility in the city and county of Dublin and the Department of Local Government should devise machinery to meet that demand.  I would ask the Minister to do what he can in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor dealt at length with the question of revaluation. That is a problem about which I have been concerned over the years. The former Minister for Local Government introduced a Bill under which reconstructed premises would not be revalued for seven years.  After the <Col N="942" /> seven years the valuation officer will not only value the addition to the premises but will revalue the entire premises.</P>

      <P>We shall come back to that.  I am touched by Deputy Burke's tribute to Kildare.  Now that he is on the Dublin County Council, if he emulates the Kildare County Council and sets that standard as his target, perhaps he will manage to achieve in a short period what he has failed to get for 16 years.  Now that he appreciates that he should take Kildare as his standard and as the example to be followed, he has gone a long way towards the achievement of his aims.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon spoke earlier to-night of the difficulties in relation to local authorities and the fact that many people in the recent elections did not exercise the franchise vested in them. There has been in recent years far too much criticism of members of local authorities, criticism of those members by people who themselves are not prepared to sacrifice the time and the effort that membership of a local authority involves.  That criticism to a large extent commenced when Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Local Government, introduced the Management Acts in 1940 and 1942 in a spirit of domination and in a spirit of criticism of the then members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of the people who believe like Deputy Dillon that it is entirely desirable that there should be managerial functions in relation to the carrying out of the detailed administrative work of local authorities.  It <Col N="945" /> should, however, be the detailed administrative work, and the broad principles and policy should be laid down by the members of the local authority.  That was not always accepted; in fact it was quite the reverse in the initial stages of the County Management Acts, and to a large extent we have never got over what I may term, for the want of a better expression, the bad spirit in which those Acts were introduced some 16 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is an undoubted fact that the members of a local authority are often not in a position to know or appreciate the powers vested in them.  There may be a few members of a local authority who do not understand them.  Sometimes they are members of the much abused legal profession, but by and large it is impossible for members of local authorities to know and understand what powers they have under the Acts, how far they can go and what rights they have <i>vis-á-vis</i> the county manager.</P>
    <P>This is a subject on which I claim a little right to speak because, so far as I know, I am the only person who ever moved the suspension of a county manager, a motion which was seconded by a Deputy no longer a member of this House and who was on the other side of the House.  We did get a change of spirit after that.  We got a change of spirit because there was considerably greater appreciation of the powers vested in local authorities.  Even so the position still arises that members of local authorities, by their very essence, by the fact that they have other business of their own to carry out, by the fact that they are unpaid, by the fact of the consequent restriction on the amount of time which they can expend, are not necessarily <i>au fait</i> with the various regulations and with their powers.</P>
    <P>There is one way in which that could be overcome and it is a way I have been advocating for years&mdash;that there should be a specific duty laid on the secretary of a county council to advise the elected members of the council of their powers <i>vis-á-vis</i> the manager. Unless that duty is specifically laid on the secretary he must feel, as the <Col N="946" /> second executive officer in the local authority, that his loyalty is to the manager and that at best he has no duty or power to advise the members of a local authority should there be any conflict between themselves and the manager.  It should be made a clear and unequivocal duty of the secretary, just as it is a duty of the secretary to advise should the local authority attempt to do something that is <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>If that were done there would be a very much greater appreciation of the powers of members of local authorities and, if there were a greater appreciation of the powers of members of local authorities, there would be a greater interest in the elections to these bodies and candidates would be forthcoming who would be representative of the various interests.</P>
    <P>Part of this trouble in relation to local authorities has arisen because certain organisations have deliberately set themselves out to denigrate the members of the local authority, to suggest that the members of the authority take no interest in their work, and generally to run them down.  I think all of us find that 99 per cent. of the people who do that, if you ask them to stand in an election, will say: &ldquo;I have not got the time.  I am too busy with my own affairs.&rdquo;  If everybody took that line it would be a sorry state of affairs.  Instead of being attacked the members of local authorities deserve a tribute for the time they spend on the business of the local authority.  Of course, there are exceptions.  There are bad members of local authorities, just as there are bad members of this House; but, after all, there was one bad Disciple.  As long as human nature is human nature, that is going to happen, but after a while the people come to know those on whom they can rely and those on whose word they cannot rely.</P>
    <P>If we were able to get more of an appreciation of the powers that are vested in members of local authorities under the law, if such powers were fully understood, it would help very considerably to strengthen our hand in dealing with the problems that come along.  I would urge the Minister there-fore&mdash;and <Col N="947" /> I think he can do this administratively&mdash;to provide that it will be a specific function of the county secretary in each county, or the town clerk in the case of an urban council or town commissioners, to advise the members of their powers, even though it may be against the county manager, and to make that a specific duty in such a way that no county manager can challenge him for having done it&mdash; that even though the county manager may not like it, he must admit the secretary is doing something laid down as part of his duty.  I would also urge the Minister, now that new local authorities have been elected, to issue to them a short note expressing clearly what are their powers and including, I hope, a memorandum giving a direction to the county secretaries to advise the members in the manner I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have spoken about the roads and the position arising on the roads.  We had two tragedies, unfortunately, within the past few days in county Kildare.  Deputies may have seen in the papers this morning the comments of the coroner in relation to one of those tragedies.  I could not agree more with those comments.  I said that too much attention was being focussed at present on what was not the real cause of accidents on the road. The real cause of the vast majority of accidents at present is that drivers do something that is both stupid and unexpected. Admittedly, speed makes an accident worse, so to speak, when it happens, but mere speed of itself very seldom creates an accident.  What does create accidents is the fact that, unfortunately, our people are not good drivers.  One may be criticised for saying that because nobody likes being told he is not a good driver, but it is, unfortunately, a fact.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister this.  He drives through the Six Counties pretty regularly.  I have occasion for an unfortunate reason to go up there a good deal at present and I have been struck by two things: first, by the fact that I think our roads are better than theirs, and second, by the fact that their standard of driving is better than ours. <Col N="948" /> The Minister probably drives through the Six Counties coming down here.  I wonder does he find the same thing? I came down this morning from Belfast. I was struck by the fact that until you cross the Border, the road was not as good, but the standard of driving in and around Belfast is better than the standard of driving in and around Dublin.  One seldom sees there drivers moving out of their own lane of traffic without giving a signal.  One rarely sees down here a driver, still progressing on but moving from the near-side lane into the middle lane of traffic, giving a signal before he moves out of his own lane.  One may constantly see people driving along the crown of the road or perhaps the left centre, leaving a large margin on their left hand side &mdash;driving along the crown of the road, sometimes slowly, but, so to speak, hogging the road.  As a result, they waste&mdash;because that is what it is&mdash;all the money that has been expended on the part of the road to their left as they move along.</P>
    <P>Many of the roads would be quite wide enough to cope with the traffic which moves along them if that traffic utilised the road in a sensible manner. But it is a fact, unfortunately, that far too many people when they are driving think that if they travel on the left centre of the road, they are doing a good job.  That can be countered by one action, and I would urge the Minister to counter it by the provision on as many of our roads as possible of visual lanes.  That can be done as an administrative act and would not require legislation of any sort.  If there were lanes laid down on the roads, people would get the habit of travelling in those lanes and would realise when moving out of them that they were doing something other drivers would be entitled to feel was unexpected and they would, therefore, give a signal before doing so.  That would minimise risks and would avoid a great deal of accidents.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing the Minister could do in consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  But I think the motivating force must be the Minister for Local Government, and accordingly I think it is proper to raise it on this Vote.  In <Col N="949" /> countries where television has been set up, a great deal has been done to improve the standard of driving through television.  What one might call &ldquo;spot-ads.&rdquo; showing bad driving, along with comments pointing out where such bad driving can be corrected, have, I think, done a great deal to improve the standard of driving in those countries in which television is an established fact.  It will be an established fact here soon and I would urge the Minister very strongly indeed to adopt something on those lines when television comes here. But even before it does come, the Minister should utilise the radio, not for the purpose of giving long lectures on road traffic regulations, but for the purpose of having very short interjections at appropriate times as to what should be done and what should not be done on the roads, and if I may say so, also for the purpose of reporting sensible comments that are made in relation to road accidents by responsible people such as the coroner who, unfortunately, had to officiate in the case to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that there are many people who in their ordinary, everyday lives, are the most courteous of people, who, if they were to walk down the street and, so to speak, shoulder somebody off the footpath would die of shame that they had been guilty of such rudeness and boorishness but who, when they get behind the wheel of a car, seem to forget that the way in which they drive that car means that they are being just as discourteous, just as rude and just as inconsiderate to other road users as if they were deliberately to shoulder somebody off the footpath. I would urge the Minister in this respect not to wait until he has a counsel of perfection and frankly I think he was wrong in deferring the introduction of his road traffic proposals for so long.  He should have aimed at getting some part of the distance in a much shorter time, leaving perhaps the more complete codification and revision to a later date.  That would have been preferable, but, however, it is crying over spilt milk.</P>
    <P>He has taken his decision, but, even <Col N="950" /> before that legislation comes before the House, I would strongly urge him to advise all local authorities to introduce the visual lane system on as many as possible of their main roads, and to utilise the radio as far as possible for the purpose of trying to improve the standard of driving.  In nine cases out of ten, it is not deliberate bad driving; it is not doing something that is dangerous deliberately.  It is because the person doing it does not realise how dangerous it is.</P>
    <P>I am afraid we are somewhat too tolerant in relation to vehicles on the roads.  Some of them are defective and I believe a fair proportion of accidents arises from that cause.  I am not quite clear whether this arises on the Vote for the Department of Local Government or the Department of Justice; I think the Department of Local Government sets down the standards and the Department of Justice does the mere enforcement.  There should be a much wider publicising of the standards required in relation to vehicles so that they will be properly roadworthy, and again I think a campaign should be undertaken to educate people using vehicles that their non-effectiveness, non-roadworthiness, is a source of danger not merely to themselves but to other road users.</P>
    <P>The series of fatal and dangerous accidents that have occurred, and the way in which traffic is becoming heavier on the roads, make it clear that we must adopt at the earliest possible opportunity every means that is to hand to improve the standard of driving and make people realise what is good and what is bad driving, what are good and what are bad practices, because I believe they are fundamentally anxious to co-operate, if only the way is pointed to them.  I do not know whether the Minister has given any indication to the House of when he hopes to have the new legislation in relation to road traffic introduced but I think we would all agree the sooner it is brought here, the better.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister one specific question and it arises out of something else I noticed in going to Belfast.  I was under the impression that what I term &ldquo;cat's eyes&rdquo; are a <Col N="951" /> distinct improvement to our roads but I noticed no such installations on the roads once one crosses into Down or Armagh.  Has the Minister made any international inquiries in relation to the use of &ldquo;cat's eyes&rdquo;?  My own view is that they improve standards of driving and the proper use of roads, and are an immense assistance in fog.  I should also like to ask him to indicate whether he proposes to urge local authorities to continue with their installation.</P>
    <P>In addition, I should like to ask him to indicate whether he has given any consideration to the Continental method of marking roads.  On the Continent, they have a white line in the middle which indicates danger, rather in the way I suppose our intermittent white line so indicates, but they have an additional second white line and sometimes a third white line in the middle.  When the second white line is on the side you are proceeding along, it indicates that any sort of passing is absolutely forbidden under any circumstances. You are absolutely forbidden to move your vehicle over it, and if there is a treble white line, it indicates that passing is forbidden on both sides.</P>
    <P>Here one sometimes sees a single white line at a corner and for traffic coming from one direction, it is necessary and desirable, but for traffic coming from the side it is not necessary. In consequence of that, traffic coming from the side where it is not necessary is inclined to skimp, get careless and go over it, and that not merely operates at the particular place where there is no danger but also serves to act as a general weakening of the principle of lines for traffic, which I feel is one that must be stressed.  The Continental method leaves no doubt in anybody's mind and perhaps might be worth considering here from that point of view.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to urge local authorities when they have carried out an improvement and taken away a bad S-bend, to take away the dangerous notice at the same time as the work is finished.  If it is left there, the result is that a person travelling along the road says: &ldquo;That notice means nothing,&rdquo; and familiarity breeds <Col N="952" /> contempt.  Then he drives on for another four or five miles and seeing a similar notice, says to himself that perhaps it means the same, and takes a chance on it.  One glaring example of that is where Meath County Council have not removed a dangerous notice between Kilcock and Enfield, at what we call Cloncurry.  I suppose the Minister himself sometimes has occasion to travel that road and if he looks he will see a notice, three miles outside Kilcock, stating that there is a dangerous bridge ahead.  In actual fact, that bridge has been bypassed for the past two years and there is no bridge there at all.  That sort of thing tends to bring traffic signs into contempt and is wholly undesirable.</P>
    <P>During the past three weeks, all of us have had occasion to express our views to the local electorate.  The Minister himself gave expression to some views in Donegal.  I do not know whether he was reported accurately or not, but, if he was reported accurately, then I feel he was repeating an untruth which has been stated before.  The rules of the House properly prevent me from describing it as a deliberate untruth but I want to say it was an untruth spoken recklessly without the Minister having taken the trouble, care or attention to look at the facts.  The Minister indicated that people in 1956/57, the last financial year before his Government took office, did not know where they stood in relation to housing grants and indicated that there had been a tremendous upsurge in housing in the past year, implying, if not expressing by his words, that there was an upsurge far and above what had been there before his Government took office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has already dealt with the figures in this connection.  I want to put on the record a slightly different aspect of them.  The fact is that there was, of course, last year a slight improvement in relation to housing when one compares last year with the year immediately preceding it. That is something about which everybody is pleased.  It is important, however, only in relation to the preceding year and it is still a long, long way short of the results achieved and the <Col N="953" /> houses built in the year in which the Minister chose in Donegal to criticise us and to abuse us.</P>
    <P>Many questions have been answered by the present Minister on this matter. The answers show the same picture and the same pattern.  In the last year for which we were responsible far more money was paid out and far more houses built as compared with anything achieved by the Minister in his three years in office.  I accept that, in relation to certain local authorities, housing is coming to an end.  It was bound to taper down.  I accept that at once and I am prepared to offer that excuse for the poor performance by Fianna Fáil.  In saying that, I am being far more generous to the other side of the House than they were to us when I was over there, and probably far more generous than they will be should they find themselves once more in Opposition.  Whether or not account is taken of that, the fact is there and the figures speak for themselves. If the Minister wishes to have any regard for truth I suggest that he should spend an hour or two examining the figures and, when he has done that, he should put them on the record whenever he speaks about housing.</P>
    <P>Last year, on the information supplied in answer to questions, the amount expended on housing from the Local Loans Fund, excluding Dublin and Cork Corporations, was £3,104,000. That was the estimate, rather, for last year as against £2,455,000 for the preceding year.  I admit it shows an improvement. I admit it shows more housing activity in 1959-60 as against 1958-1959.  When one turns back, however, and finds that it is £3,100,000 as against £4,670,000 in 1956-1957 one is inclined to think that the Minister would be both wiser and fairer if he were to refrain from suggesting that the year 1956-1957 was a disastrous year in housing.</P>
    <P>Those are the figures for local authority housing.  There is a difference of 50 per cent.&mdash;£3,100,000 in 1959-1960 and £4,670,000 in 1956-1957.  I shall not argue about the difference in the cost of housing then and now, but is it not reasonable to conclude that, if <Col N="954" /> half as much again was spent, half as many houses in addition were completed? If anybody wants to check the figures they are set out in the Official Report of this House on 21st April, 1960.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to private housing grants is that again there seems to have been some improvement in 1959-1960 when compared with the preceding year.  Last year the sum was £1,896,000; in the previous year it was £1,331,000.  But in 1956-57 it was £2,170,000.  Is not that again ample evidence of the fact that the Minister has not been able, with all his talk and all his boasting, to attain the same standards his predecessor reached?  Bad and all as that is, it becomes even worse when shown up against the number of houses completed by local authorities and in relation to private grants.  I have not yet been able to get the figures for this year, but in 1956-1957 the figure was 4,123; in 1958-1959, it was 2,399.  I have no doubt that the figure for 1959-1960 will show some improvement, but it will still be a long way behind the 1956-1957 figure.</P>
    <P>The same position prevails where private enterprise housing is concerned &mdash;3,900 as compared with 3,000 odd. If one takes the situation in the two areas in which there is no tapering off and in which there is still undoubtedly grave need for the erection of more houses&mdash;I refer to Dublin city and Cork City&mdash;the comparison becomes even more striking.  I can remember in December, 1956, having to come out into the open and tell the truth in relation to the activities of a certain member of the Dublin Corporation, a member of this House, Deputy Briscoe. For months Deputy Briscoe sabotaged the housing effort in Dublin at that time.  He sabotaged it despite the fact that I had undertaken to make available a sum of £4,000,000 for housing in Dublin, if Dublin required that amount.</P>
    <P>We all know what happened.  We were told all over the country, as well as being told in this House, that the Government of that day were not making funds available to Dublin for housing. It is a striking thing that since then there has not been a cheep out of <Col N="955" /> Deputy Briscoe or any of the other people who were then prepared to sabotage the efforts to get housing.  I see one of the people in the House opposite me who was loudest at that time shouting that there was no money for housing.  I have not heard a cheep from Deputy Lemass&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about the amount his Government have made available compared with the amount made available at that time, but he was prepared to take to the hustings then and shout with all his might and main that the Government of that day would not give any money to Dublin Corporation.  The strange thing about it is that the Government of that day in the year when he was shouting so vigorously, and I may say on foot of which misrepresentations he first came into this House were ensuring that Dublin Corporation were getting a very different sum from the amount they have been given by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Capital expenditure of Dublin Corporation in 1956-57, under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, was £2,689,000.  The capital expenditure of Dublin Corporation in the year ending 31st March, 1960, was £833,358. Three years have gone and with a Fianna Fáil Minister in charge of housing, that is the comparison.  That is the best they can suggest, after three years, as their record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the trouble I had then to get Dublin Corporation and Deputy Briscoe in particular, who was leading them astray, to make any allocation for small dwellings loans.  It is on the records of the Minister's Department that the only way I could get them to do it was to say that it was an integral part of the allocations I was making. They were prepared to sabotage and throw the people who wanted loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts to the wolves for the sake of Party political propaganda.  Look at the figures now&mdash;£936,000 expenditure under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts in 1956-57&mdash;a drop from £1,536,000 in the preceding year, solely <Col N="956" /> because of the deliberate campaign that was being carried on at that time, because, frankly, as a result of that campaign, Dublin Corporation in that year did not expend as much as they had been promised.</P>
    <P>It is on the records of the Department of Local Government; it is on the records of this House; and it is on the records of Dublin Corporation that they were told in the most specific terms they could have £4,000,000 for the purposes that were necessary both under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, but yet, thanks to the activities of Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Lemass at that time&mdash;I am not sure whether he was then Deputy or Councillor Lemass but he himself is far better able to answer that than I am&mdash;in trying to prevent Dublin Corporation getting on with their housing schemes, instead of £4,000,000 they drew only £3,600,000.</P>
    <P>I could understand all that if, when Fianna Fáil came in, there was an immediate change, a change which would have had to be seen over the period of three years they have been there and a change which was bound to be effective after three years.  Instead of that, in volume 181, No. 10, column 1312, of the Official Report, one can see that the total expenditure last year was somewhere in the region of £1,500,000, instead of the £4,000,000 they were guaranteed and which was paid and made available when we were being so untruthfully attacked at that time.</P>
    <P>It was not enough for people to attempt for Party purposes to sabotage the Dublin Corporation's housing programme. The second area where it was also necessary that there should be building to catch up with the arrears was Cork.  Cork were told by me specifically that they could have £750,000 every year and that in that year of 1955-56, they could look forward to getting the same amount in 1956-57.  They were told to make their plans on that basis.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  They did so and in the year 1955-56, their expenditure was roughly £751,000 and in 1956-57, their expenditure was <Col N="957" /> £758,000, but immediately Fianna Fáil came in no such guarantee was apparently forthcoming because the amount being made available for Cork, the amount paid for housing in Cork, dropped steadily and last year, up to 31st of March last, the total amount paid out by Fianna Fáil for Cork Corporation capital expenditure was only £508,000.</P>
    <P>Those people who have over the years seen fit to repeat falsehoods about housing issues and housing payments would be wise&mdash;particularly the Minister&mdash;to make their statements bear some relation to the truth. Frankly, I do not blame Deputy Lemass for his statements of that period four years ago.  He was a young man without experience.  He was, perhaps, filled with enthusiasm and belief in his leaders.  He did not realise then, to use a colloquialism, that they were taking him for a ride; that they were misdirecting him; that they stated things that were not true and that their performance since shows how utterly discreditable was their action.</P>
    <P>But I do blame those who should have known better at that time, particularly Deputy Briscoe who was Chairman of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee.  When they came to see me, as Minister for Finance, they knew the guarantee that had been given.  They knew, or ought to have known if they did not know&mdash;they had all the information ready to their hands in Dublin Corporation&mdash;that they had been guaranteed £4,000,000 and were not going to reach that expenditure in that year.  Nevertheless, they chose for Party political purposes to pretend that the money was not available for them and in so doing, to sabotage the housing programme and prevent the erection of houses for people who needed them so badly in this city.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government in the past month tried to take the same line.  The facts are there.  The figures are there.  I challenge the Minister to say that the answers which have been given in this House for the amounts that were expended for housing over the past five years were wrong.  They are not wrong.  They are <Col N="958" /> correct and they stand as a monument to the truth of what we were then saying and as a monument to the untruths to which certain people then gave violent and voluble expression.  Even yet they have not taken the trouble to sit down and master the figures or they would know that today they are still true.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman said that 1956-57 was not a disastrous year for housing and he gave statistics in an effort to show that more building took place that year than in the following years.  His colleagues and leader however, speaking earlier here tonight pointed out quite plainly that the building activity of a particular year depends entirely on the approach and planning of previous years.  He did that in order to show that certain activities which took place under Fianna Fáil administration were carried out, according to him, under Fine Gael planning.  I must go along to some extent with Deputy Dillon but I cannot go along with Deputy Sweetman. As a result of the mishandling of the entire housing programme by the then Coalition Government in 1956-57 the roller was sent down-hill at a tremendous rate without a driver.  Thank God, the present Minister for Local Government has not only stopped that downward plunge but has begun the task of pushing the roller back up the hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Briscoe, an individual, a leader of a minority group in the Dublin Corporation, took everybody including the Chairman of the housing <Col N="959" /> committee&mdash;who Deputy Sweetman said was Deputy Briscoe, which is untrue, because Deputy Denis Larkin has been Chairman of the Housing Committee for the last five years and was a member of the Government Party at that time&mdash;and everybody else who had anything to do with the Corporation, along by the nose while the Government were throwing out millions of pounds.  When I was speaking on the Vote on Account I said that I well remembered that, in spite of the guarantee given by the Taoiseach of the former Government, Dublin Corporation were unable to raise an overdraft from the Bank of Ireland to help them out of their difficulty.  I was strongly challenged on that.  I should like to avail of the opportunity to substantiate that point.  I think what I have to say now will indicate quite clearly the different policies and outlook on housing between the previous Government and the present one.</P>
    <P>We have had statistical information and quotations from Dáil debates.  On this occasion I would prefer to quote only from the records of the Dublin Corporation.  In a letter dated 11th June, 1956, to the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Alderman and members of the Dublin City Council, the City Manager wrote in the following terms&mdash;and if anybody wants to check this it is in Report No. 288 of the Minutes of the Municipal Council for the City of Dublin, 1956:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the 16th April, 1956, the City Council were informed of the receipt of a letter from An Taoiseach regarding the financing of the Corporation capital works, for 1956-57 which indicated that, if the Corporation were unable to raise the full £3 million required, the Government would make good the deficiency by advances from Public Funds.  The Corporation has negotiated a loan of £500,000 from the Irish Assurance Company Limited and the question of the acceptance of a further loan of £250,000 from another source is under consideration.</P>
    <P>In the light of An Taoiseach's letter, An Coiste Airgeadais authorised me to communicate with the Bank <Col N="960" /> of Ireland with a view to securing overdraft accommodation from the Bank for capital purposes, pending the availability of the money guaranteed by the Government.  The Bank, on 7th instant, stated that they were not in a position to assist the Corporation in financing its capital requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The letter was signed by John P. Keane.  I think this clearly substantiates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;up to the stage where money was actually paid and beyond it, if the Deputy will have a little patience.  At that time on the Dublin Corporation, only one-third of the representation was Fianna Fáil and two-thirds were generally opposed.  In spite of that the City Council had so little confidence in the Government's ability to produce the necessary finance that a letter was sent from the City Manager's Department, City Hall, dated 1st March, 1956, to the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Alderman and members of the Dublin City <Col N="961" /> Council&mdash;this is also from the Minutes of 1956&mdash;as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen,</P>
      <P>By direction of An Coiste Airgeadais, I submit hereunder the terms of a Resolution which was adopted by An Coiste at a meeting held on Monday 27th ultimo.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Resolution was as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That in future submissions of tenders for housing to the Minister for Local Government, the Minister be notified that the Council assumes that, in the case of any tender, the acceptance of which is formally approved by him, such approval shall also imply the necessary finances shall be made available to the Corporation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The terms of the letter were noted by the City Council.  On the 12th April the Corporation received a letter from the Bank of Ireland from Mr. W.J. Tartleton, Agent, in the following terms:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have to refer to your letter of the 5th instant and the meeting which took place on Monday afternoon between the Lord Mayor and other representatives of the Corporation and the Governor and some members of my Board to discuss the present serious situation which has arisen.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It will be recalled that, at the conclusion of the meeting, the Governor of the Bank stated that he would, of course, re-submit the matter to the Board, but he felt that the result of their further consideration could not lend to any variation in the decision previously reached and conveyed to you in my letter of 29th ultimo.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have to confirm that my Board had the matter before them again today and have instructed me to say that they have, with regret, endorsed the views expressed by the Governor last Monday.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We were still holding the Government's guarantee.  Prior to that, the Government had passed a resolution&mdash; the reference is page 119 of the same Minutes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon.  The Corporation had passed a resolution.  It was shortly prior to the second advance of the bank.  It was a sort of last hope of keeping building going in Dublin, but at that stage the Corporation could not plan.  There was a desperate financial situation, and even the Bank of Ireland agreed it was serious.</P>

      <P>That should the reply from the Bank of Ireland prove unfavourable, The Right Hon. Lord Mayor, The Chairman of An Coiste Airgeadas and the Vice-Chairman of An Coiste Teaghlachais, accompanied by the City Manager and Housing Director, should seek an interview with An Taoiseach and report to a special meeting of the Council to be held as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, having been written to, replied to the effect that, if the Corporation were not able to raise the amount of money they required for housing under the Working Classes Acts, the Government would come to their aid and make good the deficiency by advances from public funds, as a result of which the following Resolution was passed by the Council:</P>
      <P>That the Council expresses its appreciation of and satisfaction with the undertaking by An Taoiseach, as given in his letter dated 16th April, 1956, to the Lord Mayor.</P>
      <P>In fact, I myself, seconded that motion but unfortunately that was not the end of the story.  Later on there were proposals to erect 248 dwellings at Coolock, Raheny, and 40 dwellings at Coolock Raheny, which were submitted to the Minister for Local Government for his sanction on 8th March, 1956&mdash;</P>

      <P>The proposals were submitted in March with the terms of the City Council Resolution regarding the financing of such contracts, asking the Minister to indicate that the necessary finances would be made available to the Corporation to complete these works.</P>
      <P>On 10th May, 1956, the Department of Local Government sent a letter stating they would raise no objection to accepting the tender for the 248 dwellings. There was no reference in that letter to the financing of the scheme. In another letter of the same date, the Minister also said he would raise no objection to the proposed acceptance of the tender for the erection of the 40 dwellings.  In that case the letter contained the following sentence:</P>
      <P>With regard to the financing of the scheme, I am to add that, on receipt of the Corporation's proposals for borrowing the necessary Capital, the Minister will sanction such borrowing.</P>
      <P>As a result of that, the appropriate Committee passed the following resolution:</P>

      <P>The Irish Permanent Building Society went the closest to co-operating with the Government.  They wrote:</P>
      <P>With reference to your letter of the 29th November, the Society is operating the Guarantee Scheme. The interest rate is 7 per cent. per annum.</P>
      <P>We have, however, suspended the taking of new applications until after the 1st February, 1957.</P>

      <P>I do not know for certain how far the Minister's function goes in this matter.  I shall bow to the ruling of the Chair on the points I wish to raise.  The Government's intention <Col N="969" /> and policy have been made quite clear, particularly with regard to increased employment through the various schemes administered by the local authority.  If it appears that for some reason or other the local authority are not carrying out the Government's intention, can the Minister take action to ensure that the intention is fulfilled?</P>
      <P>I came across a very difficult case a short while ago.  I am prepared to give the name, the site number and the address to the Minister.  An applicant for a loan, a Government grant and a supplementary grant actually received the Government grant and was approved for the local authority loan. The certificate was issued for the supplementary grant and it was on the list for payment.  I believe it was actually signed.  However, two days prior to the list being paid out, the unfortunate applicant contracted tuberculosis and was taken to Blanchardstown. His wife immediately got in touch with the Corporation and said that in view of reduced financial circumstances, she could not go ahead with the purchase of the house.  The Corporation stopped the payment of the supplementary grant.</P>
      <P>When the builder offered to get a new purchaser for the house, they said, in effect: &ldquo;We cannot give you a supplementary grant in this instance because it is not a new house.&rdquo;  The builder is rather concerned.  As far as I know, he is a decent man.  Apparently, his only way of getting back the £137 10s. is to sue the unfortunate lady whose husband is in hospital with tuberculosis and possibly take the furniture out of her house.  I am quite sure that when these supplementary grants were introduced, it was not the intention of the Government that this type of thing should take place.  A few such matters are causing me some concern.</P>
      <P>The minimum income for a loan at the moment as laid down by the Dublin Corporation is £546 and the maximum is £836.  The maximum income for a supplementary grant is £640.  People earning between £546 and £640 can get a supplementary grant.  The range has got so small that most people are outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> Unfortunately under Sections 10 and 11 of the Act that deals with supplementary grants, the local authority in Dublin insists that the first application for the grant must be made under Section 10.  Even though the applicant knows he is not eligible under Section 10, he must wait maybe two or three months for a decision.  Then he applies under Section 11, the section under which he probably would have got the grant the first time.  Perhaps applications for these grants could be streamlined so that they could be made under the two sections at the same time?</P>
    <P>The Government's intention has been made quite clear in relation to repair and improvement grants.  It is the intention to try to preserve properties from deteriorating into slum property, necessitating possibly Corporation purchase, demolition and re-building.  I find that in the years 1957/58, 1958/59 and 1959/60 the numbers of applications for these grants were&mdash;this is in reply to a question of mine at a meeting of the City Council on 13th June, 1960&mdash;1,135 in 1957/58; 1,462 in 1958/59 and 1,542 in 1959/60. It is good to see increased activity, increased interest and increased applications in this matter.</P>
    <P>The number eligible for State repair and improvement grants were 975, 977 and 1,052, whereas the numbers eligible for the local authority grant were only 175, 118 and 169.  This is what is generally termed permissive legislation but it is deplorable that only 15 per cent. of those who qualify for State repair and improvement grants qualify for the other one-third from the local authority.  Perhaps the Minister might look at that to see if the local authority could be persuaded to take a more generous view.</P>
    <P>Applications for loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts fell from 1,196 to 335 in 1956/57.  After that disastrous plunge&mdash;the year is significant, 1956/57&mdash;they went up to 621, 608 and 730.  There is a tremendously increased activity in the purchase of houses under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty in so far as <Col N="971" /> the scheme now works: it is in the stages that each application has to go through. There is an examination of the applicant's eligibility to obtain a loan within the terms of the scheme; an examination of plans in relation to the general control of building; determination of the valuation on which the loan will be based; an examination of title and generally of the security on which the mortage will be based and and a technical examination of the completed house or the partially completed house on which an interim payment is based.</P>
    <P>Each of these foregoing stages require certification by respective responsible officers before the authorisation for payment is submitted to and authorised by the manager.  Each of the five items require separate inspection. They all go through separately and the application goes from the small dwellings section to the appropriate inspector and back again and then to the next appropriate inspector, with a a loss of weeks all the time.  Where there was a delay before this special section was set up of perhaps three months before getting a loan approved under the S.D.A. Act, now, with the special section the approval often takes six or seven months.  I do not think the Government can be blamed for this.</P>
    <P>I have got the average figures and I can give an average figure in each case because I have checked back for a full year.  For the present financial year the average amount outstanding to purchasers&mdash;the builder does not come into it; it is the person who is buying the house&mdash;at the first of each month in Dublin is in the region of £70,000. This, to my mind, makes it very difficult for the smaller builder to proceed, and I think the Minister should get each local authority to hurry things up a bit, especially in view of the fact that cost of administration has risen since 1955-56 in this small dwellings department from £16,376 to £20,514. Regardless of what the Government's intention might be, or what legislation they introduce to ensure that intention is carried out, without the co-operation of the local authority nothing can be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" /> Another problem has arisen in connection with corporation shop tenants. On the 2nd September, 1958, the Minister wrote to me to say that he had received my letter and that the local authority had power under Section 11 (1) (d) of the Act to sell or lease a house or land acquired by the authority. It was assumed that the house included a residential shop.  Unfortunately, the advice from the local authority is that they feel they must by some means or other ensure that these shops will always be utilised as shops. Eventually, outside legal opinion was obtained on this matter and it has been shown that a covenant can be included in the lease to ensure that the shop will be maintained as a shop and that, in this way, the corporation will have full power to sell the shops.</P>
    <P>The difficulty, however, is that they must sell by public tender and the law agent advises that if they are to sell these premises by public tender it would be necessary to get vacant possession. That is rather unfortunate because when these people enter into a contract with the local authority they are shown a plan and told of the density of population in the area.  They are told: &ldquo;You will have 60 households to your shop,&rdquo; buying exclusively cigarettes or whatever commodity the shop is confined to.  Unfortunately, private developers enter into it, particularly round the border between Dublin city and the county and have built a great number of shops.  Because these additional shops have been built, the rents tendered have proved entirely uneconomic.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to know how this situation can be dealt with properly. Whereas previously where shops were put up for tender the rents, I think, varied mainly between £12 and £16 a week, when the same shops become vacant and are put up for tender to-day, they fetch from £6 to £12; it is very seldom they reach £12 at all.  Before the principle of tender was adopted allocations were made entirely on the basis of an economic rent and we have tenants in corporation shops at rents of £5 a week.</P>
    <P>I think something should be done for people who are adversely affected <Col N="973" /> because many of them are working very hard and are not getting a fair return for their investment.</P>
    <P>Up to recently it was possible to buy a particular registration number for a motor car and, without destroying an old vehicle, to transfer a registration number from one car to another. Apparently, it has now transpired that if this had been done&mdash;and I can assure the House it had &mdash;it was done in the wrong and it cannot be done in the future. In England, I understand that if anybody wants a particular number or wants to transfer a number, he can get it done on payment of £25.  I suggest that a number of motor firms would be very glad to pay £25, £50 or even £100 to get a particular registration number for advertising purposes.</P>

      <P>A committee has been set up to look into the administration of the electoral laws.  I should be delighted if we could be sure that this committee will satisfactorily define what, in fact a civil servant is.  To follow some definitions possibly we are all now civil servants and perhaps not entitled to sit in this House at all.  It is very difficult to determine exactly what is a civil servant.  In the Book of Estimates this year all general service grades from cleaners to secretaries, pages IX and X would appear to be civil servants; all State employees recruited through the Civil Service Commission are also civil servants not to mention all State employees serving in an established capacity, all superannuated employees in the public service, all State employees remunerated directly from public funds provided their remuneration exceeds a certain figure.  They are, in fact, all State employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As reported in the Dáil Debates of June 3rd, 1959, I remember the Taoiseach making reference to State enterprise to the effect that it must be expanded.  If an increase is to take <Col N="974" /> place in State enterprise it is likely that the number of unestablished State employees will be greatly increased. Many of these people would be very suitable candidates for this House or the Upper House.  This would deny many of them&mdash;unless we got a clear and true definition of this problem&mdash;the opportunity of representing their trades and professions in either House.  I shall be pleased if the Minister will have a look at this problem in particular because it seems peculiar at times where a man has a right to strike that, as far as the electoral law is concerned, he is still a civil servant.</P>
    <P>I hope that the possibility of introducing facilities for commercial travellers to vote will be examined. The fact that most elections are held mid-week disfranchises a large number of commercial travellers who leave home each Monday, not to return until Friday.  There are between 5,000 and 6,000 electors involved.  These people will be unable to participate in elections unless some arrangements are made for them.  I respectfully draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this is a grave injustice to a large section of the community and that some arrangement ought to be made to enable commercial travellers to vote by post, at local polling booths or at Civic Guard barracks in the districts in which they are working.  I understand that such facilities are granted to commercial travellers in England.</P>

I am glad that the question of providing facilities for members of the Garda Síochána to vote is being examined and that we can look forward to legislation later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal more that I should like to say but I feel I have held the House sufficiently long.  I should like to associate myself with the remarks of Deputies on both sides of the House to the effect that it is a <Col N="975" /> tremendous pity that when there is so much criticism from time to time of local authorities, so few people see fit to come out and exercise the franchise. In many places the number who voted was less than one in five.  I suppose many of the non-voters will be urging their tenants' associations and residents' associations to get on to the newly elected councillors in respect to all sorts of problems and things they want done.  At times one wonders if they deserve to get the great attention they do get from all the elected members of the local authorities, regardless of political Party.  I should like to associate myself with the remarks that it is a tremendous pity that more people did not exercise the franchise, particularly in the local elections.</P>

      <P>The first part of Deputy Lemass's statement brings me to compliment the Fianna Fáil Party on their propaganda machine. Amongst their tactics, we find one based on the belief that if you repeat a lie often enough it will become the truth.  In fact, they will believe it themselves, they are so brain-washed. When they see it in big print in the <i>Irish Press</i>, they think it is gospel.</P>

      <P>We had to put up with a lot of that sort of thing on the question of housing.  I must express disappointment with the number of houses built in my area especially in view of the fact that there is a shortage of houses and a long list of applicants. The Minister sent down his officer to examine and to see whom he could delete from the housing list passed by the local council.  I know the tactics to hold up housing at the moment.  I know what happened during the term of office of the inter-Party Government in regard to housing in my area. Hundreds of houses were built, the finest scheme ever erected, which will not be surpassed.  It is about time that the sort of thing we have listened to for years ceased.</P>
      <P>I wish now to deal with the question of the noise created by motor-cyclists. Something should be done to prevent it.  Some motor-cyclists seem to get great satisfaction out of the fact that they can make more noise than other users of the road.  The nuisance thus created is a cause of comment by the public.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has power to insist on helmets being worn by motor-cyclists.  Over the past few years, a number of deaths have been caused by fracture of the skull sustained in motor-cycling accidents.  The wearing of helmets would be a protection and I suggest to the Minister that it should be the law and that the law should be enforced.</P>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with Deputy Lynch on the subject of the low poll.  That was due in large measure to the fact that people expected to get the usual reminders giving their number and the place where they were to vote.  When they did not get them, they thought they had no vote. That does not apply in the case of local elections but it would be a help if cards were issued to electors giving the number of the elector and the place where he is to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come across hundreds of cases where persons' names were deleted from the voting list since the last election.  Whoever is responsible for such deletions should be brought to book.  It happens too often.  The lists <Col N="977" /> are displayed in the local post offices but it is not everybody who can get time to read them.  People do not expect that their names will be deleted.  In some cases the names of people who have been voting since the Sinn Féin days have been deleted.  It should be possible to publish a list of the names it is proposed to delete from the register and the persons concerned should be notified.</P>
    <P>Another reason why names do not appear on the register is that tenants of corporation houses are unwilling to give the names of persons who may be lodging with them because such disclosure might mean an increase in rent. It should be made clear to such people that the information is not given to the local authority for the purpose of increasing rents.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider extending the time allowed for voting when elections take place in the summer period.  It is very hard to expect country people to come in at nine in the evening.  They may be trying to save hay or draw turf.  The Minister should consider that in the summer the hours should be from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and in the winter from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.</P>
    <P>When a voter enters the booth before the closing time, he should be allowed to cast his vote whether there is a queue before him or not.  We have known cases where people were refused the right to vote the moment the clock struck.  Furthermore, where a queue is waiting, an illiterate voter should not be allowed to hold up that queue and deprive them of their right to vote.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the fact that people are not prepared to give the names of lodgers in case their rents are increased.  That prompts me to raise this burning question of differential rents.  It is time the Government considers devoting the moneys from the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes towards the funding of loans to bring rents within the reach of the people.  High rents along with the high cost of living are leading to malnutrition.  It is not very easy to rear families, especially when people's homes are situated outside the city and they have to pay bus fares <Col N="978" /> they did not have to pay heretofore and increased rents.</P>
    <P>Another practice which is most unfair is that immediately a man secures employment after a long bout of unemployment, his rent is increased under this differential rent scheme.  This man may be working on the book, as it were, and as soon as he gets an increase in his income, he is told to pay up or get out.  It is a most unchristian attitude.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to empower local authorities to build concert halls but I hope that will be extended to areas other than the county boroughs. I am not sure what is meant.  Is this to be confined to cities like Dublin, Cork and a few other places?  I think it should be extended.  Furthermore, is it the intention of the Minister to give a substantial grant?  The Minister should give some assistance rather than that the whole amount should come direct from the rates.</P>
    <P>On this question of halls, I should like to see social centres being created on housing estates.  If people go to any entertainment in town the last bus has gone by the time the entertainment is over.  The Department should cooperate with the local authority and give a grant for the building of civic centres in these housing estates.  That would go a long way towards creating a better civic spirit.</P>
    <P>Although this is probably a matter for the Department of Education, I suggest the Minister should give his support to the giving of lectures to school children on keeping the streets clean.  A lot of sweet papers can be seen floating around cities and a better civic spirit should be instilled into these children by means of a lecture now and again.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to let us know whether he has thrown the Local Authorities (Works) Act completely overboard?  Is it because it was brought in by the inter-Party Government that it must go?  Useful work has been done under this Act and the Minister should consider reimplementing it for the benefit of the people.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal of talk about roads but it is about time more paths were constructed leading from <Col N="979" /> the city areas into the country areas, say, within a radius of five or six miles. The Minister should devote some attention to that question and help to save the lives of pedestrians who have to use these roads.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I heard the Minister, who was then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, saying that television was a &ldquo;must&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall indicate in what respect I want to raise the question. If the Minister is so much concerned with introducing television, he should see that the chimneys of houses are capable of carrying these television masts.  A lot of damage is done to the roofs of houses because during storms many of these masts crash down, causing great destruction.</P>
      <P>Another desirable development I wish to see is the standardisation of road signs.  In some parts of the country there are signs which say: &ldquo;Drive Slow&rdquo;, &ldquo;Danger&rdquo; and so on, on a type of road that would be considered an autobahn in other parts of the country.  There should be some standardisation so that when visitors come to this country the signs will mean the same thing everywhere.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is a forest of poles denoting &ldquo;No Parking&rdquo;, &ldquo;Turn Left&rdquo;, &ldquo;Turn Right&rdquo;, and all the rest, side by side with E.S.B. poles and telegraph poles.  There should be a little more co-operation between the E.S.B. and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs so that, where suitable, some of these signs could be erected on these poles.  That would reduce expenditure and do away with a great deal of the obstruction which these signs often cause.</P>
      <P>Having mentioned the question of people voting, I should like to mention now the question of people who are not prepared to vote.  The Minister should take steps to introduce legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably one of the most serious matters this House has been asked to consider for some time. It concerns the total failure on the part of the Department of External Affairs to come to the assistance of some Irish citizens abroad who found themselves, through no fault of their own, in dire circumstances, without either any means of support or any means of getting back to their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It concerns, too, the failure of the Department of External Affairs to observe the recognised practice in relation to the treatment of seamen out of their own country.  It shows a callousness and an indifference on the part of the Irish Embassy in Bonn which is a sorry reflection on this country, a great discredit to the country and to our Department of External Affairs.  Indeed it is something of which we ought to be ashamed.  We ought to be ashamed that another country had to come to the assistance of Irish citizens because of the complete disregard by the Department of External Affairs of its plain Christian duty to come to the assistance of Irishmen abroad who find themselves stranded.  These Irishmen, some 42 in number, were enticed&mdash; perhaps &ldquo;shanghaied&rdquo; would be a more <Col N="981" /> appropriate description&mdash;to Germany with a promise of certain contracts, which were subsequently not fulfilled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I wish to point out that the circumstances which occasioned these Irishmen being in Bremen were brought to the notice of the Irish Embassy in Bonn.  The case is, therefore, not that which was referred to today by the Government Information Bureau, and reported in this evening's paper, that persons who voluntarily leave employment abroad are not usually repatriated at the taxpayers' expense.  The persons to whom I am referring are not persons who voluntarily left employment. I gather the Embassy in Bonn was so informed.  The Embassy was informed that these persons had been offered employment which did not materialise; they were unemployed Irishmen who had left their country to seek employment abroad in order to provide for themselves, their wives and families.  Because they were unemployed they had not the means whereby to get themselves home again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand these men gave an undertaking to the Department of External Affairs that they would repay any expenses the Department would incur in sending them home. On that undertaking, the Embassy in Bonn should have decided to send these men home.  With some degree of mortification, I must inform the House that one of these Irishmen preferred to travel on a British passport.  His preference was governed by his fear of what might happen should he find himself stranded, in dire circumstances, with an Irish passport.  He, with two colleagues, reported to the British Consul in Bremen.  He gave an undertaking to repay the cost of being sent home and, without more ado, he <Col N="982" /> was despatched on his journey, with a ticket to Dublin; as well as that, he was supplied with pocket money.</P>
    <P>My information is that the British Consul in Bremen, although under no obligation to do so, phoned the Irish Embassy in Bonn, some 600 miles away, to inform the Irish Embassy of the circumstances of the two Irishmen who had called upon him, one of whom carried an Irish passport and the other a Seaman's Book, which ranks as an international passport for seamen.  This man was a qualified able-bodied seaman and, as such, under international practice he should have been repatriated by his own Government to his home port.</P>
    <P>I am informed that this information was conveyed to the Irish Embassy in Bonn on Wednesday 22nd June&mdash; possibly earlier&mdash;and the reply from the Irish Embassy was that they would phone the British Consul in Bremen on the following day.  No phone call came.  The British Consul again phoned the Embassy in Bonn.  The message was that they were not in a position to give any instructions, but they would phone the following day. Again, it was a promise unfulfilled. No message was received on the following day, or the day after that. On Saturday another promise was made that instructions would be conveyed on the following Monday.  No message came on Monday.  On each occasion the British Consul had to telephone the Irish Embassy.</P>
    <P>Ultimately these men, who had been waiting for days at the British Consul's office in Bremen, found that the only Christian treatment available to them was that of the diplomatic representative of a foreign Power.  They had to rely entirely on the goodwill of this man, this representative of a foreign Power.  At three o'clock on Monday afternoon the British Consul had again to take the telephone in his hand and call up the Irish Embassy in Bonn. He then issued an ultimatum; he informed the Embasy that if a message had not come by half past three he would pay for the tickets to send these Irishmen back home to Ireland, at the expense of the British Government.</P>
    <P>Half an hour later came the wonderful message, carrying cheer and encouragement <Col N="983" /> to these stranded men; the official who would normally deal with the matter in the Irish Embassy had gone on holidays and there was nobody there who could give any advice.  Now, we all wish the official a pleasant holiday; I am not criticising the particular individual for taking his annual leave.  What I am criticising is the attitude of the Department of External Affairs which failed, first of all, to act in an emergency in the way it should have acted and, secondly, failed in the established international practice of repatriating seamen who find themselves stranded in a foreign country.</P>
    <P>I am also criticising the Department for failing to make the necessary arrangements, when a particular official was absent, for his duties to be carried out by somebody else.  The manner in which these Irishmen were left stranded, with no means of support in a foreign city in which they could find very few people able to speak their own language, shows a shocking disregard of clear Christian principles, and were it not for the diplomatic representatives of another Power, they might well have found themselves in the prisons of that city. Instead of that fate, through the kindness of another Power, they found themselves invited into a seaman's institute and there supported by the foreign Power, and provided with pocket money and other assistance.</P>
    <P>Apart from these individuals who have come under the direct notice of the Department of External Affairs, reports have appeared in our newspapers since last Saturday pointing out that there are possibly many others out of this group of 42 who find themselves in difficult circumstances, and I wonder if the Department has taken any steps to ascertain the whereabouts of these Irishmen, to ascertain whether or not they are being looked after, and to ascertain if any of them are seeking to get home?</P>
    <P>A very large body of men is involved. Some of them, I understand, are juveniles who have not reached the age of 21 years and they are obviously <Col N="984" /> people who went abroad with the good intention of seeking employment in accordance with what they were promised here.  It is quite obvious, from the case of the three individuals whose circumstances have been brought to the notice of the Irish Embassy in Bonn, that the members of this party have met with very serious difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of very great urgency where there are young Irishmen, practically confined, I understand, in an internment camp, in a lice-infested hostel, in which they are being poorly fed and in which they have not <Col N="985" /> got proper bedding.  I am sure this information was conveyed by the British Consul when he informed the Irish Embassy of the circumstances of the three men he dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy I would allow him to raise this in respect of the party who were brought to the notice of the Embassy, and nothing beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir, but I should like to think that our diplomatic corps abroad would investigate what might be even a rumour concerning the circumstances of any Irish citizen abroad.  I think it is pretty well recognised that an Irish Embassy abroad is a piece of Irish national territory abroad.  The Irish Embassy in Bonn is a piece of our national territory in Germany.  Any Embassy is a piece of the homeland and those who serve in it, apart from the diplomatic functions they engage in, have also the very important duty of looking after Irish citizens in those countries.</P>
      <P>It is no excuse to say that the circumstances of these young Irishmen constituted an emergency which could not be dealt with speedily.  That is precisely what consuls and ambassadors are there to do&mdash;to attend to emergencies and that speedily. Every day on which these Irishmen were left there without guidance, or assurance of help, was a day of constant worry and anxiety for them.  It was also a day of constant worry and anxiety for their relatives and friends at home.  It is also common knowledge in respect of one of the men who returned that when he got home he discovered his wife had received a postcard saying all was well, purporting to have been written by him when, in fact it was not written by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole atmosphere of this appalling affair is such as ought to send the officials of the Irish Embassy in Bonn scurrying around Germany to find where these helpless Irishmen are, but, instead of doing that, which I admit might be considered a major operation on their part, they sat down on the job when they were told of two specific Irishmen who were calling day after day at the British Consulate in <Col N="986" /> Bremen, sitting down day after day in the offices of the British Consulate in Bremen, waiting for hours on end for a phone call from the Irish Embassy which never came.</P>
    <P>It displays a shocking degree of callousness, or else, hopeless inefficiency, if it is the case that the officials in our Embassy in Bonn waited to communicate with the officials in Dublin, and it shows a disgraceful lack of concern on the part of the Department in Dublin if it did not straightaway forward instructions to Bonn to send these Irishmen home without any further delay.  In fact, in a case of this nature, it should not be necessary to convey messages from any Embassy back home.  The number of times on which this kind of thing is likely to arise are few and far between.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about the position of the seaman who had a seaman's book.  There ought to have been no question of having to await instructions concerning what should be done about that one man.  He should have been sent home without delay.  The only excuse that could be made is in relation to the man who held a passport and not a book, but the circumstances there had been explained by the British Consul in Bremen.  They were precisely the same as those relating to the other Irishman travelling on a British passport who was sent home within hours of calling on the British Consul, and it was only because the British Consul moved in this matter that the other two men were sent home.</P>
    <P>I wonder have there been any instructions issued since that date to the Embassy in Bonn to send these other men home?  These emergencies are likely to arise from time to time and this case was not, as the Government Information Bureau stated to-day, a case of Irishmen leaving employment abroad and getting stranded.  There will always be cases of people being stranded and it should not take the best part of a week to solve their problems.  There is no excuse whatever for the Embassy in Bonn promising the diplomatic representative of another country to ring him one day after another, and yet not having the <Col N="987" /> common courtesy to say he was awaiting instructions from Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) (for the Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must totally reject the statement made by the Deputy.  There is no information at our disposal that the hostel was lice-infested. I think I should make that clear.  I might also add that the Department of External Affairs has the highest reputation for its conduct in dealing with persons in distress.  The Deputy must be credulous to the point of irresponsibility to have related the alleged facts he has put forward in the House to-night.  These are the facts. In May, 1960, the German firm, Wegesacker Fischerei, engaged 15 Irishmen to work on board the firm's fishing boats operating from Bremen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, I was not allowed discuss the civil contract between the German firm and the Irishmen and, with respect, I think the Minister should not be allowed to do so either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was allowed to go on a good distance to make his case and I must allow the Minister equal latitude in replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy just wants to continue to be offensive.  On the 30th May one of this group, a seaman who had decided not to sail, applied to the Embassy at Bonn for assistance and was repatriated on the 31st May.  The remainder of the group sailed later.  On the 29th June three of these applied to the Embassy at Bonn for assistance and were repatriated. The remaining seven have not applied to the Embassy.  Five are known to have re-engaged with the German firm.  It is understood that one was in the German firm's hostel in Bremen with a broken arm.  The Embassy informed him that he would be repatriated if he so wished.  He has left the hostel since and has not asked for repatriation facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further group of 47 Irishmen and <Col N="988" /> one British seaman were engaged in Dublin by Wegesacker Fischerei in June.  On the 23rd June two applied, with the British seaman, to the British Consul at Bremen for repatriation.  On the same day the German firm telephoned the Embassy to say that a number of the 48 men recruited wished to return home.  It was expected, however, that 22 of these would work in the German boats.  It was not clear whether all the men who wished to be repatriated could be classified as seamen within the meaning of the Merchant Shipping Act as in some cases they had never been to sea.  The Embassy at Bonn, however, was instructed to repatriate any seamen in the group, seamen being interpreted as any man who held a seaman's book or who had ever been to sea before.</P>
    <P>In addition, it was decided to repatriate any minors involved whether or not they could be classified as seamen.  In cases where the names of the minors were known the parents were visited by Gardaí.  Some advanced the cost of repatriation; others guaranteed to repay the cost later.  In one case the guarantee to repay could not be obtained.  In all, 11 of this group have been repatriated by the Embassy.  This figure includes nine minors and the two men who applied to the British Consul, one a holder of a seaman's book and the other, who, in the absence of a decision by the Department of Transport and Power, cannot be classified as a seaman.  The British Consul, acting on the instructions of the Embassy at Bonn, made the necessary arrangements. The latest news just received from the Embassy indicates that all the remainder of this group of 36 men are at sea working for the German firm.</P>
    <P>At no time were any of the men involved without food or shelter as they were accommodated either in a hostel belonging to the German firm or, in the case of those who applied to the British Consul, they were accommodated in the seamen's hostel at the Department's expense.  I should make it clear that the Department of Transport and Power, my Department, repatriates those who are working as seamen or are in distress.  The Department of External Affairs has no funds <Col N="989" /> at its disposal to repatriate from the Continent those who voluntarily leave their work, but in certain cases they take exceptional action on the merits, such as in the case of minors.  In such cases an effort is made to recoup the cost from the parents where this is possible.  The number assisted in this way in any one year is absolutely negligible.  Some delays are inevitable because the Department must, through its representatives abroad, make the necessary investigations.  I should also make it clear that the men who refused to work on the fishing vessels were offered alternative employment in the German firm's undertaking on land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for the Department of External Affairs to supervise contracts made by workers abroad.  It is their own responsibility to decide what their contracts are.  If, however, they get into distress the Department does what it can in the circumstances, but in the ordinary way the Department does not repatriate those who voluntarily leave their work. That is the position.  I should add that, although I have no personal knowledge of the detailed circumstances attending these men's work, for the Deputy to talk of conditions in Bremen as though they resembled those somewhere back in the early part of the 19th century is just ridiculous and I do not believe a word of what I have heard in relation to that subject.</P>
